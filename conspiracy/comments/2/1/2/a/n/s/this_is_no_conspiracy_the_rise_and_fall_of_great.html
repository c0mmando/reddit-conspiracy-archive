      <p>
       Most studies of a society's collapse have looked at the specifics of how one civilization declined, citing individual causes such as a disaster (earthquake, flood), loss of resources (soil erosion, deforestation) or human conflict (war, uprising) that led to the particular society's downfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the researchers (funded in part by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, College Park) cast a wider net. They aimed to create a useful mathematical model that could help analyze how any society might fall — including our current global, technically advanced, interconnected society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The balance of nature
      </p>
      <p>
       The model they arrived at takes inspiration from the classic notion of predator vs. prey, sometimes referred to as the "balance of nature." When a deer population grows, for instance, the wolves that feed on those deer reproduce more successfully, too, and so the wolf population grows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is fine until the wolves become too numerous and overreach, eating so many deer that there isn't enough venison to go around. Then, as the number of deer plunges, the wolf population drops due to famine, until equilibrium is reestablished and the cycle begins anew. [Civilization Doomed by Overconsumption, Wealth, Inequality
      </p>
      <p>
       Informed by this paradigm, the researchers developed a relatively simple formula with four factors influencing social collapse: nature and natural resources, the accumulation of wealth, the elite and the commoners. The team calls their model Human And Nature Dynamics, or HANDY.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A HANDY tool
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The researchers used the HANDY model to analyze three different social scenarios: an egalitarian society with no elite class; an equitable society with workers and non-workers (students, retirees, disabled persons); and an unequal society with a robust class of elites.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The egalitarian and equitable societies
         <em>
          could produce a sustainable civilization and avoid collapse, even with a high ratio of non-workers.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Social collapse was more likely after people overreached and depleted natural resources. Importantly, even without any social stratification, collapse could occur if a society exhausted its natural resources
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         In the unequal society, however, collapse was almost unavoidable — and these were the HANDY scenarios that mirrored our current globalized society
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The income gap
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "The scenarios most closely reflecting the reality of our world today are found in the third group of experiments, where we introduced economic stratification," the researchers wrote, referring to uneven wealth distribution. "Under such conditions, we find that collapse is difficult to avoid."
      </p>
      <p>
       Other recent research backs up the authors' claims: A 2012 study from the journal American Sociological Review shows that the income share of the top 1 percent of Americans grew rapidly after 1980 — from 10 percent in 1981 to 23.5 percent in 2007, an increase of 135 percentage points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the bottom three-quarters of the U.S. population has seen slow economic growth, with predictable results: A 2011 study published in the journal Psychological Science found that happiness, trust in others and life satisfaction plummet when income inequality is high.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Technology won't save you
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who believe that there must be a technological fix to all this despair and destruction, the researchers found that the historical record provides "testimony to the fact that advanced, sophisticated, complex and creative civilizations can be both fragile and impermanent.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It may be reasonable to believe that modern civilization, armed with its greater technological capacity, scientific knowledge and energy resources, will be able to survive and endure whatever crises historical societies succumbed to," the authors wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the brief overview of collapses demonstrates not only the ubiquity of the phenomenon, but also the extent to which advanced, complex and powerful societies are susceptible to collapse."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all is lost, however: Societies can moderate the two factors that contribute most to social meltdown: the exploitation of natural resources and the uneven distribution of wealth, the researchers said.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Collapse can be avoided and population can reach equilibrium if the per-capita rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level, and if resources are distributed in a reasonably equitable fashion"

       I agree with everything you wrote up till the TL:DR "We're all fucked". We are NOT all fucked. It's a matter of choice and aligning our choices with our lifestyle. If you were born to survive and thrive you will make choices to create a new paradigm. The old paradigm is dying. That is no more than waking up from the matrix. You have freedom and the power of choice. Examples- study permaculture, study your great grandparents and how they lived, quit your 9-5, homestead, live a simple life, become self employed doing what you love, create biodiversity in your community/on your land, barter, start a garden and learn to save seeds, create community of like minded individuals, host potlucks with friends to brainstorm solutions, upcycle everything you can ( trash will be treasure soon), relax and do what makes you happy. Like attracts like. Mother Nature is balance. No matter what she chooses, it's to balance. I believe we can balance ourselves and create a positive relationship to nature. If we choose to know/respect/steward/honor nature we surely will know how to survive.

       hey matey, thank you for the thoughtful reply ... and I agree with you ... but we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       at the 'end' of this cycle of "global mis-management" and we
       <em>
        will be fucked
       </em>
       , in the next 20yrs at most!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I hear,
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       Obamba like politician begin to say words like "economic growth" and "fiscal restraint" in
       <em>
        the same sentence
       </em>
       and that "they'll (somehow) "create
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       jobs" (out of what?)  They can't just print them like US dollars!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I hear people applaud that shit, I die a little as I see even more clearly how fucking 'ignorant' and simply
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       the people who are clapping and cheering
       <em>
        are!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And how easily they'll be 'led to the
       <del>
        slaughter
       </del>
       train station' ... believing they're being 'temporarily relocated due to a health/terror/
       <em>
        natural disaster
       </em>
       ,, threat' or some such shit!

      <p>
       i kinda just tossed that comment in becoz, I believe we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       already well on the way! (and to see if anyone actually read it! ... so cheers matey for suffering my disgruntled ramblings on this topic)
      </p>
      <p>
       For, as you say
       <em>
        "Mother Nature is balance. No matter what she chooses, it's to balance. I believe we can balance ourselves and create a positive relationship to nature."
       </em>
       ..... which
       <strong>
        we have failed to do
       </strong>
       , and the 'changes' needed will not be forthcoming from the Elite, that's for sure! They still believe they'll be able to live 'happily' in their underground cities  (that you have
       <em>
        heard
       </em>
       about ... but not 'officially')
      </p>
      <p>
       And for another thing, I live in a 'wealthy' country where over 85% of us rely on others to 'grow the food' ... and hungry people riot!  By the time they realize the 'food is running out'
       <em>
        it will be waaay too late
       </em>
       for those not already 'prepped' ... and you can bet that 98% of those 'preppers' will be the
       <em>
        first to be raided' .... within a few months *most
       </em>
       people will have succumbed to starvation, disease and anger!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thousands of people are starving right now, in places like The Balkans, but have you heard about that on 'the news?' No.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A popular saying is that “every nation is about three/six/seven/nine meals away from anarchy/revolution.” That is, hungry people are desperate people who will topple any government. ** “It is well for us to recollect that even in our own law-abiding, not to say virtuous cases, the only barrier between us and anarchy is the last nine meals we’ve had”** was cited in print in 1896.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy” was said by writer Alfred Henry Lewis (1855-1914) in a March 1906 issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine. “It’s only nine meals between men and revolution” was cited in print in 1943.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this still holds true today.   How can countries like the US justify their 'defense spending' of trillions of dollars, when there are people dying in their millions from starvation every year?
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't .... and the 'sheeple' are so well trained, that so long as it's all NIMBY ... then "who gives a fuck"  (besides the likes of you and me ... I have read enough reddit comment's about "how it'll never happen to
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       " that it makes me sick!
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERY obese/overweight person in a first world country
       <em>
        should be ashamed
       </em>
       of themselves ... and the country which 'supports' such lifestyles and behaviours
      </p>
      <p>
       Selfish people are a cancer amongst humanity, and 'nature'
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       destroy them, and everyone who subscribes to their selfish ways!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no saint, but I also haven't sold my soul to 'fit in, just to get a job and a house in a nice place, get a new car and a partner with a pretty face etc"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm going to go down with that ship becoz there are too many who do "believe the bullshit" and are just too lazy to wan' to change, they're not going to "opt for less' so the 'other guy get's
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       " ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Their mentality is "it's a jungle out their and

        , the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The "presidential" level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite.

       <p>
        Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a political sub-nation. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.

       *The Draft (As military service)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Even more interesting is the process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We begin with a tentative definition of the draft.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and sold to the public under the label of "patriotic = national" service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing.   What does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.

       <p>
        As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous.
       </p>
       <p>
        As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.
       </p>
       <p>
        To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control.

The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstanding.

       <p>
        The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to "reality" when it comes, or sooner.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the transition becomes more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must be become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920.

        The emotional pressure for self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield - if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends."

       I enjoyed reading everything you wrote. It's mindblowing the section written in 1951. I see the illusion that is preprogramed "life". I have made choices to not participate. Or as little participation as possible. There are people, families, and communities building a new paradigm. It may seem small and hard to see. Those of us living sustainable lives have done well keeping it off the radar. Well now it is time to speak up. We have nothing and everything to loose at this tipping point. A lot of people are waking up. A lot of people are finding value in things they found useless. Take gardening for example. The subs on reddit related to this are teeming with folks who never planted a seed in their lives. The community of people who have, offer help and advice. Seems small right? But the impact is huge. Once someone grows a tomato they are hooked. Food sustainability is key. (R)evolution is not something achieved through violence but wrather choices. The more people start making choices, even small ones, the paradigm shifts. I might be altruistic but I've surrounded myself with, built and work towards a new society. On the flip side when the SHTF maybe people will come together, if not then natural selection comes quick.

        "In criminology, the rational choice theory adopts a utilitarian belief that man is a reasoning actor who weighs means and ends, costs and benefits, and makes a rational choice"

       I agree with you,
       <em>
        homo sapiens
       </em>
       are fucked. The rest of the animals too. Probably the planet. But those of us who are reaching outside of this paradigm are not. Those of us with the will and knowledge to survive know more or less what's coming and have since we were children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all of you--how many of you knew the world was coming to an end when you were in elementary and highschool? I did. I knew for sure we were going in the direction of an Orwellian police state and that eventually the religion/ET card WILL be played, in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake about it: there's a lot more to our reality than science and TV would have you believe. There are forces in this universe -- intelligent, highly advanced forces -- which are interested in us, whether as pets, slaves, or an experiment. I have no doubt of that now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have researched human history since I was in elementary school and I can only conclude that humanity has been a part of a long standing "program" that has kept us rooted in the same cycles, since recorded history. This is why no "real" progress is made. That is why we cannot find peace. That is why we cannot devote ourselves to our planet and one another. Beyond human stupidity and arrogance there is the "X" factor.. that factor is all the paranormal shit which has been recorded for ages. Especially those of aliens, gods, messiahs, visitors, whatever you want to call them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something much more than armageddon going on here. The sooner you realize that, hopefully the sooner you know what "side" you're on.

       It's got nothing to do with resources. For a technological civilization such as ours, resources are not a problem. The coming collapse will be driven by racial and demographic factors.
