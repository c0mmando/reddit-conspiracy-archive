       All of my posts to

       got hit immediately today.

      <p>
       I knew something funny was going on when I submitted a post critical of Monsanto to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and it got upvoted 3 times in a minute (and no downvotes) and the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       post to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       got downvoted twice in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Honestly I don't give a shit about downvotes. I'm just trying to find out if there are any legit users here anymore. I'm really starting to wonder.

       Here.  Though I do agree with you, it's been a bit of an echo chamber lately.  Kinda creepy when I've gone to check a few users' pages who I know were legit and finding that their accounts have been deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few off the top of my head are:
       <a href="/u/Gooiesc">

       <a href="/u/cccpcharm">
        /u/cccpcharm

       <a href="/u/InternetPropagandist">
        /u/InternetPropagandist
       </a>
       (though it looks like he was re-instated - still banned from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       )
       <a href="/u/Bubba-Booey">

       Edit: And
       <em>
        immediately

       , both of my posts here get downvoted.  The fuck?

       I've suspected that they've been doing this for some time.  I notice that "problem users" (i.e. those who are outspoken and articulate) often seem to receive instant downvotes on any comment or post, regardless of topic, as if they're being "shadowed".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's also the weird cases I've seen people mention where they've created private subs that only they know about yet still see things like "4 people here" in their sub despite the fact that no one other than them should know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wonder if we've gotten to the point where the bots themselves have started making comments as if they were people.  It wouldn't surprise me.

       Here's something that crossed my mind in reading these posts about the /new queue... a sort of hypothesis test.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, your Monsanto post:
      </p>
      <p>
       Post the same link twice, first with the word Monsanto, and second with otnasnoM (i.e., Monsanto backwards) immediately after.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the first gets downvotes and the second does not, it would be, IMO, preliminary evidence of automated bot voting (headline keyword parsing from the rss feed - which is virtually untraceable except by the voting responses).
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: p.s. test this with an alt account. regular posters might also be targeted for downvotes.

       All of my posts within the last several months get hit...Now when I submit a post I'll watch to see how long before the down votes start. In almost ALL posts the down votes are IMMEDIATE as if people are just waiting for posts to down vote into oblivion.

       Then I just watch as my post gets intentionally pushed  into the void never to be seen.  It's extremely aggravating.

       The next time you have a post like that. Try x-posting it from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       .  I am not going to do it again, but you are a mod.

      <p>
       IIRC, that post had 12 downvotes at the time that I x-posted it, but it was also a very good post.  Even the trolls couldn't say much against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For whatever reason, the x-post had more upvotes that the OP until about 75 or so.

       That's how it always is with Monsanto, especially here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, is it possible to put this on the side bar, high enough and big enough so that people notice it? I remember seeing that on some subreddit I visited, and that would be a good way to tackle this.

       Probably a permanent sticky would do the job too.

       It's a great idea and one that's been considered before, but I see the potential for a different type of problem, namely people massively upvoting bullshit to the top.

      <p>
       This sub already has that problem, but it would get much worse. It helps to be able to downvote stupid images and stuff.

       Also, even if we disable downvotes, the serious shills/trolls will just get around it.

       I look at the new bin here all the time, it can be pretty terrible. I don't usually downvote the bad, I just upvote the few good I find. But to say it is being systematically brigaded, while some of that surely goes on, is probably not accurate.

       What if "new" was the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       instead of "Hot"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a post gets so many up votes, it gets moved to "rising".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after so many more up votes, the post move on to "hot" or call it something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way we can immediately save a post that looks worthy of a discussion from being sent down the hole.

       Except that there's no rhyme or rhythm to any of the down votes. Many posts aren't even downvoted and many are rightfully down voted. How is a not supposed to discern between those situations? Not to mention it's strictly against the rules.

      <p>
       Instead it would make more since to try to found out where the down votes are coming from and solve the problem rather than applying a band aid solution.

       A working hypothesis I currently haven't ruled out pertains to the new bot User_History_Bot. This is very much the bane of post/comment trolls/shills. Any time you find someone trolling, simply post a history request and bang, no accusation of shilling, just and investigation which reveals relevant info. Dead troll/shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it only stands to reason that, in order to continue to discredit this sub, those who've been doing it (the
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       overlap crowd) have to change their tactic - downvote real conspiracies and upvote drama/quackery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific example of the quackery part is the Lellux debacle (currently #1 on frontpage with 2k upvotes - far and away above normal for a typical 5-600 upvote post that makes #1). The dramatists feed the drama they want to mock. Lellux is, quite obviously, a karma whore (despite the large number of "sports buffs" who turned out in defense of one of the accounts Lellux had copied). Everything that looks suspicious isn't necessarily a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current state of angst resulting from unprecedented oppression and surveillance has many people hoping to catch - and make an example of - just
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       ... one
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       douchebag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admit it: You'd like to catch one, too. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit (the company)
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       catch nearly all of them. they don't, so we flounder amid the abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: fear of being outed may have the trolls/dramatists/shills shifting their activity to the voting process to avoid being noticed... and, apparently, that fear is nominally justified.
