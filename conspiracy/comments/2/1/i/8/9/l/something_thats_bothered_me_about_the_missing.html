       So from what I've gathered there is little to no radar data that shows where the plane went. I've heard nothing about satellite imaging data that could point searches in the right direction. Yet what bugs me and I can't get it out of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people on the plane had smartphones? Almost all smartphones have GPS capabilities, so where is that data? Does anyone else think that they are intentionally hiding that data for some reason?

       Here's what happened IMO:
      </p>
      <p>
       Transponder is shut-off, and the plane changes course. Military radar did not lose the aircraft (this is not arguable). Programs keep track of everything in the air under radar - if something blips the wrong way or disappears, the algorithms pick it up and send out an alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post-9/11 mentalities are such that if a plane goes rogue and sets on a new course with transponders shut-off, military jets are scrambled without hesitation, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, the plane was taken down by military jets. The only scenario that would save the hides of all officials and governments involved in this mess would be to claim the plane was "lost". This would buy them time to "manage things" like the shot-down debris and any subsequent fake debris.

       and remember that fake 777 crash at SFO in 2013, wreckage for future dumping at a 'crash' site, if anybody desired.

      <p>
       an airliner
       <em>
        cartwheels
       </em>
       down the runway, pivoting on its nose, no damage to the nose or front of the airplane, as seen by photos and the video of the planes removal from SFO.
      </p>
      <p>
       somebody was contracted to make a plane crash video, unfortunately actual plane crash videos are rare, BUT model aircraft crashes are common on Youtube and elsewhere, so the clever CGI monkey made an airliner crash using model aircraft physics... wheee... watch the airliner roll intact like a toy down the runway.
      </p>
      <p>
       being ignorant (of anything beyond their beloved PCs and software) of the fact that RC model aircraft are 100 times stronger than their real world counterparts, they are designed and built to withstand bad landings and to be rebuilt and reflown.
      </p>
      <p>
       model aircraft (and boats) are not built with scale materials, scale skin on a model would be paper thin.

       Malaysia is hiding evidence from even people who are families of the victims so who is to say what they are not showing to those of us who have no relation to the plane whatsoever?

       This is true. My dad is extremely skilled at computer security and can verify. If your battery is in your cell phone right now, phone hackers can listen in on you or track you. Even if your phone is off.
      </p>
      <p>
       iPhones of course can not have the battery removed easily. Due to this, a lot of world leaders are not allowed to have one.

       I heard that's the real reason why you can't remove the battery. What are your thoughts that the phones kept ringing. If I put my phone under water I can guarantee it would not keep ringing but they brought experts on that said it would.

       I think that the plane landed successfully on some sort of military base. For what reasons? I do not know. I think that the plane was either carrying sensitive materials/individuals, or the plane itself is to be used for some other use.

       The problem with this is that phones don't use Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) to calculate location. Instead, cell phones use a pseudo GPS systm that triangulates from cell towers. So a cell phone as it travels pings three or more cell towers and then triangulates from those to calculate your location. This is in contrast to true GPS. True GPS uses satellites that are located in earths orbit well above the crust of the Earth. Cell tower do not deal well with the curvature of the Earth because they broadcast from low elevations and generally have poor long range capabilities. Additionally, cell phone towers do not broadcast in the middle of oceans simply because there is no need to build towers in the middle of the ocean. So no, there is not and will not be available GPS data from cell phones. They don't work that way.

       Actually sorry mate.  Cell phones use real gps signals and most smartphones have a small gps antenna they use just like any other gps enabled device. This is why your phone will give you a 50 to 100 meter guess when you are indoors or have the gps antenna turned off. When it can see the sky you will get under 10 meter accuracy or less from gps triangulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the jet was over the ocean there would be no cell towers in range to receive the gps location data we would need. (you see the phone figures out where it is from the satellite signals, no sending signals out)
      </p>
      <p>
       If any passengers phone pinged off a tower as they approached land there should be a record of that and they could easily figure the plane within 20 or 30 miles of said tower.

       Cell phones actually use assisted GPS. They require connection to a cell tower to turn the satellite signal into a position. Try it yourself.

       I guess I should have been clearer, I thought of this after my post. The true GPS antenna that exists in many smart phones requires line of sight interaction with GPS satellites, thusly it would not work when inside an airplane. That's why I drew the distinction between the two systems in my previous post.

       So if a GPS antenna won't work from the thin aluminum shell of an airplane while it is sailing above the majority of the atmosphere, then it surely wouldn't work in a car on the earths surface, right?  GPS antennas can't receive signals from within a vehicle, right?  Yeah, that's just common knowledge.
