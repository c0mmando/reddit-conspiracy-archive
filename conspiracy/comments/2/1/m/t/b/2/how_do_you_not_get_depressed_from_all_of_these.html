        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m relatively new to the group, and I love digging into all of the different theories. One thing bothers me though, and I keep walking away with the same feeling. It seems no matter what I read and research the same depressing thread runs through it. Common people are powerless plebes. </p>

<p>How do you guys not become overwhelmed with this? Am I too naive thinking there must be something that could be done? I don&#39;t like feeling like I am just working to serve others.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thank you guys! You&#39;ve all brought some very good perspectives and suggestions. I never realized how deep this rabbit hole can go, and I am anxious to learn more. I am also more determined than ever to break out as much as I personally can. No credit cards, gardening, and supporting my local community. It may not be a huge change, but it&#39;s a start. And it&#39;s something that helps me feel like I have a tiny bit of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time you &quot;dig into all these different theories&quot; by going onto websites like this, alternate news sites etc it gets noticed. Page views add up, comments sections are monitored closely and it adds to the wave of awakened. It&#39;s a small act of dissent but its still dissent. </p>

<p>Mainstream media is haemoraging numbers like crazy - while alternate media is skyrocketing. Comments sections in MSM got so over-run with aware and awake people not buying the lies that most MSM sites had to cancel their comments section! </p>

<p>Theres some serious cracks in the dam and it can only hold for so long....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I love that. It&#39;s amazing to see this stuff grow organically. Even places like conspiratard inevitably end up promoting the message simply by granting exposure. Guys like that are a real boon to alternative information.</p>

<p>Wide exposure matters more than factual information. The most farout ideas are valuable even if they are completely insane since they, too, will draw people in just to dispute them. Then you can engage them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the conspiracy behind conspiracies is that they make people feel powerless. the information avalanche is designed to overwhelm and confuse the individual as the spectacle flits from one insurmountable obstacle to the next while we just sit here wondering what can one person do about it all. </p>

<p>one of the best things to do is take some time out. turn the computer off, go outside and sit in the sun, close your eyes and just feel the sun on your face maybe you can hear some water, a running stream or waves on a beach, and realise that for all the troubles society creates for itself the world still continues its merry path through the universe. of course this is not going to change the world but this struggle is a long one and we need endurance. </p>

<p>Buckminster Fuller said “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” and if you agree that the problem is we live in a world where global corporations are treating the planet like a slave plantation then perhaps you will humor me when i suggest the solution is local self sufficiency. this is something you can start to do today by using your power to choose local suppliers over global corporations. it may feel insignificant but the global elite exists because our choices.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am the opposite. I actually get depressed from watching, t.v. Especially the news.  Whenever I see a panel of talking heads on CNN, spewing vomitously benign, disingenuous opinions out of their heavily powdered faces,  I want to throw a shoe at the T.V.  But he only time I see CNN is at the airport, and they are funny about shoes.</p>

<p>I love puzzles.  Conspiracies are puzzles to be solved.  Can&#39;t do shit about it.  So focus your view down to what matters most.  Love your friends and family.  Stick an extra can of beans in the pantry every now and then (Just in case).  </p>

<p>Occasionally drink too much, eat cake for breakfast, or call in sick to work.  Because, you are aware that the whole thing is bullshit.  You have began to shut off the programming.  You realize that there is not a terrorist behind every tree.  You see people and wonder why they work their asses off to pay for shit they don&#39;t need.  You start to realize that credit is a suckers game.  You feel generally insulted by how stupid the people in the entertainment industry think that you are.</p>

<p>Why would you be depressed by seeing more than you could before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kept a positive attitude for all of the years that I broke my back making someone else money. I was learning, building a toolbox of skill sets, and growing as a person. I always say that you are going to pay for your education one way or another.  Whether it&#39;s college, parking tickets, or life in general, you are going to pay.  </p>

<p>When I quit the rat race and started working for myself, I had the know how because I traded my labor for my employers knowledge.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to work for someone else.  As long as you are getting more out of it than money.  Also, have an exit strategy.  Everything in life is bearable if you have an exit strategy and are working towards it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re living a care free existence, you&#39;re doing it wrong. This place is a gladiator camp for souls not a god damn summer camp. Depression is a symptom of living in reality and not the fairy tale simulation we are indoctrinated into from birth.</p>

<p>but here&#39;s what i think: the only thing that will make a difference IS us,
the strength of human spirit cannot be denied, and if only more ppl will become aware of the truth (and not be afraid of it) can it happen.</p>

<p>of course it won&#39;t be easy, TPTB have used their money/power to spread propaganda; keep everyone wishing on a star (yeah, right, keep spending money on the lottery, see how that works out for most of us)</p>

<p>an evolution of our mind/consciousness has to be realized,
the truth can&#39;t be denied forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hence their paranoia about citizens owning guns, they fully know what an armed population can do to a corrupt <em>&#39;ruling elite&#39;</em>, what a mob of annoyed citizens can do to a cities govt if SHTF.</p>

<p>what some pissed off evicted homeowner, or enraged parent, some nobody with a legal M16 or a pistol with AP ammo, can do to a body-armored cop. hence their sending in legions of SWAT every time they get scared, this costs big money out of their budgets.</p>

<p>the great unwashed outnumbers the &#39;govt people&#39; 20 to 1, more if austerity really bites and gravy train govt employment drops in number, then you have pissed off ex-govt employees with grudges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been interested in conspiricies / alternate news for the past 10 years. The first couple of years, I felt I was going paranoid. It was indeed very depressing. I was untrusting, anxious.</p>

<p>After a while of living like this, I had to take a step back. If knowledge is power, and power is freedom ... why did I feel so shitty about the world around me? I took a while for me to unwrap all this, and come to the conclusion that my attitude was unhealthy for myself. I was not living my life to the fullest, not enjoying things the way I should.  In a way, knowing all the lies we are bombarded with made me feel WORSE than not knowing, and in that sense ... &quot;they&quot; had won over me. &quot;They&quot; were ruining my existence!!!</p>

<p>Now. When I talk about &quot;They&quot;, I am referring to a world of corrupt politicians, bankers, elites, pro NWO people, Corporations and yes, at one point, evil aliens that abduct people in their sleep. Can you see how ridiculous and self-destructive this way of thinking is? </p>

<p>How could I, a reasonable fun loving dude be less influenced by all this negative crap?  I found the solution over time. Let me share it with you.  I started feeling better about it all when I backed away from the details of it all, and took a look at the &quot;big picture&quot;.  </p>

<p>From the looks of it, our civilisation as we know it is going through major changes, this we cannot deny.  Mankind has been through this before, many times.  Every time a civilisation goes down, a new one pops up .. that is better than the previous. The Roman empire fell, and it was shits for the people in that era, but our culture was rebuilt on top of that. And when our civilisation goes down, I believe another one will pop up ... that will most certainly fix some of the issues THIS culture has.</p>

<p>So, from then on, my way of seeing things is &quot;What can I do, <strong>today</strong>, to start building the new Era that is coming ...&quot;.  I don&#39;t want to &quot;fix&quot; anything per se, at least not in a grand manner. I want to live my life, today -&gt; to its fullest.  I always believed the key to the future is going back to a community way of life, ie: trading services, growing your own food ... getting back to a simpler way of life.  Living this way, you will find is much more fulfilling, and teaching others not to depend on anything but themselves for their basic needs is much more fulfilling.</p>

<p>If I have one single lecture to recommend, have a  listen to someone that explains this concept and has much better communication skills than I: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you with absolute certainty stemming from personal experience that a wee bit of gardening and a decent exercise routine (can be 15-20 mins/day) does wonders for you. You&#39;re also actively fighting back by producing, and by strengthening yourself. Seriously. You can buy a $5 dollar pot and do 25 pushups and you&#39;ve started. Good luck. Stay positive and be active, friend. You are most certainly not alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greed ultimately causes all of the problems.</p>

<p>Really, all.</p>

<p>If the acceptance of overt greed  in every kind of leadership was reduced by just a fraction, the world would quickly change for the better.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible.</p>

<p>Changes of this magnitude have happened.</p>

<p>Witch hunting, gone.</p>

<p>Racism, reduced, hidden.</p>

<p>Child marriages to older men, reduced, hidden </p>

<p>Pedophilia, reduced, hidden</p>

<p>Homophobia, reduced, hidden.</p>

<p>If greed was added to this list you wouldn&#39;t even recognize the wisdom and grace of the  civilization that resulted</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not having a world completely filled with rabid competitors  willing to lie cheat steal and kill for the  psychopathic concept of power over others.and favoring the progress of civilization instead of its demise.</p>

<p>Greed is far beyond self interest. Greed is the addition of lying, cheating,stealing and killing to self interest.</p>

<p>We have no need for those mistaken qualities in our makeup. They are destructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychopaths are called  psychopaths  because they  have no regard, no remorse, for the damage they do and they have no ability to feel empathy towards those they directly damage. The problem with that is that psychopaths have always ruthlessly  sought positions of power from which to exercise their proclivity towards greed for power and money.</p>

<p>They have no business in leadership positions for those reasons.</p>

<p>This has always been the case but we now have the capacity to understand the damage this  history of psychopathic rule and rulers has caused all of humanity.</p>

<p>Look at the roots of any war and you&#39;ll see that it was caused by psychopathic greed.</p>

<p>Look at any crime and you&#39;ll see that it was caused similarly by psychopathic greed.</p>

<p>If there is no greed in the crime then the greed is within the relevant law.</p>

<p>The short answer to your question is that we have to disallow  leadership positions  to  greedy psychopaths and remove them if they develop psychopathic tendencies.. </p>

<p>Either that or  we&#39;ll just have to sit and  &#39;watch the world burn&#39; so to speak.</p>

<p>Psychopaths don&#39;t  care about anything but forcing one more nano gram of endorphin or dopamine into their consciousness and they don&#39;t care at all how many others have to die for them to do so.</p>

<p>Many things have changed for the better in the past.</p>

<p>This one more thing, reducing the prevalence and acceptance of greed, would be the greatest change for humanity in the history of the world and it can be done simply by bringing the problem (psychopaths seek leadership positions) to the consciousness of the average Joe.</p>

<p>I intend to do that.</p>

<p>It can be done.</p>
