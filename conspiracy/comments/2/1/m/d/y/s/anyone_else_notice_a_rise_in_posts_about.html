       The idea of getting a vaccination is logical... but here we are again with "What the hell are they really putting in these things" and we'll never get straight answers from the companies that make them... and we'll have all kinds of information coming out about them that will be a mix of truth, half-truth, and lies.

       Hate to play devils advocate, but there have been more outbreaks than usual of diseases we have vaccines for this year. Largely because of increasing numbers of unvaccinated people.

       Im not making a judgement either way on vaccines, just regurgitating the news.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Measles cases are up across the state and rose to 32 cases by March 14, far higher than the three reported cases from the previous year. At the time, Los Angeles County led the way with 10 cases.
Healthcare officials in Orange County warned residents to review their vaccination history and to monitor themselves for illness.

       You make it sound like I'm an avid user on there. Which I'm not, infact the comment you linked was of me suggesting that the "conspiracytard" was infact a fake on Facebook. Maybe I should have made this clearer. The vast majority of posts are shit and the circle jerk that forms with them I steer clear of at all times. I agree with you that a lot of the people on there are idiots and believe anything that is posted on there but occasionally and by that I mean once a month at best someone might actually put up a good post.

       Why would you be surprised?  Anyone who's cracked a history book understands that vaccination has simply wiped out a whole bunch of terrible diseases that used to kill people by the droves.  It's just statistics that someone who knows this posts first.

       If vaccines are so effective why are booster shots necessary and why do vaccinated people still get diseases they were treated for? Actual Immunity can only come from the natural response of your TH-1 and TH-2 systems in your body. Do you know why you cannot sue vaccine manufacturers? Because the Supreme Court ruled they are impossible to make safe! Our immune system has been evolving for millennia, we should take better care of our bodies to ensure success against fighting most of the wimpy diseases we are vaccinated for.

       Because vaccines aren't 100% effective but they are far more effective than your body.

       Sure tell that to a newborn baby and if you think diseases like Polio are wimpy I would recommend you go expose yourself to them and see how you like them without a vaccine.

       This is true but often people simply can't and people with weak immune systems can't just close themselves off from human contact from fear of becoming sick. Vaccines like flu vaccine help the people with weak Immune systems or people with preexisting medical conditions (like most of the people who died from H1N1) Vaccines like those for polio, the measles and mumps are however designed to eradicated diseases and save lives. Which they do.

       That's a very good point, I'm actually one of those people who needs vaccines straight up or I risk croaking from something that would just make someone else bedridden for a few days. Also vaccines don't just work by making you immune to disease, but rather also increasing your bodies ability to specifically counter said diseases so that when you do get them your sickness is shorter and less intense.

       I should clarify. It wiped dramatically decreased the number of reported cases worldwide from 300,000 to just over 200. It wiped out Polio in the west in the 60s and 70s and India was declared polio free along with 10 other asian countries yesterday. Why? because of the vaccine simple.

       So what you are saying is that a factor outside of the vaccine wiped out polio at the exact same time that the vaccine was introduced? Right around the world whenever the vaccine is introduced some other magical factor does all the world?

       Actually mentioning two things that happened is not indicative that one caused the other. Yes there is little polio, but there is also no Spanish Influenza, and there is no vaccine for that.

       In The US the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 in 1957. You are saying that this was not because of the polio vaccine that had been proven to be 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio and had been massively campaigned for and implemented across the US but instead was just because of some other reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Indian health authorities who say that India is now polio free because of the widespread immunisation are just wrong? and I bet there anti-measles campaign will fail too.
      </p>
      <p>
       No you are probably right rapid drops in cases of polio during vaccine drives were a coincidence.

       As I said in my first post, show data.

       A specific are that had a high number of cases, vaccine administered and the cases drop.

       I have negated nothing. I have simply asked for more data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume those numbers are for the US. Did the mass inoculations start in 1954?  Have you been able to find a time line that shows the regions in which inoculations started and show a direct lowering of cases?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to break it to you, but patterns of epidemics and drastically lowering of cases have been happening since human history began. This is what I meant. "There was a lot of polio, there was a vaccine, there was less polio" isn't enough. The evidence has to lead that one caused the other.

       Did they all coincide with the mass introduction of a vaccine? Without you refuting the evidence that I have presented I'm not arguing with you more because all you seem to say is "I'm right you're wrong".

       There has been no arguing. You just said three things.
      </p>
      <p>
       -There was an outbreak of polio
-There was a vaccine
-There was less polio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now watch me.
      </p>
      <p>
       -There was an outbreak of polio
-Elvis was on TV
-There was less polio
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is now on me to show that Elvis single handily eradicated Polio. I cannot, so my hypothesis has been refuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again- if you have data that shows one caused the other then by all means I will read it and say you are right.

       That's how real science works. Not just 'everybody knows'...

       Clinical trials proved the vaccine to be highly effective, as I said, The vaccine was widely implemented, as I said, polio cases dropped dramatically, as I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that if no vaccine was introduced, polio would have died off at the same time anyway? but only in western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still offer no explanation of your own. If it wasn't the vaccine that caused it, explain how in the rest of the world the same thing happens. High number of polio cases, vaccine introduced, the numbers drop again take India the numbers drop when the vaccine is introduced more than 50 years after they drop in America.

       Before I say anything can you outline exactly what your position on this is? What I have gathered is that you believe There is not enough evidence to indicate that the polio vaccine worked or was effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955 children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957.

       I don't have a position. I allow evidence to lead to my conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I have looked into this. What I hoped to find is clear causation. For ex:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In ____ area in 1954 there were 10,000 cases. 90% of the local population were vaccinated in 1955. In 1956 there were 13".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never found that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence is not 'Everybody knows vaccines stopped Polio'. Evidence is evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your example what % of the US (entirely too big a sample size unless the entire country was vaccinated) were touched by the March of Dimes in the years you noted?

       For example I found this today looking for info about this very discussion. It was announced that India is vaccine free, but vaccine induced Polio seems to not count. Tell that to the 47,500 that were stricken by the vaccine in 2011.

       Looking for the first one it seemed sensationalist very biased and their sources didn't seem very balanced either and I can't find the source for the polio cases in India just quotes it's also very poorly written. At this point I wouldn't trust a word it said until I saw it backed up by something more reliable.

       I'll check out the second one and see what it has to say.

       You were trying to give weight to your argument. You did that by bringing up an emotional visual. This happens almost every thread in which vaccines are discussed. The simpson's had reverend lovejoy's wife. "will somebody think of the children!"

       You are here arguing THIS because you assume. You assume that you're opinion/view is correct. Further you assume that the opposing opinion/view is incorrect. Your assumption that your opinion/view is correct is based on the assumption that the studies which influenced you were correctly performed. Unless you were the one conducting said study, you are also assuming that the study was reported correctly. I might be able to squeeze out a couple more assumptions if I try, but I

       I'm ignorant as to what the person you originally responded to was talking about. Its over my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines; I do have an opinion on. I'm a person who believes in balance and desires things to be natural. Sticking a metal object into my skin and injecting who know's what (someone can tell you what it is but you're assuming if you didn't make it yourself) into my body is not my opinion of what is natural. So I don't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, people are going to die, thats just the way it is. Some might die horribly excruciating deaths. However, I feel that through seeing and being aware of the bad you can truly appreciate good. Ever read the short story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas. Its short and might help you understand my viewpoint. It is pretty close to the way I think about balance - you have to have bad to have good. I don't feel you can just take bad away without it popping up again in some other way.

       Yes but people can have a degree of control over how they die and more importantly live. A disease like polio (I keep using this but it is a very good example) does kill but it also cripples and paralyses if you survive it you could experience that for the rest of your life and yet it is very simple to take a polio vaccine and help yourself by becoming immune but also help others by creating a herd immunity.

       So I guess you don't use cars or wear glasses or even clothes you don't use plastics or use the internet. To be honest I see a vaccine as a lot more natural than most of the things in our society. Take the polio vaccine. It is an inactive poliovirus almost the exact same as something you could have been exposed to if you live in the U.S during the polio epidemic or in India up until today (or 3 years ago today).

       This is ultimately your decision but I feel that it is a very selfish desicion. It isn't just this could affect. You probably aren't going to immunise your children if you have any and you are putting anyone else who hasn't had immunisations (like children under 6 months) at risk as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway that's my take on your view. Feel free to dispute anything wrong that I may have said.

       90-95% of people are asymptomatic if they are infected with polio; meaning they show no symptoms and wouldn't even know they are infected.
4-8% show minor illness meaning flu like symptoms.
1-2% have nonparalytic aseptic meningitis as a result of polio.
.1-.5% of people infected with polio have paralytic poliomyelitis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats a maximum of 2.5% of infections resulting in pretty debilitating conditions or a minimum of 97.5% of infected people not having much trouble.

       I rarely use cars, haven't owned one in almost 7 years - I try to bike most of the time
I don't have nor need glasses
Clothing I have, the majority of it is cotton and hemp - though I do have a pair of adidas track pant I love
I've curbed my use of plastics dramatically in the past 4 years - I buy in bulk with my own glass containers
The internet - I obviously use, however I am using it less and do plan on nixing it completely one of these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, society as it is, doesn't really fit my definition of natural, but this is what I was born into. I am making moves to live in a society that does fit my definition.

       It is a selfish decision. Just as all decisions are. When you eat while there are people literally starving. When you go live in your home while people are living on the street. When you make sure to get to the movie 15 minutes early so you can get the good seat. When you lock your doors.

      <p>
       Everyone gets to point there children the direction they think will help them the most. I'd assume the direction you point your kids is probably different than the direction i'd point mine. And that's just fine with me. I'm not gonna berate you or tell you to die for vaccinating yourself or your children.  If you are right, it will be obvious in the end.

       Don't worry, I do refrain. (knock on wood) I've never been to the doctor for being sick, just to make sure I didn't break my ankle. No medicine, no x-rays. What medicine is everyone taking that you think i'm missing out on?  Why does everyone need this medicine. What goodies are you ingesting.

       I don't think using modern medicine is weird.  One great reason you've had less chance of contracting deadly diseases is herd immunity.  You can thank people who chose to get vaccines for that! :)

       Wow, look at that...and even information from WHO.  Interesting, right?  Cases of polio and measles (just doing a quick search) actually went down after a vaccine was administered.  Not just in the US either.

       I was pointing out that they were already on a steep decent before vacines were administered. The polio epedimics rise and fall seem to coincide with the introduction of ddt to the market as well as its exit, as well as its re-entry to the market in 1992 with the appearence of "post polio"

       When did I lie?  I made this comment and then replied to your fun little graphic.  And while I'm here, I'll just respond to that too.  Often times with diseases, there will be deep spikes and decreases in the natural timeline.  Doesn't mean that they are gone for good, just that there is a lull in the deaths.

       Vaccines help, and it's easy to find proof of that with logic and science.

       You lied saying you just got back on reddit. Nice blanket dismissal. I'm not even saying vaccines don't work. I'm saying there is no need in the first place. The constant average descent of most disease in the graph can be tied to increasing sanitation.

       And vaccinations.  I did just get back onto reddit.  I posted the comments, that was that.

      <p>
       You can't say that it's exclusively tied to increasing sanitation, because diseases are popping up NOW when anti-vaccination is at a high.

       Better sanitation+vaccines=less dead people.

       And this is funny because..? Sure humans could eventually evolve to resist these diseases but you're looking at thousands of years and millions of completely unnecessary deaths if you want our bodies to handle them on their own.

       Not to mention, by that point new diseases will spring up and the process continues.

       Of course, you might take a look at a history book sometime and see how many diseases have been essentially eradicated by vaccinations.  My grandfather made a living treating tuberculosis patients - then he was one of the driving forces behind vaccination for TB in Australia and drove himself out of business (and was happy to do so, he seemed to have a personal resentment of TB).

       Anyone you know ever got smallpox?  What about polio?  Diphtheria?  But these used to be so common - what
       <em>

       I have negated nothing. I have simply asked for more data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume those numbers are for the US. Did the mass inoculations start in 1954?  Have you been able to find a time line that shows the regions in which inoculations started and show a direct lowering of cases?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to break it to you, but patterns of epidemics and drastically lowering of cases have been happening since human history began. This is what I meant. "There was a lot of polio, there was a vaccine, there was less polio" isn't enough. The evidence has to lead that one caused the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I have looked into it and cannot find it.
