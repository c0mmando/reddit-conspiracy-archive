First the official story, he crashed his car. Then the obvious story, he was assassinated. Then the less obvious story, the assassination was made to look obvious to make sure we all saw it. It&#39;s no mistake that the engine was blown clean out of the car. By MSM standards the PRISM thing is shocking but compared to the real story it&#39;s pretty mild and serves to misdirect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that gets me about Hastings is that it was a very particular person doing a very particular thing, showing information on a CIA misconduct and taking it to a very well respected publication, Rolling Stone Magazine. He was an editor meaning this was going to get published at some point on a massive scale.</p>

<p>When I explain to people what he did and what he was trying to accomplish people say oh, that sucks. Which is fine and all, but they don&#39;t realize this is targeted at whistleblowers/people involved or incited to involve themselves in leaking information. Snowden got out and they needed to set a precedent on someone they caught.</p>

<p>Truth be told reddit, for what its worth, is far more powerful than FB or Rolling Stone Magazine, or anything like that because at its core it serves no purpose but forum. That mean&#39;s it&#39;s open to corporate interests manipulation at times, but people are getting good at &quot;spot-the-bot&quot; which is great.</p>

<p>Hastings had something to say, he didn&#39;t get a chance to say it. Instead his engine is blown out of his car 100 feet down the road in a fiery explosion saying he was racing. There was a video on youtube showing a gardener outside watering plants and a fireball streaking down the street. I&#39;ve just recently seen a car accident and while mangled there was no engine down the street, not visible burn marks. Hastings was talking to a WikiLeak&#39;s lawyer one-hour before his death saying &quot;They are chasing me, Help!&quot;.</p>

<p>Even though he was unable to get his message out, its important to know he had one. And although deliberately sabotaging Hasting&#39;s that could have brought 10 more reporters in his place, or more. I&#39;m glad to see someone is still talking about this because I feel it slipped through the cracks way way too fast. A lot of things have been like that lately but his case is especially important imo.</p>

<p><strong>Besides Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, most Democrats abandoned their civil liberty positions during the age of Obama. With a new leak investigation looming, the Democrat leadership are now being forced to confront all the secrets they’ve tried to hide.</strong></p>

<p>do you think they killed sen. udall&#39;s brother?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He Believed His Car Had Been Tampered With – Another truth, at least according to an LA Weekly writer who interviewed his neighbor. Hastings confided to her the day before the accident that he thought “someone” had done something to his car and he was afraid to drive it. But just like the feeling that he was being investigated, the fact that he thought someone tampered with his car does not mean someone did tamper with his car. <strong>Only</strong> that he thought someone had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure everyone here knows him better from Googling him.</p>

<p>And his brother had been trying for an intervention with him for several weeks.</p>

<p>Are you claiming his brother is some sort of pansy too scared to say &quot;the truth&quot; then? If the government killed my brother I&#39;d be all over the internet where they wouldn&#39;t be able to silence it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently only certain speculation is encouraged here. What&#39;s wrong with trying to keep speculation as much within the bounds of accuracy as possible?</p>

<p>Or is it more about the speculation than being correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. One of my favorite conspiracies is the moon landing. I have never believed  that happened in they was it&#39;s been spun. But try to discuss that here is pointless. I always wonder if there is a more pro-conspiracy conspiracy subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can discuss it, but you&#39;ll get people citing reasons why they think it <em>did</em> happen, and I&#39;m personally of the mind that they&#39;re right.</p>

<p>If you want the sort of place you&#39;re thinking about, it would be more of an echo chamber than a place for the to and fro of ideas, and who wants that?</p>
