<p>The reason for owning a gun now is to shoot dangerous cops?</p>

<p>How do we know a cop is dangerous enough to shoot?  They like pointing guns all the time.  Will them killing your family pet deserve your bullets?  How about if you witness a cop shooting someone else?  Will you shoot the cop?</p>

<p>But some people are reasonable when shown the light. I&#39;d like to believe I was one of those people. Yet if I hadn&#39;t seen how would I ever have known? These people need somebody to show them. In this situation it&#39;s gun ownership.</p>

You know the place were it is kill or be killed. What we used to understand when we were in nature seeing that fact every single day. Realizing that this is a dog eat dog world. We are so disconnected from the reality of how serious the repercussions are of this situation. You seem like the guy that would try to talk to the cops after they broke your door down, shot your dog, raped your wife. You really think at that point reason is going to prevail?

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. My problem is that we have to do something drastic and quick or this is gonna become common place and accepted...If it has not already happened. Everyone is so damn scared of killing. Do you think those people in medieval times were scared of killing? We behave as if they will just disappear if we don&#39;t focus on it. That is what a child does when he is scared. He hides under his bed and attempts to &quot;pretend&quot; that the problem is not really there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Back in the day if the Sheriff did something un-honorable he&#39;d be shot &amp; likely the guy that shot him would take over in his place. Nowadays however we&#39;re not even allowed due process of a Jury; you&#39;re instead treated as 100% guilty regardless of the offense. Then once you&#39;re branded as this &#39;lawless&#39; individual the cops use every opportunity to flex their muscle. The argument that cops don&#39;t look to kill or are not turned on by it is crap. It&#39;s crap because in these instances officers shoot first rather risk their life in the line of duty; which correct me if I&#39;m wrong; is part of their job. They&#39;re not out there protecting the public - they&#39;re out there protecting themselves. Avoid interactions with Public Officers at all times. They see you as either an early paid vacation or another paycheck perhaps with some Overtime if they can &#39;justify&#39; killing you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, It is their job to kill. Mercenary anyone? So here is the real question. If they cops are corrupt, who is to &quot;police&quot; them? The answer is US. It would be nice to think that cops are here &quot;to serve and protect&quot;  but that is just not the case anymore. There is always exceptions BUT this is now becoming the majority and if the good cops want to be considered good then they need to start doing something of substance about what they HAVE to see going on.All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent -unknown. Also JFK&#39;s quote fits in here as well. &quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&quot; - John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>If they think we will not start capping their fucking asses, they are bewildered.</p>

<p>Shooting a cop nowadays is essentially committing suicide.  I remember a while back a cop shooter was on the run and the police finally caught him (I think in Seattle) and killed him.  Motherfuckers were high-fiving in the street and cheering.</p>

<p>And lets not forget that one guy they burned alive in a log cabin...</p>
