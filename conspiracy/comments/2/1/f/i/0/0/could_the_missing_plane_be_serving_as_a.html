    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain to you like you&#39;re five.</p>

<p>The people who are systematically downvoting new posts clearly have an agenda that is inimical to the objectives of this subreddit. These shills downvote any post which seeks to discuss or establish the truth. When a new post garners lots of downvotes from these people, this serves as a contra-indication of the invalidity of the post. Get it?</p>

<p>Now fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been curious about this as well. For two whole weeks the media&#39;s drooled over and speculated about this one, single story! FOR TWO WEEKS! And what have they to show for it? Nothing. Not one piece of &quot;breaking news&quot; or &quot;special update&quot; that they&#39;ve &quot;reported&quot; on has gone farther than being just a rumor. I dunno, maybe it&#39;s the media&#39;s way of diverting our attention away from Obama&#39;s so-called &quot;weak&quot; stand against the Russian Federation. But really, it&#39;s none of the Feds&#39; business anyways. If Crimea really wants to secede, let &#39;em secede!</p>

<p>Plus there are potential political dimensions here -- Malaysia&#39;s Muslim government, China&#39;s involvement in Indian Ocean border disputes, the potential of &quot;terror hijacking&quot; which can generate further political leverage in the region -- depending on how the still-unresolved story turns out.  It could still go down any road until it&#39;s found, and even then, the backstory of what &quot;actually happened&quot; (allegedly) can be used to justify even more bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;re theorizing that the plane was disappeared in order to create a big enough story to replace a news story already in the know? That doesn&#39;t make sense. It would make sense if there was a single global news organization with a global monopoly on news, and for example the NSA/Snowden narrative had been replaced completely by this plane story</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t saying that--I can&#39;t speak on whether or not the disappearance was intentional, although that could be true. I was implying that the amount of attention it has been getting since its disappearance is insane, considering that most of the people weighing in on it have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. But I think this has more to show about how bad the US&#39; media is than it does a conspiracy. </p>

<p>I am trying to keep a level head. Only throwing this thought out to see what other redditors are thinking. Thanks for your input! </p>
