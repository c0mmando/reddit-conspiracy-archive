<p><a href="/r/copnspiratard">/r/copnspiratard</a> is a mockery of the subset of conspiracy-theorist-like posts that are, more often than not, too stupid to even address.  The source material is not often from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - it&#39;s mostly from Facebook, from what I can tell - but everyone has their moments, I guess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to be able to laugh at yourself, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really bad advertisement for the most idiotic sub on reddit.</p>

<p>The truth of that sub can be found here: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1ztwrl/official_announcement_your_conspiratard/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1ztwrl/official_announcement_your_conspiratard/</a></p>

<p>Even subscribers don&#39;t understand.. the mods actually think the sub is serious and that they are doing something by moderating the content. Very bizarre. Anyone who&#39;s been on reddit for more than 12 months knows the conspiratard was a DIRECT parody of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. And yes, it is very close to a mirror sub of this sub.. and comments amount to &quot;ha ha ha, yes i agree&quot;. Why anyone would try and pretend otherwise is baffling. </p>

<p><a href="/r/skeptard">/r/skeptard</a> is a helluva a lot more fun and satisfying.</p>

<p>Not even close.  The only coward that fears being called a shill is a shill.  Evidence and fact are self evident.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, aside from this particular comment not being downvoted I still am genuinely curious about something... What are you trying to accomplish by commenting here? You clearly think conspiracy theorists are delusional. Is it personal gratification in mocking people? Are you trying to be a social justice warrior? Are you here for debate? What is it that makes people come here just to start shit? I&#39;m not being an ass, I&#39;m actually curious. By the way I&#39;ll up vote you for calling me out on being downvoted, because I jumped to conclusions based on my prior experience on getting involved in  arguements with people from that sub </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just annoys me that some people in this sub make it out that we spend all our time sneering at this sub. We don&#39;t single you out, we post news articles, Alex Jones, Facebook memes that sort of thing. If someone from r/conspiratard says something stupid or breaks the rules or is racist, r/conspiratard subscribers call them out on it. I don&#39;t think that <em>all</em> conspiracy theorists do this, by the way, that&#39;s just stupid. I don&#39;t hate conspiracy theorists, I don&#39;t think that <em>all</em> of them are delusional. Some I definitely think jump to conclusions from too little evidence or desperately need to read a medical journal and some I think are just looking for attention or are really insensitive, but I don&#39;t have an issue with all of them. </p>

<p>In reality, I woke up this morning and went onto Reddit. I went onto my front page and would have been on for maybe a half hour before I found this post. Scrolled down, saw your comment, disagreed with it and it went on from there. No big whoop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, and lt makes sense on a certain level. However, the way of thinking that you&#39;re dismissing is free thinking. Free thinking and theorizing led to theoricital philosophy, physics, etc. I&#39;m obviously not going to sit here and say that everyone who can&#39;t prove what theyre saying deserves your full attention...At the same time, the people that have come up with the best ideas were not generally accepted by mainstream ideology either.They just saws things differently. I just wish sometimes the other sub was mature enough to dismiss radical ideas with no base instead of mocking them.... It just seems so juvenile to spend your free time doing that. It seems that sub can&#39;t grasp the concept that there will always be opinions you disagree with, it&#39;s just up to you to be mature enough to accept that you&#39;re never gonna agree with EVERYONE... If you get your kicks by making fun of people, I guess we will leave it at that...it just seems like such a premature undefined way of approaching things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, I support free thinking. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t, however,subscribe to the idea that theories (<em>not</em> scientific theories) equal hypothesis. Respectable free thinking should not include stuff along the lines of Flight 370 having a nuke in it or 9/11 being holograms. Those ideas would be great if they have evidence behind them. I could claim that Marvin the Martian crashed into the Twin Towers, but nobody would believe me because I didn&#39;t have any evidence for my claim. </p>

<p>A hypothesis would be what you think respectable free thinking is, which is something along the lines of &quot;I think that the owner of the WTC gave them permission to pull building 7 because we have it on record telling someone to &#39;pull it&#39;&quot; 
My response in 2001-2002: &quot;Abso-fucking-lutely. Go for gold. Investigate, investigate until the cows come home.&quot; 
My response in 2014: &quot;Actually no, we have evidence from the spoken sources that the line was taken out of context, and the line itself was taken from an interview. He actually meant by &#39;pull it&#39;, to evacuate the firefighters from the building because the chief was unsure if they could put out the fire and the owner said it wasn&#39;t worth the risk.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is amusing, considering the number of people who are subscribed to both.</p>

<p>You can believe that the government has a vested interest in prying into the lives of its citizens while not agreeing that Obama is a Kenyan, that Flouride is evil, that vaccines cause Autism, and that GMOs are the devil.  Believe it or not, this is the case.  </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has gone so far over the deep end with both its content and the self-important paranoia of its users that it has become farcical in nature.  When a group of people this large cannot tolerate any sort of difference of opinion among its members, labeling everyone who does not agree a <strong><em>shill</em></strong>, then it is a hell of a stretch to consider yourselves &quot;free thinkers&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any good idea has its enemies and trolls. They are the trolls. </p>

<p>I will be the first to admit that not all conspiracies that we think up is valid. However, <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mocks our entire subreddit and our cause, just because we allow the freedom to discuss all kinds of theories. Not all theory submitted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is believed by all, and in fact most of our comments are filled with refutations and debunking. They generalize us all as one, just because we allow people to speak their minds here. </p>

<p>Secondly, they think we are some kind of jew hating group, and they have personally tried to make us seem like anti-semites by commenting ant-jewish things under alt their accounts. </p>

<p>Third, they are led by anti-Palestine leaders, who make pancake jokes about people who got crushed to death when they protested the demolition of homes in Palestine and bulldozers ran over them. Specifically Rachel Corrie. (If you want more details about this, I can provide evidence). </p>

<p>So in short, they are a horrible group and I don&#39;t think most of the people who visit there are aware of it. It is best to ignore them. We banned most of them because all they do is disrupt conversation going on here, and don&#39;t actually add to anything. I am sure the heavy downvotes every new link is getting is some of their handy work too. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> And I get downvotes with no replies... how surprising. Of course <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> don&#39;t downvote brigade, so it can&#39;t be them. /s</p>

<p>Since <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is viewing this thread, and the majority (as expected) don&#39;t have any idea about Rachel Corrie or the joke about pancakes, I will provide the details. It is a lot more than what they will tell you there. </p>

<p>They created <a href="/r/WorldofPancakes">/r/WorldofPancakes</a> to make fun of her. If you look at the mod list, you will know I am not lying. </p>

<p>Need more proof? Here are plenty: </p>

Some will be as described and all or most mods may have an agenda but a lot of those who post are skeptards who cannot  think for themselves and are manipulated into mockery and setting up strawmen to argue.  Others are drama or concern trolls .  Others are social just warriors there&#39;s a diverse group of participants just as there is here.

<p>Yes, the mods reference it all the time with &#39;pancake&#39; posts. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/9e7bj/new_device_makes_200_pancakes_per_hour_is_it/">This is a perfect example</a> - &quot;This would have come in handy at the Rachel Corrie pancake breakfast&quot; jcm267 - The mod who banned me from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> for talking badly about the Bush family in another subreddit.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s this subredit linked in the sidebar. <a href="/r/WorldOfPancakes/">/r/WorldOfPancakes/</a>. Most of the post are submitted by Jcm267, TheGhostOfTzvika, COINTELPROAgent, all three of them mods in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and they all seem to enjoy &quot;bulldozer-Raciel Corrie-pancake&quot; jokes. Maybe it&#39;s because they are very protective of the cause she was protesting against.</p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but wouldn&#39;t it be expected by the mods there to delete posts mocking people being bulldozed to death? I&#39;ve just shown you a handful of examples with bulldozed/Rachel/pancakes are the themes, if only to amuse the 0.1% of your subredit, the mods and their friends.</p>

<p>This is just some of the more blatant evidence. It seems to me quite a few of the mods at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> find jokes about this funny, where i find them sick. To be fair it&#39;s only a very small portion of the whole community, but it is your leadership after all. </p>

I don&#39;t know how many actual threads there are about the event but I do know that there are comments about it all the time, and as <a href="/u/Strensh">/u/Strensh</a> mentioned it is even mentioned in the sidebar of the sub. I have seen dozens of jokes about it. So no, I didn&#39;t HEAR anything about it, I have seen it with my own eyes. </p>

<p>She was killed in 2003 and they&#39;ve made this macabre ritual out of her death. It&#39;s really sad. There is a lot of NSFL content out there where they photoshop photos of her corpse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Rachel Corrie, made to look like a Saint, holding a spatula and a stack of pancakes. You see now why they felt it necessary to invade this post and lie to you en mass while burying all this evidence of their true nature in excessive downvotes. They are warmongers and extremists, hellbent on discouraging people from asking certain questions.</p>

All they are are some misguided individuals who have bought into the &#39;Kosher&#39; version of events: it isn&#39;t their fault they are so misled by the media.

<p>People seriously expect anyone to believe this type of behaviour isn&#39;t continuing on this site when the the same people now mod huge subs that shape peoples perceptions like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> who&#39;s mods mocked people when asked why RT was banned and a whole host of other sites as well.</p>

<p>What about <a href="/r/restorethefourth">/r/restorethefourth</a>? that is also modded by conspiritard accounts. Do you think people that say Edward Snowden should be hanged and mocked NSA stories in news subs should be directing a sub and protests about the NSA? One of the organisers left and shown the behaviour of these mods was a blatant take over and possible criminal behaviour to do with donations.</p>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/LTdMza13">http://pastebin.com/LTdMza13</a></p>

<p>To the people that are not part of the mods accounts, rather than circle-jerking, why don&#39;t you actively have conversations with people instead of hiding behind crass humour? It&#39;d be a lot more constructive. And why do you suppose that there is always a blanket name calling policy for this sub and people here when there is some good posters and posts?</p>

<p>Seriously, people who think it&#39;s a fucking joke are part of the joke but not in on it. These people actively have been censoring people and towing some of the worst people in American politics in the last century. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aka, sabotage. Specifically saying it was the national organisers points the fingers, the content shows the malice. And I&#39;m aware that one of the other mods was a one day old account that was given privileges the same time as one of the other mods, perhaps a fall back in case they got found out? And the guy that i linked to in the Pastebin link just shows that it wasn&#39;t just one person who felt that way and it was indeed other people as well.</p>

<p>Now where have I heard about disruption, sabotage and threats being used as a tactic before?</p>

<p>Edit: Please let me know more about this &#39;evidence&#39; so I can understand too.

    <div class="md"><p>u/conspiratard used to be a creature known as u/Nuclear_Is_Good. he first showed up to do some promotion of nuclear power as a response to AGW. He quickly found r/climateskeptics and soon went ballistic when no one would cave-in to his demands for all of us to change our positions in light of his &quot;irrefutable&quot; ranting.</p>

<p>N_I_G, in his delusional grandeur, adopted several other subs as his private little world. He, and he alone, had the right to slander, condemn and belittle anyone daring to take a position not his. One of his favourite terms was &quot;conspiratard&quot; which applied to everyone. He took to heart the Lewandowski paper and so felt justified to lump every person with a contrary attiude together. If AGW skeptics could be &quot;truthers&quot; then &quot;Truthers&quot; must be &quot;deniers&quot; etc.  </p>

<p>Not too long ago it was revealed that our planet has not warmed for 15+ years. It was at that time that the head-mods on several subs decided to adopt language rules because the users had gone completely nuts in their dispair. N_I_G, thinking himself above such rules, just went on as normal with his slander, condemnations, and belittling. He managed to get himself banned from his private clubs of r/environment and r/skeptic. </p>

<p>Within 20 inutes he was back as u/geneconspiratard on r/skeptic and r/climateskeptics. A quick note to the mods and that account was banned as well. 2 hours later u/otherconspiratard was born. make no mistake about it - that guy is dangerously crazy. If ever reddit is unavailabe I shudder to think what will happen to his neighbours.</p>

<p>Yes because the same couldn&#39;t be said for a lot of users here. Especially when bullshit quotes or sensationalist, fear-mongering stories get blindly upvoted. Or when someone attempts to debunk a theory and just gets labeled a shill, downvoted with no explanation, or banned. </p>

<p>Again with the indignant hyperbole. While I agree that it adds a bit of flair to a debate and can make for a good read, it is not a valid argument in of itself. </p>

<p>The subreddit exists to &#39;troll&#39; (odd choice of words, since they seldom force themselves upon the people in this subreddit, most stay over there) excesses amongst conspiracy theorists. This is easily done by looking at this sub, since it is on reddit too, but it is not the only source. </p>

<p>Even you probably have to agree that a few conspiracy theorists like to jump to conclusions, which is both detrimental to finding out what really happened and somewhat funny. But when these people brand everyone who disagrees slightly as a traitor/shill/whatever, it becomes pretty annoying. And when people get annoyed, they make subreddits. Voila. </p>

<p>In other words, if the community here would keep themselves in check not necessarily with theories but at least with overblown accusations, <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> would move on/die out. </p>

<p>It is as simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I am curious. I think something is definately off in Amercia today: there is something as a zionist lobby, corporate lobby, defense lobby etc., and they are way more powerfull than widely believed and they do thing that are outside the boundaries of both law and good taste. </p>

<p>I am disappointed however that some people just like to go into hyperbole the second something suspicious pops up, and immediately blame it on the standard baddies with very flimsy evidence. Challenging the evidence isn&#39;t always the same as outright disagreement, and if people immediatly silence these dissenters as shills, I feel it kills any real debate. </p>

<p>Secondly, I would like to challnge you to be a bit more civil. Just dismissing me as a &#39;nob&#39; makes it really easy for you to just ignore everything I say, doesn&#39;t it. It is a somewhat cowardly way though, and it makes you come off as an insecure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making a lot of generalisations after accusing me of the the same. So let&#39;s drill down into a specific story - the MH370 missing plane. </p>

<p>If you do some reading, it should be clear that the discussions on this subreddit are trying to find out what is actually going on. We are trying to do this in a blizzard of misinformation from officials and mainstream news sources. We are looking for contradictions in the ever changing official narrative, we are trying to establish what, if anything, is true in this story. This inevitably involves speculation, but it is measured and coherent, not hyperbolic, as you are claiming. You won&#39;t find any alien abduction or &quot;a black hole swallowed my plane&quot; stories getting any traction in this subreddit.</p>

<p>You know what we really don&#39;t want, as we try to do this? People with limited outlooks or cryptic agendas coming here to disrupt conversations, repeat misinformation and generally piss people off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the long wait. Shit happened. </p>

<p>Anyways, the specific story you bring up is a very good example on how conspiratard isn&#39;t trying to actively &#39;troll&#39; everyone and everything on here. </p>

<p>If you check conspiratard, you won&#39;t see any posts about the missing plane: the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/top/">top post of the week</a> (at the time of checking) are about an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21bhku/nasa_is_hiding_something_from_us/">inverted earth theory</a> that uses ridiculous evidence, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21mgal/donald_trump_goes_full_jenny_mccarthy/">Donald Trump bashing vaccination because autism</a>, a post mocking not the content but the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21qm81/not_in_the_mainstream_news/">sensationalist headline of a post</a> on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and someone who hates the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21i03n/fck_the_aluminade_xpost_from_rcringepics/">&#39;Alluminade&#39;</a>. </p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21enr1/yes_yes_im_sure_its_not_just_possible_that_people/">another top5 post</a> that makes fun of a theory posted on here probably, but I think the author has a point in doing so: there are a lot of brunettes in America. To top it of, the girls have a very generic face and they are crying: I&#39;d be more suprised if there weren&#39;t any somewhat cute crying brunettes witnessing a disaster in America. </p>

<p>Therefore, I think you are wrong in saying </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sad creatures of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>[1] are psychologically damaged specimens who believe themselves to be champions of objectivity, but are brainwashed dimwits who are unable to think properly for themselves.</p>

<p>This is what I was referring to when I was talking about hyperbole. 
Look, I get that you are mad because people on an open internet forum barge in conversations with misinformation due to negligence or intentionally, but I don&#39;t think you can blame this on conspiratard. Judging by the people in this thread, there are lots of people like me on here who subbed to both, and use one for information and the other one for fun. </p>

<p>I thank you for your latest post, it was honest, to the point and had limited anger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, you are making perfectly reasonable points, and I am sure we can agree to disagree on why <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> exists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, I get that you are mad because people on an open internet forum barge in conversations with misinformation due to negligence or intentionally...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you hit the nail on the head here. Many of the ideas discussed on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are regarded by &quot;ordinary&quot; people as fringe, deranged and/or heretical. For this reason, there is no point voicing these ideas in mainstream subreddits or internet forums generally - the responses are either insultingly dismissive, or angry, bordering on the hysterical.</p>

<p>This subreddit is about the only place I know where conspiracy-related ideas can be batted about with like-minded people and without the abuse. </p>

<p>So when certain individuals deliberately come here to disagree, disrupt, belittle it causes a great deal of frustration. </p>

<p>These people have the whole of the internet to discuss mainstream ideas, but they insist on coming here to troll.</p>

<p>So even though my original diatribe was hyperbolic, referring to these people as &quot;psychologically damaged&quot; is not unfair. Going out of one&#39;s way to troll people who think differently is not the behaviour of well-adjusted, decent human beings. Some of them may be teenagers, in which case they can be excused, but I genuinely think an adult who does this (for pleasure) has issues.</p>

<p>..and then people still barge in and go ballistic and fuck stuff up, as you said. This is absolutely true. </p>

<p>However, I still believe a lot of this base doesn&#39;t come from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. I thin kyou are right in suspecting them of coming in sometimes and fuckign a single thread up like it has never been fucked before, but in that case I genuinly doubt that this behavior is the norm  for most conspiratards. Might be because I feel like I fit in, though I usually don&#39;t go over to here for the reason, and the top posts also don&#39;t display that particular teenage-like sentiment. </p>

<p>From my personal vantage point, the posts that actually suffer from conspiratard attention are the conspiracy theories that are milked out and perfectly drab, usually very insulting and generalizing too and just all out poorly worded and argumented. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the more interesting and thought out submissions suffer, in fact I suspect these gems are influenced positively. Even when they might be fringe. </p>

<p>Therefore I don&#39;t think it is fair to say that &#39;all&#39; (which you implied heavily) people of conspiratard are &#39;psychologically damaged&#39;. If the popular stuff on conspiratard was like walking through cringepics, I wouldn&#39;t like it as much, is what I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This follows poes law, so im just going to assume that you are being genuine. I believe that the world we live in now is full of information, some ridiculous, some false, some true and some information is just plain stupid. We have so much information, and a lot of it is complicated. I will probably never have time to dig through half of the content that includes 9/11. Probably loads of reports and different conspiracy ideas. </p>

<p>So, with limited time to actually look through all the data, what should i take at face value? The dude on facebook who makes pictures of red lines pointing to &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;suspicious&quot; activities and is the same dude that will talk about how we got pictures of aliens? Should i trust the media? Or professional investigators? </p>

<p>I would personally trust someone who had a bit more knowledge then simply looking up on the internet, i would trust professionals. The chances that professionals cover up based on ulterior motives are way slimmer then a regular conspiracy theorist  blurting out the first shit they can think of. Just look at 9/11. People claimed that jews were behind 9/11 because &quot;no jews had died&quot;, despite between 270-400 jews died that day....</p>

<p>Its obvious that many conspiracy theorists manage to find conspiracies where there is none or little evidence to support it. It is almost a knee-jerk reaction more then any solid evidence. </p>

<p>So, when a conspiracy theorist looses its shit and starts claiming stuff, it should be well documented. I can say that real conspiracies happen, a conspiracy is usually when a couple of people plan out criminal act or are corrupt. Water-gate and Enron are perfect examples of well documented conspiracies, with Enron going to court and the accusations being proven. Would i believe that CIA tries to give us cancer or that FBI works with aliens or that south america and USA are secretly the same country? No, give me a break. When you got extraordinary evidence i will believe in it, but you don&#39;t, so go home. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off. If you are open to the possibility of being proven wrong, then you cant say that just because someone can earn something on corruption, that it means that they have or would have. Second it is difficult to see how much a report would be altered, or if reporting it in a very wrong view would have meant they met scrutiny, unless we suggest the alteration of the content is a mass conspiracy, which i think with humans being unpredictable and agendas flowing around, would be incredibly difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not done any research on 9/11. I wouldn&#39;t claim to know anything of that case, im simply making the point that conspiracy theories pattern to make a knee jerk conspiracy and expect everyone to suddenly lose their shitis common. And i wouldn&#39;t consider that more valid then what the media would tell you. The point is, a bias for seeing patterns where there are none can be just as much or more unreliable as the medias presentation of anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just dont make the mistake of generalising them all.  That is a big mistake. Some will be as described and all or most mods may have an agenda but a lot of those who post are skeptards who cannot  think for themselves and are manipulated into mockery and setting up strawmen to argue.  Others are drama or concern trolls .  Others are social just warriors there&#39;s a diverse group of participants just as there is here.  I actually think some are fairly rational and accept a lot of what gets discussed here has a basis in fact but a herpderp caricature of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> gets promoted and that caricature is ridiculed.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s where the real problem lies. I for one DON&#39;T believe in: reptilians, no moon landing, holograms on 911 or any shit theories like that. So don&#39;t lump us all together because it makes it look like the crux of your argument is only picking a select few with wild ass theories. Please don&#39;t use a sledgehammer where a scalpel is needed. This goes for both sides. </p>

<p>What a sanctimonious load of cock.</p>

<p>Again with the indignant hyperbole. While I agree that it adds a bit of flair to a debate and can make for a good read, it is not a valid argument in of itself. </p>

<p>The subreddit exists to &#39;troll&#39; (odd choice of words, since they seldom force themselves upon the people in this subreddit, most stay over there) excesses amongst conspiracy theorists. This is easily done by looking at this sub, since it is on reddit too, but it is not the only source. </p>

<p>Even you probably have to agree that a few conspiracy theorists like to jump to conclusions, which is both detrimental to finding out what really happened and somewhat funny. But when these people brand everyone who disagrees slightly as a traitor/shill/whatever, it becomes pretty annoying. And when people get annoyed, they make subreddits. Voila. </p>

<p>In other words, if the community here would keep themselves in check not necessarily with theories but at least with overblown accusations, <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> would move on/die out. </p>

<p>It is as simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the long wait. Shit happened. </p>

<p>Anyways, the specific story you bring up is a very good example on how conspiratard isn&#39;t trying to actively &#39;troll&#39; everyone and everything on here. </p>

<p>If you check conspiratard, you won&#39;t see any posts about the missing plane: the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/top/">top post of the week</a> (at the time of checking) are about an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21bhku/nasa_is_hiding_something_from_us/">inverted earth theory</a> that uses ridiculous evidence, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21mgal/donald_trump_goes_full_jenny_mccarthy/">Donald Trump bashing vaccination because autism</a>, a post mocking not the content but the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21qm81/not_in_the_mainstream_news/">sensationalist headline of a post</a> on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and someone who hates the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21i03n/fck_the_aluminade_xpost_from_rcringepics/">&#39;Alluminade&#39;</a>. </p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21enr1/yes_yes_im_sure_its_not_just_possible_that_people/">another top5 post</a> that makes fun of a theory posted on here probably, but I think the author has a point in doing so: there are a lot of brunettes in America. To top it of, the girls have a very generic face and they are crying: I&#39;d be more suprised if there weren&#39;t any somewhat cute crying brunettes witnessing a disaster in America. </p>

<p>Therefore, I think you are wrong in saying </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sad creatures of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>[1] are psychologically damaged specimens who believe themselves to be champions of objectivity, but are brainwashed dimwits who are unable to think properly for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I was referring to when I was talking about hyperbole. 
Look, I get that you are mad because people on an open internet forum barge in conversations with misinformation due to negligence or intentionally, but I don&#39;t think you can blame this on conspiratard. Judging by the people in this thread, there are lots of people like me on here who subbed to both, and use one for information and the other one for fun. </p>

<p>I thank you for your latest post, it was honest, to the point and had limited anger. </p>
