    <div class="md"><p>I do have a lot of thoughts on the whole star gate theory. I think I could build one if I had an unlimited budget and about 10years to do it (crowd funding anyone? :)    Then that would make it all plausible to me. But when he says shift reality, I think reality is just what you focus on.  Using quantum entanglement to travel large distances quickly would be something different then that. travelling a long distance by bus compared to plane would not be considered a manipulation of time to me. Even though you could philosophize that it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2007, I lived in Chicago with my girlfriend. We had an apartment in the Little Village area, on the second floor of an old brick building. None of this is really relevant, but, it provides a nice image of the location.</p>

<p>I believe it was in May when this occurred. We were sleeping in our bed when I started having really strange dreams. It was as though someone had accessed my memories and was reusing them to create artificial dreams. However, they were not quite accurate or correct. Things felt &quot;off&quot;. Everytime that I&#39;d perceive this, the dream would switch to a new one.</p>

<p>Underneath it all, almost like a subawarneness, I could hear myself telling myself to wake up. The words I remember thinking were: &quot;Wake up. You&#39;re being abducted by aliens.&quot; It was terrifying because the thought would be prevented from emerging completely. I would scream the words, but, I was unable to act upon them.</p>

<p>After three or four dreams, I distinctly remember seeing our bed from above. The clock beside it read 3:05am, and I thought to myself: &quot;Oh no! When I wake up, it&#39;ll still be dark. I&#39;ll be really scared after this, in the darkness.&quot; I was awake before I woke up, is how i describe it.</p>

<p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, 3:05am and I was terrified. Turning to my girlfriend, I shook her awake and said that we&#39;d been abducted by aliens. Since our bedroom was very small, I was about three feet from the doorway leading into the living room. Everything was dark. A horrible fear took over me. It was almost like a post=traumatic fear, where I knew that there was nothing in the adjacent room, yet, I <em>felt</em> their presence still there. I felt the short, gray form in the next room, lingering and watching.</p>

<p>She got up and turned on the light. I told her about what had happened. When I finished, she said: &quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot; After this, she described her own dream of being in a big room, like a basement with stairs leading to another area. There was a big group of people with us in there and a monster hid under the stairs, trying to decide which one of us to take next.</p>

<p>Of course, this could all be the result of a predisposed mindset, sleep paralysis, eerie dreams, and mere coincidence. She sees it thus, since she&#39;s more objective and logic-based. I myself see it as some kind of confirmation of my own experience. We were abducted together. She had her own dream of a big room and a monster taking people. I was aware of what happened, but, a mental block prevented me from doing more than warning myself to wake up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this is the first abduction, nor do I think it was the last, <strong>nor</strong> do I believe it will be the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s nice but you are assuming too much. If you are thinking in that aspect then what parameters are the &quot;aliens&quot; judging upon? Do they see all individual humans and know/judge their actions etc etc. No, that seems a little ridiculous. At least in my opinion, then why even allow these situations/people to exist. Too wasteful ya know. Anyway I believe what you are going towards and what I agree is the best situation/possibility is the book &quot;Contact&quot; by you know who. When we are ready, and collectively reach that point, then we will find the answer. I think this new Nolan movie coming in Nov. will touch upon this, I hope.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These answers are simple.</p>

<p>Aliens from planets in our local star system have been dominating our lives ever since we&#39;ve been walking.
These guys helped us to become who we are now, via evolution. </p>

<p>They have no interest in our planet or the material resources on it.
The Anunnaki are masters of hyper dimensional travel. Do you really think gold means all that much to them? That was rhetorical.</p>

<p>What they do have an interest in has been called gold in the past, interestingly enough. It is our human souls, the spark of the unnameable flame that allows such spiritual transmutation possible.</p>

<p>They have tricked us so much and so badly, few of us remember who they are and what is going on, and those who can see what is happening are ridiculed by stupid people.
The human mind is clouded by amnesia, and it&#39;s like that on purpose. 
Few of us even know what the fuck being a human even means. Few know what matters above all else. </p>

<p>If we all, or close to everything had a spiritual revelation (which is going to happen, very very soon) we would understand what comes along with being a human via activated chakras.
If we were all awake and aware these beings would be thrown off of this rock because we would remember and have the means to make them dissipate. </p>

<p>All of our archetypical figures in religion (Jesus, Horus, Isis, Ra, Marduk, etc.) Pretty much all gods and demigods are these beings.
We put energy into them and we become trapped in their soul net. When we die we go to the places we put energy into, via thoughts and emotion, these are their realms in which they are worshiped as gods. </p>

<p>In this life they have us via material slavery, and even in the next one they have us, via spiritual slavery.
Not everyone deals with this afterlife, but most people do because of lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Break free from the chains of reincarnation, it is the only way out of this place.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All the disclosure project and all that is bs. The ruling elite fund the disclosure project and other things like that, even history channel shows like ancient aliens.</p>

<p>You would be a right and proper fool to think that what the people &quot;in the know&quot; that are in government have anything true or factual to say. True, it may be flattering to hear because fear exists, but it&#39;s only sugar coating things. </p>
