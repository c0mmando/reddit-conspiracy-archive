       Does this famous quote apply to the recent charges against Democratic California State Senators by the FBI, or are California politicians really that much more corrupt than other state politicians, or is it coincidence?

       There is a huge amount of corruption in the selection and deselection of candidates, of course there is. But is it important? Rigged electronic voting machines now determine elections in the US, and this has killed any semblance that the country is a democracy.

       As others have said, you may be disappointed to discover there is very little interest in party politics in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       . This is because virtually nobody here believes the Republican v. Democrat narrative is anything more than an irrelevance - a media show to distract the great unwashed and make people believe they are participating in the selection of their political leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that virtually all politicians in the US owe their positions to corporate donors and are expected to do their bidding. This includes the current President, who is just as much of a puppet as his predecessor, and possibly more so because he appears to have more skeletons in his closet (giving his controllers greater leverage over him).

       100% correct.  Partisan politics is an absolute fiction.  Meant only to divide and conquer.  It worked for quite some time, though that day is drawing to a close.  The masses, not just
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

conspiracy is larger when looking at Republican governors under indictment and investigation.

       My making an openly liberal political comment on a conspiracy post is not equal to
      </p>
      <p>
       a politically partisan post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no objection to politically directed conspiracies.  They do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is about corruption, corruption is not partisan, the only conspiracy is the collusion to commit a crime, bribery. 
Just because all criminal acts involving two or more are a conspiracy, does not mean that r conspiracy is a crime sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a sub devoted to conspiracies within our political, corporate, financial and military organizations, that affect many and most of us, usually directly, sometimes indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will repeat, there are thousands of sites running the joyful news that an anti-gun legislator has been arrested for gun running, I do not disapprove of that, but those sites will not allow conspiracy posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say reddit conspiracy must stick to conspiracy related posts, leave the political dirty laundry washing to strictly politically driven sites.

       The conspiracy here is that a US State Senator conspired to make guns illegal, while simultaneously reaping profits from the illegal trade of banned weapons.  Considering this particular Democrat was at the forefront of California anti gun legislation, this story is more than relevant to the sub...no matter how it may offend your delicate liberal sensibilities, or damage your personal desire to disarm the population.

      <p>
       Perhaps you were unaware but propagandist and shill are pretty similar terms.

       You should always be grateful and it is good you tend to see things from the positive side.  Were I a liberal these days, given everything Obama has done to this country, I would have great difficulty mustering your type of serenity.
