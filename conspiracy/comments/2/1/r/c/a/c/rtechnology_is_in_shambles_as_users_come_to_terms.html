<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfn0q0">I&#39;m sorry but a blanket ban on the word &quot;Tesla&quot; followed by the banning of any user who questioned it, with no response from the mods = you fucked up big time. All the backtracking in the world won&#39;t change that.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfn0q0">This is just a poor attempt at damage control. If the wider community hadn&#39;t found out about this censorship you would have let it continue.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfn0q0">I&#39;m joining the many other users in unsubscribing from /r/technology.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmpar">This was the biggest mistake you made. I don&#39;t think anyone cares about whatever the moderator said, I hadn&#39;t even heard about it until now, but placing a blanket ban on a popular topic is just asking for trouble.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmpar">I understand why you&#39;re understaffed, I just hope you actively try to fix that. All of the default subs desperately need more moderators, especially since a lot of them share the same mods (some of which are inactive). Unfortunately most of them seem to want to keep their small little circlejerk to themselves.</a></p>

<p>When a mod try&#39;s to claim they use automod because they&#39;re &quot;understaffed&quot;;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfm1s3">I don&#39;t think you&#39;re understaffed at all. I help mod /r/Dota2, which gets 2-4 times your daily traffic. Our moderation team of about half your size very rarely has a problem getting to anything promptly. For example, the recent hack to multiple large subreddits was dealt with in under 2 minutes, and four of us discussed the issue on Skype and resolved it in under 5 minutes.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfm1s3">The problem is that you just have a collection of no doubt mostly useless figureheads who are responsible for the moderation of between 25-150 subreddits each. When you&#39;re a moderator so that you can feel self important, not because you have any real passion for the content, it&#39;s long past time to step aside.</a></p>

<p>With regards <a href="/u/agentlame">/u/agentlame</a>&#39;s claims that he was being &quot;witch hunted&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfltrb">Witch-hunted in what way? I hope &quot;witch-hunted&quot; here doesn&#39;t mean, &quot;mocked, ridiculed, and criticised&quot;, because that&#39;s just one of the consequences of making bad decisions.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfltrb">Reddit moderators have thankless unpaid jobs. I get that. But it&#39;s a responsibility, and when they screw up that responsibility and then the communities they moderate object vocally to that, mods shouldn&#39;t publicly sob about it.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">I&#39;m a bit sad about this term, &quot;witch hunt.&quot; Can you shed some light on what you mean when you say it? Here is a dictionary definition to help us out:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">the act of unfairly looking for and punishing people who are accused of having opinions that are believed to be dangerous or evil</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">And here are two potential things that could be construed as witch hunts:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">One is, I said that posts with the word &quot;Tesla&quot; in them were banned, I said that I was banned, and I quoted the explanation of the moderator who did the banning. I refrained from comparisons to fascists and New Jersey governors, and the tossing around of terms like &quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;power trips,&quot; because I thought they were inflammatory, and I wanted to be somewhat even-handed about what happened, even though I was obviously a participant in the story.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">You, /u/qgyh2[4] , and /u/agentlame[5] [-24] have all called this a witch hunt.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">On the other hand, users were banned for submitting posts about, or asking moderators about, Tesla. This really is the totality of the conversation that led to me being banned.[6]  . /u/agentlame[7] [-24] said that I was also banned for submitting two posts about Tesla that didn&#39;t have the word &quot;Tesla&quot; in them, something I did to test the hypothesis that posts with the word &quot;Tesla&quot; in them were banned. I didn&#39;t want to make an unsubstantiated claim to that effect.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">So is publishing what happened a witch hunt, or is the banning of critics a witch hunt?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">Personally, I don&#39;t think the term &quot;witch hunt&quot; should be thrown around by anyone here. It&#39;s unnecessarily inflammatory.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">I&#39;m really not upset about what happened anymore, and I&#39;m happy that I was unbanned, but the reason I&#39;m concerned about the term &quot;witch hunt&quot; is because I&#39;d like to talk about other aspects of /r/technology[8] in the future without being accused of engaging in a witch hunt. I understand not wanting to be in the spotlight, and that moderators are only volunteers, but you did volunteer for this role, and you do have a lot of power as moderators of a default subreddit. We should be able to talk about what happens here. This isn&#39;t Fight Club.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmvbd">I&#39;m glad we&#39;re working this out.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;When a hot topic is in the news for a long period of time, people tend to submit anything related to it, no matter if it&#39;s a repost or not even new information. In these cases, we will often be more harsh in moderating.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/">How is that even your decision to make? If a lot of people are interested in it of course their is going to be a lot of posts about it. If people stop being interested in it they will stop being upvoted. Simple.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/cgfmmzj">I&#39;d like the Mod(s) who caused the stir to be dropped as a moderator(s). They did not use good judgement.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about the &quot;witch hunt.&quot;  Just a few days ago, when the Facebook shill was being (presumably) exposed, one of the mods responded that he was deleting the trail because it was a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big problem if reddit power-mods and admins think that stopping shills is a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;</p>

<p>Can we get some clarification from admins about what users should expect regarding the exposure of shills, and protecting subreddits from shill activity?</p>
