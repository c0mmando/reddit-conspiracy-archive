         I'm sorry but a blanket ban on the word "Tesla" followed by the banning of any user who questioned it, with no response from the mods = you fucked up big time. All the backtracking in the world won't change that.

         This was the biggest mistake you made. I don't think anyone cares about whatever the moderator said, I hadn't even heard about it until now, but placing a blanket ban on a popular topic is just asking for trouble.

         I understand why you're understaffed, I just hope you actively try to fix that. All of the default subs desperately need more moderators, especially since a lot of them share the same mods (some of which are inactive). Unfortunately most of them seem to want to keep their small little circlejerk to themselves.

         I don't think you're understaffed at all. I help mod /r/Dota2, which gets 2-4 times your daily traffic. Our moderation team of about half your size very rarely has a problem getting to anything promptly. For example, the recent hack to multiple large subreddits was dealt with in under 2 minutes, and four of us discussed the issue on Skype and resolved it in under 5 minutes.

         The problem is that you just have a collection of no doubt mostly useless figureheads who are responsible for the moderation of between 25-150 subreddits each. When you're a moderator so that you can feel self important, not because you have any real passion for the content, it's long past time to step aside.

         Witch-hunted in what way? I hope "witch-hunted" here doesn't mean, "mocked, ridiculed, and criticised", because that's just one of the consequences of making bad decisions.

         Reddit moderators have thankless unpaid jobs. I get that. But it's a responsibility, and when they screw up that responsibility and then the communities they moderate object vocally to that, mods shouldn't publicly sob about it.

         I'm a bit sad about this term, "witch hunt." Can you shed some light on what you mean when you say it? Here is a dictionary definition to help us out:

         One is, I said that posts with the word "Tesla" in them were banned, I said that I was banned, and I quoted the explanation of the moderator who did the banning. I refrained from comparisons to fascists and New Jersey governors, and the tossing around of terms like "censorship" and "power trips," because I thought they were inflammatory, and I wanted to be somewhat even-handed about what happened, even though I was obviously a participant in the story.

         You, /u/qgyh2[4] , and /u/agentlame[5] [-24] have all called this a witch hunt.

         On the other hand, users were banned for submitting posts about, or asking moderators about, Tesla. This really is the totality of the conversation that led to me being banned.[6]  . /u/agentlame[7] [-24] said that I was also banned for submitting two posts about Tesla that didn't have the word "Tesla" in them, something I did to test the hypothesis that posts with the word "Tesla" in them were banned. I didn't want to make an unsubstantiated claim to that effect.

         I'm really not upset about what happened anymore, and I'm happy that I was unbanned, but the reason I'm concerned about the term "witch hunt" is because I'd like to talk about other aspects of /r/technology[8] in the future without being accused of engaging in a witch hunt. I understand not wanting to be in the spotlight, and that moderators are only volunteers, but you did volunteer for this role, and you do have a lot of power as moderators of a default subreddit. We should be able to talk about what happens here. This isn't Fight Club.

        How is that even your decision to make? If a lot of people are interested in it of course their is going to be a lot of posts about it. If people stop being interested in it they will stop being upvoted. Simple.

       Interesting about the "witch hunt."  Just a few days ago, when the Facebook shill was being (presumably) exposed, one of the mods responded that he was deleting the trail because it was a "witch hunt."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a big problem if reddit power-mods and admins think that stopping shills is a "witch hunt."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we get some clarification from admins about what users should expect regarding the exposure of shills, and protecting subreddits from shill activity?
