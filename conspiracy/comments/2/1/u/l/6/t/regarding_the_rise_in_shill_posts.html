        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-03-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/cavalierau.html">cavalierau</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A lot of talk has seemed to arise on this sub about conspiracy theory-denying &#39;shill&#39; comments that exist only to discourage other Redditors from agreeing with a certain comment or post. </p>

<p>I believe this is true, and it is something that is happening. But here&#39;s a few things I&#39;d like to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shill posts can work both ways. They can encourage you to believe in a false theory just as easily as they can discourage you to believe in a truthful one. Question all the theories that you read with an equal level of scrutiny as you would anything else. A shill can be an instigator just as easily as they could be a debunker. </p></li>
<li><p>Make at least a minor effort to browse all the informative subreddits you subscribe to by new, rather than hot. Upvotes and downvotes can be easily manipulated, especially on less popular subreddits. The date/time stamp is unrelenting and can&#39;t be tampered with except by an administrator. </p></li>
<li><p>If multiple theories exist on a subject that are conflicting one another, it is up to you to make an informed decision on what you want to believe. For example there are many theories on the recent MH370 flight, and they can&#39;t all be the correct one. Some are more credible than others, and the most logical theory is not always the most popular. </p></li>
<li><p>Always check post and comment histories of users, particularly if they say something that sounds suspect or something receives an unusual amount of upvotes or downvotes. All too often I see strange posts and comments from users who haven&#39;t posted in many months or even years, or from users that have never left AdviceAnimals before today. The more you peruse user history the more you&#39;ll differentiate between what seems like normal activity for a human with a healthy interest in world news and conspiracy theories, and what seems highly suspicious. </p></li>
<li><p>Get to know your subreddit mods. What is their post history like? Are they just or do they have a tendency to abuse their power? Do their world views align with yours, and if they&#39;re different, how so?</p></li>
<li><p>Posts can get deleted from various subreddits. Sometimes for legitimate rule violations, sometimes the author might delete it themselves, or sometimes there might be something more sinister involved. Again, it is up to you what to believe. If you have a rough idea of what the deleted post was about (maybe a broken link took you there), there is nothing stopping you from doing further research on your own. Maybe you&#39;ll discover what the deleted post/comment was all about. </p></li>
<li><p>Always take notice of the website you are sent to when you click a link. Does it have an agenda? Is it owned by a certain company? Does it have a history of providing trustworthy or provable information? If it is an independent site run by one person or a small group of people, who are they? Read their other articles, and read their about page.</p></li>
<li><p>Know what satire is, and know when you&#39;re reading a satirical article on a satirical website. This shouldn&#39;t even need to be said. </p></li>
<li><p>If you are a free thinking human being, vote on posts and vote often. The more real people that make use of the voting system, the louder we are and the more we can drown out the efforts of shill accounts. (Although we should still browse by r/new!)</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>this is known as &quot;herd mentality&quot;, if I recall.
It happens in any community, so yes, all subreddits, all, get &quot;circlejerky&quot;. That&#39;s just human nature.</p>

<p>Just like there are &quot;groups&quot; on reddit that instant downvote anything that even mentions &quot;x&quot; and instant upvote anything that mentions &quot;y&quot;</p>

<p>It this free-thinking? No</p>

<p>Is it smart? As to say, taking one&#39;s own time to become educated on something? No</p>

<p>No, sadly most ppl will take what they are fed by the herd and follow it straight off the cliff.</p>

<p>Mock that, oppose that, do anything but jump, and yes, prepare for downvotes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I don&#39;t believe my &quot;karma&quot; is always the quality of my content (though some of my lamer ducks got what they deserved.), and neither should anyone else who truely wishes to express their God given right to speak thier mind on an issue.</p>

<p>Just remember to keep that mind open, cause someone might know something you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the rule I apply to myself, anyways <sup>.^</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is so much a matter of there being &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>There are people that come here and argue against, for example, 9/11 being an inside job, or the Aurora theater shooting having more than one shooter, or the Boston Marathon bombing being just a bunch of crisis actors, or the Sandy Hook massacre being a staged event, or pharmaceutical companies otherwise ordinarily engaged in trying to bankrupt one another are in reality secretly colluding to prevent the cheap and easy cure for cancer leaking out, or the oil companies who work hard to make sure that tesla generators don&#39;t become household items, or the WHO poisoning people systematically through vaccines with chemicals that will be activated by chemtrails to cause autism, or hundreds and thousands of soldiers with families at home who gladly participate in anti-American operations ranging from highjacking foreign or domestic airplanes and killing all the people on board so that the powers that be will have a vehicle to fly their stolen nuke into New York City creating the impetus for a war with Russia, or the bankers who enter into suicide pacts to protect some pedophile pipelines, or the central banks who have overseen a century of the greatest progress in human history actually being owned by one family who is hell bent on making you sick, fat, broke, brainwashed, uneducated, imprisoned, and impotent.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a reasonable chance that these people aren&#39;t shills, and that they just think that the above opinions are wrong, and that the people who believe that are gullible.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a strawman at all. I don&#39;t think you understand what that actually means. I wasn&#39;t talking to you. But your defensiveness against the comment says a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think people here don&#39;t do it every bit as often?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No i don&#39;t because that&#39;s completely illogical considering the context. We are IN a conspiracy sub. An alternative information sub.</p>

<p>One group attacks alternative information because of the naiveté they recognize in themselves. They want to make what they&#39;ve already accepted as true, true. </p>

<p>The other group actively seeks alternative information because they recognize naiveté in themselves. They want to confirm what they&#39;ve previously accepted as true is actually true. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories often come after an event has been presented by the mainstream. Not before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things are going from bad to worse here, I&#39;m about ready to jump ship. </p>

<p>I&#39;d rather see the mods shut this subreddit down than allow it to become 90% disinformation. </p>

<p>What do people think about turning this into an &quot;approved submitter&quot; subreddit? I&#39;m just brainstorming.</p>

<p>I also liked the idea someone posted that you have to comment in order to vote on a story. I don&#39;t know if reddit&#39;s mod system can do that.</p>

<p>Participation is down here, probably because people are paranoid or just smart enough to start talking about this stuff secretly, not online. Shill activity is rising, it could get to a point where this subreddit is doing more harm than good, despite the mod&#39;s best efforts <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> becomes a parody of itself.</p>
