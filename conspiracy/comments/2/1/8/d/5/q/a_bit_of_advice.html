<p>I suspect it will be a lot like Nazi Germany, and as such, your biggest fear shouldn&#39;t be hunger or dehydration.  No, your biggest fear is the wolf, the snake, and the rat.  The neighbor happy to sell you and your family out so to score extra rations.  The co-worker who wants a promotion.  The teacher who wants a raise.  The soldier who was conditioned to not feel empathy.</p>

<p>Our very enemies will be our community members.  Most will be too confused and terrified to believe anything other than what the TV tells them, and they will think themselves patriotic to have you and your children thrown into a camp for a few extra cans of food.</p>

<p>Be smart.  Hold your tongue.  Form small groups.  If someone seems promising, inspire them to form their own group instead of bringing them into yours.</p>

<p>Play the part.  INFILTRATE.  Get as far into the system as possible, and then bring it down.  Sabotage officers as much as possible, inspire paranoia and discontent within the system as much as possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a rabbit my entire life, and I think it&#39;s about time we are the wolves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>more like &quot;guys who don&#39;t realize becoming a soldier is just going to fuck themselves and others over while being flagrantly dishonest with themselves and buying into complete bullshit and substituting reality for their ideals until eventually that becomes impossible, then they call the consequences PTSD&quot;.</p>

<p>you CANNOT trust people who aren&#39;t honest with themselves or people who would risk their lives/the suffering of their families/supporting the suffering of their friends for a group dedicated to being lied into &quot;wars&quot; by criminals who are never prosecuted, sorry man, you might think of yourself as a good guy and maybe you are, but in my book anyone in the military has a lot of growing up to do, and you can&#39;t count on, depend on, or trust childish people to do anything BUT make the wrong decisions.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t really matter if you&#39;re cold heartless unempathic killing machines, what matters is that you&#39;re even in a group like that or giving away your personal responsibility for your decision making to &quot;superiors&quot; while doing nothing about obvious ongoing criminal enterprises.</p>

<p>Not everyone can just &quot;shrug off&quot; a lifetime of indoctrination and I disagree with your description of the military archetype. On the contrary I believe that the <em>vast majority</em> of human beings who volunteer for any type of law enforcement do so with pure intentions but are completely unprepared for Machiavellian machinations that you and I are all too aware of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but expect everyone turn to the bad side. People will rat you out if they can get some canned goods in exchange to feed their family. </p>

<p>This is why I believe we need to work with each other right away on pushing the idea that we should stick together and should depend on each other. This country has focused too much on competition between individuals (fighting for the same job as an example or school opportunities), and so we need to be re-educated properly about the importance of depending on one another and fighting for the best of the society, rather than for selfish reasons. This is what makes human beings better than animals and it makes no sense for us to devolve and live like animals. </p>

<p>If we are only focusing on sustaining ourselves, then we will only be temporarily avoiding the inevitable. If we put the importance on working together for the greater good and educate people about not thinking in terms of the self... then we will be much more harder to destroy as a resistance. </p>

<p>For all the people asking what we should be doing... we should be arguing less about things that won&#39;t matter soon enough and we should be working on terms that we can all related to - i.e. the importance of depending, caring, supporting, and accepting each other. It is going to be us against them, and you want the &quot;us&quot; to stay united if we stand any chance at all. </p>

<p>There are movement people and network people, both can do things the other can&#39;t.  I am a movement person so I get to be loud as I want.  Network people have to be under the radar but get a lot more freedom of action.  </p>

<p>But you are right, the number one thing to realize that in a disaster (i.e. The Mist, The Road), the majority of people in any area are going to lose it completely, which is to say, the people around us are only a few short steps from murdering you for your shoes.  </p>

<p>Civilization is a thin veneer around here, be wary.  </p>
