       There are a lot of people telling you how to prepare when tshtf, and they all give good advice about stocking canned goods, water, etc, but very few talk about the social preparedness to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect it will be a lot like Nazi Germany, and as such, your biggest fear shouldn't be hunger or dehydration.  No, your biggest fear is the wolf, the snake, and the rat.  The neighbor happy to sell you and your family out so to score extra rations.  The co-worker who wants a promotion.  The teacher who wants a raise.  The soldier who was conditioned to not feel empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our very enemies will be our community members.  Most will be too confused and terrified to believe anything other than what the TV tells them, and they will think themselves patriotic to have you and your children thrown into a camp for a few extra cans of food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be smart.  Hold your tongue.  Form small groups.  If someone seems promising, inspire them to form their own group instead of bringing them into yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Play the part.  INFILTRATE.  Get as far into the system as possible, and then bring it down.  Sabotage officers as much as possible, inspire paranoia and discontent within the system as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been a rabbit my entire life, and I think it's about time we are the wolves.

       You're definitely right about us soldiers. I, along with literally every other soldier are brainwashed into hating human beings. We're cold heartless killing machines and actually eat babies in our spare time. Congratulations on figuring us out.

       more like "guys who don't realize becoming a soldier is just going to fuck themselves and others over while being flagrantly dishonest with themselves and buying into complete bullshit and substituting reality for their ideals until eventually that becomes impossible, then they call the consequences PTSD".
      </p>
      <p>
       you CANNOT trust people who aren't honest with themselves or people who would risk their lives/the suffering of their families/supporting the suffering of their friends for a group dedicated to being lied into "wars" by criminals who are never prosecuted, sorry man, you might think of yourself as a good guy and maybe you are, but in my book anyone in the military has a lot of growing up to do, and you can't count on, depend on, or trust childish people to do anything BUT make the wrong decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesn't really matter if you're cold heartless unempathic killing machines, what matters is that you're even in a group like that or giving away your personal responsibility for your decision making to "superiors" while doing nothing about obvious ongoing criminal enterprises.

       From the moment we emerge from the womb we're exposed to propaganda. The good guys always win and the United States is the greatest country in the world. It isn't perfect but by golly we do our best.

       Not everyone can just "shrug off" a lifetime of indoctrination and I disagree with your description of the military archetype. On the contrary I believe that the
       <em>
        vast majority
       </em>
       of human beings who volunteer for any type of law enforcement do so with pure intentions but are completely unprepared for Machiavellian machinations that you and I are all too aware of.

       There are good people who are soldiers, police officers, politicians, and CEOs. There are also bad people who fill those roles. In a situation where people are rounded up, they didn't send the bakers and tailors to round them up, it was the millitary/police.

       Yes, but expect everyone turn to the bad side. People will rat you out if they can get some canned goods in exchange to feed their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I believe we need to work with each other right away on pushing the idea that we should stick together and should depend on each other. This country has focused too much on competition between individuals (fighting for the same job as an example or school opportunities), and so we need to be re-educated properly about the importance of depending on one another and fighting for the best of the society, rather than for selfish reasons. This is what makes human beings better than animals and it makes no sense for us to devolve and live like animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are only focusing on sustaining ourselves, then we will only be temporarily avoiding the inevitable. If we put the importance on working together for the greater good and educate people about not thinking in terms of the self... then we will be much more harder to destroy as a resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the people asking what we should be doing... we should be arguing less about things that won't matter soon enough and we should be working on terms that we can all related to - i.e. the importance of depending, caring, supporting, and accepting each other. It is going to be us against them, and you want the "us" to stay united if we stand any chance at all.

       Oh I agree 100%, I just wanted to say that since it seems some people believe by default, if there is one good soldier or one bad soldier, the group as a whole are either good or bad and will discount the situation based on that. What you're describing is the only way to overcome our situation

       I think veterans might be more able to think for themselves since they no longer have to "obey orders" and have to think for themselves if it is worth doing. I am not sure but at least that's what I would like to believe.

       That is subjective and your opinion. I disagree. The thread is constructive but your commment was not. You simply insulted the message while providing no way to better it.

       I love your spirit, but they want us to go full honey badger.  That will give them legal reason to call us terrorists and kill us.

       We must be smart.  Please try to focus your energy on ways to outsmart them.  If you take this war to the streets, they will slaughter you.

       There are movement people and network people, both can do things the other can't.  I am a movement person so I get to be loud as I want.  Network people have to be under the radar but get a lot more freedom of action.

       But you are right, the number one thing to realize that in a disaster (i.e. The Mist, The Road), the majority of people in any area are going to lose it completely, which is to say, the people around us are only a few short steps from murdering you for your shoes.

       I disagree somewhat strongly. This is the kind of resistance that they've been working on combating with the surveillance network. This is the dissent that can be defeated quietly piecemeal because the people are terrified to voice their opinion in public, the opposition has been divided a thousand different ways.

       We need to get down to Washington with 100,000 people and fuck free speech zones this time. Need to force their hand, force them to start cracking down on dissenters. I'll take the nightstick but I don't want to take it alone.

       Yeah camps would absolutely be broken up and if you refuse to leave you might get beaten or thrown in jail, it seems like a recipe for defeat but actually a propaganda victory for the good guys. I think forcing them to act is better than hiding from them. That's why I'm still here, making public comments on this subreddit.

       No one will believe you. Everyone will either believe that you are enemy or that they have far too much to lose by standing up with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       People already hesistate to speak up because they don't want to sound weird in front of their friends, and you do get alienated in social circles if you speak about conspiracies. If a good guy is killed on the streets, most of the people will believe that he is a bad person because the propaganda will make them believe it is true. If you stand for him, you become another possible terrorist.

       Monkey see monkey do.   Who cares what they believe.  Especially where I live people are very passive but if they see someone doing something they will do it too.   example, crossing a red light.

      <p>
       I'd never convince you it was safe in principle to cross a red light, but then you won't even think and follow me across when I do it.  This happens all the time.

       I know what I say sounds "out there"...but please hear me.  If the military rolls into your neighborhood, please be smart.  If you try to "be a patriot" they will kill you.

       the military already rolled into my neighborhood.  they were kettling people around the corner -  people were run over by horses, and thousands arrested under fake laws.

       I say the same to the military.   don't try to be a patriot and kill us.  you saw what happened in Ukraine when protestors get shot..  you get to change governments, kick out the cronies and put your own goons in.

       I know what I say sounds "out there"...but please hear me.  If the military rolls into your neighborhood, please be smart.  If you try to "be a patriot" they will kill you.

       Be smart.  Think.  You can work the system against them.  It's not just about you, and you're no good to us dead.

       Yeah camps would absolutely be broken up and if you refuse to leave you might get beaten or thrown in jail, it seems like a recipe for defeat but actually a propaganda victory for the good guys. I think forcing them to act is better than hiding from them. That's why I'm still here, making public comments on this subreddit.

       No one will believe you. Everyone will either believe that you are enemy or that they have far too much to lose by standing up with you.

       People already hesistate to speak up because they don't want to sound weird in front of their friends, and you do get alienated in social circles if you speak about conspiracies. If a good guy is killed on the streets, most of the people will believe that he is a bad person because the propaganda will make them believe it is true. If you stand for him, you become another possible terrorist.
