       The propaganda war is rampant from both pro-russia and pro-west outlets. And people are eating up all of it, mainly the pro-west sentiment on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is the top comments sprinkled in accusing only Russia of propaganda.

       Even anarchists like myself use Propaganda.
       <strong>
        We have to
       </strong>
       is the problem, because agit-prop can be used by governments to destabilize regimes they dislike but anarchists use agit-prop all the time; we fight fire with fire but when the world is burning no one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-Russian propoganda is easy to see when you realize all nation-states are power-mad and still hungry. Russia wants the Ukraine to avoid losing face in global diplomacy to the EU; The EU is a liberal economy that needs to expand in order to grow faster (higher numbers = better score). The USA wants to expand NATO
       <strong>
        even though they promised the Russians they wouldn't
       </strong>
       .

       Governments lie, governments omit half the truth and if it's in their favor they'll tell you it later. However
       <strong>
        Russia is not the USSR
       </strong>
       ! Russia is a regional power with ICBMs (and must be treated as such). The USSR was a boogeyman to NATO, but now it's gone; The Peoples Republic of China is due to be the worlds largest economy in this century, and no longer will the USA be able to use its economic might alone to have a hegemony over the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Propaganda is legal in the USA is a moot point because
       <strong>
        It's been going on for decades
       </strong>
       and now as the Iron Curtain falls and access to the internet allows everyone huge amounts of geopolitical information we find
       <em>
        propaganda isn't enough
       </em>
       to justify the military-industrial complex. Perhaps we must ask ourselves if propaganda  can be used to justify the prison-industrial complex instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, I dunno. One thing is clear: Russia signed an agreement with the USA and UK about the Ukraine.
      </p>

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances is a political agreement signed in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994, providing security assurances by its signatories relating to Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers, the Russian Federation, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine as well as those of Belarus and Kazakhstan. As a result Ukraine gave up the world's third largest nuclear weapons stockpile between 1994 and 1996.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, the U.S. and U.K. both separately stated that Russian involvement is in breach of its obligations to Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum, and in clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A prominent Russian politician has proposed dividing Ukraine along the lines of an infamous Nazi-Soviet pact and suggested that regions in Western Ukraine hold referendums on breaking away from Kiev.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a letter sent to the governments of Poland, Romania and Hungary, Vladimir Zhirinovsky also suggested those countries hold referendums on incorporating the regions into their territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zhirinovsky, whose nationalist Liberal Democratic party largely backs President Vladimir Putin in the Russian parliament, sent the letter as Russia annexed the Crimea region of southern Ukraine last week.

       I mean, ever since "just say no", it seems like they have been conducting quite a bit of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the actual law being referred to was changed to allow web streaming of the "Voice of America" program.  It's mission is to provide an independent and objective source of news and information in parts of the world where it can be hard to come by.  (For example, in countries without an independent media, and real propaganda,
       <em>
        cough, cough
       </em>
       )   It has standards for sources and verifiability and only broadcasts news that meets those standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people wanted to have access to it from within the USA.  It is not being broadcast, they simply opened up the web steaming so that people here can see what we are saying over there, and people from over there that are now here, and would like to keep listening have an option to.

       It's going the same way with vaccines too, they don't want people to be allowed to post studies showing how dangerous they are and how the autoimmune diseases they causes skyrocket Big Pharma profits.
