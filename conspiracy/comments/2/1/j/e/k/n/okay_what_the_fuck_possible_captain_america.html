<p>Talking about bringing German soldiers to America to work for them, trying to instill a &quot;New World Order&quot; by Hydra etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s anything, and I probably am just making some wild assumptions but you really can&#39;t put a mind that notices these things to sleep, I just find it strange. Anyway, good movie, totally should see it!</p>

<p>Edit: As soon as I heard that New World Order reference and having to kill off a mass population to assert protection as well as saying stuff such as &quot;The people need to give up their freedom willingly&quot; and &quot;We&#39;re so close that the people will give up their freedom for protection&quot; etc.</p>

<p>It sorta weirded me out, I hope you understand where I&#39;m coming from, the propaganda is real hah!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s primarily why movies like that are made, even some television shows.</p>

<p>It gets the subconscious mind made adjusted and familiar with these ideas and themes, interestingly enough some of them are real world issues we unfortunately face in today&#39;s age.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t put so much thought into their blatant and poor attempt of  propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you liked the film however, I cannot wait for the new Avengers!</p>

Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>If you want to expand upon what you are able to do I would recommended opening up your chakras. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly wish I could help you upon your quest for understanding, but I do not know the video you seek to find. I am sorry.</p>

<p>However, once you pick up on this <em>awareness</em> you can easily begin to piece together the meaning that is <em>in between the lines</em>.</p>

<p>Most films serve as esoteric symbolism that can only be understood by those who have the means to see the meaning.</p>

<p>I am glad you are beginning to see things for what they are, not what they appear to be.</p>

<p>Good luck unto your quest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of.  So in a hypothetical scenario, god powers, bla bla; how do you &quot;rule.&quot;  The answer is puppeteering through the shadows.  You are the ultimate ruler, so you <strong>CAN&#39;T PAINT A TARGET ON YOURSELF</strong> You make enough powerful ppl, and people hate/love them, usually hate unless they are getting something out of it.  This works if you want to be a benevolent ruler, you esentially control the &quot;lesser beings&quot; into helping the many, and it will piss some off, but generally work out.</p>

<p>My point is, ruling in secret is more potent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What confuses me is that so many people here think that the plot points in Winter Soldier are &quot;Propaganda&quot; from the man, to condition the &quot;Muricans to accept a surveillance state. Did you miss the point in the movie where Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon work to DESTROY this horrible apparatus of tyranny and how this is portrayed as a very bad way of governance. Or did I miss an alternate version that OP saw that implies the &quot;Operation: Insight&quot; plot point is acceptable and cool for any society. As in the recent Robocop reboot, the use of drones was used as a plot point to say to the masses what a bad thing that CAN BE! A lot of people in this sub make ZERO sense as some of you are not as much critical thinkers as you like to pretend to be.</p>
