        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the biggest media organizations here in Finland ran a story with the headline &quot;What is happening in United States? Childrens autism is growing in numbers fast&quot;.</p>

<p>In the story it said that in 2012 an estimated 1 out of 88 children had autism, when a new report shows that it is now 1 out of 68. It also mentioned that no one knows why, and it has especially affected the kids with a higher IQ.</p>

<p>That is an incredibly huge leap in numbers and in just two years. Any americans here that have speculated this and come to a conclusion? I dont think theres a situation like this anywhere else in the world, it must be something that the US population are the only ones in the world consuming. What is it?</p>

<p><strong>Under freedom of information (Simpsonwood), the CDC discussed that study and said it showed that vaccines did cause Autism, they kept massaging the figures, manipulating statistics until it wasn&#39;t so obvious.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s a peer-reviewed study which shows that vaccines can cause autoimmune disease</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Systemic autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of over-stimulating the host&#39;s immune ‘system’ by repeated immunization with antigen, to the levels that surpass system&#39;s self-organized criticality.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Doctor Tenpenny is one of the world&#39;s leading safety vaccine experts, here she explains the Risks V Benefits of every vaccine in the schedule. Turns out the risks by far exceed the benefit, however that suits the pharmaceuticals as they profit from vaccine damage which generally leaves people dependent on drugs for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if my words will reach too many people but I married in to a family of educators just last year.  My wife(nearly complete with her masters) is a 6th grade math teacher, my sister-in-law is a speech pathologist(special ed), mother-in-law(masters) is a &quot;home economics&quot; (the term has changed) teacher, and my father-in-law(masters) teaches science at the high school and college level.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of theories that talk about why autism is on the rise in the US and I just wanted to point out that my family often tells me that the largest reason why autism is on the is on the rise is because of the diagnosis of autism.  </p>

<p>&quot;40 years ago, we wrote these kids off as weird and different.  Today we have a term for it.&quot;</p>

<p>-Over 90 years of combined opinions from 4 different public educators, including 1 special education teacher.  </p>

<p>Not sure if anyone feels this holds water, I am just conveying an opinion from people who work in the public education system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a hard source for this, and this may not be the case for everywhere in the U.S., but I know someone who works for the local county school board as a child psychologist. She said that, in this county alone in the last few years, the number of boys labeled as autistic has sky rocketed. In her opinion, after seeing how quickly elementary schools label these boys for, well, acting like little, easily distracted boys, that it&#39;s because of money. At least in this particular county, schools get, like, $100 dollars per mental problem per student. Often, they&#39;ll say, &quot;Oh, your kid is on the autism spectrum, has some speech problems, and his handwriting is bad, so he needs to work on his fine motor skills.&quot; That&#39;s three disabilities on one child&#39;s record. They put him in the according therapies, and they get $300 extra from the county for that kid. The typical elementary school in this area has around 2,500 kids; if, say, a quarter have only one disability each, then that school gets an extra $62,500 added to their budget. </p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t have any hard evidence for this, other than talking to someone who works at the school board as a psychologist and what she has experienced in the last several years. I do not also know if this is happening necessarily outside of this particular area, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did. Either way, you&#39;ll want to take this with a grain of salt until I or anyone else has stronger evidence.</p>

<p>EDIT: TL;DR: My understanding is that it gets diagnosed here so often because of money. </p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, I didn&#39;t clarify, that extra $100 per disability per child is given every month. It&#39;s not a one-time monetary grant, if I recall correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall (again, I&#39;m not trained in psychology---one college course several years ago certainly does not count for much of anything), the school&#39;s resident psychologist would evaluate the child&#39;s inability to focus on the conversation at hand---because there was, like, a toy present in the evaluation room---as a sign of their being on the spectrum. I guess it&#39;s because they took it as a sign for the social unresponsiveness associated with autism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question, and I would hope that they didn&#39;t. My field is in higher education, and I&#39;ve learned after &quot;going under the hood&quot; that school is a shady business all around. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about psychologists, but even college professors fudge the crap out of numbers to protect their job security. Students can be downright idiots (e.g., I get emails every semester from <em>university</em> students saying that they lack the reading comprehension skills to take a quiz on the Constitution, no joke), but too many teachers will just give them an A for the sake of job security. <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/03/whistleblower-says-this-148-word-paper-earned-a-unc-athlete-an-a-minus/">Did you see that A- paper from UNC that spread onto the Internet today?</a> That A- was possible because athletes = money, and school administrators love money. No self-respecting educator would allow this, but, at the same time, the job market sucks for profs right now and people need to eat. </p>

<p>If an educator can be brought into such shadiness by administrative pressure, I imagine any other school employee could. This, of course, is just speculation colored by my experience, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that autism is a spectrum, so there may be room for a generous &quot;diagnosis&quot; on the mild end, but that the serious cases of autism are also rising dramatically.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>There has been a similar thing with diabetes, I believe.  Diabetes is real, but they redefined the standards for diagnosing it some years ago I think so that people get diagnosed much more easily nowadays.  So when people say that diabetes cases are on the rise, I want them to give normalized numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could also be that autism rates have stayed steady for the most part and we have just gotten better at diagnosing or recognizing different aspects of the spectrum. I feel like ADHD is often over diagnosed among boys but not for girls. Btw ADHD is a real disorder that is attributed to dopamine shortage. It is usually along with compulsive behaviour aswell as problems dealing with emotions</p>

They might rule the world or maybe just rule a piece of paper, but I don&#39;t give a shit as long as they are compassionate and happy.</p>

<p>People think autism is a disorder because they don&#39;t understand it. They try to figure out who or what caused it, what environmental thing they can blame for their child&#39;s deviation from neurotypical.</p>

<p>The fact is that humanity is colorful. It takes different strokes coming together to make the full picture. Just because you&#39;re &quot;normal&quot; and don&#39;t understand is no reason to think somebody else is broken. Please, be patient with your fellow beings.

    <div class="md"><p>I have a daughter on the autism spectrum.  She is 20 and should be in college now.  We didn&#39;t find out until she was a 5th grader.  If you saw her, you wouldn&#39;t think she was unusual, except she&#39;s not a girly-girl, but neither am I.  It&#39;s her inability to organize, her inability to socialize normally (our whole family is introverted so we don&#39;t really socialize much), her inability to succeed in school due to the way school is set up.  Even though she had an IEP, it still didn&#39;t work out well for her.<br/>
I was highly stressed mentally while I was pregnant with her, but lots of women are stressed during pregnancy.  I ate right, didn&#39;t drink, I exercised, everything you are supposed to do.  She was a month early, but still OK to go home on the normal schedule.  She did cry all the time, and I mean all-the-freaking-time until she was about 6 months old, and I didn&#39;t get much sleep then.  After that she was pretty normal until about 2nd grade.<br/>
My 2nd 2 kids are normal.  Believe me, I have been wondering why all her life.  I hope it is discovered, because it&#39;s just an unpleasant thing for her to live with.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s not in college now.  I want her to get out and do something productive with her life, but when I have to write down how to make meatloaf every 2 weeks so she can fix us dinner, I get a little discouraged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, wealthy individuals have children later in life than less wealthy individuals.</p>

<p>In fact the <em>very</em> poor have great access to healthcare through a program to Medicaid.  Medicaid pays for just about everything and anything you could need vis-a-vis health.  The only people who have better access to care are people with cadillac health insurance plans, typically union workers, and of course the very wealthy.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s an interesting spread of access.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You cannot say that with any certainty, and not with any scientific proof. It may be a factor, but certainly not the only factor.</p>

<p>Also, parental age and wealth are directly correlated. Wealthy individuals wait longer to have children, so maybe it&#39;s not the age, but something in the lifestyle that helps to trigger autism more often in these families.</p>

<p>Personally, I think autism is triggered by a combination of environmental factors. But at the crux of it is exposure to modern, toxic elements in the environment, diet, and medicines. This is why autism is so prevalent and increasing in American society, which is the most drugged and eats the most toxic food of any society on Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such comparisons show large recent increases in rates of autism and autistic spectrum disorders in both the U.S. and the U.K. Reported rates of autism in the United States increased from &lt; 3 per 10,000 children in the 1970s to &gt; 30 per 10,000 children in the 1990s, a 10-fold increase. In the United Kingdom, autism rates rose from &lt; 10 per 10,000 in the 1980s to roughly 30 per 10,000 in the 1990s. Reported rates for the full spectrum of autistic disorders rose from the 5 to 10 per 10,000 range to the 50 to 80 per 10,000 range in the two countries. A precautionary approach suggests that the rising incidence of autism should be a matter of urgent public concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there&#39;s <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hghr/online/autism-on-the-rise-a-global-perspective/">this.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While ASD is increasing globally overall, however, many developing countries are reporting significantly lower rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the disease is almost certainly related to post industrial society. It has to be vaccines. I&#39;m thinking maybe it&#39;s having needle prick at such an early age can be traumatizing to some children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post!  There are studies showing that the children who regress into Autism after vaccines have an autoimmune disease in their gut, this then stops food from being properly digested and the correct nutrients can&#39;t be supplied to the brain, so the root of Regressive Autism is the gut disease which is started by the triple vaccines.  The gut disease can be improved by cutting out dairy and gluten; the brain then starts to improve to an extent as long as the diet is kept to.</p>

<p>How is the gut disease started?  Think about it this way, the MMR is a triple live virus vaccine, that means concurrent live infections.  The CDC currently recommends Tylenol (Paracetamol) for use after vaccination, this suppresses the immune system, so you&#39;ve got a triple concurrent infection and your immune system is being suppressed, it&#39;s no wonder that things will go wrong and diseases will be triggered when these crazy scenarios are regularly induced.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a peer-reviewed study which shows that vaccines can cause autoimmune disease </p>

<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008382">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008382</a></p>

<p>&quot;Systemic autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of over-stimulating the host&#39;s immune ‘system’ by repeated immunization with antigen, to the levels that surpass system&#39;s self-organized criticality.&quot;</p>

<p>If we go back to Andrew Wakefield, he was one of the world&#39;s top experts in the gut, that&#39;s why he got involved, he realized that it would be safer to go for single vaccines so he recommended them and also recommended more studies into the MMR vaccine.  However the pharmaceuticals weren&#39;t going to roll over and lose their incredibly profitable Autism industry without a fight, so they sent a hit-man after him to smear him and manufacture lies, his name is Brian Deer, he was paid a huge sum of money by Big Pharma to destroy Wakefield&#39;s reputation using whatever dirty tactic necessary.  To this day Wakefield is still fighting his case, he&#39;s an honest man who puts children first, he used to be pro-vaccine at the time of his initial study, however now he&#39;s had time to research in depth and so is aware that there are huge gaps and concerns in the science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people mock youtube? Youtube is merely a video hosting service. You may as well be mocking the medium of film, motion pictures, videos etc. </p>

<p>Its not the technology, its how people use it.</p>

<p>For example, we know that some people engage in &quot;sexting&quot; but we wouldn&#39;t say that text messaging is inherently sexual.</p>

<p>We could mock any form of media there is. TV. Radio. Newspapers. Its not really about radio tech or satellite tech or printing press tech, its about your ability to think critically and discern truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr Peter Fletcher, former UK Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health said (regarding MMR/Autism):-</p>

<p>&quot;it is the steady accumulation of evidence, from a number of respected universities, teaching hospitals and laboratories around the world, that matters here. There&#39;s far too much to ignore. Yet government health authorities are, it seems, more than happy to do so.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;the refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;There are very powerful people in positions of great authority in Britain and elsewhere who have staked their reputations and careers on the safety of MMR and they are willing to do almost anything to protect themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>&quot;Clinical and scientific data is steadily accumulating that the live measles virus in MMR can cause brain, gut and immune system damage in a subset of vulnerable children,&quot;</p>
