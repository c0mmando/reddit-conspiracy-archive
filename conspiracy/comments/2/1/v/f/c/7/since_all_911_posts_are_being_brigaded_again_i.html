<p><strong>QUESTION: The Secret Service knew about the incoming plane for the last 30 minutes, was following on radar, had the means to shoot it down, and should have done so in order to protect the Capital, but they didn&#39;t. Why?</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: In regards to the exchange between Cheney and the &quot;young man&quot;, can you suggest anything different from an order not to shoot down the plane as it was approaching Washington&#39;s protected airspace?</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that, according to the Pentagon Building Performance Report, &quot;<a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">the aircraft frame most certainly was destroyed before it had traveled a distance that approximately equaled the length of the aircraft (p. 40)</a>&quot;, and that &quot;it is highly unlikely that any significant portion of the fuselage could have retained structural integrity at this point in its travel (p. 40)&quot;, can you explain what caused the most perfectly round exit hole in the outer wall of the C-Ring?</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the maximum fluctuation between the two cameras would translate in a difference of 25 feet in the position of the plane, can you provide a valid explanation for the large discrepancy between the two corresponding frames (23:19)? Absent a valid explanation for this discrepancy, we must conclude that at least one of the two frames is the result of intentional manipulation, or &quot;photoshopping&quot;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain how most of an airplane weighing 100 tons could end up buried deep underground in a hole that closed itself up before the first responders arrived? (31:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since the plane was carrying 8 to 10,000 gallons of fuel at the time of impact, can you explain why there is no plume of black smoke raising from the ground after the initial explosion? (34:45)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since the plane is supposed to have hit the ground in one piece, can you explain how it was possible for debris to be found 6 to 8 miles from the crash site on a day when only a light breeze was blowing? (37:16)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Since they were only 20 minutes away from Washington and for almost 6 minutes the passengers had been unable to enter the cockpit, why didn&#39;t the hijackers continue flying towards the Capital? (43:25)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Even if they thought they couldn&#39;t make it to Washington, why didn&#39;t they try to crash the plane onto a small town nearby? Why crash the plane in an empty field where they knew they could not kill any more victims than those who were already on the plane with them? (43:30)</strong></p>

<p><strong>The &quot;Sagging Trusses&quot; Theory: Problem - 1. No proof of insulation &quot;widely dislodged&quot;. 2. No proof of temperatures above 250ºC (480ºF) (1:10:58)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the fireproofing from the steel trusses was &quot;widely dislodged&quot; by the impact of the planes, which NIST has made a necessary condition for the collapses to be caused by fire? (1:14:48)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you provide any evidence that the temperatures in the Twin Towers were high enough, and lasted long enough, to seriously weaken steel in the areas where the initial collapses occurred? (1:14:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can explain how a sagging truss weakened by heat could pull and eventually break apart the structure it is attached to with no external force being applied to it? (1:15:00)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that &quot;the building section above came down essentially in freefall&quot; (Source: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017">NIST NCSTAR1 - p. 146</a>); given that for freefall to occur no supporting structure must be present; and given that the falling sections did not have any extra energy to destroy the structure below, can you suggest anything different from some kind of demolition for the removal of the supporting structure which was necessary for near freefall speed to be achieved?

<p><strong>INTERESTING FACTS: 1. Major elevators renovation. 2. Heavy equipment moved on empty floors. 3. Bomb sniffing dogs removed. 4. Unprecedented power down (first time in 30 years) (4:31)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fuel in elevator shafts theory: 1. No regular elevators from top to bottom. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/pVMNxRD.jpg">Diagram 1</a> | <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NIYVGa6.jpg">Diagram 2</a>) 2. Personnel not cremated by &quot;fireball&quot;. 3. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wcm2W7Q.jpg">Volumes not considered</a> (15:41)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that after the initial explosion and the ensuing fires there wouldn&#39;t have been enough jet fuel left to pour down the elevator shafts in substantial quantities, can you explain the at least three separate explosions reported by multiple witnesses at the time of the first impact in the North Tower? (29:16)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: In particular, can you explain the huge explosion reported by multiple witnesses in the basement of the North Tower moments before the impact of the plane? (29:31)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the huge explosion that literally devastated the lobby of the North Tower, according to multiple witnesses, about one hour after the impact of the plane and before the collapse of Tower Two? (29:40)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the big explosion reported by Mr. Jennings and Mr. Hess on the 8th floor of Building 7, before either tower had collapsed? (29:51)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain what caused the multiple explosions recorded by different camera crews including the BBC and CNN, after the towers had collapsed and before the collapse of Building 7? (30:00)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you explain how more than 100 witnesses, most of them firefighters and policemen, could have all &quot;been mistaken&quot; in reporting explosions at the WTC? (30:15)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that what we see is clearly not glass from a broken window but concrete and debris, can you explain what caused the squibs observed 30-40 floors below the level of collapse? (32:45)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the falling, upper sections of the towers had no additional energy to destroy the healthy structure below, where did the energy to hurdle these large chunks of structure at such a distance from the towers come from? (37:39)</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. I never got around to watching the ad. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve seen is a reawakening of the 9/11 truth movement over the last year. I think it&#39;s directly related to the Snowden leaks constantly adding to the public&#39;s already growing distrust of the government.</p>

<p>As more people started questioning the official story, the propaganda efforts had to be scaled up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he said explosives, but no explosives were used.</p>

<p>The ACTUAL EVIDENCE is Thermite/Thermate residue, meaning that Thermite/Thermate cut charges were used, which are not explosives.</p>

<p>It may sound like semantical nitpicking, but it absolutely is not, saying explosives is literally wrong, and TPTB want you to say explosives so you look stupid to people who believe the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible without explosives, stop saying explosives because none were used, they would have left seisemic and audio evidence which could be matched with the video footage.</p>

<p>They used Thermite/Thermate Cut charges, they do NOT explode, they cut whatever line they&#39;re shaped to cut, be it a foot long straight line or a 5 inch long half circle, if you can shape it, you can cut it.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Stop saying explosives, it&#39;s disinfo that they want you to say because it was really Thermite/Thermate cut charges.</p>

<p>I hear this a lot from people who used to be propaganda zombies or self-proclaimed skeptics. They &quot;knew&quot; there was probably a certain amount of &quot;shady stuff&quot; going on. They &quot;knew&quot; politicians were corrupt. But, they &quot;never thought&quot;... about a lot of things. It&#39;s that whole &quot;not thinking&quot; thing that seems to be a huge obstacle for some people to overcome.</p>

<p>Among a large number of conspirators surely at least a few would have no family to be concerned about and enough human emotion to not want to sit on their secret role in the murder of 3,000 people.</p>

<p>Even if there was operational separation in such an operation, all that becomes quite irrelevant the moment the towers collapse. At that point anyone who was involved but unaware of the bigger picture will immediately realize their part in it. </p>

<p>Everywhere you look in most conspiracy theories there are many people at the periphery who would be aware that they were being controlled, exploited or manipulated. Look at the &quot;pull it&quot; quote - allegedly said to an FDNY chief who would certainly be aware of what was happening. The premature BBC report about WTC7 - everyone in the newsroom and the shooting crew would have known it to be unusual if they were being fed a script from outside their usual channels.</p>

<p>Any of those people could come forward with their role. None have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you are overestimating the nature of the conspiracy here. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the media got a memo stating &quot;we&#39;re secretly blowing up the WTC - here&#39;s what to say, but keep it all hush hush, and only say it in this order&quot; and someone fucked up. I don&#39;t think anyone in the media knew what was going to happen. </p>

<p>In that situation, media gets most of their info from government people, like FBI spokespeople for instance. In the case of WTC 7, there may have been a few people in key places who knew what was going to happen. At some point, one of them thought it had already happened when it had not, and accidentally passed it on to a reporter. That&#39;s a possibility. Another possibility is that it was just a random mistake that coincidentally came true (as any debunker would claim). That BBC report is just one of those &quot;huh?&quot; things that make you want to look into it. It wasn&#39;t like everyone at BBC was sitting around with a script, asking &quot;can we read the part about WTC 7 falling down yet?&quot; It&#39;s not concrete evidence that anyone knew early, it&#39;s just a thing that sticks out because it&#39;s so bizarre. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s no one in the media that could &quot;come forward&quot;. No one could say anything that isn&#39;t already known because of the broadcast. If it actually was a case of leaked info, the person who was &quot;in the know&quot; would have been the FBI spokesperson or whoever gave the reporter info too early. But that person likely wouldn&#39;t be doing anything but passing on info from a source higher up also, so even they weren&#39;t a knowing participant. What&#39;s possible is that there was <em>one</em> person with foreknowledge trying to control some of what was going out - like trying to spread rumors that the fires inside 7 were really bad and causing the structure to weaken. And that got turned into &quot;WTC 7 fell&quot; through miscommunication. </p>

<p>Imagine that Larry Silverstein knew it was going to come down by demolition. Surely he had friends who worked there. So he may have told one of them that it was going to come down <em>because of fire</em>, so they needed to GTFO. That person then told others. And the word got around, and &quot;WTC 7 is going to fall down&quot; became &quot;WTC is falling down,&quot; and finally &quot;WTC 7 has fallen down&quot;. Remember, people are running around scared for their lives here. It would be easy for statements to get altered going from one source to another (which I think is the debunker explanation for the BBC report). </p>

<p>As far as &quot;pull it&quot; goes, I don&#39;t think that was really a command to blow the building, I think it was out of context most likely, or misheard. But it&#39;s something people jump onto because it seems sketchy, it would fit well with some kind of grand conspiracy with thousands of people involved. It&#39;s another thing where you want to look into it, but it&#39;s not proof of anything in and of itself. If any of the NYPD knew parts of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, I would think there would be <em>one</em> person, and they probably would only have limited info. A plausible scenario would be that the Chief was told that they were doing impromptu demolition to limit damage to other buildings, and to save more lives - but all because of terrorists hitting WTC with a plane caused damage that was eventually going to spread and cause even more damage. But that he has to keep it on the DL because it&#39;s likely a few people would die - acceptable losses considering that many more would die if they didn&#39;t do it, yada yada. And later it&#39;s sold to him as just that, but he still can&#39;t say anything because it would look bad. And just to make sure, if you <em>do</em> say something, you&#39;ll lose your job. So all he thinks he&#39;s covering up is an emergency measure that did more good than harm. I don&#39;t think there is anyone who really thinks that they were a part of something evil - people just won&#39;t consider that, they want to think they did the right thing. </p>

<p>I hope it made sense how I explained things. That there is a way for nefarious deeds to be pulled off while the players don&#39;t really know what is going on, even after the fact. That it could have been an &quot;inside job&quot; without legions of people knowing that. Only a very few people would know the truth, people who were part of the plotting. Loose ends can be cleaned up with blackmail, extortion, and murder. </p>

<p>Oh, and Snowden is a very rare exception. How many people in addition to Snowden knew what was going on and <em>didn&#39;t</em> come forward, or were ignored or silenced before getting word out? Even he had to resort to extreme measures to protect himself. And he was in a unique position to be able to plan his leak really well ahead of time, collecting proof all along the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course they can. But once that endgame is revealed (ie. the towers collapse killing thousands) they are likely to become aware of what they were involved in.</p>

<p>In that case it seems even <em>more</em> likely they&#39;d speak out. They may feel used and manipulated. Whereas if all parties were fully informed and aware they would not be caught off guard or struck with unexpected guilt later.</p>

<p>So if you were a security contractor mysteriously ordered off your post at the WTC (as some conspiracy theories claim), or you were an Air Force maintenance technician tasked with rigging two 767s with remote flight capabilities, then you would likely realise what you&#39;d been part of on the morning of 9/11 - it was not something you signed up for, not something that served a purpose you agreed with... </p>

<p>If you start to get into the more dramatic claims (no planes, no victims, FDNY involvement) then the list of the uninformed and unconsenting conspirators gets substantially larger. And that overlooks the people who must have been actively aware of what was going on - military personnel who fired a cruise missile at the Pentagon, people who scattered aircraft parts on the lawn, those who planted aircraft debris in Manhattan, those at NIST and elsewhere who apparently created false reports.</p>

<p>Why does it have to be in reference to demolishing the building, however?</p>

<p>I bet you he was telling the FDNY Chief to &quot;pull it&quot; as in &quot;pull back your men, it&#39;s too far gone&quot;.</p>

<p>Why would the FDNY Chief &quot;be aware of what&#39;s going on&quot; if he&#39;s simply being told to stop trying to save the building? As far as he&#39;s aware, it&#39;s on fucking fire and it&#39;s his job to put it out.</p>

<p>The premature BBC report could be tossed up to misinformation. &quot;We didn&#39;t mean to say WTC7, it was a mistake, simple as that.&quot;</p>

<p>Reporters and Journalists and Newsroom people get mixed up info all the time that they have to redact, that&#39;s why they always preface anything they say with &quot;We&#39;re reporting&quot; because that means that they are merely reporting information, not stating that any of it is true or not, just being reported.</p>

<p>In general of you look at many of the ideas they require that many people involved either were actively a part of some aspect (rigging explosives in towers for example) or would have been aware that they were being directed to do things in a strange way (various members of the air force for example). </p>

<p>Depending on which aspects of the various theories you buy into there has to be at least hundreds of people who have personal knowledge that what happened wasn&#39;t as it has been reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijackers have taken over planes in the past with such tools. What used to happen in hijackings was that the hijackers took hostages to negotiate / make demands. Usually when people meant to attack aircraft they would plant bombs. There are some cases of hijckers attempting to use planes as weapons as well. Why is it so odd that people took over plane with box cutters anyways? You can severely injure if not kill someone with one if they get too close. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so easy for a lone hijacker but if he has 2 or 3 buddies then it&#39;s much harder for people to subdue them all, though most likely people were thinking it was a hostage situation and they thought if they stayed calm they would land the plane and make demands and not purposefully crash it. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings">List of airplane hijackings</a></p>

<p>Interesting cases:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>September 29, 1988: a man hijacked a VASP Boeing 737-300 registration PP-SNT operating flight 375 en route from Belo Horizonte-Pampulha to Rio de Janeiro. He wanted to force a crash on the Palácio do Planalto, the official presidential workplace in Brasília. The pilot convinced the hijacker to divert to Goiânia where an emergency landing was made. The hijack ended with 1 victim.</p>

<p>1994: FedEx Flight 705 experienced an attempted hijack by disgruntled employee Auburn Calloway as it left Memphis, Tennessee, with the intention of using it as a cruise missile against FedEx HQ. He was subdued by the flight crew before an emergency landing back at Memphis.</p>

<p>December 24, 1994: Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked from Algiers by four GIA hijackers planning to crash into the Eiffel Tower in central Paris. After the murder of 3 passengers, GIGN commandos stormed the plane in Marseilles, killing all hijackers and freeing all passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hijackers have attempted to use planes as weapons in the past and sometimes even lone hijackers have taken control of aircraft. But I guess believing the government did it all with months if not years of planning and thousands of people involved is more plausible? </p>

<p>Why do people think it&#39;s easier to fly a plane through a difficult manoeuvre remotely, than it would be actually sitting in the seat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not the claim he made.  He said the hijacker had marginal pilot skills at best, and it was highly unlikely he would have been able to pull of the maneuvers that were documented.  In this instance, the more plausible answer is that the plane/drone/missile which hit the Pentagon was remote piloted/controlled.  Whether remote piloting a 757 is easier (for a random pilot), than piloting a 757 is irrelevant regarding 9/11.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bull Shit. Remote control is THE most plausible and reasonable deduction when taking into account WHO was supposedly flying the plane. The so called hijackers were documented as not having the ability to fly a simulator... simple conclusion.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t necessarily flown remotely by a human pilot...it could easily have been brought to location by GPS guidance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...you&#39;re going to lose everyone&#39;s belief,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So...tell them something besides the truth? I am not worried the least bit if you or anyone else believes me. Remote control makes the most sense...who are you to designate &quot;The Realm of Plausibility?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple people who spoke out about 9/11 and started raising the alarm early. However, Fox News, CNN, NBC, et al did not cover these &quot;whistle blowers&quot;, they covered the &quot;official narrative&quot;. </p>

<p>IF you are so concerned about answers, watch the video linked in this post. It will clear up your doubts real quick. </p>

<p>Look, we all know this is hard to accept, and frankly no one wants to accept it. However, if this was to be tried in a court of law today, you would be hard pressed to find an independent jury that would convict those 19 hijackers---beyond a reasonable doubt, with this crime. The evidence just does not point to them.</p>

<p>The hijackers did not have the means--they could not even fly a Cessna, hell half the the &quot;pilots&quot; had never even been in the cockpit of a 757. </p>

<p>The hijackers had motive--if you consider them all insane--and do insane people come up with plans this complex, let alone carry them out?</p>

<p>And, al-Qaeda certainly did not benefit from this attack. So, who did benefit?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which side of a topic you are on if you use those things I mentioned above then your entire viewpoint has no solid foundation.   You have not done any of these things, so when you do get around to it I hopen I am fortunate enough to see it.</p>

<p>I personally find this documentary VERY convincing.   It makes far more sense than the Official Conspiracy Theory.    A lot of people miss the distinction that the &quot;official story&quot; is simply itself a theory about people conspiring to an act.   It&#39;d take a time machine to make it more than a theory.   As with ANY theory they should be challenged.   If they fail in even one point then the theory is not sound, and should be questioned.   The official conspiracy theory fails in many points.   Thus, people seek the truth.   We can only get so far without a time machine and/or a lot of confessions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will get people like you described in any discussion area.   It just happens more often here than some places than others because, it can be very uncomfortable topics that challenge world views.   The only place it would probably be worse is if you went to r/pick_religion and started trying to debunk their religion.    It is not that bad here because, contrary to popular belief most truth seekers are not dogmatic.   They just expect rational, logical, and truly scientific explanations to counter points of what they are talking about.   Some people are not capable of this from either the conspiracy theorist side, or the debunker side.   It is human nature.   If we can educate more people hopefully we can kill off that trait.</p>

<p>I believe a lot of conspiracy theories are viable.  I also believe some are crap.   I consider myself a truth seeker rather than a conspiracy theorist.   Some of my friends would label me a conspiracy theorist because I believe the official 9/11 story has holes all over the place.  I think a lot of the other theories do as well, but others I think have less holes.</p>

<p>The interesting thing people forget though is that the official theory is also a &quot;theory&quot; that a panel allegedly came up with to explain the events of that day.   They couldn&#39;t stand inside the towers and watch it, etc.   It also refers to the conspiracy of the terrorists to hijack the planes.   That means even the official story is a conspiracy theory.   Thus, could we not ALL be labeled with the derogatory term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; when we present any theory about what happened on 9/11?</p>

<p>Propaganda has kind of conditioned that phrase as a buzz word to shut people down, and end arguments.   That is not rational, or reasonable.   It is certainly not scientific, and it does not indicate victory in a debate.</p>

<p>Conspiritard is another term like that.   I am of the opinion that anyone that has to belittle, name call, mock, etc you to try to prove their point is incapable of proving anything.   You cannot convince anyone of anything by calling them names or mocking them.   Unless you are trying to convince them you are an ass...</p>

<p>So now the really challenging thing for you.   It can be really hard (and I fail at times too) but try not to sink to that level.   Be civil... as you have been so far.   If someone is not civil to you try to make a token attempt to bring it back to civility... if it doesn&#39;t work... move on.  That person is not worth your effort.</p>

<p>That does not mean your time was wasted.   Someone like me may have been lurking and found meaning in what you had to say.  If I happen to be around and paying attention I will try to defend people I think are unjustly attacked by the dominant faction of any particular subreddit.   I don&#39;t often have the time... but, if I do I totally respect someones right to disagree with me... as long as they keep it civil.   Those are actually the greatest opportunity to learn, and to teach.   This can sometimes be onesided and often it is mutual.</p>

<p>Anyway... hang in there.   Keep your mind open.   Even on uncomfortable topics.   Ask questions...   examine data with a rational, logical mind, rather than emotional... and you and I will ALWAYS get along whether we come to the same conclusions or not.</p>

<p>I appreciate you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post and summary. Nice work.</p>

<p>The most important question of all, however, is WHO BENEFITS?, and I believe that it is THIS question that drives the &quot;debunkers&quot; to obsessively work in their coordinated efforts to ridicule, defame and marginalize anyone who questions the the &quot;official version&quot;.</p>

<p>So who DID benefit from 9/11? Did Osama and Al Qaeda benefit? Did Saddam benefit? What about the Saudis? Did they benefit? If so, how?</p>

<p>Whose interests were served - not necessarily in the attack itself, but in the world&#39;s reaction in the aftermath?</p>

<p>Given the benefit of hindsight, I think we would do well to examine which groups seem to be the most devoted to attacking any reexamination of these events, as it would seem that these folks have a vested interest in preserving the false &quot;history&quot; that has been adopted and sanctioned by the Powers that Be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is my take on this situation. Most people fail to realize that when planning any strategic operation the goal is to not look short term, rather in the long term. So in a sense I do not believe that the 9/11 attack was used to get us after Osama, or Saddam, that is small picture stuff we could have done with some minor planning. (Also, if we wanted to get a person why would we tell them we are coming after them? Seems odd to me.) Now my thinking is this, look at this on the long term geopolitical spectrum. Think of the wars as being the movement of chess pieces. We (meaning the western world) have bumped heads with nations such as Iran since the late 60&#39;s. We now have them surrounded by our own little campaigns. Not to mention that, but we also have created coalition forces to pretty much back us up against them if things were to arise. That is one area to look at. Also, think about the role Israel could have played by having some of the greatest supporters to the Palestinians and hezbollah taken care of, just another angle.</p>

<p>The second is creating a new fear. Look at the growth and ability for politics and politicians to make anything seem like a rational choice when we have something or someone to fear. When the government creates a boogyman they can create excuses why certain unreasonable things should be done. Things such as the Patriot act would seem ultra horrible if it had not been done in the name of catching terrorists.</p>

<p>Then there is the money side of things, creating wars by the big banks and companies to make more profit. I have heard tons of different stories about insurance policies and who had what to gain from war, etc. My point being that there are many different possibilities and I think that there are any number of reasons for something like 9/11 to be staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im talking about a capture or kill mission. The US did not enter the war until it was well under way. Also, Hitler started the war by invading the Sudetenland and other European nations, we did not. However, if we re trying to find a sole man somewhere in a cave, who is known to be a flight risk, and has no nation where he remains, that is illogical. Another point to add is at the time of the beginning campaign, we did not call it a &quot;war&quot;, it was an operation so there was no need to declare war. </p>

<p>Obviously they would distribute to those areas as they&#39;re directly next to the source, and distribution from that point is insanely easy when it comes to denying your involvement, because you just pay off the poor locals to transport it and shit.</p>

All of the evidence (even the official story that was presented in the 9-11 report) suggests that the US was either incompetent or complicit on 9-11-2001.  I think the true conspiracy occurred after the attacks.  Our government decided to make the evidence fit the narrative they wanted to push so that we could get into Iraq.</p>

<p>That the US government knew a major terrorist attack was going to take place, and allowed it to happen (although it&#39;s likely they didn&#39;t know the exact nature of the targets) in order to justify and push through certain pre-made plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His comment pointed out that most of us don&#39;t think it was an inside job, we think the government was either incompetent, or complicit in the sense they where aware of a pending attack and let it happen regardless. A lot of evidence points in this direction such as Tom Daschle admitting on video that both Cheney and Bush asked him not to investigate 9/11 at all. Why would you not want to have an investigation into the largest terrorist attack to ever occur on US soil? The only logical explaination in my mind, and I imagine in most skeptics minds too, was that they where trying to keep something hidden. Once the public demanded an investigation it was one of the worst funded and time limited investigations to ever take place given the scope of the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to disagree. Prescott Bush was the first Bush to get into the &quot;club&quot;, he married into it, and then helped the Nazi regime rise to power--the Bush family is powerful--but maybe just front men. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if personal speculation about who did it is really even the point. Nearly everyone here can agree that the way it happened is not the way we were told it happened. So, why? Why is someone working to hide the truth? I think the people who think it happened differently than we were told mostly just want the truth to come out, they care much less about trying to place blame on someone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not personally invested in any ideas about the involvement of any particular groups of people. I don&#39;t know who did it or why, and I imagine that if we ever find out the whole truth, it would be way stranger than any of us guessed. I just look at the evidence and it pisses me off that someone thinks we are all so stupid. I want to know the truth about what happened, the motive, the logistics, the planning, the ultimate goal. I want to know why we were lied to. I&#39;m not trying to pin it on anyone in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several smoking guns. And the motivation is complex, many parts of it discussed in the film - like why the WTC was the target. It was prime real estate poised to lose a shit ton of money from asbestos removal. </p>

<p>But the main point of the film wasn&#39;t to analyze the motivations. It is to point out inconsistencies in the &quot;official&quot; story, so that people will be motivated to call for truth. Analyzing the motivation behind the crimes is kind of a step two - first you have to show that a crime was committed. </p>

<p>No one knows every single detail of the what&#39;s and the who&#39;s and the why&#39;s, because of active cover up by those involved. That&#39;s why we <em>want</em> to know the truth. So that we can catch and punish the real criminals, and right the wrongs. But we can&#39;t know every detail of the conspiracy if no one questions the cover up. Just because this film doesn&#39;t uncover every single fact about what really happened doesn&#39;t mean that the facts it does uncover are false. The complexities of the motivations can only become clear after we first show unravel the lies protecting those motivations. The official version fails to hold up to scrutiny, so we need to have a full investigation backed by the people of the world. An independent film maker can&#39;t uncover the entire story of a very complex crime that happened with the protection of the most powerful people in the world by himself. But he has shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the official version(s) is(are) false. </p>

<p>What we <em>do</em> know, and that this film exposes, is that what we have been <em>told</em> happened cannot possibly be what did happen. That in itself is worthy of outrage and further investigation. </p>

<p>What we can say for sure is that a group of Middle Eastern small time religious fanatics did not carry out a devastating attack on the US without help from anyone inside the US power structure. </p>

<p>There is proof of a cover up. Lots of proof. Facts changed, pictures photoshopped, evidence destroyed and hidden. </p>

<p><strong>But if you want motivation, here are a few:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>WTC to be demolished and rebuilt at a huge profit (including insurance money) instead of a huge loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so that incredible profit could be made by the entities that make money off of those wars (Halliburton, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Emergency&quot; powers granted to the government that bypass constitutional guarantees, to give those in power more power.</p></li>
<li><p>Justifying increases to spending on the military-industrial complex. </p></li>
<li><p>Bush family personal revenge against Saddam.</p></li>
<li><p>Caches of gold and silver to be stolen from vaults underneath the WTC.</p></li>
<li><p>Distraction from other crimes and political shenanigans, like the $2.3 trillion fuck up in military spending Rumsfeld had to confess on 9/10/2001.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So money and power, those are the motivations. Just like with most all high crimes and acts of war. </p>

<p>WTC 7 is pretty fucking far from a smoking gun. The vast majority of the scientific world do not find a problem with the &quot;official story&quot; regarding WTC 7. There are plenty of sources going into great detail about how it collapsed, but Myles Power has a good, quick video going over it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheney calling off the shoot down of 77</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t that not anywhere near a confirmed fact? Pretty much everything I can find seems to indicate that he did not, in fact, order the attack to &quot;stand down&quot;. People seem to claim that Norman Mineta&#39;s account verifies the idea that Cheney ordered the fighters to &quot;stand down&quot;, but when you look at the actual documents, it really seems to indicate the exact opposite.</p>

<p>WTC temperatures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, seriously? I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re referring to the claim that the temperatures weren&#39;t hot enough to melt steel. The fact that truthers still repeat this as though it hasn&#39;t been thoroughly torn to shreds amazes me. Anyone who had done even a few minutes of research would at the very least be aware that the steel doesn&#39;t need to actually melt for the structure to collapse, it just needs to be significantly weakened.</p>

<p>You can get plenty of information here: </p>

<p>Alexa Graf, an AT&amp;T spokesperson, said it was almost a fluke that the calls reached their destinations.[3] Marvin Sirbu, professor of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University said on September 14, 2001, that &quot;The fact of the matter is that cell phones can work in almost all phases of a commercial flight.&quot;[5] Other industry experts said that it is possible to use cell phones with varying degrees of success during the ascent and descent of commercial airline flights.[5]</p>

<p>If it were impossible, though, what would be the point in lying about it? There would be tons of people in the public well aware that it was impossible, and it&#39;s a fairly minor part of the whole story. They&#39;d have to be incredibly stupid to lie about something like that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to be a bit more specific here. Are you claiming that the security camera stills are photoshopped? Can you tell by the pixels?</p>

<p>The idea that the Pentagon was not actually hit by an airplane is pretty silly. Not only are the claims that the shape of the hole is inconsistent with an airplane ridiculous, but many, many people saw the plane. Here is a site that discusses the witnesses that they could locate: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/911pentagonflight77evidencesummary:">https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/911pentagonflight77evidencesummary:</a></p>

<p>From the lists above, 136 people saw the plane approach the Pentagon, and 104 directly saw the plane hit the Pentagon. 6 were nearly hit by the plane in front of the Pentagon. Several others were within 100-200 feet of the impact. 26 mentioned that it was an American Airlines jet. 39 others mentioned that it was a large jet/commercial airliner. . . . </p>

<p>Killtown,
I am certainly aware of people like yourself who believe that those of us who suffered on 9/11 must be part of some giant plot, either as dupes or plotters. I was in the Pentagon when the plane hit, I held parts of that aircraft in my hands, covered with fuel and oil, and I helped with the triage area. I helped a guy with a headwound, aided ambulances coming in, and suffer to this day with ongoing nightmares on a very regular basis. When one has seen what I saw, and had to do what I had to do, the images, the smells, the sounds, resonate in your mind forever.</p>

<p>I do not object to your desire to dispute the facts of that day. While I feel you are hopelessly naive and silly, that is your right. But please know that your page on the Pentagon crash is deeply offensive to the survivors such as myself. Again, it&#39;s not that you argue. But your tone is one of mocking, of making light of the greatest suffering I ever saw in my 25 years of military service. Your fake &quot;quotes,&quot; your quips, all mock the pain of those of us that were there, and served that day. I am very likely one of the people in some of your photographs, and I assure you our thoughts were not about the grass (a silly claim you make, by the way), but were deeply, intensely worried about the people hurt, the people left inside. I will never forget that day, and while I can forgive your foolishness in not understanding the facts, the science, the reality of that day, I find it much harder to forgive your willingness to laugh at those who were so terribly hurt that day. Such an attitude shows you to be a cruel and heartless person, in addition to silly one.</p>

<p>There are no two ways about it.</p>

<p>It is a physical impossibility for every single core column to have completely failed at precisely the same instant, allowing the building to literally float to the ground. Yes, float. It had zero structural support and thus hit free-fall speeds, something PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE with ANY amount of resistance, besides the fact that the building&#39;s structure was barely damaged before the collapse.</p>

<p>The claim that WTC 7 fell at free fall speeds is a flat out lie. It fell about 40% slower than free fall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</p>

<p>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</p>

<p>Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p>

<p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—<em>was due primarily to Stage 1</em>, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTC7 mysteriously imploded and fell to the ground in an astounding 6.5 seconds.</p>

<p>6.5 seconds. This is a mere 0.5 seconds more than freefall in a vacuum. To restate this, a rock dropped from the 47th floor would have taken at least 6 seconds to hit the ground. WTC7, in its entirety, fell to the earth in 6.5 seconds.</p>

<p>There is a method that has been able to consistently get skyscrapers to fall as fast as the three buildings of the World Trade Center fell on 9-11. In this method, each floor of a building is destroyed at just the moment the floor above is about to strike it. Thus, the floors fall simultaneously – and in virtual freefall. This method, when precisely used, has indeed given near-freefall speed to demolitions of buildings all over the world in the past few decades. This method could have brought down WTC7 in 6.5 seconds. This method is called controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Apparently you don&#39;t know what &quot;in a vacuum&quot; means. We&#39;re not in a vacuum on earth.</p>

<p>You also happened to cut off the section you copied right before a key phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.</strong> In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>

<p>Notice how it doesn&#39;t say &quot;This is consistent with a controlled demolition model&quot;? It&#39;s because it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Why is it, do you think, that the <em>vast majority</em> of scientists around the world (yes, this includes architects and engineers) don&#39;t buy the controlled demolition theory? Do you think that the government has paid off almost the entire scientific community? Have they all been outsmarted by a bunch of amateurs? Are they all just stupid?</p>

<p>And what about the people who setup the demolition? Not only would it take a large team, it would have to be done in total secrecy, without raising any suspicion from anyone working in the building. How do you choose someone for the job? You&#39;d need people who have zero morals qualms with killing innocent people, yet have the integrity not to turn on you after the fact (coming forward with evidence about this would make you both rich, and world renowned as a hero... they could hardly just have you killed for coming out, it would just confirm your accusations).</p>

<p>It really just makes no sense.</p>

<p>I found it, but all it does is tells the NIST story of what happened. There&#39;s no scientific evidence shown for why that could have happened. The closest he gets is saying in what order the columns supposedly collapsed. But that building was built so that many columns could be removed and the remaining ones still support the structure. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t explain how the fire could get hot enough to cause steel columns to give, when office fires don&#39;t get nearly hot enough to do that. </p>

<p>You mean when you read the documents that were prepared to support the official story? Of course they make it sound like that. I&#39;m talking about primary sources, like Mineta himself, or Cheney&#39;s statements which don&#39;t fit any of the &quot;official&quot; timeline. When you read the official reports, you&#39;re only reading what has been sanitized to support what they want to say happened. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re referring to the claim that the temperatures weren&#39;t hot enough to melt steel.</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m referring to the fact that there was molten steel visible in many images and videos of the WTC, but airplane fuel and office fires cannot create enough heat to melt steel. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the long cell phone calls supposedly made from the plane while it was at 30,000 feet. The plane is too high and moving too fast for the calls to switch antennas, yet one call went on for over 18:00, I think?</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to be a bit more specific here. Are you claiming that the security camera stills are photoshopped? Can you tell by the pixels?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t, but a computer can. Every frame from the two security cameras match exactly <em>except for the one the plane is supposedly captured in</em>. The theory isn&#39;t that no plane hit the Pentagon, it&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t AA77. It was a military aircraft painted to look like an AA jet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll finish with this open letter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does it matter if a survivor dislikes the tone of some blogger I&#39;ve never heard of? </p>

<p>Why is it that people can readily believe that <em>other</em> governments routinely lie and commit crimes, and even that <em>our</em> government did so in the distant past, but to analyze and question what a government that openly condones torturing people who haven&#39;t even been give a trial, that is mocking the people who died?</p>

<p>What is offensive to the people who died, is when politicians use those deaths to justify their personal agenda. When they use their deaths to justify constitutional violations and war crime. </p>

<p>Say for a second that the official story of 9/11 is completely true. Even if that is the case, the appalling incompetence of those in charge that day should warrant punishment. Instead, those involved in what the debunkers call the &quot;incompetence theory&quot; were all rewarded with promotions shortly afterwards. In addition to that, 9/11 was used as justification to invade another country and create secret prisons where people (including children down to 7 years old) are tortured without <em>ever</em> being proved guilty - well, except for torture induced statements. </p>

<p>So even if the official story of 9/11 was completely accurate and true (which it clearly can&#39;t be because there are internal contradictions), then the people who are being offensive to the victims&#39; memories aren&#39;t the people who want every single bit of truth to come out, it&#39;s the people who bend the story so as to use it for personal gain.</p>

<p>Our government has shown over and over that it is willing to lie, that catching and blaming someone quickly is more important than making sure that the ones caught and punished are actually the ones who did it. The upper echelons of government have proven over and over again that the fates of citizens are less important to them than career advancement and gaining power. </p>

<p>These are the exact same people who told you that they had absolute proof that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11, and when evidence leaked that that was a lie, said they had absolute proof that he was hiding weapons of mass destruction. </p>

<p>These are the same people who gave no-bid contracts to their own companies. The same people that clearly did not give a shit about the people of New Orleans during the flooding. People who condone and encourage torturing people <em>to death</em> who haven&#39;t been given a fair trial. I do not understand how demanding the truth from them equates to mocking the people who many feel are victims of their abuse of power. </p>

<p>If there are no problems in the official account, why has so much evidence been hidden and destroyed? </p>

<p>Based on what? Some nonsense you&#39;ve read on a conspiracy website? Office fires don&#39;t <em>normally</em> do that. Under extreme circumstances, there&#39;s no reason to believe they can&#39;t unless you&#39;re ignoring possibilities.</p>

<p>I mean <strong>the only documents we have</strong>. The idea that Cheney ordered a &quot;stand down&quot; is based on a pretty bizarre interpretation of those documents. The only reason to interpret them that was is if it&#39;s your agenda to try and justify the idea that Cheney is somehow responsible. I liked directly to this information.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about? I&#39;ve never heard of anyone beyond the nuttiest right wing rednecks, who claimed that criticizing the Bush administration was &quot;mocking&quot; the victims of 9/11. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an enormous difference between lying or misrepresenting real information... and actively slaughtering thousands of your own people in a massive and insanely risky venture that requires literally thousands of people to carry out. Do you seriously think that the thousands of people needed to pull of 9/11 would just keep their mouths shut? That the <em>best</em> evidence that would come to light would be the lame things you listed?</p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t get away with lying about the fact that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim about a dictator in a secretive foreign nation, and yet they breezily seem to get away with lying about 9/11, without <em>any</em> solid or conclusive evidence?</p>

<p>You go on to talk about a lot of mostly valid criticisms that you&#39;ll find most of the people who oppose the inanity of the &quot;truthers&quot; totally agree with. It seems like you don&#39;t have the slightest clue who you&#39;re arguing with.</p>

<p>completely destabilize the economy for the next two decades (at least)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The people who orchestrated the conspiracy did not have their personal economies destabilized. Just look at Haliburton&#39;s stock value before 9/11 compared to a couple of years later - and that doesn&#39;t even include the money that didn&#39;t go to the stockholders, the &quot;dirty&quot; money. Since 9/11, the rich have become much richer and the poor much poorer. Those people do not care if the masses can&#39;t put dinner on the table.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>would you want to be GWB for the past 13 years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GWB was not at all a 9/11 mastermind. He participated because he was a pawn of Cheney and Rumsfeld and others, really including his father. He&#39;s a drunk frat boy who does what he is told, at best. And the defining characteristic of corrupt people is that they don&#39;t care what people think if they get away with it and profit. They <em>definitely</em> could care less about some innocent people getting killed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and spend 15 years at war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Years and years at war is <em>exactly</em> what they wanted. We&#39;re talking about the very people who sell war - executives from companies whose sole products are the hardware and logistics of war. They would have us at war indefinitely, if the could (and it looks like they can). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>vilified by the press</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ensure a two term presidency for a black liberal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They care who became prez after they finished? Shit, those guys basically retired. They&#39;re happy to have a Democrat come clean up their mess and try to re-stabilize the world economy they crashed (and take much of the blame for it as well). By the end of the Bush administration, they had done everything they set out to do and the fallout had already begun (the banking crisis). They were glad to get the fuck out of Dodge and enjoy their new trillions and unprecedented power. Let some liberal deal with &quot;fixing&quot; it. If you read Cheney and Rumsfeld&#39;s past writings, 9/11 and the aftermath was the culmination of everything they had worked for their entire lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a creationist? Do you believe that since we do not know the answer to how the universe came to be then it must be intelligent design? You are making this exact same argument. Because you cannot see a motivation, then it must not have happened. </p>

<p>Have you ever thought to consider, that maybe the motivation is not something you would ever understand? That there are things going on in the world that are so far occluded from the public so as to not make sense when explained? Is this not remotely possible to you? Are you all seeing? All knowing? </p>

<p>Just like with the Big Bang, as with any theory, there are possibilities. We cannot have a definitive answer, in the case of 9/11, the most powerful government in the world has worked very hard, flexed all their muscle with arms in secret intelligence, online misinformation ops, and the media to occlude facts from us. </p>

<p>With this information hidden, it is difficult to ascertain a true defining motive, as I said earlier maybe the motive is not something we can grasp at the current time. However, what we CAN do is look at what has been presented to us, what we have seen, what we know and question it, test it, understand it. If we do this, and realise there are holes in that story, then we have every right to ask more questions until we find the truth. </p>

<p>If there were no holes, if there were no glaringly obvious events that happened which defied basic laws of physics then we wouldn&#39;t need to ask these questions.</p>

<p>Sadly, for humanity as a whole, there are, and we must ask these questions. It is out duty as members of human civilisation to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I answered the question, you ignored it and then you said: &quot;So WTC 7 caused 9/11. Got it.&quot; This is not using critical thinking that is just crazy. </p>

<p>I will say it again, try to process the entire concept, ok...</p>

<p>Look at pics of WTC 3 and 4 on 9/15/2001, those buildings had to be torn down manually, but WTC7 just collapsed. A security building holding the mayors and governors situation rooms as well as all the corporate investigations, such as Enron. But again WTC3 and 4 were hit by plane debris directly, had worse fires than 7. They were also hit by the falling 1 and 2. But your going to tell me that 3 and 4 withstood initial debris impacts, fires, 110 stories falling right on top of them, but 7 dropped in free fall speed, beginning at the central column, 3 hours after the BBC said it collapsed. So, yes you are retarded.  </p>

<p>This is reality:

<p>Look at 7, neatly tucked BEHIND a still standing 4. That sure was a weak building to be holding so much valuable stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement is completely off base. And you are pulling BS distractionary tactics. Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s motivation is irrelevant to the discussion, he was following orders. He is but a single player in a chorus. But the fact he announced the Pentagon was missing a TRILLON fucking DOLLARS on 9/10/01 is just yet another coincidence right? </p>

<p>The fact you still see in left and right means you don&#39;t have an understanding of what is going on. How is Obama a liberal? He used Romney&#39;s Healthcare plan, extended the patriot act, signed as many executive orders as Bush, Kept Gbay open, Continues on the same foreign policy as before, raised the number of drone attacks 10 fold, and prosecutes whistleblowers. Liberal?? LOL</p>

And there&#39;s not enough jet fuel to burn the building... but flight 93&#39;s crash had not enough burning fuel when first responders arrived... etc)</p></li>

<p>To hear you conspiracy nuts talk about it, these buildings were built like fort knox to withstand atomic blasts, the cockpit doors were bank vaults, steel designed to be as light as possible can withstand an oxygen stoked jet fuel fire unscathed, and kinetic energy can never be deflected.</p>

<p>This is just the moon landing bullshit all over again. Either it&#39;s the most perfectly executed hoax of all time requiring thousands of people to keep this secret, even upon their death beds.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, what happened was <em>prior</em> to the NIST report, around 2,000 architects and engineers (which is actually a pretty small number, considering how many architects and engineers there are in the world) signed a petition saying that they felt further investigation was needed. Saying that is the same thing as &quot;coming out against the official story and organizing&quot; is pretty dishonest.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that many thousands more &quot;architects and engineers&quot; think the truther movement is stupid is certainly staying willfully blind and deaf (notice how I don&#39;t include &quot;dumb&quot;, as that means unable to speak, and the way you used it makes zero sense).</p>

<p>Keep in mind, of course, that the Discovery Institute were also able to compile a large list of scientists who were &quot;critical of Darwinism&quot; (plenty of whom were not biologists, and had zero expertise in the topic).

<p>What is it with the lack of proper punctuation around here? When something is a question, you put a question mark at the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>First of all, I&#39;m not from the US, and second, assuming that anyone who doesn&#39;t believe that the government carried out 9/11 doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re some kind of blind patriot. That&#39;s like thinking anyone who denies the existence of martian colonies believes that it&#39;s impossible for there to be any extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Why do you think people like Noam Chomsky, highly respected academics who are extremely critical of the government, calling out blatantly illegal and immoral actions, also think that the truther movement is stupid?</p>

<p>Yes, one is geared towards the evidence leading to a conclusion and the other is finding what &#39;evidence&#39; can fit their paranoid world view. You think of those hundreds of thousands, how many are Muslims that are shocked to believe that someone could do this over their own religion?  Yet they accept it.  What of the thousands who aren&#39;t American and don&#39;t even need to think that it was their own govt?  Why do you think this is such a weighty decision?  Govts are disliked throughout the world, it&#39;s not like anyone worships the govt, Bush is one of the most hated men of the last few hundred years. Or maybe they have actually looked at the evidence and found that the truth movements science is incorrect and biased.</p>

<p>For someone who is naturally paranoid delusional, it&#39;s obvious that the govt/shady figures <em>had</em> to be involved, logic doesn&#39;t enter their mind, they need to convince themselves that their delusions are right.  And that&#39;s why there are only 2000 or so of them.  </p>

<p>Yes, and they just claim that it was god that guided evolution and the bible is based in metaphor.  They are the sensible ones who do not deny science and accept the bible might not be literal.  They&#39;ve adopted a world view that doesn&#39;t contradict science, but still allows them to believe.  AE911T are the equivalent of creationists.</p>

<p>Exactly.  So why do you believe such a small percentage of the worlds Architects and engineers and ignore the massive percentage that disagree with that small percentage?

<p>You think it&#39;s easy being called a shill/govt lackey/bootlicker when all I am trying to do is make the world a less paranoid place?

    <div class="md"><p>The <strong>outside shell</strong> of WTC 7 fell at freefall for a short time because the insides were gutted by fire and had already collapsed.  It fell at that speed because it had no resistance due to it no longer having any structural support.</p>

<p>With WTC 3, <a href="http://gdb.voanews.com/4395A947-6AB8-4F73-BF40-91347F7AD80A_w268_r1_cx1_cy6_cw98.jpg">Only the south part of three stories of the building were still standing</a>, all of which were gutted.  I&#39;ve been searching to see if it  (and WTC 4) were constructed differently than WTC 7, which was a tube in tube design, but can&#39;t find it, every page links to the new WTC 3 and 4.  WTC 7 was an office building, it was built tube in tube to maximize office space, WTC 3 was a hotel, no need to maximize floor space, there&#39;s a good chance that it was not tube in tube (I.E concrete protecting columns, as opposed to no concrete used to create a ridged block or protect the columns. The steel webbing being pushed to the outer walls.)  If this is the case, then it probably didn&#39;t collapse (edit: except that it did) due to the improved structural integrity created by rigid concrete blocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/bjh/14.jpg">WTC 4 had all but one wing of the building collapsed</a> to ground level, it being only a 9 story building, it was unlikely that is was tube in tube, I can&#39;t confirm this however.  But to suggest that a 9 story building will fall in the same way as a 47 story building is absurd.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFJa9WUy5QI#t=124">No, the video shows the east penthouse collapsing about 8 seconds before the collapse of the outer shell</a> This is indicative of the structural failure on the inside of the building.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/fig-1-7.jpg">Some of a 110 story building</a> and it didn&#39;t stand, as I already stated above...WTC 4 had all but one wing of the building collapsed, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/bjh/15.jpg">Look at it.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 fell from some fires is absurd  </p>

<p>How so?  And what motive do you have for them demolishing a building on purpose that required the most elaborate scheme in history?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also before 9/11 no steel structured building ever collapsed. EVER.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you meant &#39;collapsed from fire&#39;....And how many of these buildings were hit by fuel laden jet liners going top speed, causing major structural damage?  The towers and WTC 7 were tube in tube designed.<br/>
<a href="http://www.debunking911.com/steelweb.jpg">Most steel structures have a web of steel like this</a><br/>
 <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/perimeter.jpg">The towers and WTC 7 have webbing like this</a><br/>
The towers and building 7 were essentially bolted together like an erector set. No concrete was used to create a ridged block or protect the columns. The steel webbing was pushed to the outer walls.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>A building in free-fall means 0 structural support. If there were any intact core columns, there would be no free fall. Free fall with any intact support (which happens UNLESS each beam was cut, because collapse  and failure of every single column would simply not happen in the tenths of a second that would be required for total failure) <em>is</em> impossible physics. </p>

<p>Do you believe that if a 1 floor chunk of the building was magically taken out, the top still intact would fall through the bottom without slowing down a single bit? Not possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m certainly not qualified to go through all of the points here, there&#39;s a few really awful arguments:</p>

<p>When discussing Steven Jones&#39; paper on thermite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Power is also unimpressed with the findings of the paper due to the fact that the components of thermite are very common, and could have simply come from prosaic sources in the buildings. But other members of the Movement have explained why this argument is complete nonsense. As explained by mechanical engineer Gordon Ross:</p>

<p>Although these elements -- aluminum, iron, oxygen, and silicon -- were all abundant in building materials used in the Twin Towers, it is not possible that such materials milled themselves into fine powder and assembled themselves into a chemically optimized aluminothermic composite as a by-product of the destruction of the Twin Towers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Complete and utter bullshit. He&#39;s acting like these samples are some rare, super high tech chemicals. They&#39;re not. Here&#39;s a paper regarding exactly how simple this would be: <a href="http://911myths.com/Sulfur.pdf">http://911myths.com/Sulfur.pdf</a></p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get the impression the people being quoted here know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>His argument about the vanity journals and their joke of a peer review process is pretty damned incoherent. Powers points out how the Bentham journals published a complete nonsense paper sent in to demonstrate their lack of peer review... yet apparently this isn&#39;t evidence that their peer review process is lacking, because another Bentham journal did reject it. Huh?</p>

<p>Trying to defend vanity journals is pretty pathetic. </p>

<p>A lot of the other arguments here are pretty cringe worthy as well. Like this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although viewpoints differ in the 9/11 Truth movement regarding the cause of these explosions, some features of the lobby damage indicate that they were not due to a fireball explosion from the jet fuel. For example, the white marble walls show no signs of being exposed to fire, and the plants next to the blown out windows show no signs of burning either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? A few photos of the lobby that don&#39;t feature direct evidence of a fireball, and that&#39;s evidence that jet fuel didn&#39;t cause any kind of explosions in the lobby area? That&#39;s seriously weak, not to mention that it completely ignores pretty much everything Powers says on the topic, which you can get to here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=mmIjDfpTeMc#t=882">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=mmIjDfpTeMc#t=882</a></p>

<p>This guy seems to do quite a bit of ignoring and side tracking. Overall, this feels pretty weak.</p>

<p>Everything is a theory until proven true. What you seem to be implying is that conspiracies are impossible. I&#39;m all for an objective analysis of what is being said here and debunking the BS. But to try and make the argument that conspiracy theory is merely a pursuit of fools is foolish in and of itself. </p>

<p>I could point you to a plethora of atrocities committed by our government, most of which any rational person with a highschool education would refer to as conspiracy upon learning the true definition. It seems as though, many such as yourself, have been conditioned to hear the term &quot;conspiracy&quot; and automatically reject it as the ramblings of a nutter. This on its own suggests somebody seeks to benefit from a society where discerning individuals are taught to reject any notion of corrupt leaders who have little regard for the average human being. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just silly. Acting like &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; simply means someone who theorizes about any kind of conspiracy is just asinine. We both know it has a very specific meaning. It refers to people who make unsubstantiated claims that directly contradict what most academics, historians, journalists, and scientists claim to be the facts about the way the world works.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is dedicated to these kinds of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. Yes, there are also discussions of real and substantiated events, but more often than not, those are brought up in order to claim that the more nutty theories are plausible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly the kind of thinking that paints the conspiracy theorist as a nutter. It&#39;s the idea that everything is carefully controlled, that all major tragedies have been brilliantly orchestrated by a powerful cabal of leaders, and that even any rational skepticism of this kind of paranoid thinking has actually been planted there through subtle brainwashing. Even further, as you seem to be demonstrating here, the idea that if you roll your eyes at the crazier conspiracy theorists, it means you have trouble even imagining the idea of corruption, and blindly love everything about the government like some kind of excessively patriotic robot.</p>

<p>The kind of thinking around here seems to indicate a group who have a great difficulty wrapping their minds around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon&#x27;s_razor">Hanlon&#39;s razor</a>. There&#39;s also the simplistic tendency to believe that if blindly trusting everything about the government means you&#39;re stupid, then if you do the exact opposite and blindly distrust everything about it, that must make you really smart.</p>

<p>You&#39;re putting words in my mouth. I never said anything to the effect of a &quot;global cabal&quot; pulling the strings (i.e. illuminati, NWO, etc). All I&#39;ve suggested is that its in any hegemon&#39;s self interest to maintain a general attitude in society which does not question or contradict their actions/motives. There is nothing crazy about this idea -- its been happening since the dawn of time. What I am trying to get across to you is that the media seems to have a precedent for favoring stories which glorify the actions of those in power and ignore the ones which might paint them in a less than favorable light. I&#39;d be glad to point you towards countless examples of this happening. Why do you think the US (a proven imperialistic nation of warmongers) would be any different than anyone who came before? What happened if you questioned/spoke out against Napoleon, King George, Ghengis Kahn, Caesar Agustus, Cleopatra, hell even Marcus Aurelius (an emperor often considered to be one of the most fair and compassionate ever) etc.? You got your fucking head cut off. Do you truly believe we really see the full picture regarding the nastiest things our country is responsible for? Of course not. Its these things that I come to this sub in hopes of learning about. It seems you on the other hand would prefer to hide your head in the sand or attack those who wish to bring them to light. </p>

<p>I kind of addressed this above but I&#39;ll expound. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t imagine any of the corruption that goes on in our world; nor am I saying that I think you&#39;re stupid or a robot. I am, however, saying that you seem to only care to believe what is shown on CNN or NBC or whatever your outlet of choice is. </p>

<p>Well unfortunately the first part of your statement is true. I get you&#39;re making an analogy, but lots of these people do exist. What you have to understand is that for most &quot;truthers&quot; they find something out that seems to make sense, on top of this the so-called &quot;American dream&quot; usually isn&#39;t panning out for them. So most go through a sort of shock period where everything the government does must be evil. It takes a while for the newcomers to learn to discern from the BS (I went through this when I first started looking into &quot;alternative&quot; ideas about 5 years ago).</p>

<p>Theres a really good essay by william golding called <a href="http://faculty.weber.edu/dkrantz/en2500/Thinking%20as%20a%20Hobby%20-%20Golding.htm">thinking as a hobby</a> that kind of describes what I&#39;m talking about in the above paragraph. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying things are as simple as the illuminatyetc.  -- in fact I don&#39;t believe the government (executive, judicial, legislative dudes) per se is who is to blame. I would argue that we have a very powerful military-commercial-industrial complex who bullies the government into being complicit. You can see these guys&#39; bulldogs in action any time you see paramilitary proxies like blackwater in other countries, huge lobbyists, intelligence agencies who seem to answer to no one etc. in action.  </p>

<p>The idea that this sub is a reasonable source for this kind of information is nonsense. It&#39;s a <em>terrible</em> source, filled with people who have no understanding of maintaining the kind of journalistic and scientific ethics that are important for establishing truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am, however, saying that you seem to only care to believe what is shown on CNN or NBC or whatever your outlet of choice is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get the distinct impression that not only do you not know anything about me, but you also seem to have a blind distrust for the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Yes, the media isn&#39;t going to give you <em>all</em> the information out there, and there&#39;s going to be a certain amount of bias. Unfortunately, this sub has <em>way</em> more bias and stupidity than, say the BBC, CBC, Al Jazeera, or other relatively reputable news sources.</p>

<p>Shitty conspiracy blogs, youtube channels, and websites are not better sources than the mainstream media. They&#39;re far, far worse, and they also come with a childish amount of hubris, and the belief that they&#39;re rebels who &quot;see behind the scenes&quot;.</p>

<p>The absolute best way to get an intelligent, educated analysis of the world is to go to books, and respectable academic sources. Read people like Noam Chomsky, Gore Vidal, or Chris Hedges. There&#39;s a whole universe of writing out there about the world.</p>

<p>But also understand that the politicians who the people on this sub love to demonize are humans, too. For all the very valid criticism that Obama receives about drone attacks and other such things, I think that a lot of people who find these things deplorable might end up making the exact same decisions he did if they ended up in the same situation. It&#39;s often a lot more complicated than portrayed here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even that is a vast oversimplification. There&#39;s rarely any kind of specific group who can be blamed for these circumstances and events.</p>

When I said they &quot;collapsed directly due to the fact they were hit by airplanes&quot; I wasn&#39;t saying that the collapses didn&#39;t result from fires due to the planes, I was saying that the thing that triggered it all was the airplanes, not a controlled demolition, a missile, or that the WTC buildings were secretly holograms put up by humanoid reptilians that never really existed at all.</p>

<p>Either way, you&#39;re intentionally ignoring the actual issues here. Why do the vast majority of respected scientists think that the truthers are completely off the wall? Did you even look at my link? Do you have any training in physics, or do you just blindly buy into anyone who says sciencey sounding things, while claiming that the &quot;official story is wrong&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Care to try again? Conspiratards aren&#39;t the smartest bunch...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you should really try and get a grasp on the terminology. What you are saying here is that the folks who take the truther&#39;s ideas seriously aren&#39;t the smartest bunch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, what? </p>

<p>Again, you don&#39;t know what the word &quot;conspiratard&quot; means.</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely ignoring the points I&#39;m making, and you&#39;re making it blisteringly clear that you don&#39;t have the slightest clue what you&#39;re talking about. You don&#39;t seem to care about any kind of scientific discussion, or analysis of the fact, just about playing games and finding irrelevant reasons to discredit me.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m talking about how you don&#39;t hear any of these claims from experts in physics, I wasn&#39;t talking about you. I was pointing out how there are plenty of websites and youtube videos claiming that the &quot;official story violates Newtonian physics&quot;, and yet you don&#39;t see <em>any</em> physics or engineering professors or anyone of that nature making these claims.</p>

<p>The fact that you seem to think that me asking you if you have any training in physics contradicts my statement shows how insane your reasoning is. I was asking if you had &quot;any training&quot;, not if you were a respected authority. Plenty of the people in the videos have <em>some</em> physics training. They appear to have a high school, or perhaps some introductory university level physics education. They don&#39;t, however, show any sign of having an advanced understanding of physics.</p>

<p>Your entire debate technique seems to be based on attempting to find things that were written a little clumsily, and then acting like it&#39;s a big &quot;gotcha!&quot; moment. You don&#39;t seem interested in actually looking at facts and arguments, just in using the word &quot;conspiratard&quot; incorrectly.</p>

<p>Why do I get the feeling that you have trouble understanding how anyone could disagree with the truthers, and think that anyone who tries to debate them is a paid shill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sense some bias in your comment, and that&#39;s okay.  Unlike the threadstarter, I don&#39;t need or want to use ad hominem attacks against you.  But I hope you will read what I have to say.</p>

<p>We know that 9/11 is a conspiracy.  I use that word even though it has a disparity, often used as a propaganda tool by main stream media outlets and our own government.  But the term in it&#39;s definition still holds fact. Our government places all guilt of this conspiracy on Osama Bin Laden and al-qaeda.  All the evidence of which came initially from factions within, or associated with, our own government, and not from any independent research.  Infact, by evening time of 9/11/01, all major media outlets in the US were reporting that Bin Laden was indeed the culprit.  But after 12 years this is no longer the case.  Independent research has produced names and motives of neocon factions within our own government, and in high ranking positions of several private corporations that were involved in 9/11.  Let me give you just one example.   </p>

<p>In the impact zone of the north tower was a company called Marsh and McLennan, which at the time was the worlds largest insurance brokerage company.  One of the executives was man named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer">L. Paul Bremmer</a>.  He was also the chairman of the Congressional National Commision on Terrorism(99-00), and the US Ambassador at large for counter-terrorism(86-89).  Instead of being in towers on the morning of 9/11, where hundreds of his collegues died that morning, his flight to New York was diverted and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNP3PdstwRM">he went on NBC that same day and told the world that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the attack.</a>  In the same interview he is quoted as saying, we need to respond with &quot;the most severe military response we can come up with&quot;.  In 2003 he was called away from Marsh and McLennan to become the Iraq occupation governor.  So not only did Bremer have a connection to the North tower but he had access to the company located in the exact impact zone where flight 175 would hit.  He went on TV the same day to tell us who the perpatrator was, and then went on to become the occupational governor of Iraq.  Perhaps this is just a coincidence. </p>

<p>Well, the story goes deeper.  Bremer was also the former manager for Kissinger Associates, and he was a member of the, Board of Trustees, for Axel Nobel, the parent company of International Paint LCC, which produced a fireproofing application for skyscrapers called Interchar.  Bremer was on the International Advisory Board for the Japanese mining and machinery company, Komatsu, which was involved in a joint venture with Dresser Industries (ties to the Bush family).  The Komatsu/Dresser Mining Commision operated from 88-97. In July 96 it patented a nano-thermite demolition device that could, &quot;demolish a concrete structure at high efficiency while preventing a secondary problem do to noise and dust&quot;.  <a href="http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tocpj/articles/V002/7TOCPJ.htm">Nano thermite has been confirmed in samples of WTC dust.</a>.</p>

<p>This is just one of many high level suspects.  The general public hasn&#39;t even heard of this guy, let alone his potential involvement in the crime of the Century.  With that being the case, how can we not reopen an investigation on people like this?  We know that the 9/11 Commission was under funded and given limited resources.  Why not do an independent investigation where funding and governmental constriction are not issues?</p>

<p>A good unbiased source to start investigating more about 9/11, and other topics, is with <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/">James Corbett</a>.  He&#39;s an independent journalist based out of Japan that is very critical, and descript, in analyzing information. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-TISYtc9fs">Here is an conference analysis he did on Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s actions on 9/11.</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, there&#39;s a mountain of evidence suggesting we should. However, once those who are in control put their stamp of approval on a decision it will stand until those people are no longer in control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>There will be no new investigation of 9/11 while the true powers are not the elected government officials. The banks, the big business interests, international financiers, etc. These are the people in power. They are the ones who profit off of an endless, immortal war machine.</p>

<p>And as long as they are in power, there will be more of the same.</p>

<p>Several years ago, someone in this subreddit asked a puzzling question.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that the 99% overthrew the 1%. What would we do with them? If we caught the Rothschilds and Rockefellers red-handed, tried them and convicted them of heinous crimes against humanity, what would we do to them? Kill them? Put them in cages?</p>

<p>The question becomes even more difficult when you realize that most of the people who would be assigned with making those decisions were probably influenced by them along the way somehow anyway. </p>

<p>This world is hell. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. And the people in power have become so  corrupt that everything connected to them is festering with that corruption to many degrees of separation.</p>

<p>There has not been, nor shall there ever be, a real &quot;official&quot; investigation of 9/11. There is only the &quot;official story&quot;.</p>

<p>The real investigation is what you read here... conveniently discredited as just so much &quot;big foot nonsense&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there has to be a saturation point though where enough people are collectively informed that the gears of power start grinding to a stop.  We saw the effects of that when Obama wanted to start a criminal military strike against Syria.  Everyone collectively said, NO!  We have to be careful though, because the only reason this is possible is because of the unique tool we are using now.  The internet.  And that will be the litmus test.  If we even allow net neutrality to disappear we are fucked.  But until then, I do hold hope that there will be a counter movement in my life, and I will continue researching and asking questions.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t want to sound jaded.... but, at this point (for me), it&#39;s unavoidable. The changes I am affecting to this world are not in our favor, sadly. Everything I do to &quot;raise the stakes&quot; gets countered by a truly heartless &quot;re-raising of the stakes&quot; by those in power. </p>

<p>I came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> 6 years ago <em>believing</em> that the government was spying on pretty much everything anyone did. I was called paranoid and crazy for believing that. Now, after Snowden&#39;s revelations <em>confirming</em> what I (and millions of others) believed, nothing has changed <em>in our favor</em>. We&#39;re not vindicated. The stakes have been raised. We&#39;re potential terrorists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s people like you who completely turn me off to this sub, and conspiracy theories in general. You come across as so high and mighty, with irrefutable proof of your claim, and then explode when anyone tells you they don&#39;t believe what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>If you want people to believe you, or &quot;wake up,&quot; then you should seriously consider being more presentable. At this point you are looking no better than the homeless guy in the street screaming that 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question 1:  <strong>If</strong> they truly did know this, and what you say is true, it means nothing.  Don&#39;t make a false cause fallacy.</p>

<p>Question 2:  No, I can&#39;t, but that is a loaded question, that&#39;s also a logical fallacy.  You&#39;re making too many assumptions.</p>

<p>Question 3:  This question doesn&#39;t really make sense, do you think that airplanes read minds?</p>

<p>Question 4:  Thing&#39;s aren&#39;t so black and white as you may think they are.  In order for us to know the true result of something like a plane flying into a building it must be duplicated.  Oh and before you link me to the video where they use scale models of everything, unfortunately physics doesn&#39;t work like that, tensile strength, will be drastically higher in a smaller scaled model.</p>

<p>Question 5:  The frame rate of security camera footage is much much lower than you seem to understand lol.  I&#39;m actually surprised that anything was caught by camera footage at all.</p>

<p>Question 6:  No, this is the fallacy of personal incredulity.</p>

<p>Question 7:  Personal incredulity and false cause.</p>

<p>Question 8:  Personal incredulity and false cause.</p>

<p>Question 9:  I don&#39;t know the answer to this one, but then again it doesn&#39;t really pertain to the matter at hand.</p>

<p>Question 10:  Jesus christ this post is long,  sorting throught the piles and piles and mountians of fallacies, misinformation, ignorance is giving me a headache so I give up.  You win.  I could care less what happened to the fucking planes.  This is why a should just stick to avoid you nutjobs like I was before, these mind-numbingly stupid arguments must be taken from the same place as creationist apologetic textbooks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several smoking guns. And the motivation is complex, many parts of it discussed in the film - like why the WTC was the target. It was prime real estate poised to lose a shit ton of money from asbestos removal. </p>

<p>But the main point of the film wasn&#39;t to analyze the motivations. It is to point out inconsistencies in the &quot;official&quot; story, so that people will be motivated to call for truth. Analyzing the motivation behind the crimes is kind of a step two - first you have to show that a crime was committed. </p>

<p>No one knows every single detail of the what&#39;s and the who&#39;s and the why&#39;s, because of active cover up by those involved. That&#39;s why we <em>want</em> to know the truth. So that we can catch and punish the real criminals, and right the wrongs. But we can&#39;t know every detail of the conspiracy if no one questions the cover up. Just because this film doesn&#39;t uncover every single fact about what really happened doesn&#39;t mean that the facts it does uncover are false. The complexities of the motivations can only become clear after we first show unravel the lies protecting those motivations. The official version fails to hold up to scrutiny, so we need to have a full investigation backed by the people of the world. An independent film maker can&#39;t uncover the entire story of a very complex crime that happened with the protection of the most powerful people in the world by himself. But he has shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the official version(s) is(are) false. </p>

<p>What we <em>do</em> know, and that this film exposes, is that what we have been <em>told</em> happened cannot possibly be what did happen. That in itself is worthy of outrage and further investigation. </p>

<p>What we can say for sure is that a group of Middle Eastern small time religious fanatics did not carry out a devastating attack on the US without help from anyone inside the US power structure. </p>

<p>There is proof of a cover up. Lots of proof. Facts changed, pictures photoshopped, evidence destroyed and hidden. </p>

<p><strong>But if you want motivation, here are a few:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>WTC to be demolished and rebuilt at a huge profit (including insurance money) instead of a huge loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so that incredible profit could be made by the entities that make money off of those wars (Halliburton, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Emergency&quot; powers granted to the government that bypass constitutional guarantees, to give those in power more power.</p></li>
<li><p>Justifying increases to spending on the military-industrial complex. </p></li>
<li><p>Bush family personal revenge against Saddam.</p></li>
<li><p>Caches of gold and silver to be stolen from vaults underneath the WTC.</p></li>
<li><p>Distraction from other crimes and political shenanigans, like the $2.3 trillion fuck up in military spending Rumsfeld had to confess on 9/10/2001.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So money and power, those are the motivations. Just like with most all high crimes and acts of war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you are overestimating the nature of the conspiracy here. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the media got a memo stating &quot;we&#39;re secretly blowing up the WTC - here&#39;s what to say, but keep it all hush hush, and only say it in this order&quot; and someone fucked up. I don&#39;t think anyone in the media knew what was going to happen. </p>

<p>In that situation, media gets most of their info from government people, like FBI spokespeople for instance. In the case of WTC 7, there may have been a few people in key places who knew what was going to happen. At some point, one of them thought it had already happened when it had not, and accidentally passed it on to a reporter. That&#39;s a possibility. Another possibility is that it was just a random mistake that coincidentally came true (as any debunker would claim). That BBC report is just one of those &quot;huh?&quot; things that make you want to look into it. It wasn&#39;t like everyone at BBC was sitting around with a script, asking &quot;can we read the part about WTC 7 falling down yet?&quot; It&#39;s not concrete evidence that anyone knew early, it&#39;s just a thing that sticks out because it&#39;s so bizarre. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s no one in the media that could &quot;come forward&quot;. No one could say anything that isn&#39;t already known because of the broadcast. If it actually was a case of leaked info, the person who was &quot;in the know&quot; would have been the FBI spokesperson or whoever gave the reporter info too early. But that person likely wouldn&#39;t be doing anything but passing on info from a source higher up also, so even they weren&#39;t a knowing participant. What&#39;s possible is that there was <em>one</em> person with foreknowledge trying to control some of what was going out - like trying to spread rumors that the fires inside 7 were really bad and causing the structure to weaken. And that got turned into &quot;WTC 7 fell&quot; through miscommunication. </p>

<p>Imagine that Larry Silverstein knew it was going to come down by demolition. Surely he had friends who worked there. So he may have told one of them that it was going to come down <em>because of fire</em>, so they needed to GTFO. That person then told others. And the word got around, and &quot;WTC 7 is going to fall down&quot; became &quot;WTC is falling down,&quot; and finally &quot;WTC 7 has fallen down&quot;. Remember, people are running around scared for their lives here. It would be easy for statements to get altered going from one source to another (which I think is the debunker explanation for the BBC report). </p>

<p>As far as &quot;pull it&quot; goes, I don&#39;t think that was really a command to blow the building, I think it was out of context most likely, or misheard. But it&#39;s something people jump onto because it seems sketchy, it would fit well with some kind of grand conspiracy with thousands of people involved. It&#39;s another thing where you want to look into it, but it&#39;s not proof of anything in and of itself. If any of the NYPD knew parts of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, I would think there would be <em>one</em> person, and they probably would only have limited info. A plausible scenario would be that the Chief was told that they were doing impromptu demolition to limit damage to other buildings, and to save more lives - but all because of terrorists hitting WTC with a plane caused damage that was eventually going to spread and cause even more damage. But that he has to keep it on the DL because it&#39;s likely a few people would die - acceptable losses considering that many more would die if they didn&#39;t do it, yada yada. And later it&#39;s sold to him as just that, but he still can&#39;t say anything because it would look bad. And just to make sure, if you <em>do</em> say something, you&#39;ll lose your job. So all he thinks he&#39;s covering up is an emergency measure that did more good than harm. I don&#39;t think there is anyone who really thinks that they were a part of something evil - people just won&#39;t consider that, they want to think they did the right thing. </p>

<p>I hope it made sense how I explained things. That there is a way for nefarious deeds to be pulled off while the players don&#39;t really know what is going on, even after the fact. That it could have been an &quot;inside job&quot; without legions of people knowing that. Only a very few people would know the truth, people who were part of the plotting. Loose ends can be cleaned up with blackmail, extortion, and murder. </p>

<p>Oh, and Snowden is a very rare exception. How many people in addition to Snowden knew what was going on and <em>didn&#39;t</em> come forward, or were ignored or silenced before getting word out? Even he had to resort to extreme measures to protect himself. And he was in a unique position to be able to plan his leak really well ahead of time, collecting proof all along the way. </p>

<p>Why would the FDNY Chief &quot;be aware of what&#39;s going on&quot; if he&#39;s simply being told to stop trying to save the building? As far as he&#39;s aware, it&#39;s on fucking fire and it&#39;s his job to put it out.</p>

<p>The premature BBC report could be tossed up to misinformation. &quot;We didn&#39;t mean to say WTC7, it was a mistake, simple as that.&quot;</p>

<p>Reporters and Journalists and Newsroom people get mixed up info all the time that they have to redact, that&#39;s why they always preface anything they say with &quot;We&#39;re reporting&quot; because that means that they are merely reporting information, not stating that any of it is true or not, just being reported.</p>
