       I really don't believe there is a single group that puppeteers the entire world. I also do not believe that all the countries are in on it together.

       Make no mistake, they all do shady and underhanded things. The first thing you have to realize with politics is that no one is always the good guy or bad guy, it varies.

       They have been trying false flags, but now people just assume things are false flags now. The media has lost the trust and so has the government. The only option they have is to wait for everyone to go back to sleep and do the round up.

       There isn't one right now. I am speculating by the way, if it was not obvious. Though, (conjecture here) with the airliner missing, it will most likely be used in a terrorist attack. Watch the news, keep your eyes and ears open.

       I doubt that Putin, Obama, or most other political leaders even know to what extent they're being manipulated. If the current mess in Ukraine leads to war, I don't think it will be for a while. I would expect Russia to bolster it's relations with China and the other BRICS nations in response to the US/Euro sanctions. If they can make oil trade deals with the Saudis down the line then you can bet that China and Russia will come out on top as the financial hegemony. If America's faltering economic system can't handle the tensions of the transfer in financial power, then we will probably see some hard times in the US. They can't allow society to collapse completely or people may actually get desperate enough to really unify. But if done at the right time (probably coinciding with a good ole' fashioned false flag event) then America could blame Russia for its economic woes and get a real war going with an unprecedented death toll.
All conjecture of course, but given present circumstances, that's how I would do it if I were trying to set it off. Steady, serious economic downturn in America for a year or so and then war. I think these guys know they need to take their time or risk losing centuries of work.
