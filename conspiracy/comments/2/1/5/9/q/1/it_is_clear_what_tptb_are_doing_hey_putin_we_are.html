    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that Putin, Obama, or most other political leaders even know to what extent they&#39;re being manipulated. If the current mess in Ukraine leads to war, I don&#39;t think it will be for a while. I would expect Russia to bolster it&#39;s relations with China and the other BRICS nations in response to the US/Euro sanctions. If they can make oil trade deals with the Saudis down the line then you can bet that China and Russia will come out on top as the financial hegemony. If America&#39;s faltering economic system can&#39;t handle the tensions of the transfer in financial power, then we will probably see some hard times in the US. They can&#39;t allow society to collapse completely or people may actually get desperate enough to really unify. But if done at the right time (probably coinciding with a good ole&#39; fashioned false flag event) then America could blame Russia for its economic woes and get a real war going with an unprecedented death toll.
All conjecture of course, but given present circumstances, that&#39;s how I would do it if I were trying to set it off. Steady, serious economic downturn in America for a year or so and then war. I think these guys know they need to take their time or risk losing centuries of work.</p>

<p>To one group, Russia/Iran/Syria still the enemy, to the other group, think of the energy resources they can control if all in agreement? </p>

<p>As for power.  The Russian oil- igarchs have thoroughly looted their nation, and have one interest, increasing their personal wealth and power. </p>
