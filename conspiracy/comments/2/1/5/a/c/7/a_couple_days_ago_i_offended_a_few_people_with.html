        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following two things are in conflict:</p>

<ul>
<li>reddit&#39;s anti-personal-information policy is one that they enforce more often and more strongly (bans added to content removal) than most of their other rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>and...</p>

<ul>
<li>much of the theorizing is based on personal information; one of the very curious aspects of Sandy Hook is a purported event on 2009/12/25 in which many mortgages in Sandy Hook were paid in full, and personal information about the individual homeowners isn&#39;t being protected in the presentation of this aspect of the overall theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Articles are being submitted which contain either the personal information itself, or which have subsequent links directly to the personal information (e.g., a youtube video of someone who recorded their searches), without any personal information <em>protections</em>. These articles are in violation of reddit&#39;s policies against posting personal information for being a direct path to the personal information of presumed innocents.</p>

<p>Rather than move beyond this barrier and focus on the implications, this conspiracy theory (Sandy Hook) has gotten snagged here with a degree of self-perpetuation.</p>

<p>Until those interested in this theory can learn to discuss the theory without pushing personal information (present the point of curiosity <em>without</em> presenting all of the names involved), this conspiracy theory will remain snagged on reddit&#39;s policy.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook looks suspicious. reddit enforcing its rules does not.</p>

<p>Leaving out all of the personal information about the various individual home owners, there&#39;s still a very interesting question about Christmas Day, 2009 and Sandy Hook&#39;s Dirty Santa. Is it possible to discuss the questions &quot;how and why&quot;, without posting links directly to personal information? I was able to post this question here <strong>without any links at all</strong>.</p>

<p>p.s. to those I offended the other day: if you were looking for an apology, this is about as close as you&#39;ll get. I won&#39;t hide in dark corners of reddit to avoid its policies, like delinquent schoolchildren looking at Playboy magazines they stole from grandpa and smoking cheap cigarettes they stole from grandma. Not that I didn&#39;t do such things in my youth, I&#39;m just no longer in my youth. </p>

<p>Truth to power and all that.</p>

<p>A Facebook page is private information, as is a phone number, even though it may available for viewing if somebody looks it up. </p>

<p>However, I believe that a birth, marriage or death record is a PUBLIC RECORD, because it is provided by the State. I also believe that a link to a recognised news source should also be fair game.</p>

<p>From my understanding of reddit&#39;s policy on posting personal information, I don&#39;t think posting a link to the registry website and saying &quot;look for yourself&quot; would be a violation. </p>

<p>However, looking them up and posting the results would be (which is what is occurring in much of the theorizing on this event). </p>

<p>Unless and until there is an implication of wrong-doing on the part of some specific person or group of persons, there is no reason to presume anything other than innocent bystander. And, as such, reddit&#39;s policy (in its current incarnation) applies to them</p>

<p>You accessing the registry isn&#39;t forbidden. I don&#39;t think the location of the registry is forbidden information. </p>

<p>However, looking up a bunch of individual records and posting that information without protecting the presumed innocent is a clearly a violation of reddit policy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying that the registry software includes default data (e.g., the date the software was released in date fields and $0 in monetary fields) when those fields should have actually been left blank.</p>

<p>Has this been confirmed? It seems to be a reasonable assertion. Is the software company publicly traded? Does it have public records?</p>

<p>Clarifying this matter might allow people to move past their &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; obsession with this community&#39;s inhabitants... and better focus on what remains.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that there can be so much implication that an entire community was involved in the perpetration of a large scam. (The way this theory is being presented by inclusion of all of this personal info.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find it hard to believe that a fictitious community could have been created, even though I haven&#39;t decided whether or not I believe that happened here.</p>

<p>More to your point, though, I don&#39;t find it unreasonable to think that this is &quot;filler data&quot; (possibly just lack of &quot;polish&quot; on the part of some programmer). By the same token, though, until this is clearly presented as a proof (see my earlier questions on this topic), it remains a snagging point for those discussing the incident - and it doesn&#39;t disprove any other theories (it just places a nullification of drama on this one data source).</p>

<p>An administrative assistant at the Assessor’s Office, Andrea Santillo, promptly returned my phone call. She said that the Newtown city government recently had switched to a new computer system and had not been able to enter the property data for all Newtown homes. So the computer used the 12/25/2009 and $0 as, respectively, a “filler” default sale date and price</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a perfectly reasonable explanation, and seems entirely credible to me. As mentioned elsewhere, it is the case for many homes in Newtown - and, indeed, I checked the database for other towns in the state, and large numbers of the properties there have a sale price of $0 as well.</p>

<p>The claim &quot;many mortgages in Sandy Hook were paid in full&quot; - either on that date or another - appears entirely without support. </p>

<p>there might be a very nefarious reason that property data could not be entered.</p>

<p>And neither is there any evidence it was &quot;selective&quot; at all. It covers a broad range of properties and, as mentioned above, even non-properties. If it <em>didn&#39;t</em> include some names &quot;in the news,&quot; that would seem MORE grounds for suspicion. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s a much bigger picture question here - how is this whole picture of a conspiracy self-consistent?</p>

<p>One the one hand, people running such a conspiracy would have to be at least competent and have planned it for many years.  It would have to involve hundreds of people directly and many thousands who had to know that some sort of coverup was going on - people in all branches and levels of government - and huge amounts of money (how much would paying off hundreds of mortgages cost alone?)</p>

<p>And yet these same people are so careless that they pay off hundreds of mortgages on one day, and leave complete records of this transaction in the most obvious public place, and don&#39;t notice it for years.</p>

<p>Yes, even smart people make stupid oversights.  But the gap here is too implausible - wouldn&#39;t someone in the registry office notice when thousands of transactions appeared literally overnight?  Wouldn&#39;t the newspapers?  Even if they were all on the take, wouldn&#39;t they say, &quot;Hey, people will notice this in a second once the shit hits the fan, let&#39;s get rid of these,&quot; to the people paying them?</p>
