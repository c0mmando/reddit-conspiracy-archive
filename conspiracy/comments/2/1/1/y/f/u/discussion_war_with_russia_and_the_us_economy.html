        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every other day on this sub we hear doomsday reports saying that the US economy is going to collapse. Well just look at it, it&#39;s pretty much a given that at some point it will, it mathematically cannot be sustained.</p>

<p>As with every President though, no one wants to see it fall on their watch. But perhaps a method has been discovered to pin the inevitable collapse onto someone else, onto a long-time foe, onto the &quot;power seeking&quot; communist Russians.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Obama threatened to introduce sanctions onto Russians for the &quot;invasion of Crimea&quot;. At the time this happened, Russia threatened to retaliate by <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/ukraine-crisis-russia-warns-could-reduce-zero-economic-dependency-us-20140">going off the USD</a> as their reserve currency. Doing such a thing, especially if countries aligned with Russia followed suit, would have the effect of unpinning the USD as the global reserve currency, and would be the catalyst for a catastrophic collapse.</p>

<p>Well sanctions have gone ahead, will Russia retaliate?</p>

<p>If they do, the Obama administration may get all their christmases at once. The crash of the economy will be attributable to the actions of the Russians. Americans and most westerners, who have just now become unbelievably poor, will despise the communist and Cold War dogima of US vs Russia will be reborn. The media will paint Russia as an active aggressor hellbent on destroying America, this being &quot;obvious&quot; by their choice to crash the economy. </p>

<p>At this point, the angry western world will beg for war to make things right...</p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

<p>The Central Bank of Russia unlike Belarus National Bank, Ukraine or Kazakhstan is member of BIS.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia">1</a></sup></p>

<p>BIS == Bank for International Settlements (the central bank of central banks)</p>

<p>Ukraine wasn&#39;t playing ball with the BIS, so the US took their gold &quot;for safekeeping&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s a media induced hysterical fear of economic collapse. And who will rescue the world from that economic collapse? The same people who caused it, of course. They&#39;ve been doing this to nations for the past 300 years. Seems to be working. Why stop now?</p>

<p>The BIS will get absorbed by the IMF, the UN will become the world political power (with all influential delegates being politically owned by the same people who own the current various national politicians). </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same recipe, just a different day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia can and will impose its own sanctions against the countries that sanction it. No more gas for a large part of Europe. </p>

<p>The effects might not be seen immediately, but in 8 months when the cold weather hits, Russia will have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector">powerful</a> tool at its disposal.</p>

<p>What no one sees to say in the news, which have gone misteriously quiet after Obamas no war declaration (pretty much translating to &quot;no war industry money&quot;), is that Russia can sustain itself without trade far longer than the other countries that depend on its oil and gas.</p>

<p>This has just turned into a waiting game, and Russia is going to win it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, US economy won&#39;t collapse. It will suffer a bit, but the doomsday reports of it collapsing is overblown. A majority of the countries in the world run a defecit. The US is an economic powerhouse. The US may have seen a slight drop in it&#39;s overall economic, military, and political dominance but it&#39;s frankly still ahead of the pack. The gap between the US and the next economic/political powerhouse is still pretty staggering. Sorry, but we still have the ability to basically collapse a country&#39;s economy through economic means. Our sanctions on Russia are hitting hard. Russian sanctions on the US really aren&#39;t having a huge effect. As much as people want to say that the US is declining, you&#39;re talking about probably the most dominant geopolitical force in history. I&#39;m not saying this as an American who really likes his country&#39;s policies either. Russia might go off the USD. Maybe a few other countries also go away from the USD. A majority of the world though will still use the USD. China sure as hell won&#39;t go away from it. Other countries aren&#39;t about to switch to the Ruble. The overall impact will be a slight drop in the US economy. That&#39;s about it</p>
