    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see. I thought you were saying it was discredited because it was found to be in a filmed scene in like a Hollywood movie. </p>

<p>I knew it was &quot;from a movie&quot; which happens to be a documentary about a moon hoax.  That&#39;s what the footage implies so it&#39;s natural to be used for that purpose. It doesn&#39;t discredit the footage. It might make it seem so by association to a guy who now has a motive to sell his doc. But I doubt he had the camera on board the shuttle. </p>

<p>Why were they conducting such a manipulative film experiment?!?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed my point, i didn&#39;t explain anything to well either. I did accidentally exchange the words documentary and movie, the whole time I&#39;m talking about the moon hoax documentary. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that- the footage featured in the moon hoax doco is not evidence of the staging that the narrator is claiming, its merely the documentary writer&#39;s uneducated spin on it. There are detailed reasons of why this piece of video is not a piece of evidence of a moon landing hoax, I honestly don&#39;t have the time to go thought it now, but its very easily searchable. The female narration in the clip you posted goes throughout the full length doco i posted previously. </p>

<p>Just to clarify, its a pretty decent documentary as far as moon landing hoaxes go; but the creator of the documentary did do some pretty stupid shit in regards to manipulation of facts and deception (seriously Google his altercation with Buzz Aldrin) and also his particular narration of the clip you originally posted (which features the narration) has been clearly explained and generally known to not be the &quot;accidentally released&quot; piece of damning evidence that he claims it is. Look for the explanation, its there. </p>

<p>-I&#39;m not saying its not evidence because its featured in the doco; </p>

<p>-I&#39;m saying the doco has some good points, but this isn&#39;t one of them</p>

<p>-I&#39;m saying the original footage in question was not (and this is generally known again if you&#39;d like to google this) 
accidentally sent to him, and was in the public domain before hgis documentary</p>

<p>-I&#39;m saying you should research the documentary creator, he&#39;s a pretty interesting chap</p>

<p>just to clear my thoughts up, after all they are just my thoughts!</p>

<p>Anyway. If the thrust of your argument is nasa is too big and professional to make mistakes. I have to say that&#39;s incredibly weak.  Ever hear of Enron? </p>

<p>The bigger and more tentacles an organization has the harder it is to keep things under wraps</p>

<p>Corruption exists. If it exists in the individual it can exist in a small business. If a small one why not a large one? If private business why not government ? </p>

<p>And the kicker is your referring me to youtube comments to get the &quot;real answers&quot; so I can not &quot;waste my life&quot;.....</p>

<p>The epitome of why I posted this. Always with these bits of footage am I deflected somewhere else with mockery and no real answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But to clarify, I wasnt saying they are not too big to make mistakes, just pointing out what kind of mistake it is. </p>

<p>Them sending out credible evidence (which again,  this has been debunked - it would be headline news in every country if it was correct as narrated) would be the equivalent of the FBI &quot;accidentally uploading&quot; their plot to kill JFK on you-tube on an official channel;Do you think that&#39;s very likely?</p>

<p>Leaked? maybe. Accidentally Sent? are you kidding me? Should have been your fist clue....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok well. First. You keep telling me the first video was debunked. And that&#39;s great. Can you explain how or point me to a link explaining how this specific footage was debunked.  That&#39;s the whole reason I posted this to get some more evidence of a fake without getting just generalized comments that it HAS Ben debunked or is too &quot;ridiculous&quot; to be real. Etc. </p>

<p>Which brings me to another issue that I&#39;m sure has been addressed somewhere else on the topics of conspiracy. </p>

<p>In regards to &quot;appeals to common&quot; sense. Don&#39;t you see a logical flaw in that? A conspiracy theory is a theory that goes against the grain of common knowledge or what the common people would consider true. So if you appeal to common sense. Of course conspiracies always lose. </p>

<p>In most cases yes they deserve to lose. But to truly refute a theory, real evidence is needed. Not an appeal to the majority. </p>

<p>If it is the majority opinion or common knowledge. Then take it one step further. Ask WHY is it common sense. What specific common law did this theory break? Is it a solid proven law? Is it common knowledge because the footage was shown to be from a movie of film. Etc. </p>

<p>By doing this you get to REAL answers. </p>

<p>Mockery, appeals to &quot;common&quot; this or that. They don&#39;t get anyone anywhere. </p>

<p>So in summation.  How has the first video been debunked? And where did the crazy footage from the other links come from?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not. Armstrong says the camera blocks the window, not that it&#39;s against the glass. The reason to shut out the sunlight from other openings would be to eliminate glare on the window. And even if they were getting part of interior in the shot for effect it doesn&#39;t prove anything about the apollo missions being fakes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I only watched the whole thing because the narrator&#39;s voice is awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm, the first video is what I would expect to be the most credible, they are obviously in zero G. and manipulating the shape of the earth through the window of the shuttle (its apparent when the lights go on), this can only be to fake a distance from the earth. as well as the transmission they reply that is obviously an incorrect distance since they are still within orbit. </p>

<p>the other two pieces of footage are sketchy I know, however I&#39;m not looking for mere replies like &quot;yea those are fake.&quot; I was more looking for leads that prove it, some research I can read online etc.</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you attempt to get the best shot out of a space shuttle window from all the way on the other side of the shuttle? </p>

<p>As for the lack of astronaut audio. I&#39;d say a lack of extra information is no cause to discredit. I think it best to answer what the information we already have implies. </p>

<p>The main question is what logical reason would nasa astronauts be manipulating footage for? If it&#39;s not manipulation then what is it? That&#39;s the information I&#39;m seeking with this post. Not mockery. Just a straight rebuttal with research that is specific to this footage. </p>

<p>I highly suspect it is a piece for art or something from a film or someone on a wind up. All I see is a woman who could be anywhere. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just a thought; link 1 says we never went to the moon essentially, although very interesting footage. Link 2 says we found ancient structures on the moon, so what one is it? We never went or there are stuctures?</p>

<p>I knew it was &quot;from a movie&quot; which happens to be a documentary about a moon hoax.  That&#39;s what the footage implies so it&#39;s natural to be used for that purpose. It doesn&#39;t discredit the footage. It might make it seem so by association to a guy who now has a motive to sell his doc. But I doubt he had the camera on board the shuttle. </p>
