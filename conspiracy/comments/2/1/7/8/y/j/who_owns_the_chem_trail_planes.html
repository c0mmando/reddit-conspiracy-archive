       im asking in the sense of say you got a rocket or something and shot it down or attempted to, who would show up at your door?
      </p>
      <p>
       is there a documented case where "they" were spraying another country and they shot it down thinking it was a military plane or something?

       That's why  I said "perhaps".

      <p>
       And for further clarification, I did not post the pic of the fire-fighting plane because I believe it is evidence of "chemtrails".  I posted it as a visual of the markings of an Evergreen Int'l plane.

       Evergreen are a civilian company which provides tanker services for the military including inflight refuelling. They are the sort of outfit you might expect to be involved in clandestine activities - if there was any evidence for those activities in the first place. But there just isn't, despite the best efforts of the 'Look Up' brigade.

       Oh, OK. I'll consider myself suitably impressed, or worried, or whatever it is you are trying to convey. Maybe you should use emoticons, y'know, to help with that simmering rage that Rule 10 just won't let you express. :/

       If you are a shill, you've done badly, your condescending generalizations are a real give away. Otherwise, do some research, and quit your bullshit.

       That's simply a list of geoengineering patents and plans. These come out of 'geoengineering planes'. Simply tacking the word 'chemtrails' onto the list won't suddenly make them become 'chemtrail planes'.

       The phenomena which is in discussion is clearly one which is shrouded in uncertainty. The main reason for so much heat around the subject, however, is the clear observation of coordinated and peculiar 'persistent contrail' formations, which coincide clearly with patents for geoengineering, heavy metal accumulation, whistleblowers (take former chief of FBI Ted Gunderson for example, who later died extremely suspiciously), incentive structures for wall street elite's that 'bet' on weather derivatives, huge agricultural monsters that are 'coincidentally' buying up weather station technology and patenting aluminium resistant seeds (monsanto), HAARP technology, extremely adverse weather conditions that are baffling meteorologists, bizarre cloud formations and atypical sounds before strange weather events etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unfortunately the word chemtrails is likely to put people off or encourage associations with the kinds of damaging stereotypes proliferated around people with a critical eye. Beyond the choice of words to represent that which should be further investigated, is a world of evidence and reason that should be investigated.

       For almost anyone who has heard the word chemtrail used, it means the long white trails which cross the skies, sometimes forming apparent crosshatch patterns, and which sometimes persist and spread out to form a thin cloud covering the entire sky. That is not Geo engineering, and they are not chemtrails.

       It takes magic pixie glasses to tell the difference between a contrail and a chemtrail. These are only available to people who 'Wake up' and 'Look up'. And if you have the slightest understanding of physics they simply won't work for you.

       Unfortunately, the catch all definition of how a contrail is formed is not nearly enough to explain away the hugely disparate phenomena we see in our sky. Taking everything into account, those who can see past the sceintific dogma know that their environment is being tampered with.

       Even without the nefarious 'chemtrail' argument, which is better represented by geoengineering, we see the sky turned from blue to white in a matter of hours, in a clearly coordinated fashion. Whilst scientific conceptualizations are a key tool for the human being, one has the ability to discern from their environment when something is atypical, hence the huge growth of activists, whistleblowers, evidence, and shills, revolved around the geoengineering topic.

       You perceive there to be a pattern, where in fact there is none. There has been an explosion in air travel in the last three decades, with as much as 12 percent year-on-year increases. Where once the sky may have had a single contrail, it now has dozens and they spread out to form a thin haze of cirrus cloud. Despite global warming, this is a bad thing. The cloud reflects back sunlight, it's true, but it also traps a layer of warm air near to the Earth. Experiments with man-made solar reflectors have reached the same conclusions; pumping reflective substances into the stratosphere can have exactly the opposite effect to what was intended. In fact, any attempt to mess with the weather is opening a can of worms which mankind, in its arrogant stupidity, will never be able to close again.

       Again, the catch all 'there's been an increase in air travel' does not adequately reflect the behavior evident in the skies. Sometimes, the sky is completely clear save a giant cross, which is followed quickly by complete overcast. Sometimes, one thick and vastly spread out trial will become base to smaller and clearly coordinated trails which meet perpendicular to the base trail. Sometimes in the east, sometimes the west. Sometimes the patterns are too strange to explain coherently here. Again, I will reiterate, that a large enough amount of evidence is present to demand a greater investigation than these 'there's more air travel', 'it's just a contrail' catch all replies permit. It is a failure to see the huge incentives for such programs and the technology that they are in conjunction with. What's your take on the whole thing? Please state your reasons for regurgitating limiting and generalized defenses against the program.

       My take: the generally accepted conspiracy theory – that the white lines across the sky are not contrails, but "chemtrails" if they persist and spread – is not supported by any evidence. There is a simple explanation for them, using physics and meteorology, which does not require any chemicals or conspiracies. I invoke Occam's Razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I believe that contrail believers are actually harming serious investigation of geo-engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geo-engineering is a serious problem. Geo-engineering and chemtrails are not the same thing, and attempt to conflate them are just a dishonest way of giving chemtrail theory some credibility. "Look, here's a bunch of geo-engineering patents. Therefore, chemtrails! Look up, sheeple! They're poisoning our kids again!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hysterical bullshit. And it's compromising serious discussion of geo-engineering by lumping it in with the loony tunes tinfoil hat brigade who believe they can disperse chemtrails by spraying them with vinegar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree that greater investigation is needed. Air force whistleblower Kristen Meghan was on to something when she found suspicious undocumented chemicals being brought on to her base. Geo-engineering is supposed to be banned by international treaty, except for small scale local cloud busting and "experiments". In other words; if they want to do it, they will do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as long as there are dumbasses telling us all to "wake up" and "look up" and stare at the contrails – which are nothing more than harmless ice crystals – then even the people who
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       take the threat of geo-engineering seriously will be looking in the wrong place.
