        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>ALL CENSORED INFO WAS CENSORED BY ME. /U/NEWTRUTH221 ORIGINALLY POSTED ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT REMOVING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I HAVE SCANNED THE ALBUM MULTIPLE TIMES FOR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT I MAY HAVE MISSED. IF YOU FIND ANY, PLEASE PM ME AND I WILL GET RID OF IT IMMEDIATELY</strong></p>

<p>Here it is: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/tUV55">http://imgur.com/a/tUV55</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that this aligns 100% with the proof that was provided yesterday by the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> user who reported him and had him banned: <a href="http://imgur.com/26nlN9g">http://imgur.com/26nlN9g</a></p>

<p>From that exchange with the admin, it&#39;s clear that the admins were allowing <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> to continue his activities as long as he didn&#39;t include names. He and the admins agreed upon a line that could not be crossed and then he crossed it and was rightly banned. As other users have pointed out, <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> had been careful to toe that line since his last ban, but he DID slip-up pretty severely this time and posted a bunch of personal info.</p>

<p>A COUPLE NOTES:</p>

<p>I left a small portion of each Imgur url visible, so that you could see that it was the same image that <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> linked in the post without being able to find the unedited versions that he originally posted.</p>

<p>I left a couple of random (and harmless) portions of the images uncensored so that you could get an idea of what was being posted without furthering the spread of personal info.</p>

<p>I blocked out the name of the other <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user who replied to <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a>&#39;s comment because I don&#39;t want to provide an easy trail for someone who might go looking for archived versions of the original, uncensored post.</p>

<p>I blocked my own reddit username in the sidebar image because I took the screenshot from my main account, which I do not use for posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>I blocked a couple of items in my favorites bar because they are websites specific to my city of residence.</p>

<p><strong>All of the users who were defending <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> yesterday</strong>: The space to admit your mistake is in the comment section below <em>cough</em><a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a><em>cough</em>. I look forward to watching you move the goalposts.</p>

<p>In any context this would be a violation of Reddit&#39;s TOS. In this case, it was particularly ban-worthy because the context was that she was implicating this person in a horrible crime. It was further aggravated by <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a>&#39;s previous history of bans for posting personal information.</p>

<p>I see this as a &quot;you&#39;re not wrong, you&#39;re just an asshole&quot; type situation (the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> poster, not you). Yeah, that poster did seem to have a real hard-on for <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a>, and did break the rules of this sub, but that doesn&#39;t in any way excuse what <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> did.</p>

What is the worst that could happen from sharing information <strong>from completely public websites</strong>? It&#39;s bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_figure">Public figure</a></h2>

<p>In United States law, public figure is a term applied in the context of defamation actions (libel and slander) as well as invasion of privacy. A public figure (such as a politician, celebrity, or business leader) cannot base a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth).[1] The burden of proof in defamation actions is higher in the case of a public figure.</p>

<p>The controlling precedent in the United States was set in 1964 by the United States Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. It is considered a key decision in supporting the First Amendment and freedom of the press.</p>

<p>A fairly high threshold of public activity is necessary to elevate people to public figure status. Typically, they must either be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a public figure, either a public official or any other person pervasively involved in public affairs, or</li>
<li>a limited purpose public figure, meaning those who have &quot;thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.&quot; A &quot;particularized determination&quot; is required to decide whether a person is a limited purpose public figure, which can be variously interpreted.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to attorney Aaron Larson:[2]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person can become an &quot;involuntary public figure&quot; as the result of publicity, even though that person did not want or invite the public attention. For example, people accused of high profile crimes may be unable to pursue actions for defamation even after their innocence is established...</p>

<p>A person can also become a &quot;limited public figure&quot; by engaging in actions which generate publicity within a narrow area of interest. For example, [jokes about]... Terry Rakolta [an activist who spearheaded a boycott of the show Married With Children] were fair comments... within the confines of her public conduct [and] protected by Ms. Rakolta&#39;s status as a &quot;limited public figure&quot;.</p>

<p>The metadrama is irksome because what harm is there in a tiny, private sub researching a topic they find interesting?
