        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live a town over from Newtown, CT. I have been researching about some of the Sandy Hook event theories. After seeing odd things like the Robbie Parker &quot;getting into character&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKr-av9jVx8">video</a>, and the Parker family photo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzv5OthS7rU">photoshops</a>, among other things there is some weird stuff surrounding the event. I chose to reference these, because many of the theories seem very speculative, but these are some glaringly obvious oddities that leave me with a big question mark.</p>

<p>I feel that it is hard to say one way or another what actually happened that day, because there is incomplete evidence on either side. </p>

<p>I brought up these things with my mother yesterday and she also agreed that they are very odd. Although, being so close geographically to SH, my family knows many people connected to the alleged victims of that day.</p>

<p>Anyway my question is, having heard testimony from my mother yesterday about her personal connections to people who knew the victims families and medical staff who worked on victims at Danbury hospital. My sister also played basketball with the teacher who was allegedly killed, Soto, so she was not made up. How is it possible that these alleged victims didn&#39;t actually exist/weren&#39;t actually killed when I hear so many people in my life talking about the connections to the victims? </p>

<p>How is it possible to discredit all the people who have connections to these families? </p>

<p>Let me know what you think. Thanks.</p>

<p>Considering the very, very, basic examples you&#39;ve presented, I would imagine you&#39;ve only come to know about Sandy Hook being a fraud recently, and if you bother to do enough research you&#39;ll come to an obvious conclusion. Everyone with any sense does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been researching for some time, but it seems that many of the theories have a high amount of speculation. However I do find that the official report also contains speculation. Even the report that Adam Lanza was the shooter has a severe lack of concrete evidence. If there was just one video or picture of Adam anywhere near that school it would settle much of this, but there is not. There is not a single picture of the crime scene inside the school, and I get that they don&#39;t want pictures of victims on the internet, but there isn&#39;t any non-victim crime scene photos either. </p>

<p>Also that there was no blood cleanup is super strange, and that they knocked down the school, apparently while all the blood was still in there. Super weird.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is an obvious conclusion either way, too much speculation.</p>

<p>In your mind, what is the most compelling evidence that this is a hoax? since you are so researched, maybe you have read or seen something that I haven&#39;t seen yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that children were killed at SH but that&#39;s about all I believe of the official story. I can&#39;t think of a single justification for the secrecy of the government, except for the obvious answer: they&#39;re lying. When you compare SH to prior mass shootings like Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Aurora, SH stands out in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The events of SH stopped happening about 9:45am on Dec 14th. The official story changed continuously for the next 5 days, until, finally, the AR-15 was the weapon they claimed was used. An AR-15, in a close quarters scenario like SH, would have been awkward. The Izmash Saiga-12 magazine fed shotgun, purported to be in his car, would have been the first choice. Next, would have been the pistols. </li>
<li>Columbine HS, Virginia Tech&#39;s Norris Hall, and the Aurora movie theater are still standing. Why was SH torn down and down so quickly? Why were the demo workers forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement? </li>
<li>How could 112 lb Adam Lanza carry 100lbs worth of gear/ammo and still dispatch 27 people in the 600 seconds purported by police? Particularly, when most victims were shot numerous times in numerous rooms. </li>
<li>Where is the security camera footage? The authorities could debunk all of these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; if they released the clip of Lanza acting alone with an AR-15. In Columbine, you can find nearly the entire episode on the internet to include the shooters suicides. In Aurora, they released still shots from the lobby security camera.</li>

<p>The very first news conference the next day said that all the victims at the school were shot with the AR-15. The police never changed the story. The confusion was caused by people re-posting old news stories (from before the first press conference) over and over again.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Columbine HS was extensively remodeled over the summer and the library where most of the killings happened was torn down. The site of the Amish school shooting was also demolished quickly.</p>

<p>Norris Hall is still standing, but the classrooms where the shootings happened are not used as classrooms.</p>

<p>It was 30.47 pounds.</p>

<p>There was no video recorder attached to the security camera. It was just used so that personnel in the office could see who was at the front door.</p>

<p>Nope. Originally, they said the shootings were done with handguns. I even made a FB post the day after, saying that by Wednesday they&#39;d have that AR-15 in the building. It only took until Monday. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Norris Hall is used for engineering labs. The building is still standing, probably because they weren&#39;t worried about rounds of an inconvenient caliber or an inconvenient shot pattern being found like SH. </p>

<p>The police made no official statements on Friday about what weapons were used. Some media reported rumors of &quot;only handguns: being used.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatthefolly.com/2012/12/24/transcript-connecticut-state-police-briefing-on-the-sandy-hook-shooting-on-dec-16-2012/">At the very first press conference</a>, which was on Saturday, Lt. Vance said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s been questions about the weaponry and I&#39;d like to take a minute to discuss with you briefly — very superficially — some of the information that we can release at this time.</p>

<p>The weapon that was utilized most of the time during this horrific crime was identified as a Bushmaster AR-15 assault type weapon. It had high-capacity magazines.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the subject had in his possession a Glock 10mm, a Sig Sauer 9mm — both weapons — all weapons had multiple magazines and additional ammunition.</p>

<p>The fourth weapon recovered was a shotgun that was recovered from the suspect&#39;s vehicle that was parked outside the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say &quot;That&#39;s so implausible, it&#39;s funny. That&#39;s like buying a car with no wheels.&quot; It&#39;s used so that people can be buzzed inside from the office. I&#39;ve seen systems like this at many schools. I don&#39;t know what use a videotape system would be if the camera only covered the front door.</p>

(Off topic:  There&#39;s a story you guys don&#39;t even know about which happened around here involving them using their money and coverups.) What convinced me without a doubt Sandy Hook was a hoax was when Obama came on TV telling us we should feel bad for &quot;These poor mothers&quot; or something like that. It was like he cued them to fake cry for a couple of seconds. All because we want to keep our guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well take this into account.</p>

<p>The FBI has never classified or gotten involved in a school shooting investigation before, They did with sandy hook. That should tell you that something is not right.</p>

<p>Also the  whole entire narrative of the shooting has so many investigation plot holes, and things not adding up it might aswell be  Swisscheese hook.</p>

<p>And Something else  I don&#39;t think a lot of people realize is that   you know those pictures  of the kids walking in a line holding onto eachother?</p>

<p>Those were taken in the schools front  parking lot, Meaning the Cops and Disturbingly enough the Media where on the scene  so early(and in position) that  The kids were being evacuated as  the shooting was going on.</p>

<p>Also Theres a lot of strange stuff relating to the media and the police presence that day aswell, and that&#39;s something that needs to be carefully looked at.</p>

<p>Dunno. Pretty weird stuff though.</p>

<p>No offense intended but you could find tens of thousands of them at any Dio or Black Sabbath concert. Or many others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My uncle lived in Danbury when it went down and said he knew people that worked in the morgue and that it was extremely upsetting an unsettling for those that worked there. I don&#39;t doubt many died. But I firmly believe in ancient strains of demon worship that have permeated through the ages which heavily involve ritual sacrifice. It was undoubtedly a false flag. Any event that coincides directly with the globalist agenda and receives massive televised coverage usually is. Does this mean innocents were not murdered? No. Does this mean there was no shooter? No. But I really think something deeper is at work here. And this area of Connecticut and much of the surrounding area is extremely wealthy and I have no doubt in my mind that many people around there secretly and openly engage in occult practice and Crowleyan/thelema</p>

<p>IMO, there is not nearly enough evidence to be using words like undoubtedly. Conversely, it was not undoubtedly committed by Adam Lanza.</p>

<p>So all major events that are related to globalist agenda that is a false flag operation? The government for sure does not let a good tragedy go to waste (see 9/11) but it doesn&#39;t <em>necessarily</em> mean it was a false flag (9/11 probably was). Maybe it was, but not undoubtedly.</p>
