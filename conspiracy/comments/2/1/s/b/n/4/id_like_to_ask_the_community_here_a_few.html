        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>I mostly lurk here, i&#39;ve occasionally posted, but nothing of massive significance. I read this sub more than any other sub on reddit and read it probably 3-5 times a day. My motivation for being in the conspiracy sub is because i feel like i can be around like minded people. It certainly seems that from the time i started reading the sub, which was shortly after I joined reddit, there has been a lot of madness going on with vote brigading and shills and it&#39;s super interesting to see this stuff unravel and i am massively interested in how this is going to develop and what this subs community as a whole are going to do as it is apparent that there is a lot of censorship here. </p>

<p>Anyway, I digress.. the real reason I wanted to post here is day after day i see a lot of posts with a similar theme, which are very anti-israel, anti-judiasm / zionist etc and i just wanted to ask your opinions here as although I am atheist, I am still born a jew, and whilst i am not a religious person, I view the &#39;religion&#39; as more of a set of traditional values.</p>

<p>Please bare in mind, i am no way attacking or criticising anyone here, i am just looking to understand peoples opinions and points of view and hopefully value them in due course.</p>

<p>Whilst i appreciate that you are not pigeonholing me, or others who are born in to the jewish faith or similar, I have a lot of family in israel and really wanted to get a deeper understanding of why there is such a massive amount of anger directed toward israel.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, being born a jew or israeli does not automatically mean that i am consenting of the actions of the government or the actions of other jews/israelis. For one, I think its absolutely disgraceful what happened with the Depo-Provera incident and I actually tried to talk to a bunch of friends of mine who have moved out to israel, paste it to their facebooks, to find out it had been deleted minutes later because they don&#39;t want people to see that stuff. I will always speak up when i think something is out of place and naturally i think its a fucking disgrace that they would do that. This is one thing that stands out the most to me as just plain awful.</p>

<p>The israel I know is not the israel that you guys know, for me, its a holiday destination full of great nightlife, beautiful women and a massive amount of unity throughout the people who live there, from all walks of life. I have a lot of friends, and of course family who have been through the army and its something that really creates a common bond between everyone there. The lifestyle there is very relaxed. Israeli&#39;s, at least the ones I know, have no problem with arabs, palestinians, or the like, and infact work side by side with them in a lot of instances, also there is a massive amount of Somalians in israel too.</p>

<p>I would also like to let you guys know that whilst my family are not your classically religious type, they do observe kosher laws, myself and my brother do not as we have taken a different path in life, but nonetheless we are respectful when we go to visit the family.</p>

<p>Both myself and my brother are actually very anti-orthadox jews, where we live in the UK there is quite an abundance of them and there are goings on within the communities that are pretty disgraceful and the main reason which i don&#39;t really have much respect for the ultra orthadox black hat guys is because they feel that they don&#39;t need to work or provide any value to society and live in a bubble - whilst coming round to our houses every friday, doorknocking in an attempt to raise money for a shabbaton or something similar. In the same vein that i won&#39;t give money to a homeless guy drinking his ass off, im not going to give money to these guys either.</p>

<p>I fit a lot of the Jewish stereotypes however. Im a young, successful business owner and I am also actively seeking out a lodge to join the masons. And yes, there are a lot of Jewish masons and even jewish specific lodges. Are my reasons behind it anything malicious? Absolutely not, If anything i find it intriguing and see it as a great way to advance my business connections and create more success for myself and my family.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this post because day in day out i see posts out there which sort of urk me - i dont feel offended, i feel like i need to get an understanding of how YOU feel and get a better opinion. </p>

<p>I hope this post doesn&#39;t attract any negativity as I&#39;m simply looking to further expand my understanding of other people and even answer questions which you may have.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really relevant though, and it sounds a bit insensitive.  People are concerned about the long stream of human rights abuses, murders, and war crimes from the US, Israel, and... well, most nations.</p>

<p>Many Israelis and Americans seem to be unaware, or deliberately ignoring, the crimes committed by their nations&#39; military.  History teaches us this is a bad thing, and humanity teaches us to care about Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghanis, etc.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think you were trying to be insensitive.  The question to ask is, why does this happen?  Americans constantly talk about &quot;exporting freedom&quot; and spreading our wonderful culture, which is definitely insensitive given the hundreds of thousands of innocents&#39; murders and war crimes we have committed in Iraq alone.</p>

<p>The point is... and I think it&#39;s one of the important goals of this subreddit... is to ask questions.  Don&#39;t be that guy who blindly talks about how great Israel is in front of a group of people from other cultures who have suffered from Israel&#39;s military.</p>

<p>You have to work a bit to find alternative opinions.  They&#39;re not in the mainstream <del>propaganda</del> news.  But in America / Israel, those opinions are essential... they are often the voices of people who are being slaughtered, in some cases in a (literal) genocide.</p>

<p>Some day, I believe Americans and Israelis (and others) are going to be walked on tours through the Gitmos and Baghdads and other places we have committed war crimes, and we will be shamed, stunned, and in denial.</p>

<p>It is one thing to view these atrocities though pictures and video, but to see them up in person would drive the lesson deep into our memory. </p>

<p>I remember the first time learning that German citizens had to walk through some of the concentration camps...I never knew they were made to take those walks. </p>

<p>If people, are willing to give and follow orders, that kill innocent humans, from another country, why should we believe they will restrain themselves, if given the orders that might kill innocent humans in their home country?</p>

<p>I for one, would not put my life in the hands of people like this. Fortunate for all of us, we have our great leader, Commander-in-Chief Obama. He makes decisions for all Americans, even the ones who did not vote and voted against him. </p>

<ol>
<li>2012 US Population              313.9 million</li>
<li>2012 US Votes for Obama     62,611,250</li>
<li>2012 US Votes for Romney    59,134,475</li>
<li>2012 US Voter turnout         121,745,725 </li>
<li>2012 Non Voters                 192,154,275</li>
</ol>

<p>Even the cool, hip, black president, that just &quot;changed&quot; America 4 years ago, can&#39;t get half the country to vote. I think we should start those walks sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media didn&#39;t even report how large Obama&#39;s victory margin was.  And then things immediately went into &quot;scale back the victory&quot; mode.  The Democrats could have crushed the Republican party at that time, but chose to crush America instead.  They intentionally lost the Senate seat in Massachusetts so they could blame the Republicans for the health care reform sellout.</p>

<p>Obama didn&#39;t betray himself.  He knew what he was going to do, and it was scripted Democratic/Republican politics.</p>

<p>This is where I feel Obama did betray himself. If he did not betray himself, then he went in with full knowledge, his orders would be killing innocent civilians. He chose to ignore that fact. </p>

<p>The reason I bring up the election numbers is to show the support &quot;given&quot; to our beloved President Obama. The fact that games are being played with the interests of Americans is what is a crime. Politician worried about winning or losing is a crime to America. </p>

<p>Who cares if you win or lose an election? So long as that the people in office genuinely care and worry about their constituents, us, the people. </p>

<p>People&#39;s opinions of Israel don&#39;t really matter, unless you&#39;re running a marketing campaign.  The point of this sub (in my opinion) is to find the stories that are not being reported by state-controlled media, and to ask questions about what is really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but the thing here, is that the &#39;germans&#39; as a people were not entirely responsible.

    <div class="md"><p>The German people voted in a fascist dictator who espoused a vicious hatred of Jews long before his political career got started. They were traumatized by the first world war and allowed themselves to be overtaken politically and psychologically by a racist and violent doctrine. Although ordinary Germans weren&#39;t aware of Mengele&#39;s experiments or the furnaces and mass graves, they certainly knew that Jews were being imprisoned and deported en masse. </p>

<p>But I see what you&#39;re saying. Simply because a handful of Zionists are doing harm does not mean that all Jews should be condemned. But frankly, in the light of the crimes that are being committed by the Israeli regime in Gaza/West Bank and the cabal of Jewish bankers (as well as German and British) in international finance, such sentiments sound like excuses and they don&#39;t resonate with me. </p>

<p>Does that mean that I hate you or condemn you because you are Jewish? Does that mean that I distrust you or treat you differently? No, absolutely not. There are many, many, <em>many</em> Jews in the world whom have had a formative influence on my life -- people who incidentally viciously criticize the Israeli regime, like Noam Chomsky and the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Historians">New Historians.</a></p>

<p>But if you start saying things like, &quot;the Palestinians are terrorists, the government of Israel is just defending itself&quot; then I will look at you with pity and fault you for falling into the trap of yet another racist, violent doctrine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? What&#39;s being ignored in Israel?  It&#39;s the most condemned nation on earth.  At the UN Human Rights Council in this month alone there have been 5 resolutions condemning Israel. FIVE. Against a liberal democracy.  How many against all other countries in the world? Two.  One against Iran and one against North Korea. None against Russia, China, Cuba, Pakistan, Venezuela, or Zimbabwe. It&#39;s a fucking joke.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re trying really hard not to offend people here but it&#39;s a bad move, IMO.  The double-standards to which <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> holds Israel to is just emblematic of a long history of anti-Semitic conspiracies.  No other ethnicity have been blamed for conspiracies to the degree that Jews have been throughout history (think: Protocols of the Elders of Zion).</p>

<p>Israel isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s a liberal democracy like the best of the countries in the world are.  None are perfect but damn, understand the history and circumstances facing the country and you&#39;d be amazed that the country has managed to be one of the most just countries in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care whether Israel is mostly jews or mostly whatever else. It has no meaning for me what their religion or ethnicity is, except insofar as it is exclusionary. You know, South Africa had a very large black population, but most everyone agreed it was a racist system because it excluded blacks from power, and it seems as though Israel is equivalent. I&#39;m sure SA had great nightclubs, too, but that&#39;s really not the measure of a society, is it?</p>

I can see how actual Israeli society may differ from an outsider&#39;s supposed jewish society. Anyone can make something up and call it &#39;jewish&#39; society. And what is with the quotes? Do you mean Israeli society, or do you mean &#39;israeli&#39; society? What is &#39;israeli&#39; society?</p>

<p>In regard to your initial post you said</p>

I don&#39;t feel it is exclusionary. It is exclusionary.</p>

<p>It doesnt actually make much sense - why is it under certain circumstances? I completely dissagree with it being exclusionary if thats what your asking, given that the generations of my family can be traced back much further and in fact have a very ethnically mixed background.</p>

<p>I know a fair amount of christian people who have done alliyah and moved to israel permanently. So No, i dont agree.</p>

<p>Well, you said what people call &#39;jewish&#39; society. I don&#39;t know what any one person might call &#39;jewish&#39; society. I was asking for clarification.</p>

<p>There are circumstances under which a non-jewish person can claim the privilege of return, though it still has to do with judaism. If you don&#39;t consider that Israeli law based on religious beliefs is exclusionary, well, then you don&#39;t believe that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what alliyah is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, congrats on coming out of the shadows after so long, and welcome. I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve been here lurking for a long time then you have seen the many complaints people have with Israel and Zionists. Their treatment of the Arab nations they are neighbored with and the Palestinian people they are displacing is well documented here. I&#39;m not going to go list them all in detail because like I said, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen many of them. I&#39;d rather go into why I personally feel that the crimes of Israel get more attention than crimes of other nations, such as Chad, or DPRK, or the DRC. Yes, I believe the actual acts of many other places are worse than Israel. However, I believe that people hold Israel to higher standards. The reason is because Israel presents itself as having higher standards. Let me use myself for an example. I am not of one of the faiths of the Book. However, as an American I was brought up around it and it is ingrained in me like it is in most other Americans. All of my life I was raised to believe that the blight of the Jewish people was legendary. They had always been oppressed, yet persevered and because of their rightousness they would someday be relieved of the oppression that they have always endured. When I took an interest in middle eastern history and learned that everything I believed about this people was not only a lie, but often the opposite of reality. I felt a DEEP animosity and even though I am not religious I felt betrayed. I&#39;m not saying that the Jewish people haven&#39;t gone through hardships, I&#39;m just saying that not only were they not the shining beacon of light that we as Americans are raised to believe, the actions of the nation of Israel are on par with the very horror stories they claim to have gone thru. Obviously, not as bad as Nazi Germany but horrible none the less. I believe because of this betrayal that people tend to focus more on their crimes. I don&#39;t believe this is the main reason people focus on Israel&#39;s actions, just one of the many reasons.</p>

<p>Another reason is because literally the entire Middle East is inflamed over what Israel is doing to the populations of Palestine and her other neighbors. Sure, North Korea&#39;s human rights record is atrocious but it&#39;s not causing half of Asia to be at war. Of course, in the Near and Middle East Islam is also at war with itself and this is a major problem. But again, we expect better from Israel because we are raised to believe that they are better than that.</p>

<p>Finally, America is literally Israel&#39;s lap dog. We roll over when she says to, and we attack when she says to. It is illegal for foreign powers to lobby in America&#39;s system yet Israel not only does, it is one of the most powerful lobbys there is. Our debt is out of control, our military is stretched thin, and the world hates us, largely because of our actions at Israel&#39;s bidding. Israel is in way over her head and the ONLY reason she has survived her aggression is because we protect her.  I don&#39;t want to see my nation ruined at the hands of another nation, much less one that thinks we are less than they are because we weren&#39;t chosen by God. </p>

<p>I would love to see peace in the middle east, and I would love to see the nations of this area restored to the respected positions they have earned as some of the most documented and ancient peoples on earth. However, when it comes to Israel and Arabia, I am getting to the point where I would rather see them just wipe each other out than to continue dragging the world down with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the points you have touched on in your response are pretty much the exact reason why I made this post in the first place. In terms of the historical aspects, there is certainly a heavy emphasis on the holocaust and yes, i do feel it is/has been used to justify un-needed things. </p>

<p>I have been to several holocaust museums in eastern europe and obviously its absolutely shocking stuff, not to mention that I personally know people whos family were affected all those years ago by the holocaust and it really is a very dark time in the Jewish history. Do i think that it justifies things to this day? No. Do i believe the numbers that were given, changed, etc, i really don&#39;t know but I have been doing some reading and it&#39;s something i&#39;m on the fence about. </p>

<p>I am obviously impressed and applaud the fact that you have taken it upon yourself to understand and uncover the history of the region in your own way and naturally a lot of this stuff has been written out of the history books, i don&#39;t doubt that for a second. However, it is not an area which I can talk about with any real knowledge as I simply don&#39;t have a big enough understanding of it to comment in an intelligent way.</p>

<p>There is a lot of grey area for me when it comes to the america/israel partnership because I really don&#39;t know what to think. On one hand, it is fact that there are a lot of captains of industry, and high up politicians who are Jewish - can i comment on what that means on an ongoing basis..not really, because i genuinely have not done enough research in that area. Although, there is pretty solid evidence that there is a strong Jewish lobby and that they will do whatever they can to get their way, and I have started reading in to why certain bills have been passed and who they have been passed because of that relates to a Jewish person in a high up position in global/economic leadership or similar.</p>

<p>I would also love to see peace in the middle east, but i think that it is a term which has been thrown around for people to look up at the stars and wish for. I don&#39;t know if it will ever happen because its just a comforting thought for us all to have whilst we are completely unaware of what may be going on behind the scenes. I feel the same about this as I do about when I learnt how the Bush family has long standing relationships with the very same families they are blaming for 9/11 - if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>In terms of the israeli military doing things in neighbouring countries, again, this is something I have been looking for more answers for. My cousins who range from 18 right up to grown up with kids, have served in a mixture of positions ranging from intel, soldiers, infantry, medical, etc, and I have asked them all what happens, have they killed anyone, etc. NONE of them have killed anyone, and pretty much unanimously, in response to &#39;do you mess with people just to mess with them&#39;, they look at me like im crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>just to answer your q&#39;s</p>

<p>&quot;As a jew do you find your community fearful of the non jew? Do you think this can act as defence mechanism that binds you together and perhaps it is something that can be used to manipulate your community to act in ways which attract unwanted attraction?&quot;</p>

<p>I think that as with any other ethnic group/communtiy you tend to somewhat stick together and I think that is more prevelant in the orthadox Jewish communities, they are very very isolated but do so intentionally and like I said in my OP, they live in a bubble. for me personally, I enjoy branching out and getting to understand people from all walks of life, i have friends from just about every ethnic background and proudly so. </p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything to the saying buy from a jew sell to anyone?&quot;
Never heard this before lol, so i cant really comment on the saying haha.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it common to think of non jews as goyim?&quot;</p>

<p>If I personally knew someone who did think in that way, which i don&#39;t, i would either smack them upside the head and remind them we are all humans or completely distance myself from them. I think that mentality is poisonous, no matter what religion or belief you belong to.</p>

<p>Could you explain your comment on &quot;Do you feel some jews or jewish organisations act in a way to attract unwanted criticism?&quot; , im not sure I understand what you mean, would you mind elaborating. </p>
