<p>Not if any &quot;viable third party&quot; is working and functioning within the currently incorrigibly corrupt system as it stands.  That system will take any party&#39;s stance and corrupt it because THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT.  It&#39;s not about &quot;supporting&quot; any third party.  It&#39;s about changing the system within which all of the parties function in the first place.  Part of that change begins taking place by not supporting it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you believe not voting is the answer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I don&#39;t believe not voting is &quot;the&quot; answer.  It&#39;s certainly <em>an</em> answer, however.  It&#39;s a step in the direction that will eventually let those whose eyes are still closed finally (hopefully) see that voting never ever made a difference in the first place - not in <em>this</em> particular system anyway - and hopefully that will begin to help allow people to wake up and see that the SYSTEM is corrupt and will begin to change it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what are you doing/going to do in order to break from the apathetic line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&quot;Apathy...is most commonly defined as a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, and/or passion.&quot;</em></p>

<p>You have to understand that apathy is actually not as bad a thing as this society has made it out to be.  Apathy as it relates to the specific topic that we are here discussing involves not having an interest in the system as it currently exists.</p>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> have an interest in the system as it currently exists.  What am I going to do to &quot;break from the apathetic line&quot;?</p>

<p>I wonder if the apathetic line should even be broken away from in the first place as it relates to not having an interest in this system as it currently stands.  Also, we&#39;re dealing with semantics in a sense here because if, for example, the entire citizenry of the United States decided to engage in communal, non participation in the system as it stands, then the system would not only come to a grinding halt, but pretty much any demand that the citizenry make would be listened to and met.  Now, think about it:  That &quot;non participation&quot; can be 100% looked upon as an absolute form of apathy.</p>

<p>The point being made here is that there are many actions that would actually <em>benefit</em> our lot as a citizenry that many would call &quot;apathetic&quot;.  </p>

<p>What we need to do is be apathetic about <em>the right</em> things:  Don&#39;t vote in the system as it <em>currently</em> exists, don&#39;t pay certain types of taxes designed more to hurt the public than to help, don&#39;t participate in certain aspects of the grinding, manipulative system, don&#39;t be &quot;passionate!&quot; about your particular race, ethnicity, religion, etc in exclusion or aggressive opposition to others, etc.  However, of course, be active in OTHER areas of the system - promote greater awareness, understanding, and education of different thoughts, perspectives, peoples, cultures, etc, promote greater unity and communication amongst the population, etc, etc...</p>

<p>So what am <em>I</em> doing to &quot;break away from the <del>apathetic</del> ignorance line&quot;?  I post videos, I read as much as possible, I speak to as many people as I can about topics that I feel are important.  I listen to others&#39; perspectives and try to learn as much as possible about what others have to say.  I promote racial tolerance and do what I can to spread a message of intelligence, critical thinking, and spiritual development.</p>

<p>I work on <em>myself</em> as much as possible, and try to allow this to rub off on others if the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>What are you doing?  Voting?  Are you voting?  Is that it?  Do people go into the ballot box, punch the button or fling the lever or whatever it is one does one one goes in and votes (I&#39;ve never done it before, so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s done) and then proceed to go home and not do anything else because they think &quot;I&#39;ve done my part!&quot;?  Do people act however it is they feel like acting outside int he world and not worry about it because on Sunday they go to church, enter into another little &quot;ballot box&quot; confessional and tell their sins to a priest...and everything&#39;ll be forgiven and it&#39;s okay?</p>

<p>What do people who <em>do</em> vote really do to help themselves and to help the system?</p>

<p>Voting certainly won&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not, by the way, saying that <em>you</em> in particular don&#39;t do anything.  I&#39;m not indicting you or anything.  I don&#39;t know you, of course, so I&#39;m not assuming.  However, I <em>am</em> letting it be known that there are really a lot of ways to be a productive human being that <em>don&#39;t</em> involve &quot;voting and working in the political system&quot; as it stands.</p>
