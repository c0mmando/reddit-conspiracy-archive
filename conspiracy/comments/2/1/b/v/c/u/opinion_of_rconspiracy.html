I thought i was gonna see some good conspiracies here, about all kinds of different stuff. But all it is now, is just &quot;the government is out to get us.&quot; 911, Newtown, Boston Bombings, all staged by the government? Look i get that there are plot holes, but that doesn&#39;t mean everyone is out to get us, bad things happen all the time and they don&#39;t have to be inside jobs. I think looking for another reason something happened is cool and all, but sometimes things just happen. I&#39;ll probably get down voted for this, or be accused of working for the government, but i just wanted to get my opinion out there</p>

<p>There are a fair number of posters in here who really do seem to believe <em>everything</em> is part of an orchestrated plot.</p>

<p>They will make up, entirely out of thin air, an alternative theory for almost anything reported in the mainstream media. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve literally seen someone say that whatever was printed in the media, on any story, was a lie. Basically, if the media is reporting it, you know it&#39;s disinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the conspiracy theories here are a bit far fetched and don&#39;t even make sense. But I&#39;d say they are a minority.</p>

<p>Most of the people who post things about the government &quot;being out to get us&quot; actually support their argument with either proof or research that shows that something is very suspicious. So I wouldn&#39;t want people stop posting that stuff just because they&#39;re worried about being judged.</p>

<p>Also, if you think about your argument re the US government: They&#39;re the same group of people. If they do something once and get away with it what&#39;s to stop them from doing it again? Once something is pulled off successfully then a precedent is set. So I&#39;d say once the government do even one thing that can be proven to be malicious then they definitely are out to get us.</p>
