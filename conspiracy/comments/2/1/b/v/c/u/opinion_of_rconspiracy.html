       I've been lurking on this thread for a while now. I thought i was gonna see some good conspiracies here, about all kinds of different stuff. But all it is now, is just "the government is out to get us." 911, Newtown, Boston Bombings, all staged by the government? Look i get that there are plot holes, but that doesn't mean everyone is out to get us, bad things happen all the time and they don't have to be inside jobs. I think looking for another reason something happened is cool and all, but sometimes things just happen. I'll probably get down voted for this, or be accused of working for the government, but i just wanted to get my opinion out there

       Ones that have evidence? Those pop up from time to time (Big Oil funding climate change-deniers, banks writing the rules that govern them, Russia assassinating journalists), but they're drowned out by coincidences and missing planes. Banks do get talked about often, but mostly about bankers killing themselves at a rate consistent with other professions.

       There's that saying... When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a fair number of posters in here who really do seem to believe
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is part of an orchestrated plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will make up, entirely out of thin air, an alternative theory for almost anything reported in the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've literally seen someone say that whatever was printed in the media, on any story, was a lie. Basically, if the media is reporting it, you know it's disinformation.

       Some of the conspiracy theories here are a bit far fetched and don't even make sense. But I'd say they are a minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people who post things about the government "being out to get us" actually support their argument with either proof or research that shows that something is very suspicious. So I wouldn't want people stop posting that stuff just because they're worried about being judged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think about your argument re the US government: They're the same group of people. If they do something once and get away with it what's to stop them from doing it again? Once something is pulled off successfully then a precedent is set. So I'd say once the government do even one thing that can be proven to be malicious then they definitely are out to get us.

       A lot if the anti-government views come from a HUGE group of conservatives and libertarians in here. Just look at comments that talk about things like currency or Common Core; anything that doesn't toe the conservative line is downvoted to Hell.

       i would much rather "deal" with them by not paying them my attention than have someone espousing authoritarian viewpoints like yours "getting rid" of any content here.
      </p>
      <p>
       criticisms like yours, about who to get rid of in the sub, are very consistent with the rinse and repeat complaints about racists bigots and deniers used by the 'tard forum, as if they really cared at all about the credibility of this sub. it's warfare, not ethics.

       I've never seen anyone with a r/conspiracy post history deny climate change or gay rights. I've seen people object to big business profiting from renewable energy in ways that are unethical, but never deny climate change.

       However, I have seen people who usually spend their time on other subreddits come here and say stuff like that but they get downvoted. They're just here to make us look like dicks but they're easy to spot and we don't put up with it.

       To be fair; anthropogenic global warming and climate change are different things, though interested parties have been using propaganda to make them seem the same since the global warming thing began to unravel. The consensus (or as close to it as we get) in this subreddit appears to be that attempts to make human activity the driver of climate change is an NWO political and economic conspiracy using captured science, but climate change of some kind is never-the-less occurring through natural means which remain obscured by that same captured science.

       Interestingly I've found it's basically impossible to make reasonable predictions about political opinion among conspiracy theorists. It seems people at the more extreme ends of both sides of the political spectrum are attracted to various conspiracy ideas.

       I dig this sub but lately it's been irking me when random users wander through and are then met with an onslaught of paid shill comments. I know that their are literal shills, like the Occulus/Facebook cross post guy, but, most people aren't. I don't remember the thread topic of my first post on this Sub, but I do know it didn't take long for people to call me a shill. I didn't even know what a shill was at the time and was legitimately asking questions. I dunno..like I said I like this sub I just wish people would relax a little.
