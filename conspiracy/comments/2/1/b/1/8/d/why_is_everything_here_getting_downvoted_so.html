Or perhaps - and I&#39;m just throwing this out there - some posts get upvoted and others get downvoted, based on merit. But that wouldn&#39;t fit persecution complexes that see shills lurking behind a skeptical keyboard, would it?</p>

<p>Nope. Here&#39;s the current list - none of which, I should point out, have I voted on.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 up, 0 down. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21da72/dhs_and_pre_crime_technology/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21da72/dhs_and_pre_crime_technology/</a></li>
<li>2 up, 1 down. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21da2t/us_will_not_appeal_judges_ruling_in_nofly_list/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21da2t/us_will_not_appeal_judges_ruling_in_nofly_list/</a></li>
<li>3 up, 3 down. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21d9xc/obama_deflecting_criticism_calls_russia_a/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21d9xc/obama_deflecting_criticism_calls_russia_a/</a></li>
<li>4 up, 6 down <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21d9f5/big_pharma_shill_defends_bill_for_reeducation_of/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21d9f5/big_pharma_shill_defends_bill_for_reeducation_of/</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>So, actually, only one in four posts is below zero - and that one deservedly so. I&#39;m going back to vote it down right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you read each post and research the claims made within? Or do you downvote just because you don&#39;t agree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends. I should mention, the vast majority of posts I don&#39;t vote on at all. But certain sources, buzzwords e.g. &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; and topics are basically guaranteed to get a thumbs down. I don&#39;t <strong>need</strong> to research another EVERYBODY IN SANDY HOOK GOT FREE HOMES post much, in order to vote it down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s happened to me a couple of times. Like, for example, why do you have 6 down votes? Are people disagreeing with your question? Why down vote a legitimate question?</p>

<p>Granted, yours is one of a thousand posts about this so it may just be that it&#39;s not really &quot;new&quot;, but having a reminder every now and then that this is happening doesn&#39;t hurt. Especially those who surf new instead of just hot.</p>

You know, the ones that make up the conspiracy theorist steriotype. I personally refrain from downvoting except in cases of egregious idiocy, but I&#39;m sure there are a lot of people who browse through here and every time they see something that could be classified as sensationalist go &quot;oh for fucks sake&quot; and hit that blue arrow. Not every down vote is a shill people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m one guy, and cannot prove that there aren&#39;t shills on my own, but at least entertain another option besides there being a concerted attack on this sub. Shit gets downvoted for no reason on all the subreddits. Also, vote smudging or whatever it&#39;s called. I don&#39;t understand how it works, but I know that the number of true up and down votes is not what you see.</p>

<p>Oh, no, It has to be &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>If you are going to post something and then choose r/conspiracy, maybe you should use that handy little search function and see it there is already a post and thread about it instead of trying to blindly gain upvotes.</p>

<p>and all these selfconspiracy posts? We use to never have those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because the constant calls of &quot;shill!&quot; is a pointless ad hom that doesn&#39;t advance discussion? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, whenever a post on this sub gets popular enough to reach the front page or upcoming list or whatever, a more representative cross-section of Reddit starts to contribute. Naturally, Reddit at large is less accepting of conspiracy theories than this sub. So, what you baselessly suspect is a squad of government agents invading your post is actually the normal Internet reacting to your ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Constant? I hope you mean in general because I only said it once in that certain sense. As well as I replied to someone, I didn&#39;t start a comment in which I accused a part of an existing thread, so that at the very least should not be punishable. I&#39;d understand it if it was a sole comment accusing others of being Shill but a response , doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Why would people be paid to discredit the opinions of those on this subreddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well for starts, you imply that all we have here are opinions, which is untrue. Secondly, there is an extremely belittling connotation behind your statement, &quot;this subreddit&quot;, as if it&#39;s so incredulous that people would want to stop us from sharing information about internet propaganda and rhetoric and how it&#39;s used against people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one reason &quot;they&quot; would want to stop <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from being a viable avenue for the free flow of information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has r/conspiracy actually achieved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implying we havn&#39;t achieved anything here probably is making people downvote you as well, because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has achieved a LOT, notably in making us all aware of the powers that be and this bullshit system they&#39;re trying to fuck us through. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has made more informed citizens who know their rights and are willing to fight for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the British Government, under JTRIG, attacked hackers that targeted Government Websites...which is totally understandable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh so when they do it it&#39;s okay, but when WE do it it&#39;s jail time, and that&#39;s okay..............</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is every theory the truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, another derisive statement implying members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are unable to discern fact versus speculation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am simply, and innocently, enquiring.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk nonsense, sir.  You&#39;re generalising what I&#39;ve said to support your argument.  Accusing someone of being a &#39;shill&#39; for down-voting an article supporting Chemtrails, or fake moon landings is silly.  So why would Government Agents pay people to do this?  The stupidity of those theories are apparent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the reasoning of what you are saying.  I was more concerned with the down-vote factor.  And, yes, it does sound paranoid.  How do you separate the reason from madness?<br/>
I am not saying all conspiracy theorists are crazy.  YOU put those words in my mouth.
I said that there are people who will naturally down-vote &#39;faked moon landing&#39; articles and you then went on about Alex Jones, etc, style PAID conspiracy nuts.
Simply, I believe that down-votes are not the work of &#39;shills&#39;, or whatever, because I believe r/conspiracy hasn&#39;t CHANGED anything.  It&#39;s easily deniable, whether a conspiracy, or not.
Yes, people may be more &#39;awake&#39;, etc, but that&#39;s none of the governments concern.  Groups hacking their websites are.  I&#39;ve been told this is a smokescreen - show me the evidence and I will read.
If you had convinced people to storm the white house/downing street with force, then maybe they would take action on the internet.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I was trying to say that people will down-vote on their own accord if they believe something to be ridiculous.
You can believe in what you want, I was never trying to change your opinion.</p>

<p>What reason from what madness? Where is the context? I don&#39;t know what you are refering to, thus I am unable to answer that question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying all conspiracy theorists are crazy. YOU put those words in my mouth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true, though you were strongly implying it as you stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is reassuring to meet CT that actually have some evidence to support their claims and some rationality regards what they do and do not believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not believe that all down-votes are the work of shills either, it&#39;s all sorts of people and I honestly can&#39;t claim to know who any of them are.</p>

<p>You believe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hasn&#39;t changed anything. Good for you, and your wrong opinion, because it has changed things.</p>

<p>It has changed peoples fear of labelling themselves as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and talking to random people about government corruption.</p>

<p>For me personally, it provided actual legitimate evidence of 9/11 being a government involved conspiracy, rather than all of the misinformation that was being paraded around so as to be debunked by the likes of &quot;popular mechanics&quot; in an attempt to &quot;end the conspiracy theories&quot;, a sad and pathetic attempt as it turns out Popular Mechanics are LIARS in claiming that thermate can&#39;t cut steel beams, which it absolutely provably can, you can do it yourself today if you feel so inclined to buy all the materials.</p>

<p>People being more awake IS the governments concern, because you can&#39;t lie to people who know you are lying to them.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use a performative on a person that knows what a performative is and exactly how it&#39;s being used.</p>

<p>They very much do want to control the free flow of information on the internet, because that free flow of information exposes them and the tactics they use to continue in their illegal activities.</p>

<p>People obviously down-vote on their own accord if they think something is ridiculous, I do that all the time, what is your point in stating obvious facts?</p>

<p>TL;DR - Refute the content of my post POINT BY POINT, don&#39;t try DODGING what I say with your misdirect attempts. Also, holy fuck, click the &quot;formatting help&quot; button under the comment reply text box, so that you can learn how to properly quote people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know what you were trying to say, which is why I asked for clarification, which you provided, thanks.</p>

<p>As you&#39;ve already stated, yes, I don&#39;t know why downvotes happen, I can only speculate, just like everybody else.</p>

<p>I do know for a fact that there are downvote brigades on reddit, and I know for a fact certain users which are involved in these activities.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="/r/stalkerwatch">/r/stalkerwatch</a> to see some of the anti-conspiracy crew on reddit. <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">/u/BipolarBear0</a> is the ring leader, <a href="/u/redping">/u/redping</a> is in bed with him along with <a href="/u/celocanth13">/u/celocanth13</a> , <a href="/u/fab500">/u/fab500</a> , <a href="/u/herkimer">/u/herkimer</a> , and many many more.</p>

<p>Just look into those people alone if you want to view how people troll/shill reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the shills on reddit are not from the government, they are from private interests looking to protect their financial standings, such as Monsanto and Comcast.</p>

<p>Shilling happens in very small quasi-legal ways as well, like the post where a redditor claims his sister got him a pringles cake for his birthday. More than likely, pringles had one of their employees do this, it&#39;s obvious advertising.</p>

<p>Other places, like <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a>, don&#39;t need shills for the purposes of advertising, because those mouth breathing casuals all love fucking cheetos and mountain dew and love expressing this when they get &quot;the munchies&quot; because they&#39;re ignorant of the harms of those foods. There was a &quot;yoohoo is the nectar of the Gods&quot; post and you could tell it wasn&#39;t a shill, just another casual being ignorant as fuck enjoying chocolate flavored corn syrup water touting it as the best drink ever so as to &quot;fit in&quot; and &quot;be cool&quot;.</p>

<p>TL;DR - It&#39;s pretty easy to spot the advertising shills and big-pharma big-ag shills. It&#39;s much harder to spot the trolls, however, which is the reason for rule 10.</p>

<p>Again, check out <a href="/u/redping">/u/redping</a> , <a href="/u/fab500">/u/fab500</a>, <a href="/u/herkimer">/u/herkimer</a> , and any other accounts connected to them, especially through the moderation of subs. These users are all known trolls, though the level of their trolling ( or possible shilling ) is hard to determine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s really tough, and for me the hardest part about this whole conspiracy thing.

<p>If there are enough holes in the official story it would indicate to me that it&#39;s either fabricated or not giving us enough of the data to come to the correct conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I think that the entire town was actors. I said it was suspicious. Have you even seen the clip I&#39;m talking about? I would have said the same thing as you before I actually watched it, hence my saying it sounds ridiculous until you actually look in to it. Aside from that I don&#39;t actually subscribe to any of the theories floating around - I just don&#39;t believe the official story.</p>

<p>Edit: I wouldn&#39;t class his laughter as nervous, either.</p>

<p>Edit2: I also want to add that it wasn&#39;t me looking to connect dots, although it&#39;s great that you think you know me better than I know myself, as before I looked in to it I thought the fact there could be a conspiracy surrounding Sandy Hook was ridiculous and disrespectful. It was after I saw those things that I thought there was something going on and not the other way around, which if you could get past your own bias on the subject you would see is exactly what I wrote. It seems to me that it is <strong>you</strong> that is connecting dots to follow your own views, while allowing you to disregard others at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nevertheless, you have connected some spurious dots that paint the wrong picture. I can make the same observations as you about the event, but I immediately realized the implications of trying to paint them as evidence of a conspiracy. For example, if the parents were actors, then the families must be fictitious. If the families are fictitious, the victims must be fictitious. If the victims are fictitious, the entire school must somehow be in on it, since otherwise they would notice that students and staff were invented out of thin air. The conspiracy would also imply that the first responders are conspirators, as well as the hospitals that reported receiving casualties, as well as the investigating agencies.</p>

<p>I know you said you don&#39;t ascribe to any particular conspiracy theory, but these are the undeniable implications of the line of thought that begins with &quot;the victims are fake&quot;. Not only would a conspiracy of this magnitude be extremely improbable to pull off, its improbability would make it extremely improbable to even be attempted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fallacious thinking, even saying that he was an actor for now... the family does not need to be fake - although it does increase the probability of that being the case it most certainly does not mean that they are mutually inclusive. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things about Sandy Hook which are suspicious, the father is just one of them - but it&#39;s the one which I feel stresses how odd the entire thing is. </p>

<p>The families moving in to the area shortly before. </p>

<p>The houses that the victims families moved in to prior to the event.</p>

<p>The coroner being unable to answer simple yet very important questions.</p>

<p>The portaloo&#39;s and the sign saying everyone must check in. The christmas trees. </p>

<p>The kids skipping away from the shool.</p>

<p>The covered body sitting up on the stretcher.</p>

<p>The helicopter shot which shows people walking in circles through the building.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some of these things will be innocent or plain wrong, I would love to have the time on my hands to be able to go through each one of these and verify that there was something odd about each one of the things I&#39;ve listed, and taking each one by themselves - there isn&#39;t really anything too odd about them, it&#39;s that there is so many things which are suspicious about Sandy Hook which makes me feel that we aren&#39;t getting the truth. But the video of the father, that really sits wrong with me, I really hope you have watched it and aren&#39;t just arguing for the sake of it because that video is just wrong. That is not the look of a father who has just had their child murdered by a gun wielding psychopath shortly before. That is not shock and it is not grief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those observations are meaningless, especially when put up against the implausible conspiracy you imply. </p>

<p>Do you actually think a massive school shooting secret false flag would employ a big public sign asking people to sign in? Isn&#39;t it more likely to be completely unrelated, or perhaps part of standard procedure to sign in before visiting a school? There are a dozen things that are more plausible than a comically absurd blinking sign that indicates the shooting is a hoax. </p>

<p>Further, do you really think a government agent crisis actor would do character warm-ups in front of a camera? And not be in character the whole time in public? You are making a lot of assumptions about how people should act in an unprecedented crisis. There are accounts of people hysterically laughing when they found out JFK was assassinated only to be overcome with grief.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, I did not say that I thought it was a false flag, nor did I say that I thought a shooting did not happen. I said that I don&#39;t believe we are being told the truth and that I do not believe that man is who he is supposed to be.</p>

<p>You would choose an industrial sign to inform people they have to sign in before entering the school? You don&#39;t think something in reception would do better? Still, as I said, alone it isn&#39;t that suspicious.</p>

<p>I have been around quite a few people in shock and in grief. Hysterical laughter is pretty common, yes. That man is not hysterical, nor, in my opinion, is he displaying any signs of shock or grief. That reaction is also usually upon <em>first</em> hearing the news, which was not the case for the man in question.</p>

<p>And yes, actors get in the zone all the time right before they think the camera is to roll. I agree with you that if he was an actor then he shouldn&#39;t break character but mistakes do happen.</p>

<p>Stop attributing theories to what I am saying, I&#39;m not implying anything other than what I am explicitly stating and at the moment that equates to the public not being told the whole truth about what happened at Sandy Hook and someone appearing on tv who I do not believe is who he said he was.</p>

<p>This is not an unprecidented event, either. There have been school shootings before and in all cases I can think of there has been a lot more proof of what happened released to the public.</p>

<p>This is a lie and a smear against my character, if <a href="/u/tuckerbest">/u/tuckerbest</a> is indeed refering to myself, which I&#39;m pretty positive he is. I&#39;m pretty positive because he is using rhetorical generalizations, making false claims, and projecting his actions onto me ( claims of &quot;arguing with things I haven&#39;t even said&quot;, he is doing that to me in trying to put words into my mouth).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21b18d/why_is_everything_here_getting_downvoted_so/cgbdacy">Read this whole exchange starting with my reply to him, I do not feel /u/tuckerbest is here for legitimate discussion, his posts reek of rhetorical dishonesty.</a></p>

<p>Edit2: I also want to add that it wasn&#39;t me looking to connect dots, although it&#39;s great that you think you know me better than I know myself, as before I looked in to it I thought the fact there could be a conspiracy surrounding Sandy Hook was ridiculous and disrespectful. It was after I saw those things that I thought there was something going on and not the other way around, which if you could get past your own bias on the subject you would see is exactly what I wrote. It seems to me that it is <strong>you</strong> that is connecting dots to follow your own views, while allowing you to disregard others at the same time.</p>
