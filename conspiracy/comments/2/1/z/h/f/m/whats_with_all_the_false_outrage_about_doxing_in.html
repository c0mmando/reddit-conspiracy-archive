So much false outrage and crocodile tears, it seems a little weird. In the war for our minds, they&#39;re trying to turn words like &quot;investigation&quot; into a scary new word: &quot;doxing.&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like we&#39;re so close to exposing some major plots, and the closer we get, the more bannings happen and the more &quot;moral warriors&quot; come out of nowhere to tell us that investigating and sharing facts (freedom of speech) are bad, and something to be ashamed of. </p>

<p>What is going on? Is there a safe space on the web where we can speak? Are we going to see more &quot;bad words&quot; like &quot;doxing&quot; used to intimidate us?</p>

<p>doxing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doxing is an abbreviation of document tracing,  the Internet-based practice of researching and publishing personally identifiable information about an individual.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s odd with its recent use in this forum, is that, my understanding of the term, is the &quot;outing&quot; of someone who wished to remain anonymous. Personal feelings aside on Sandy Hook, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we&#39;ve witnessed.</p>

<p>So was <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> &quot;doxxing&quot; by making public information on the internet available on Reddit? No, as he didn&#39;t unveil anyone&#39;s identity who wished to remain anonymous through document tracing or &quot;doxxing.&quot; Did it breach Reddit&#39;s TOS? The admins said so. </p>

<p>What Adrien Chen of Gawker did to <a href="/u/violentacrez">/u/violentacrez</a> was Doxxing- an investigation that &quot;unmasked&quot; the identity of someone on this site who had hoped to stay anonymous. </p>

<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web/all">http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web/all</a></p>

<p>Whatever people think about Sandy Hook and <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a>, words <em>do</em> have meaning. Posting someone&#39;s personal information, that they posted on the web themselves, unassociated with any anonymous account, just isn&#39;t doxxing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah kids have turned doxing into anything pertaining to personal info, names, addresses, pictures, habits, cars, other posts.  It doesn&#39;t matter if its public info or not.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if people are just being dumb or if its a concerted effort.  I don&#39;t think so though, I think its just political correctness going too far and being used as an EXCUSE to silence people that other people don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>reddit though can make any rule they like, they could ban everyone who used the letter A if they wanted.  Its censorship, but its not government censorship, its their website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess ... what I mean is, posting names of an abortion doctor does not make me liable for anything that other people do .. assuming the infor4mation I post is publicly available.</p>

<p>You are basically saying that the website author/phonebook writer/television station would be liable if someone murdered someone whos information was on a website/phonebook/tv commercial</p>

<p>but all this is the extreme hypothetical.. no one is murdering anyone based on names posted on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term is fairly new to me as well.  First time I heard it was in regards to an individual who went to CT and then posted some personal information of people they were investigating.  It was this posting of personal information I had heard to referred as &#39;doxxing&#39;, not so much the investigation itself.  It seems wikipedia is able to confirm for me what doxing actually is.  I don&#39;t know the context to which said information was revealed, but that appears to be just a blatant disregard for reddit rules regardless.</p>

<p>Investigating isn&#39;t doxxing.  Investigating is exactly that- investigating.  Doxxing is is not reporting.  Reporting is taking information gathered during investigating and compiling into an easily readable, narrative structure.  At least that&#39;s the lay-man terms in which the courts have defined it.  If you&#39;re not doing that, you&#39;re just posting things, which doesn&#39;t have much protection as would reporting, under the law.  Don&#39;t know why I got into that.  Moving on.</p>

<p>Now, if you and some individuals are doing some joint investigating in a public forum and trying to compare notes and sort through information- some of which may be personal names and contact information, in which case you are just posting, not reporting.  As such, you are &#39;doxxing&#39;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the specifics to which you&#39;re referring so I don&#39;t mean to make light of anything, but why is that sorting and comparing of investigative notes happening on a public forum?  You should have all agreed to work on your information off-site where you could control access to content.  You can&#39;t expect to use another corporations on-line forum infrastructure to do whatever the toss you want.  I bought server space and installed some bb software for this exact reason, so friends and I could discuss things outside the rules and regulations of assclowns.</p>

<p>Doxxing I don&#39;t think is intended to intimidate you so much as intimidate someone else, specifically, the one whose information has been posted.  It&#39;s intended to define a way in which personal information is shared on-line without consent of that person, at least that&#39;s how I&#39;m understanding it, so I may be in the wrong here. It has nothing to do with investigating.  It has EVERYTHING to do with sharing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to draw a parallel (and I think you are, so please correct if I&#39;m wrong) connecting, people who don&#39;t believe the official report of 9/11 are categorized negatively as &quot;truthers&quot; to people doing self-investigating are negatively categorized as doxxers, I just don&#39;t see it.  </p>

<p>Again, the term is new to me and I&#39;ve just heard it for the first time a few days ago so I find it hard to believe it&#39;s some attempt to belittle personal investigators.  But, maybe it&#39;s been in the collective vernacular and I&#39;m just out of the loop.  I am pretty aloof sometimes.</p>

<p>Forgive the long-winded reply, I didn&#39;t set out to start a novel, but sometimes it just happens when I get excited about new things.</p>

<p>You bear a stance frighteningly similar the the NSA. Everyone is a suspect. And each suspect should be able to be randomly subjected to the investigation and posting of their alleged personal information. Information that may be public to another website, but which users expect to remain anonymous on this website. With this subs fetish for witch-hunts you people have been attempting this more and more intensely. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a rise in &quot;false outrage.&quot; Because what you attempt to do is fucking insane. And you do it together.</p>

<p>You will level no playing fields, and you will inevitably hurt innocent people in the process.</p>

<p>THE ENTIRETY OF REDDIT HAS THIS GUYS INFO NOW AND THEY&#39;RE GONNA GO GET HIM BETTER BAN AND DELETE EVERYTHING</p>

<p>except <strong>the subreddits were private</strong>. But oh god, not the innocent people having screenshots of a website that is available to the entirety of the Internet! The poor innocent man is gonna be witch hunted! Like that one missing dude after the Boston bombings! </p>

<p><strong>NO.</strong> the Boston bombing threads were on the front page of EVERYTHING when it was happening, in real time. This was info taken from public websites, and posted to a private subreddit. Quit spreading disinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen. This is not a court of law. </p>

<p>This is a private website which can determine its own rules. Take a look: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules/">http://www.reddit.com/rules/</a>  They pretty much explicitly say that only public information for public figures is permitted. </p>

<p>It is absolutely irrelevant if the info was available online, so is your facebook page and everything you post on the internet. If someone were to post this info about you in reddit they&#39;d be banned as well.</p>

<p>These are the rules which have been explained over and over again in numerous drama-ladden instances. Moreover, when there&#39;s an edge of witch-hunting you can expect the admins to be twice as strict about it. Calling someone a &quot;shill&quot;, &quot;paid actor&quot; and &quot;part of a &quot;coverup&quot; kinda meets that criteria.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_is_posting_personal_information_ok.3F">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NO. reddit is a pretty open and free speech place, but it is not ok to post someone&#39;s personal information, or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people and certain individual information, including personal info found online is often false. Posting personal information will get you banned. Posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of some company is probably fine, but <strong>don&#39;t post anything inviting harassment, don&#39;t harass, and don&#39;t cheer on or vote up obvious vigilantism.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not in a position to shut this site down or do anything for that matter. Iam just trying to provide some perspective on what&#39;s going on, and an alternate explanation besides &quot;OMG SUPPRESSION OF INFORMATION THE ADMINS ARE IN ON THE CONSPIRACY!&quot; which (I hope you realize) sounds outlandish.</p>

<p>I NEVER posted anyones info, so I really don&#39;t see why you are getting so worked up about it.  Do you think I&#39;m Newtruth221?  Because if you do, then you are dead wrong.  Newtruth was a girl, I am a man!  Just so we can be straight on this!  I didn&#39;t DOX anyone.  I post youtube clips and make comments.</p>

<p>I think the admins went way overboard here.  You don&#39;t.  Great, at least we know where the other stands.</p>

<p>I think the admins could have deleted the thread, and left the rest of the SUB alone.  Maybe told her that she was going to be banned and to find an admin ASAP for the sub.

<p>1) They could have, but this is one of the violations that carries a ban penalty and even though the admins can decide what the rules are, I think you&#39;ll agree that equal and objective enforcement is necessary when applying them. </p>

<p>2) Not sure what you mean by &quot;find an admin&quot;. So as not to talk past eachother: the established terminology is ADMIN = reddit employee, MOD = user who moderates the subreddit.</p>

<p>3) I get what you&#39;re saying. The thing is, reddit has had all sorts of drama which spilled into real-life via doxxing so now doxxing is a no-second-chance offense because the admins really don&#39;t want shit coming back to their site/company when someone does something stupid.</p>

<p>4) Well witch-hunt goes both ways. I&#39;d consider doxxing someone and labelling him a &quot;crisis actor&quot; and &quot;shill&quot; in a sub known for its distain against whoever is labelled as such, is much more witch-hunty than banning the user providing the means for said hunt.</p>

<p>In any case, for me it doesn&#39;t go beyond &quot;this is one of our 5 rules, you broke it, you&#39;re out&quot;.</p>

<p>You bear a stance frighteningly similar the the NSA. Everyone is a suspect. And each suspect should be able to be randomly subjected to the investigation and posting of their alleged personal information. Information that may be public to another website, but which users expect to remain anonymous on this website. With this subs fetish for witch-hunts you people have been attempting this more and more intensely. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a rise in &quot;false outrage.&quot; Because what you attempt to do is fucking insane. And you do it together.</p>

<p>You will level no playing fields, and you will inevitably hurt innocent people in the process.</p>

<p>THE ENTIRETY OF REDDIT HAS THIS GUYS INFO NOW AND THEY&#39;RE GONNA GO GET HIM BETTER BAN AND DELETE EVERYTHING</p>

<p>except <strong>the subreddits were private</strong>. But oh god, not the innocent people having screenshots of a website that is available to the entirety of the Internet! The poor innocent man is gonna be witch hunted! Like that one missing dude after the Boston bombings! </p>

<p><strong>NO.</strong> the Boston bombing threads were on the front page of EVERYTHING when it was happening, in real time. This was info taken from public websites, and posted to a private subreddit. Quit spreading disinformation. </p>
