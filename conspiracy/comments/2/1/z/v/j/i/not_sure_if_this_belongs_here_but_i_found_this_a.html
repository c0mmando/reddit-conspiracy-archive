       Again, not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit (so downvote if you wish), but it does seem a bit odd to me...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Safety is our highest priority, and we are committed to protecting the most vulnerable victims of backover accidents â€” our children and seniors,"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "On average, there are 210 fatalities and 15,000 injuries per year caused by backover crashes."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       210 fatalities per year is quite a low number on the grand scale, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be grasping at straws here, but I call "bullshit".  Seems like a gov't's dream - more cameras in things that most of us use!  Most auto manufacturers would have most likely had cameras regardless by 2018, but making it mandatory?  To allegedly lower a petty number of 210 fatalities/year?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think this reliance on technology, as opposed to our own senses, is making us dumber as a society, and the fact that things like this are becoming "required" is concerning...turning into Idiocracy.

       Autonomous vehicles are right around the corner. This type of surveillance is only going to increase because of technological advancements.

       I can see where this could be conspiracy territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seatbelts were adamantly rejected. I literally have a friend who doesn't wear one due to her upbringing. Safety wasn't always the #1 of cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now cars are becoming safer. This includes cameras. So, how can we figure out the cameras are for negative purposes?  We can't and we're simply speculating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be wary of being paranoid. There could always be legitimate people behind the movement who has a genuine concern for safety. We need not be painted as seeing conspiracies in everything.

       How can we discuss this then? Because I completely, absolutely understand the potential for automated cars to be used for nefarious purposes (Edit: Michael Hastings). But I also agree that automated driving is most likely a good option to limit human error car accidents.

       I would rather risk human error car accidents and have my hands on the wheel.  I also think automated driving would make us even less intelligent...think of the number of folks who wouldn't know how to get to from point A to point B without their GPS...some people would (

       conspiracy can be systematic in addition to the notion of a bunch of old men sitting at a round table in a dark room.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand- you can guarantee that there is a corporate lobby pushing this mandate.  It's going to make money for people- the hardware people, the software people and the data people.  This will certainly somehow be incorporated into the insurance calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is an understanding that as technology increases its grasp on our day to day, humans lose agency and autonomy (liberty).  "Conspiracy Theorists" tend to see that these freedoms are disappearing and are worried about this loss of independence.

       Quick inquiry.  Which portion was construed as a personal attack.  I can see a dig on the conspiritards, however I fail to see an attack on the poster, or this sub.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to clarify.

       Possibly. It was reported, was a borderline violation, so I removed it and issued a minor warning. No one was banned. No permanent repercussions.

       Given the context, I would actually consider reinstating the comment, were it not so antagonistic and laden with profanity.

       You're absolutely right.  I try to keep it civil.  But when it comes to some worthless distractors, all bets are off.  The line has been drawn.

       You're downvoted because of your attitude. A perfect example is threatening to join conspiratard when you don't get your way. By your own admission you only "woke up" this year. Have you considered that maybe you are not fully awake and aware yet, because you basically push the "part line" quite a lot.

       Try not to take it personally. It happens all the time. On the other hand, most of what you post here (that I've seen) is upvoted. So there's that.
