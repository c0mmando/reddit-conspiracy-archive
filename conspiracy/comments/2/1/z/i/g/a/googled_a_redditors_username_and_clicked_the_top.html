       I curse every time I renew and reinstall server certs, no matter how good my docs were last go-round, but jeesh, plenty of multi-million-TCP-connection sites manage to install certificates and maintain great performance. Even scumbag LinkedIn finally caved and went default SSL (a crime that they ever were default clear-text, soooo much interesting connection information dangling in the wind to all takers).

       Yeah, reddit has grown enough to afford proper security. I'd have understood the issue if it were 2004 and there was minimal traffic here but it's time reddit put on the big boy trousers and acknowledged 2010 came and went.

       Well hmph. I used to use Open DNS but then my internet started acting weird. The issue seemed to be that my devices were conflicting with IP addresses. Not sure why the problem started and I thought about giving up on DHCP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went back to automatic DNS server from ISP to make sure that wasn't the problem. It didn't solve the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now, sometimes when I'm redditing on my Kindle it'll lose internet connection and I'll have to restart the Wi-Fi. I checked my router and the IP lease time was forever so I don't understand the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ideas? Unfortunately my knowledge of the topic is very limited but I might as well switch back to Open DNS.

       Conflicting IP addresses are a wholly separate issue. That normally happens when one device wants to hardset it's own IP address while other devices are being handed one through the DHCP server (normally your router or modem).
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNS hijack can take form from either targeting your PC, Modem or a trusted DNS server further down the line, possibly your ISP's. You already touched upon the solution.. Using something like Open DNS or even Google DNS would re-route where you are receiving the name translation from. Also as a precaution I would look at flushing your DNS cache on your local device using an elevated command line ( ipconfig /flushdns). I'd probably do a winsock reset as well (Netsh winsock reset catalog)- That command is for Windows 7 and above.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also wouldn't hurt to run some spyware detection software beyond what you currently have. I've found that 100% of the time I'm seeing funky things happening there's some malware on my system that spybot by itself doesn't find. So I normally hit up something like hitman pro or ADW cleaner.

       The URL shows
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com">
        https://www.reddit.com
       </a>
       - this always shows an Akamai cert because Reddit somehow can't get site-wide SSL going despite it being 20effing13 (now there's a conspiracy for us). Reddit uses Akamai to host their images. To get to where you need to go, change www to pay or take out the s. I recommend keeping the s and using

       That Google sent you there doesn't really matter - type it into your URL bar directly, you'll see the same behavior.

       First, is

        /u/Antiochus88
       </a>
       anti-semitic or not? This is the basis of the argument. I never said they were or were not. I simply said
       <a href="/u/redping">
        /u/redping
       </a>
       believes such.
      </p>

       My bigger concern was this redirect. HENCE WHY IT'S IN CAPS. Not the anti-semitic.

       You posted redping's

       that this sub is anti-Semitic. I never said otherwise. Read my first comment again. You could just as easily have made your point about the redirect without the irrelevant

       that this sub is anti-Semitic. So why include it?

       I thought it should be explained why I was doing what I was. Didn't want to incriminate somebody undeservingly (calling the user an anti-semitite if they're actually not). To please you I should have redacted both users and simply pointed out the issue of redirect. In hindsight, maybe. Just please believe I have no agenda to discredit this subreddit. I don't believe it anti-semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I feel like almost anything I say could be critiqued for wrong and that worries me. Such as, if the NSA collects absolute data of you, they could eventually form a case to label you as a terrorist even if you're not.

       but I can't prove anything other than saying that my comment history and submission history will vindicate me.

       Considering all of the negativity this sub has undergone in the past about the issue perhaps I'm overly sensitive. As I recall, redping was banned here at least twice and, as far as I'm concerned, using him/her as a reference is unacceptable.

       Okay. Still, if you frequent that sub and post things here like this one you should be aware that that will appear suspect. Inciting hatred is what they do and I really hope you won't bring it here anymore.

       Ninja edit: Do I really seem suspicious to you? I've always found Conspiratards / trolls / shills to be obvious. Usually their motives are clear even within a few comments. The words they use. I'm sure you have a bullshit detector. I just can't understand why, as legitimate, you would suspect me. Y'know? Man this gets to me. Do you tag people on RES like I do? Very quickly I can determine a legitimate user vs non.

       I use RedditReveal instead of RES so don't tag people like that. I don't remember what the specific comments were but I do have you "tagged" in my mind as someone to watch out for. I also don't remember you posting here except for maybe the past 2-3 months. That's probably because I was paying attention to a lot of users while I was a mod.

       Well. I actually would say I "woke up" just beginning this year. I watched things like Loose Change years ago but, for some reason, something changed me recently. I deleted my main account (because it had personal information) and focused on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .

       I wonder what I said to catch your attention but I do remember it happening because I was shocked a moderator would be on a different page than me.

       I curse every time I renew and reinstall server certs, no matter how good my docs were last go-round, but jeesh, plenty of multi-million-TCP-connection sites manage to install certificates and maintain great performance. Even scumbag LinkedIn finally caved and went default SSL (a crime that they ever were default clear-text, soooo much interesting connection information dangling in the wind to all takers).
