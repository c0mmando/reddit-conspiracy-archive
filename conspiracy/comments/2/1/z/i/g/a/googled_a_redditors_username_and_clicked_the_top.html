<p>Sometimes it&#39;s just easier to Google than to directly do things. Anyway, anybody have any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well hmph. I used to use Open DNS but then my internet started acting weird. The issue seemed to be that my devices were conflicting with IP addresses. Not sure why the problem started and I thought about giving up on DHCP.</p>

<p>I went back to automatic DNS server from ISP to make sure that wasn&#39;t the problem. It didn&#39;t solve the problem. </p>

<p>Even now, sometimes when I&#39;m redditing on my Kindle it&#39;ll lose internet connection and I&#39;ll have to restart the Wi-Fi. I checked my router and the IP lease time was forever so I don&#39;t understand the problem. </p>

<p>Any ideas? Unfortunately my knowledge of the topic is very limited but I might as well switch back to Open DNS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conflicting IP addresses are a wholly separate issue. That normally happens when one device wants to hardset it&#39;s own IP address while other devices are being handed one through the DHCP server (normally your router or modem).</p>

<p>The DNS hijack can take form from either targeting your PC, Modem or a trusted DNS server further down the line, possibly your ISP&#39;s. You already touched upon the solution.. Using something like Open DNS or even Google DNS would re-route where you are receiving the name translation from. Also as a precaution I would look at flushing your DNS cache on your local device using an elevated command line ( ipconfig /flushdns). I&#39;d probably do a winsock reset as well (Netsh winsock reset catalog)- That command is for Windows 7 and above.</p>

<p>It also wouldn&#39;t hurt to run some spyware detection software beyond what you currently have. I&#39;ve found that 100% of the time I&#39;m seeing funky things happening there&#39;s some malware on my system that spybot by itself doesn&#39;t find. So I normally hit up something like hitman pro or ADW cleaner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The URL shows <a href="https://www.reddit.com">https://www.reddit.com</a> - this always shows an Akamai cert because Reddit somehow can&#39;t get site-wide SSL going despite it being 20effing13 (now there&#39;s a conspiracy for us). Reddit uses Akamai to host their images. To get to where you need to go, change www to pay or take out the s.

    <div class="md"><p>I curse every time I renew and reinstall server certs, no matter how good my docs were last go-round, but jeesh, plenty of multi-million-TCP-connection sites manage to install certificates and maintain great performance. Even scumbag LinkedIn finally caved and went default SSL (a crime that they ever were default clear-text, soooo much interesting connection information dangling in the wind to all takers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use RedditReveal instead of RES so don&#39;t tag people like that. I don&#39;t remember what the specific comments were but I do have you &quot;tagged&quot; in my mind as someone to watch out for. I also don&#39;t remember you posting here except for maybe the past 2-3 months. That&#39;s probably because I was paying attention to a lot of users while I was a mod. </p>

<p>You&#39;re sounding very sincere so I apologize if I offended you.</p>
