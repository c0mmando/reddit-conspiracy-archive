        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine you are someone who is GREAT at doing research and seeing things before others... so much so that you discover something that would change the world if only you could convince the world.</p>

<p>BUT... as good as you are at doing research and putting pieces together.. you are equally as terrible expressing yourself and communicating to others in a way to convince them of what you have discovered - be it writing or speaking.</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<p>Also realize that all the supposed outlets to get the info out are controlled - such as the &quot;alternative&quot; news fronts and supposed &quot;whistleblowers&quot; so you have no one you can trust to help you get the info out.</p>

<p>Also realize that to really understand this info it takes months of study and unlearning to remove all the disinfo that has been spread to make us avoid the truth....</p>

<p>TLDR - I know the truth but I have no way to get it out to the masses because the people in power have rigged the game and tricked us into looking in all the wrong places for answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you could develop your writing skills a little bit... There is so much work to do online with waking people up that people skills isn&#39;t a necessity. Instead of captivating narratives, simply focusing on facts would go a long ways without requiring someone to be a wonderful writer.</p>

<p>Second, maybe you could team up with someone? Find a partner who complements your strengths and weaknesses and produce content.</p>

<p>What type of research are you into, may I ask?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The research is related to technology and different historical events. I have done what a journalist could do who has some knowledge of science and technology. </p>

<p>I have been working on my writing skills but I have spent years working on this full time with no pay and I am financially screwed... to continue working on this to write it in a way that I feel would sway people will take a long long time and I am in such bad straights financially that I just can&#39;t do it anymore.</p>

<p>I have tried to get help but teaching people this info takes so long.. by the time I find someone that can help and who understands it it may be too late. If it isn&#39;t already too late.</p>

<p>BUT..  that is the direction I am working now so if worse comes to worse I will just continue in that direction.</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy a cheap laserjet printer</li>
<li>Open your favorite (open source?) word processing program</li>
<li>Write down whatever it is you want the people to know about. Do your best to put it in a way they will understand</li>
<li>Distribute these 8.5x11in truth-drops whever you can </li>
</ol>

<p>People understimate the power of the printing press... some people won&#39;t even read a newspaper but might pick up your leaflet </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good idea and thanks for trying to help but the issue here is that the info is too much.. I need to take the info from many documentaries and books and remove all the misinfo mixed in them.</p>

<p>also keep in mind that I have to compete with all the other forms of media.. so if I am putting out a little flyer the opposition is putting out beaitifully made documentaries and fabricated news stories on CNN or all over cable... I end up being drowned out.</p>

<p>BUT if I could get one famous trust worthy person to get this info out.</p>

<p>Also.. something could happen to me before i can get the info out as well..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said.. I don&#39;t think this is the right format to do that. This type of format the conversation devolves into arguing about every little detail and nothing gets accomplished. This is why I need help getting this info out in the proper way...</p>

<p>I am unable to just talk about part of it without giving away info that I feel needs to be kept secret in hopes that it can be revealed in a  dramatic fashion.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for that is the disinfo I said was strewn all through out.. but that is also why I need help figuring out some way to get help..  but it needs to be the right help. Many times before I have tried telling people and it led nowhere.. they didn&#39;t understand the info or couldn&#39;t help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How deep is YOUR truth? If it&#39;s there are multiple &quot;warring&quot; factions here on earth in the game of life and we are actually the most powerful we being pure human. However the alien faction is technologically hundreds if not thousands of years ahead. We are immortal higher selfs with multiple incarnations throughout history while &quot;they&quot; are clone like parrots that lie cheat eat and steal from us then yes you know the truth. My suggestion write a book and publish through Amazon. Buy a spam campaign or spread it here I will spread the word make it like 9.99 I find with truth books if it&#39;s free or too cheap no one will believe the info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they upgrade together like the borg, they remember who they are and progress over millions if not billions of years without loss of knowledge. They live sequentially and we live simultaneously. In other words you have someone living in Ramses II Egypt times right now possibly, we have multiple incarnations across time. Anyone who has ever done DMT or any psychedelic in high doses and as a sacrament and not to see pretty colors will tell you time is a misnomer. It is fictitious created by the god Kronos, who also happens to be many other gods many names of &quot;god&quot; LOL. I prefer Satan or Lucifer. What each separate incarnation discovers is shared to the rest of the simultaneous. This is where your most believable dreams come from, they are not all earth incarnations either. We &quot;forget&quot; who we are due to the DNA manipulations &quot;junk DNA&quot; and everytime we accumulate any worthy info they destroy it (book burning, Library of Alexandria) think of WHY any enemy no matter how barbaric would destroy knowledge that would give them an advantage.</p>

<p>I thought all of this was nutty crazy batshit stuff BEFORE I was attacked by a reptilian. This happened in Late 2012 and have been researching this stuff ever since. In fact a psychiatrist of mine gave me David Icke&#39;s name when I confided in her about the attack, she said she too believed we were being invaded by an alien race with drugs alcohol and media as weapons (No not crazy, was seeing her to quit drinking and smoking). The truth is out there however they have manipulated the game so badly that anyone is made to look nutty by bringing this up by warping the current reality. We can all agree that a dark massive black hole can suck in stars, that spirit animates matter, an acorn can become an oak tree, matter and anti matter, so why is it so hard to believe (not really believe but entertain the thought) that we could be food for another more &quot;advanced&quot; race. They are only technologically advanced, spiritually they are about as close to pure hate as one could get at. They are jealous of us (I think) they contantly fuck with us genetically, emotionally, physically, and  Over 100 years ago we were on horseback (animals) as the main mode of transportation for several millenia. Then boom in 100 years we have Mars rovers, landed on the moon can all video talk to people via mobile, airplanes, cars, televisions, computers. NEVER in history has such an event occurred except for maybe Atlantis and we know how they fared.</p>

<p>Check out Mark Passio on youtube lots of info I would start with cosmic abandonment. John Gee on youtube gets deeper into magic and 4th dimensional stuff. I experimented with DMT and mushrooms after this attack experience and I can tell you there are good and bad entities on the other side. It would make more sense to discover your spiritual side. Im not talking about religions, I&#39;m talking about YOU and YOUR higher self. I met up with mine on Pharmahuasca and I have to say beyond godlike would be the best description. However all the information you glean in this mode (specifics) gets erased I think it is part of the game to play the weakling. Our strength is in numbers and they play divide and conquer very well. Sex, race, religion, rich or poor, work which they steal 1/4 of, they try and play into that to separate us. We need to stand together, they KNOW we are stronger hence all of this police state / war violence as of late, all the lies are so hard to track now they are leaking everywhere making it difficult for anyone to get to the truth. It&#39;s all about the first domino, look back in history I have read dozens of books and have YET to find a time where we were not enslaved by their governments or religion. There is NO SAVIOR coming you are your OWN savior! We are our own savior, we cannot defeat it alone and we cannot defeat it in fringe communities of r/conspiracy. You have to go find this truth yourself and convince others, do not believe me do your own research and I think you will come to the same conclusions. I have been unemployed for 8 months and spent 15-16 hours a day on this and before when I was working about 6-8 hours a day reading on this and ancient religion,history, pythagoras, sacred geometry, the occult, kabbalah, freemasonry. </p>

<p>I no longer play golf, video games, or any time wasting activities. Time is running out people we WILL be snuffed if we sit back and do nothing. You need to be brave and not feel foolish saying things like this. Aristotle said somethingto the effect of it is the mark of an intelligent man to entertain an idea in his mind without believing it. I live in paradise 3600 sq feet, beautiful home, married with a child, very happy overall, im not somebody with a bone to pick other than 3 run ins with cops that cost me one a severe baton beatdown (for sticking up for the violence against another human being slammed into a car hood) and the other two about $40,000 in DUI victimless (I no longer drink, another trap by their game). They say drink responsibly but if you go to a bar and have one drink you are over the limit PERIOD, how can this be allowed, then comes the shaming of everyone around you that HAS drank and drove over the limit. They put liquor ads in golf magazines, beer ads in football etc... My suggestion is do what I do boycott all of their games, no drinking, no smoking, no cable tv mind programming, no shopping, no more games. Rage against the machine &quot;What does the billboard say come and play come and play&quot;. I still laugh mostly at their control game attempts and the folly of all the clones and minions still plugged in. Meditate! What I mean is pay extreme attention to EVERY moment in your life. There are no coincidences. Your higher self is always their to guide you but you need to listen, byt that I mean use all 5 senses and FILTER it.</p>

<p>In doing so I can now see the matrix for what it is. My brain is sharper, I am smarter, I got a job making more than I ever did in my life, not that I care, I was ready to go move into a cave honestly (the wife and daughter did not agree :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s part of what I was trying to explain though.. I am an extreme introvert.. I don&#39;t have anyone that can help me with this that is close to me. That was a big reason i was in a position to do all the research necessary to learn everything.</p>

<p>And finding someone that can understand it is very difficult. It would require someone who is a master writer as well. Someone who can get all this info out effectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right right, my bad I explained wrongly. I think the best you can do is hang out on societies/forums/this subreddit to try and find someone near you or at least someone you can bond with correctly to hopefully find someone who can help you with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you can start a thread here and find some charity help of some people/someone that is great at writing/language who can help you with these matters, since we all share the same interests although some times have different point of views on political rights and such.</p>

<p>You could also try 4chan&#39;s board /pol/ be aware though sometimes there&#39;s trolls there but it&#39;s easy to notice the rotten apples from the good ones there(They&#39;re very obvious). Regardless good luck mate, hope you can find someone/some people to help you out! We really need more people like you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be able to express yourself pretty cogently. Even if you think you need someone with the prose skills to &quot;sex up&quot; your research to make it attractive to the unwashed masses, you will still need to write down your ideas in detail so your designated scribe fully understands the nuts and bolts. This should be your first task.</p>

<p>If you are still working on the research, and you want to bat some of your ideas around in a constructive and relatively hermetic environment, you could start your own private subreddit and invite users you have vetted to share their thoughts and add their suggestions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that fear is the most powerful tool being used against people like you. So long as you are paralyzed by fear, you will be unable to defend against other assaults, or to act to help others.</p>

<p>Fear is useful to us, don&#39;t misunderstand. Fear tells us when there is something we may potentially not prefer. But when it is lasting, when we&#39;ve gotten the message from fear and still it clings on causing paralyzation - that is when it is a problem and must be overcome.</p>

<p>I have been paranoid and afraid of many things I&#39;ve come across in learning about conspiracies and deep politics, often afraid of speaking about such things for fear of being put on a list - long before this PRISM business came to light. I have determined, however, that if I allow that fear to conquer me, to prevent me from acting, then nothing is gained. We must acknowledge and dismiss fear when it is doing us a disservice, when it prevents us from acting in the slightest to achieve our objectives.</p>

<p>Sharing information and helping to educate others is not a crime. It is honorable. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and reddit in general, are not the greatest places to work together as there is a lot of trolling, a lot of noise - BUT you do have access here to MANY people who could be of value to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks seems to be a good place to go. Their leaks have beem some what damning and so I am more inclined to trust them as an organization than any other alternet news site.</p>

<p>Look, if your evidence is damning, it will get attention. For example look at <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">/u/Three_Letter_Agency</a> &#39;s posts.</p>

<p>They are well sourced and damning. </p>

<p>If you are unwilling to go to other people. Make your own website, post your information, write a book. Collaborate your information as well as you can and get it out there.</p>

<p>If you are concerned for your well being, then take a step back and really ask yourself. <strong>Is this worth it?</strong></p>

<p>If that answer is no. Then put it down now and never return to it.</p>

<p>If that answer is yes, then may positive influence surround you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem though... if I just say it now no one will believe it and there aren&#39;t enough people here on the conspiracy section to really get this info out to the masses.</p>

<p>The reason why is that even in the conspiracy community everyone has been conditioned to look the wrong directions for the answers or they will think these subjects are ridiculous or already debunked.</p>

<p>BUT.. there are some key elements to what I have discovered that COULD hook people into looking more deeply IF they are used in the right way. But if I just tell people here and don&#39;t have the time to show people the evidence they won&#39;t make an impact and the disinfo agents will discredit it or some people may try to make money off it which will damage what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>TLDR - this is incredibly complex and it needs to be handled properly. It&#39;s too important to just leak out little by little... it needs to be some type of event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you are incapable of even attempting to explain what you know in any kind of brevity.  Since that&#39;s the case, I would say do some more research, learn how to write coherently (I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re still quite young based on your writing style) and people will begin to listen.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poorly written vague statements asking questions with cryptic messaging aren&#39;t going to get you anywhere, sorry to say.  In the end though, I&#39;m fairly certain that all you have is a bunch of loose ends that you believe you have tied together in an inexperienced, haphazard fashion, which will fall on deaf ears regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would describe it like an immense detective story.. one that covers many  eras in history AND one that relies on scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>BUT... what really makes it so difficult to understand is that the people trying to suppress all this info have buried it under volumes of disinfo.</p>

<p>This is really what makes it so difficult to sort through. It&#39;s no accident. BUT... with enough study and thought it can be decoded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say that when you don&#39;t know the situation...  do you realize that the people in power have been spreading disinfo for decade after decade.. using infinite funds.</p>

<p>We do not control what we think ... THEY do. I was the same way... I had bought everything they had been pumping into us just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Also.. it isn&#39;t just about me being able to write to you here.. it&#39;s about being able to truly ARTICULATE it....</p>

<p>For some reason I am just not an influential writer... and I have horrible difficulty being able to explain something that is so incredibly complex and just getting people to listen.</p>

<p>Also.. when I try to contact people who could get this out it is even more difficult for me to express myself because of the complexity as well and having to get the info out in a short time.</p>

<p>And as i said, it takes months just to understand what I am talking about because most people aren&#39;t knowledgeable about the subjects that are being hidden.. that&#39;s by design. In society we are focused on everything BUT those subjects...</p>

<p>Also, in this kind of message board here it is very difficult dealing with the skeptics, who may be paid skeptics.They are GREAT at shooting down the real info and spreading disinfo to take people off the real trail before they get a chance to take it seriously.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called divide and conquer... they get us bickering so much that people have no idea what to believe. Then they discredit the people trying to reveal the truth..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise you.. this is real. I can tell you this.. as I researched I would come to conclusions about what had happened and every time I did when I continued researching more and more of it would be corroborated. This happened over and over and over again.</p>

<p>It is so clear what happened it is incredible.. but it is also incredibly complex and difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Also... the way i got into this is because of something someone in my family witnessed.. and it led me down this path. All the info is out there right now for any of you to find.. the tough part is putting the pieces together properly... </p>

<p>You can&#39;t understand why this is so incredibly difficult without going through all that info.. also consider that this whole thing is far bigger.. far more immense than people can fathom.</p>
