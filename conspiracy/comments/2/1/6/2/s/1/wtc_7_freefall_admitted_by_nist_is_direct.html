<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atbrn4k55lA">WTC Building 7 video compilation</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Final Report shows that NIST avoided physical testing altogether. Instead, it created a computer model that it claims supports their collapse theory, but won&#39;t even release that model for inspection by the public.</p></li>
<li><p>In the new Report, NIST quietly drops the theory promoted by since 2001 by the New York Times and FEMA, that diesel fuel was responsible for the collapse, and minimizes the role of purportedly extensive damage from the fallout of the North Tower.</p></li>
<li><p>NIST entirely ignores the voluminous evidence of molten metal at the building&#39;s base, and steel sulfidation documented by FEMA, despite these issues having been directly raised with NIST in press conferences, and public comment periods for this and the previous report on the Twin Towers. NIST&#39;s pointmen act as if they never heard of aluminothermic incendiaries, yet some of the NIST Report authors and other supporters of the collapse theory have been on the forefront of research into advanced energetic materials based on thermite.</p></li>
<li><p>NIST advances a theory that the entire &quot;collapse&quot; was caused by a beam disconnecting itself from its column supports through thermal expansion -- a behavior that is the opposite of that exhibited by actual building fires and building fire simulations, in which severely heated beams sag downward and stay connected, rather than remaining rigid and breaking their connections.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST also deliberately produced a fraudulent research, they state that the visible 18 stories feel at 5.4s because they chose a fictitious starting time on purpose while the correct analysis leaves no doubt that those same stories fell in 3.9s; literally pure free-fall</p>

<p>A better insight for those of you that are confused about this:</p>

It&#39;s extremely obvious in this video that the collapse starting long before any of the time measurements made by conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the description that NIST gives, they calculated the collapse time of the 18 visible stories from the <strong>moment that the roofline starts descending until it disappears</strong>.</p>

<p>As the video I linked clearly shows, the bowing is not present in the horizontal view (at least not as downardas as the other perspective looks like) thus it is not part of the <strong>moment that the roofline starts descending until it disappears</strong>. If you don&#39;t understand this then you should learn how perspective works and how sometimes it leads you into error.</p>

<p>The 18 stories collapsed in 3.9s, period. Your &quot;disinfo&quot; attempt at shifting what NIST itself even stated as their measurement parameters is pathetic at best.</p>

<p>EDIT: So that you understand better how ignorant your argument is, you are talking about the start of the building collapse, which we will agree that it started moments before the east penthouse collapse. What I am talking here and what I addressed about NIST was <strong>their measurement of time that it took for the 18 floors to collapse from the moment the roofline started descending until it disappeared</strong>. This is not what you addressed and you would do well to correct it.</p>

<p>You have yourself acknowledged freefall, not that it is any longer in any sort of dispute, but i fail to see how you can even argue the point any longer, you either have a tenuous grasp on the most basic of scientific principles or have an agenda, probably the latter, as you are coming out with constant falsehoods and outright lies in most of your posts.</p>

<p>No i did not, i will post it again for you, why don&#39;t you answer the question?</p>

<p>You are clearly wrong as explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpiVv8tQdmY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3h17m0s">here</a> for you,  however lets ignore the times for just a moment, just for the sake of argument. </p>

<p><strong>Freefall actually happened,</strong> this is scientific fact, how then do you explain the structure falling through the path of most resistance at the speed of gravity?  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I never said they used charges, you did, they did find active thermitic material  in the dust, this is well documented and should have been fully investigated, NIST didn&#39;t bother. </p>

<p>So any new investigation should focus on that and the eyewitness and video evidence of explosions throughout the day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, wrong on multiple points. First, thermitic charges are extremely loud and bright and would have been incredibly obvious. Second, only a single reviewed paper found anything remotely close to &#39;thermite &#39; in the dust, and they found it in a very common form in very small amounts, and the paper was posted on a completely bunk review site.</p>

<p>Can you explain the extreme temperatures at all three demolition sites, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2V3np#0">the molten steel and concrete,</a> how do you explain this away?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it has not been peer reviewed. Bentham Science is a bunk site, as I stated earlier. It is infamous for publishing fake papers on subjects like phrenology, and &quot;peer reviewing&quot; randomly generated papers as well. Their own editor-in-chief quit after the publishing of the Thermitic Materials Paper because it was nonsense and she wasn&#39;t willing to be associated with a company that lied so blatantly and without her consent.  </p>

<p>So no, the paper is <em>not</em> peer reviewed, at least not by any with the tiniest modicum of a positive reputation.</p>

<p>As for molten metal, aluminum melts at 400 degrees, concrete spalls at 400-500, and then we have this comment from a physicist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This, by the way, is a place where Jim Hoffman makes a serious mistake; in his paper on the dust butt, he fails to note that he has to ADD THE HEAT BACK IN when he’s totaling things up at the end. This is a violation of conservation of energy, the First Law of Thermodynamics (and a foundational law of physics). The energy dissipated during the fall is about 250 or 300 GJ, and the leftover energy at impact is about 600 GJ. So it’s about a quarter kiloton of TNT for the North tower and about a fifth of a kiloton for the South tower; that’s still a hell of a lot of energy, more than sufficient to liquefy a pretty healthy chunk of steel, and it doesn’t change the fact that there’s a lot more energy in the office contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that was easy.</p>

<p>However, those 18 stories still took 5,4 seconds to fall, not the 3.9 you falsely claim. This Is blatantly obvious from any video you watch, edited or otherwise. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536">It took 3.9s</a>, if you argue this you have no understanding of how to correctly measure vertical changes.</p>

<p>In the video that I just linked, he literally starts the clock for 5.4s backwards. This means that from the moment the 18 stories disappeared the clock is 5.4s, he then reverses the video and the clock keeps counting 1.5s <strong>AFTER</strong> the building was already standing still.</p>

<p>Warning, do not get mixed up with the &quot;visible 18 stories&quot; reference, as the one NIST used only shows 18 stories, and the correct vantage point David uses shows more than 18 stories.</p>

<p>I am not just partially correct, I am absolutely correct. The 18 stories collapsed in 3.9s and anyone can verify this by measuring the video with <strong>the correct vantage point for vertical changes measures which is an horizontal view</strong>.</p>

<p>First you attack my argument with an ignorant comment, to which I addressed and proved to you how wrong you were. You have still yet to correct your mistake.</p>

<p>Then you insist that the 18 visible stories collapsed in 5.4s after I clearly posted a video section explaining how incorrect that measurement is.</p>

<p>Then I explain to you that the correct form of measurement for vertical changes is an horizontal view, not from below like NIST did, to which I clearly warn about David&#39;s video showing <strong>more than 18 stories</strong>  (which I shouldn&#39;t explain, but apparently there are people that are simply too limited to understand, like you) which you still ignored and even attacked that point as your pathetic debunking statement.</p>

<p>Now, after being proved wrong and incorrect at every turn, you claim that all I said is nonsense and it doesn&#39;t matter because there is no evidence.</p>

<p>Well, there is, any person with a drop of common sense will know that the pure free-fall collapse is itself evidence of a demolition. Your argument that &quot;it would be incredibly obvious and visible&quot; is the most ignorant points any debunker can use to disprove anything;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One, being the fact that to expect criminals to not be carefull to make it look like a collapse instead of a demolition (including making the charges make less noise) is just <del>ludacris</del> ludicrous and plain ignorant. Any criminal will always try to make his crime not look like a crime, at least a crime that will not point the fingers at him.</p></li>
<li><p>Two, despite the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">evident caught explosion sound before of the east penthouse collapse</a> (which is an explosion since the rest of the building collapse hardly produced any sound at all), all of the WTC7 recordings are far from the building and even blocked by other buildings, <strong>GREATLY REDUCING</strong> any further explosion sounds that came from the building especially when we take into account the city noise present in that day, cars wailing and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just because you believe in fantasy doesn&#39;t make it true, it just means that you think science is the same as religion. We, however, use facts, correct studies and evidence to make our points.</p>

<p>That tiny thing? Hahaha you call me incompetent and insult my intelligence, yet you claim that was even close to the volume of explosives used in demolition? Ignoring the fact that it fell from the bottom, not the top. Ignoring the fact that it fell as one piece without any visibly obvious explosions on the outer columns. Ignoring the fact that there was no chain of equally loud explosions. These are all things present at REAL demolitions. I encourage you to watch one some time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is not an excuse. Thermite or no thermite, explosive charges or no explosive charges, there are NO VISIBLE DETONATIONS on the exterior face of WTC7. How do you destroy these supports? Invisible bombs? Magic? Thermite is both incredibly bright and incredibly loud, so that theory is immediately out the window. Detonation charges are the same way (not to mention the buildings collapse looks nothing like a conventional demolition), so that theory is also out. </p>

<p>What does that leave? Oh. Right. The collapse of the supports due to weakening by fire, followed by the progressive collapse of the building. </p>

<p>Again, though. This is irrelevant. First, you do not have to look at something directly to judge the speed of collapse. Things fall at the same speed no matter the angle. Second, they started their measurement at the wrong time, as I showed you. Third, the universal collapse of the building <em>took more than 16 seconds.</em> No matter how you slice it, the primary collapse was nowhere near free fall except for a very small period of time, and again, this is explained.</p>

<p>This is a complete lie and you know it, NIST have refused to release their data models, so what scientific consensus are you referring to? Nobody outside of NIST has seen the data, it is not peer reviewed.</p>

<p>This makes absolutely no sense at all, you are literally ignoring the fundamentals of basic science, regardless, how do you explain every single exterior column failing within a fraction of a second of each other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the downvote brigade. No worries. Remember: the reason why we bring this up is we want a new investigation that actually accounts for the various evidence that we can all agree on. For example, we know WTC 7 was in freefall for at least part of the collapse. NIST admits it. Now what? It&#39;s really important that we remain focused and have a goal in mind, and that we stick with what is provable. NIST did what NIST had to do. Whether fraud or error or blackmail, we just don&#39;t know.</p>
