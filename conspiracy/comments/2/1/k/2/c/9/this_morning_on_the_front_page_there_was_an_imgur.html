       from this morning; over 1600 points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I browsed that link in the morning and thought to myself, "yeah, this looks shitty...". Now, after reading through a couple pages of the ama, I'm thinking, "Hey, maybe that breakfast would be worth a try...at least I should go for a dinner binge sometime, I like TacoBell."
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence or social media marketing done right? Was this a planned ama? How come no one voted up as top comment this morning's submission? Usually the hivemind leans against big business-y stunts like these, and holds them accountable with tough questions.

       I do know there are people so inclined, but not that many.  I remember one particularly horrific, to me,  conversation, where my best friend's mother said she was voting for that cute Ronald Reagan.  . . . but so odd, I have never forgotten and I was not even voting age.

       Front page is dictated by a massive series of folks hitting the "upvote" button.  It takes very little effort to do, and most folks will do it if they find a silly picture relatable.  A farmer in chile, a student in china, a salesman in australia, and a retiree in portugal will have very little in common.  But a picture of a cat with a peanut butter jar stuck on her.head?  Each of them will find that at least passingly amusing.  A simple upvote from each, and boom.  Meme culture and front page fluff.  Its not harmful, just keep in mind that is represents our most basic collective commonalities.  I don't really know who Justin Bieber is, but I upvote whenever he does something dumb because its kind of funny to witness his trainwreck.

       Some of you are to young to remember taco bell already did the breakfast thing for about 10 years. They stopped it around 97/99. I haven't tried the reboot yet maybe this weekend my guess is its not that bad.

       Not really. A paragraph description of 4 items and pics. Plus taco bell doesn't really need help in making itself look bad.

       It's more likely the guy who posted the imgur album was sitting on his post and chose today to post it knowing that the AMA was scheduled. Sometimes timing is essential for reaping karma.

       Social media marketing done right. All publicity is good publicity. What was important wasn't the "gross out" message, it was getting the words TACO BELL to the front of reddit.

       I heard a customer at TB, telling the cashier to "Make it look like the pic on the menu" Or else she wouldn't accept it. That was priceless.

       I wouldn't say the link this morning was that bad.  It was a big announcement that got people thinking about the product, and it was hardly a slam on it.  Then follow up with some "wow, better than expected" and greaseball IAMAs (corrupt mods assisting), and you've got a viral awareness campaign.

       People don't eat at Taco Bell because it's appetizing anyway.

       The whole thing was an experiment from the get go. TacoBell knew their new line was shit months in advance. That's part of the experiment. They are trying to find out what the cheapest crap they can put out that we will still buy. TB still needs to make a profit so the damage control was not only expected, but anticipated.
       <br/>
       It's shit people, you deserve the shame you feel when you give them your money. Your dollar is the only weapon you have. Conserve your ammo.

       A couple years ago both the shitty looking food link and the AMA would be right next to each other. Now you just need to hire a company to bury what is considered bad publicity.
