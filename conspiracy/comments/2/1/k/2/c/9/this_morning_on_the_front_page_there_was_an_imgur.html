<p>I browsed that link in the morning and thought to myself, &quot;yeah, this looks shitty...&quot;. Now, after reading through a couple pages of the ama, I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Hey, maybe that breakfast would be worth a try...at least I should go for a dinner binge sometime, I like TacoBell.&quot;</p>

<p>Coincidence or social media marketing done right? Was this a planned ama? How come no one voted up as top comment this morning&#39;s submission? Usually the hivemind leans against big business-y stunts like these, and holds them accountable with tough questions.</p>

<p>What gives?</p>

<p>Yes, it was a planned AMA, scheduled ahead of time. You can always view upcoming scheduled AMAs <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=amaverify%40gmail.com">here</a>. The President of Taco Bell did not just drop in on Reddit, he was booked as part of media and marketing efforts (which is why, as he mentioned, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21il1d/i_am_brian_niccol_president_of_taco_bell_today_is/">he had to leave</a> to go do Huffington Live).</p>

<p>I do know there are people so inclined, but not that many.  I remember one particularly horrific, to me,  conversation, where my best friend&#39;s mother said she was voting for that cute Ronald Reagan.  . . . but so odd, I have never forgotten and I was not even voting age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Front page is dictated by a massive series of folks hitting the &quot;upvote&quot; button.  It takes very little effort to do, and most folks will do it if they find a silly picture relatable.  A farmer in chile, a student in china, a salesman in australia, and a retiree in portugal will have very little in common.  But a picture of a cat with a peanut butter jar stuck on her.head?  Each of them will find that at least passingly amusing.  A simple upvote from each, and boom.  Meme culture and front page fluff.  Its not harmful, just keep in mind that is represents our most basic collective commonalities.  I don&#39;t really know who Justin Bieber is, but I upvote whenever he does something dumb because its kind of funny to witness his trainwreck.  </p>
