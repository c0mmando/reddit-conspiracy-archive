       A list of resources for people to do their own research? Not a stupid .jpg? Why would this be of any interest to me?

       Thank you for this compilation. Any down votes are shills or daft sheep. Every link you posted is obviously legitimate, haven't yet had the time to look into any and you already have my upvote.

       Hey man that means a lot! It may seem like a blob of information but if you read through the whole thing it is great stuff. Especially the readings list, a lot of this came from investigative journalism books that i have which are college accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I intend on making future posts similar to this about propaganda and the PR industries tactics and strategies. I wish more content like this would be in this sub not just posts of articles and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wan't to try to give people tools of information to be able to see through the thick cloud of 'spin' in media instead of just providing a narrative of current events to follow through articles and opinions.

       Excellent list, I'd also like to add
       <a href="http://rightweb.irc-online.org/">
        Rightweb
       </a>
       to it, which is a site dedicated to tracking Neocons and Militarists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rightweb is absolutely essential because it identifies many of the individual Neocon analysts, financiers and NGO's (Nongovernmental Organizations) outside of the Federal government that comprise the 'Shadow Government'.
