       Yeah, those screenshots very clearly out at least one shill. And I hesitate to even use that word because I feel that it repels many otherwise openminded people from listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if these people are actually on Facebook's payroll, but this is real evidence that someone (whether a company or private citizens who just love FB enough to make several accounts supporting them) is trying to manipulate the public's opinion in a deceptive way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What confuses me is people on other subreddits who deny this astroturfing or attempt to mischaracterize the users of this subreddit when they claim there are shills about.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       EDIT: After seeing the explanation for the duplicate posts, it seems more certain that none of the users were marketing people. They're just very enthusiastic FB fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, many of you would acknowledge that it's no secret that companies will try to influence social media sites by pretending to be a regular user. Even people who mock this subreddit would declare it's an obvious and basic marketing strategy. I guess the difference between people here and there is that some of us tend to call out fouls excessively (and I hope we can admit when we were wrong) while others will never blow the whistle.

       Reputation management consultants.  Polish any turd into a diamond and nix any negative comments with a wave of criticism and down voting.

       I spend most of my life dealing with this info, so I'll give you my opinion: It is both. Even within the same illness, both exist. For example, depression rates are very high... some of that increase are simply people with situational sadness and other normal human issues who are falsely classified with "MDD." On the other hand, some of that increase is legitimate. You can look to the increased suicide rates, self harm, etc. to substantiate this.

       I think you're right, but there's also a connection to Big Pharma that should be taken into account. Those increased diagnoses rates for situational sadness and normal human issues that you mentioned leads to an increase in prescriptions being handed out. People who shouldn't be on pharmaceuticals are getting on them and it will fuck with your head. If you're a person who genuinely needs anti-depression pills or SSRI's I completely understand that, there are differences in brain chemistry that can be tweaked in a helpful way. But I think being on them when you really shouldn't be (I.e. do not have a chemical imbalance) is going to lead to higher rates of suicide, self harm, and whatnot.

       Bingo! Serotonin is responsible for a great deal of your emotional processing and thoughts, it's not just a sad/happy juice that if you have more of you'll feel better. (Otherwise we'd all be on MDMA all the time.) Take a look at the adverse effects of the most common SSRI here:

       This is true, but if you are taking any of these drugs you should be under close supervision, like most anything else in modern medicine if used incorrectly the can make the problem much worse in the long run. ex:not taking the full course of antibiotics. These chemicals can be invaluable, but only under the right circumstances. They aren't bunk but they also aren't a panacea. All I know is that they worked for me, but I would never recommend anyone taking them unless they really need them. I couldn't get a boner for 2 years, and my libido was shot. Still worth it.

       The fact most are living a life they don't want to, but are forced to for a 'living wage' and to keep a roof over their head and food for their family.

       Then conversing with people in life that actually believe it's all real and important, or keeping an upbeat attitude because Debbie downers have been peer pressured out of existence?

       I knew it! I intuitively had a strong feeling Monsanto was doing this. The number of extremely long, well-written "pro-GMO" posts popping up
       <strong>
        EVERYWHERE
       </strong>
       GMOs were called into question just seemed a little off to me... especially when all of these comments are so similar that they are essentially carbon copies of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for posting this, I have wanted to ask
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about this for a while. Unfortunately, it seems like most people, even on this sub, have been fooled about GMOs.

       No, most people know the truth, the shills just yell loud to give the impression that "most people support GMO".

       I haven't met one person in real life that supports GMO's.  And I know republicans, democrats, independents, in other words, people from all walks of life.  Not one person supports GMO's.  They all want natural foods.

       I think awareness of this is growing. A month or so ago, I saw a post about GMOs on another site. There were several very obvious shills posting, supporting each others' posts, and crapping on dissenters. Two different people called them out for being shills, three counting me. Sometimes calling them out makes them immediately go away, especially when there's only one, rather than a brigade.

       "Shill" doesn't imply that they are paid but they espouse a view that will not be changed by evidence or logic because its in their interest to support that view.
"Paid shill" is different but they certainly exist and have multiple alt accounts to game the system ntm specialized software created especially to make gaming the system easier.

       I think there's a stigma behind using the term itself which is incredibly unfortunate. It creates doubt in a person's mind the second they hear it. Much like whenever anyone says the word conspiracy. This might make me sound weird, but it's exactly how people in control of society want us to behave.

       Yes, but I'm more referring to instances where I may divulge info regarding WTC7 or even Operation Northwoods. They may respond with," This isn't one of those conspiracy theories is it?" Credibility is lost as soon as the discussion has even begun and it's something that's hard to break through when the person is already comfortable with his or her own level ignorance. I see what you're saying tho. The proles are the recipients, but are just as often the providers whether they realize it or not.

       Ya... I understand where you're coming from there, I was offering the solution of calling them "PR people" instead of "shills."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very hard toeing that line, I had lots of decent conspiracy conversations with one of my coworkers over the last year but then just a week ago I mentioned something about 9/11 and he says, light-heartedly, "Oh you're one of those conspiracy guys aren't you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I just laughed and nodded "yup" ha. I work with some cool people its not a corporate deal, but there's still a certain line you can't cross before everything you say can be dismissed without question. You've gone too far past the fence and nobody wants to come with you see what's out there.

       I find that interesting  because I got into a ... 'fervent but not heated' argument with a group of coworkers a few years back about 9/11 NOT being an 'inside job'. It felt a little weird to be in a group of about 5 men and being the only one not to believe in a conspiracy that the vast majority of the country discredits. I welcomed it because I'm a fan of having these discussions in general, but I wonder if its belief a little wider held than media lets on.

       That is interesting. Thanks for sharing. It's a total mystery because it's one of those things where people like me, after the initial disillusionment period, we start to keep this stuff bottled up because there are negative social ramifications to going public with your beliefs.

        A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_%28Internet%29">
        A sockpuppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception. The term—a reference to the manipulation of a simple hand puppet made from a sock—originally referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an internet community who spoke to, or about, himself while pretending to be another person.[1] The term now includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization,[2] or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website. A significant difference between the use of a pseudonym[3] and the creation of a sockpuppet is that the sockpuppet poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the puppeteer. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.

       And I wasn't talking about, or to you at all, I just jacked your comment to be closer to the top. I'm also kind of glad that after all this time I've been on Reddit that I've never heard nor know what the word "stawmanning" is. Sounds like what my Broncos QB was at the superbowl... a strawmanning.

       I agree that there is no shortage of people who are creepily invested in defending and supporting a huge corporation no matter what, but that being said some PR agencies are hired to and specialize in precisely doing that kind of stuff. It's along the lines of crisis management, but just even more unsavory.

       THAT IS WHAT IT IS, SELFISHNESS.

      <p>
       Is it really so hard to believe that shills are a real phenomenon? These so called open minded folk you speak of should open their eyes. It is in the interest of these businesses to manipulate social media and turn it to their advantage. The association of the word as a conspiracy theory retort or "dirty word" in effect is the result of those who do not wish to be exposed as such.. think about it.

       Shills exist but you're right it could be karma whoring. What I was thinking it could be one of those times when someone copy/pasted a comment (for karma) and then someone else saw that he was copying from facebook and copied other text from the same facebook page to be funny and show he knew he was copying it.  But shills do exist.  PR firms do this everyday and get paid to do it.  So who knows?

       Is this even a debate?  Is it even illegal? Then it's not a conspiracy.  Of course this is part of their PR model.. The way the Internet works almost requires it.. I mean.. Places like Reddit are a shouting ground for people to voice their own opinions. It would be bad for business for them not to do such a thing..  That being said  - it's unethical, it's manipulative, it's deceitful,  and it just goes to prove that organisations actually do this kind of thing,  Facebook,  Google,  fracking organizations, and even alphabet soup agencies - and they will lie about it.. Which proves their dishonesty.

       Normal men do not fear being labeled, for truth is self evident.  One can easily validate the truth, and therefore should never fear an incorrect label.  Only those who are obvious liars.

       I am pretty sure it is copypasta trolling.  The gaming nerds are angry and shouting exactly the same vitriol e.g. "R.I.P Occulus" and so people are just pasting in the same comment to see if they get the same chain of comments and for how long.   It is amusing in itself and also funny (but not unexpected)  to see conspiracy theory born from this phenomena.  Unfortunately, people are going too far by claiming "absolute proof" and "real evidence." This does nothing for the subs reputation which you seem concerned about.

       Would a real shill for a corporate organisation reply to himself? Would a real shill copy and paste comments.   The conspiracy is an entertaining interpretation of events but really should not be taken with the gravitas that I am seeing here.  Reddit is desperate to believe this one

       Why were you so desperate  for a conspiracy theory involving shills to be the ONLY possible explanation given a voice!?

       Can you not see how my non-conspiracy view on this was totally valid and the most probable truth that most intelligent people accept now.  This is despite the massive campaign and hysteria against a sensible explanation.  Your dirty disinformation tactics of slandering me makes you an integral part of the witchhunt and you should share responsible for the death threats being made to various people and the harassment.

       Firstly you are  a 12 day old negative karma account and you have the cheek to insinuate malice.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets do this:
      </p>
      <p>
       How have I tried to discredit Hailcorporate?  Seriously wtf? I have posted there and get upvoted fairly regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is my involvement of subreddit drama?   They have documented one of my threads as drama and I turned up in that thread to thank them for their downvote brigade.  I did not know they were the bad guys!  They are just another meta subreddit like this is sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you trying to dox me?  Are my questions and level of discussion not appropriate for this subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you not like my simple explanation?  Why does a simple explanation and respectful discussion bother YOU so much that you have brought-out your puppet account to try and disrupt me?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing is clearly a case of people absolutely wanting to believe that they have found shills.   I respectfully have given an alternative theory without rubbishing the one being presented here as having "absolute evidence".

       i mean, that's only if you think the shilling profession (if "professional" shills even exist) is a strict one.
      </p>
      <p>
       but shills are real, theres no doubt about that. look up the greenwald piece on it from february.
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree with you that it could just be a troll, as many are, but the fact that facebook is heavily in bed with the nsa makes shilling for facebook a very likely event.
      </p>
      <p>
       they might have loose "regulation" that allows for lazy shills. who knows? nsa workers have been caught doing inappropriate spying on their girlfriends, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       so an actual shill, already at the bottom of the totem pole? i wouldnt be so sure to say copypasta isnt in their little arsenal.

       I disagree with you, this is likely fake shilling. Any shill with shit for brains would know to slightly change the comments and to keep it spread out over many sub's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to note I'm not arguing that there aren't shills, just that this is not one actually working for FB. Plus, this is over a fucking gaming platform. That isn't exactly an important topic.

       Games are a billion dollar industry, worth the time of companies / shills. That being said, looks like they invested in cheap over sea shills. Taking jobs away from good hard working American shills.

       Exactly, its basically impossible to tell who they are. That's the big problem, not just that they exist, but the group mentality that everyone is suspicious. And I've yet to hear a good idea on how to fix it.

       The shitty shills are there to further hide the pro shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you root out a pro shill when everybody in the thread is focusing on the obvious shit shills?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling the pro shills are VERY selective with what they post, how it's worded, and where it's posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use the shit shills as a wall to hide behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, I'm not the smartest human in the room, so if I can think of a basic strategy like this to hide shills, you had better bet your ass that somebody who is smarter than me that is involved in this BUSINESS, damn well has thought of it ( and has probably already implimented it ).

       Th gaming nerds might be spewing the same vitriol because this was a crowd funded project that is now catering to a different audience entirely, and perhaps theyre pissed they spent money to fund a vr gaming console and now they're getting a fucking facebook product...not to mention there have already been over 11 projects for games that have already been canceled because no one wants anything to do with shady motherfuckers like mark zuckerberg

       It wasn't exactly fraud, technically at least. The kick starter was to get the device working as a platform IIRC, not any specific platform like games, just a general one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now obviously literally everyone thought it was exactly what was implied, a gaming platform. But legally the whole thing hasn't been against kickstarter's rules.

       That's not a shadowban.
      </p>
      <p>
       A shadowban just means your account is deleted from existence by admins. You can still post, but none of them will show up without mod approval, and no one can access your /u/ page.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might have been banned from

       and
       <a href="/r/technology">

       This is true, however mods can so something which resembles a shadowban.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can use automod's wiki feature to target indvidual accounts and automatically place all of their submissions and comments into the spamfilter. This is done without altering the user so it can be considered a shadowban of sorts from indvidual subs. Dirty practice that I look upon with scorn.

       I just found out this was a job. On a podcast they were talking about tons of money being paid for comments on articles! I'm doing it for free like a sucker. People are getting paid to argue against global warming and make pro fracking comments.

       Urgh! I want that job so much but I couldn't be that person. Unless, I do it and then make another account which could post immediately afterwards and debunk what I was paid to say. Maybe that would even things out.

       I have no idea, but hearing after hearing about it, it totally makes sense that they'd want people commenting just to confuse people/reinforce peoples beliefs with links/data. It sucks, it seems like every time you see a controversial topic come up there's someone negating it and it's hard to get to the truth (on some subjects).

       <strong>
        They have made a statement, which is important to include. I'm making no comment or judgement on this:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hahahaha, oh my god.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm the guy. The evil guy or whatever. Here's what really happened:
       </p>
       <p>
        I commented in the
        <a href="/r/technology">
         /r/technology
        </a>
        Oculus post. The top comment was like "RIP Oculus" or something. A bit later I see another rising post in /new, with the same kind of title. And what do you know? It has the same top comment! Wow!
       </p>
       <p>
        So you know what I thought would be funny? To copy and paste the reply comments, just like that guy reposted the top comment. People will see that I posted all the comment replies to myself, recognize that they're the same as in that other thread, and have a laugh. Kind of caricaturing the karma whoring people will do in copying comments. At worst, it'll get a few downvotes, and at best people will have a laugh, right?
       </p>
       <p>
        No. Not right. So hilariously not right.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidently doing this was proof that I'm a...shill? (I'm not sure what that means, but given all the hate mail I gather it's some kind of insult. I'll look it up if I start giving a fuck.) I'm also a bot. And a Facebook employee. And an Oculus employee. And a bunch of other evil stuff.

        Anyway, I made those comments, got a few people calling me a liar, and just figured they were a few vocal idiots. Went to class, came home and watched a few new rented DVDs with the girlfriend. I'd say which ones, but maybe I'm a movie rep too, praying on innocent Redditors! Lets just say one was a new animated film about a cold place, and the other was about being stuck in space. I login, and see a shit storm! Woohoo!
       </p>
       <p>
        Death threats, probably a hundred personal insults, and so on. All of my recent comments have been downvoted (even the ones unrelated to the Oculus thing). Apparently there are way more paranoid Redditors than I thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll probably have to start a new Reddit account to avoid all the hate mail. And that's fine. I got rid of my last account because it contained much of my full name. I can't imagine what this kind of witch hunt would be like if people knew my name. ಠ_ಠ
       </p>
       <p>
        It does kind of stink, though. I've been gilded like 3-4 times on this account. Made quite a few top comments or front page posts that I thought contributed to the community. I've had this puppy for a year! I even got into an argument with
        <a href="/u/shittywatercolour">
         /u/shittywatercolour
        </a>
        . And the guy who I copied/pasted comments from will probably the butt of this witch hunt as well. That honestly didn't even cross my mind when I reposted the comments. If you had told me reposting comments as replies to myself to poke fun at reposts would result in a witch hunt, I'd call you insane. &gt;But it did, and (s)he is probably affected by it. And I'm sorry. :(
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyway, I'm going to report the people who threatened me and made personal insults, maybe post this comment elsewhere to spread what happened and then jump ship. To a new account. Fuck. This. haha

       The shills are a plague. Just the other day, I'm pretty sure I ran into a NAMBLA shill. It's fucking weird hearing him defend Jimmy Saville.
      </p>
      <p>
       But outside of the main subreddits, reddit is still a good place to get exposure to primary sources. Skip over the obvious opinion shit that gets posted, and skip over the shill comments. Just keep digging at the sources until you get to the original primary source. Read that and do some critical thinking to make up your own mind. Don't let other people's interpretation heavily sway you.

       Facebook, Google, Apple, Monsanto are effectively the "government". Or rather, the PR facing government and those companies are all wings of the centralized authority in control of this planet.

       So, not to get everybody's hopes up, but I'm tentatively working on a p2p, manipulation-resistant reddit-like utility.  Assuming it ever nears completion, the features I have planned are intended to fix issues with corrupt moderation and shilling, among other things.  Since it's still very early in its development, what would you guys like to see in such a website/ utility/ whatever?

       If it's a site, make the whole site, source code, comments, posts and all, downloadable via p2p. So if you get forced to take it down or whatever, it simply can't be destroyed.

       It has two clients, a native and a browser one.  The idea is that you can point your browser towards a known native client, and it will send you the browser client which is in essence just a website.  The browser client is what's used to view content on the utility, while the native client's only purpose is to host the network (mining).  From the browser client you will also be able to download a copy of the native client.

       Do you mean 4chan-style anonyminity or Tor/ Freenet/ I2P style anonyminity?  If you mean anonymous posting, I don't think that's a very good idea because it makes it extremely easy for shills to pose as multiple people.  If you mean anonyminity in terms of hiding your IP address from the network; I'm trying to make it as anonymous as possible, but just from the nature of the tasks the network has to accomplish in this situation, I'm not sure it's possible to achieve something Tor-tier.  It will still be much better than reddit and 4chan in terms of IP logging, though.

       I've gotten the suggestion to remove public karma a few times.  I may do it, though it's worth noting that the current plan calls for karma to operate much differently than it does on reddit.  Karma is going to be a sort of currency where upvotes cost one point and downvotes cost ten points, with the idea being that making votes expensive will discourage inane puns and memes and encourage more insightful discussion.  Users start with zero karma and it has to be earned either through recieving upvotes or "mining" karma.  Users can mine karma by running the native client on their computers and offering up a few gigabytes of disk space to the network.  For every hundred or so requests the client serves, that user will be awarded one karma.

       Not that much easier than a reddit-like system where creating another account takes seconds. Hell, that is what this thread is about.

       I post in a lot of places, none of that relates to the OP mass downvoting this person.  I don't know or care about any turf war.  How can there be a turf war on the internet?

       People's need to fit into a group and then attack whatever they believe is the opposition or group that's in the wrong, you have a subreddit called
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       the name even implies making fun of this subreddit and people look for posts here to post there to have a jolly old time and laugh at other people they feel better/smarter than

       Most people I know have already abandoned Facebook. People online will try and defend it, but many of them are either shills or just uninformed. People have come to realize that it's little more than a government-approved tool to spy on it's users (and more accurately, make them spy on themselves). Nobody trusts it anymore.

       Reputation management companies (from where many corporate "shills" come from) tend to hire individuals who already have an internet presence. Thus, an organic account may be used for promoting a product, agenda, etc.

       So, you have an opinion and want to comment on a thread.  What do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       A: Post your own comment by taking the time to type type it out.
B: Scour reddit for SOMEONE who has the same opinion as you, find a comment that will say what you like.....copy and paste??
      </p>
      <p>
       B sounds like a ridiculous amount of time to waste given the comment is, what, 4 or so sentences long??  That and the comments are not on the same day I assume so?  Why go hunting for the same comment to copy and paste again?

       Please. Understand. People bash this subreddit for claiming things are proof when they're literally not proof of evidence. It has been pointed out that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       other possibilities.

        Edit: You could have literally posted the same thing but not made the claim of "proof with absolute evidence" and it'd be perfect.

       I think you might be viewing things here from a very skewed perspective.  There is no hive mind here, we are a group of individuals who all hold our own unique opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single time I see your statement expressed here by someone, or a statement that says about the same thing (oh the hive mind!) or (oh blame it on the joos!) I can't resist the urge to click your user profile and see conspiratard staring back at me.

       Why jump to the assumption of shilling when the more likely and logical explanation is that Lellux is a karma whore or thought he was being funny?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why assume all the other comments are by the same guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the FAR more likely explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       -3 people carry on a fairly intelligent conversation in
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       , accumulating decent karma
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Then one of 2 things:
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -- Lellux is a karma whore, and copypastas the 3 comments to another subreddit (unlikely since it makes him look retarded replying to himself as though he were different people) OR
      </p>
      <p>
       -- Just as Lellux said, he thinks he's being funny by posting the highest comments from one discussion under an identical parent comment on another discussion (he's not. still retarded and clearly more than one person can come up with the short and simple comment "RIP Oculus").
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Someone notices the copypasta, screen caps it, and calls him out. This becomes the highest rated comment in the discussion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Others see that screenshot and try to be funny/reap karma by pasting the same comments. Just like Lellux, they are retarded and get downvoted.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People who want to see a conspiracy in everything
         <strong>
          assume
         </strong>
         the worst, then claim it to be irrefutable prrof. Just like all the rest, the are full re...well, you get the picture.

       In this case a shill is somebody paid by a company (or government) to pretend to be a normal reddit user and post things in support of the cause they are paid to support in an attempt to sway public opinion in their favor.

       Wanky may be the wrong word... Like people are trying too hard to be intellectual, it's a word that doesn't add anything to the conversation other than make it sound worse than it actually is

       Most people I know have already abandoned Facebook. People online will try and defend it, but many of them are either shills or just uninformed. People have come to realize that it's little more than a government-approved tool to spy on it's users (and more accurately, make them spy on themselves). Nobody trusts it anymore.
