    <div class="md"><p>What bugs me is where is a flight crew during all this? They have access to emergency phones and would have noticed the flight going off course. Malaysia Airlines has satellite communication systems. The satellite &quot;pings&quot; you keep reading about were the pings from the Inmarsat satcom system. If the satcom modem was still pinging the satellite then the satcom system was still operational. Why didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t anyone get a message out? The official explanation is that Malaysia Airlines had Inmarsat satcom equipment installed but had not &quot;subscribed&quot; to the service. Why would an airline waste all the money installing the equipment (the expensive part) and not actually sign up for the service (the cheap part)? Plus you can find an article (from 2009) discussing Malaysia Airlines upgrading their Inmarsat equipment and confirming the fact that they did have in flight data services.</p>

<p>Malaysia Airlines didn&#39;t subscribe to Inmarsat service:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point didn&#39;t even think of the flight attendants. Everything surrounding MH370 is fishy. Why does a black box have such a shitty battery? Why can you only hear when you are 2 miles within range? You&#39;d think airliners would have the best tracking systems for their planes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good question. Even if the footage was only recorded to the black box rather than uploaded online or anything like that. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t want to be recorded while on a flight and I don&#39;t know why. I just think it&#39;s invasive. It&#39;s not like some dark alley or somewhere dangerous that could genuinely use a security camera.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m surprised the government haven&#39;t tried to push this idea. Especially here in the UK where there is CCTV everywhere. Maybe it&#39;s because the flights might cross international waters therefore there are different country&#39;s laws to take into consideration and each passenger might be of different nationality and so their rights are different. I bet it would be a legal minefield. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I just saw the second part of your question. Well, I guess it would depend on the airline as that would determine the nationality of the pilots. With regards to MH370 I don&#39;t know because I don&#39;t know what Malaysian people&#39;s rights are. But here in the UK I think it might be a union issue. If pilots got the job before being constantly filmed during their shift then they wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to agree to being filmed once they brought that practice in to place. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue of data protection in the UK. You can&#39;t hold data about a person unless it is deemed totally necessary and I guess the pilots could argue that it wasn&#39;t necessary. I don&#39;t know, these are just ideas. I don&#39;t know enough about the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, but no need to save the footage of a normal safe flight. Only the ones where say the pilot had to make an emergency landing, or there was a pilot error or something to that effect. But the job of a pilot has so many peoples lives in their hands it just makes sense to me that they could be filmed for the safety of everyone on board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are actually, but not on all of them. On the new Airbus A380 you can watch yourself take off, fly and land from the screen in front of you through a camera mounted inside the upper part of the tail of the plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well video can take up lots of space but it could be useful. I think the two best improvements the airlines could do to protect from hijackings is to install cameras as well as maybe a way for the pilots or any other of the crew to be able to have some form of non lethal weapons or perhaps lethal that would be locked away and in the event they are accessed it would send out an automatic distress signal. That way in the worst case situation that the plane does crash rescue Crew would be able find the location increasing the possibility of survivors</p>
