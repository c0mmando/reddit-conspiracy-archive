We won&#39;t survive long if we are to go at this divided and alone. You can save yourself some food and learn tricks to sustain yourself, but it will be useless when the rest of the community has turned against you.</p>

<p>If we are to make a successful resistance then we need to group up with each other, and see past our differences. We need to build up trust and stop thinking selfishly. Our leaders have always kept us divided and selfish, and so we need to work against that.</p>

<p>It is time we took a step in the right direction and united ourselves first. I created the sub <a href="/r/UnitedWeStand">/r/UnitedWeStand</a> yesterday for those interested in discussing how to introduce the idea of unity in our community. It is the only way we will succeed.</p>

<p>For those who are not convinced yet, I have discussed this in greater detail <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/219jbz/what_do_we_do_now_here_is_what_i_think_we_should/">here</a> and within the other sub.</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t start now, no one else will, and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uCePtq4.jpg">we don&#39;t need any leader to lead us.</a></p>

<p>I know you’re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you’re afraid. You’re afraid of us. You’re afraid of change. I don’t know the future. I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin. I’m going to hang up this phone, and then I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see. I’m going to show them a world … without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My plan is to lead by example. We can begin by lending a hand to others who are in need, showing everyday kindness, and giving more freely to one another. We can share these ideas with our loved ones, and help them understand how the old way of thinking is dangerous to our species and to our world. We need to continue bringing people together under these ideas so that we can grow. </p>

<p>Once we can group up with enough individuals in our local communities (even small groups are better than none), we can consider about volunteering in our free time to help strangers who are in want i.e. reaching out further than we could have alone. </p>

<p>People can find strength for their emotional problems with each other&#39;s support and acceptance of their differences. Volunteer to listen to the problems of strangers. I am sure there are many more ways we can think of providing for others and reaching out to others to give them the sense that they are not alone in this world. Some in the sub have already suggested how we could give speeches at churches and other places on the importance of giving and seeing past differences. Others have suggested how we can create pamphlets to reach out to people who don&#39;t aren&#39;t in touch with the internet. We can put up posters in colleges to help bring together like minded people. This will be useful since I am sure many young people feel trapped and would be open to taking these steps.</p>

<p>These are just my own ideas for now, and hope we can all discuss how to better facilliate the spread of these ideas, and  introduce them whereever we are. </p>

<p>If I was planning on grouping people who are a danger, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to group them under the idea of violence, than something like this that I have created? My sub is only about non-violence and lending a hand to one another. If they plan to do background checks on people who plan to promote good intentions and good will, then they will wasting their time and resources focusing on that. It makes no sense for them to collect absurd useless information because then they have too much unnecessary data to work with. It would make more sense to do random background checks on random strangers on the internet, than some group like mine if they intend to control anything. Even that would be useless data collecting. </p>
