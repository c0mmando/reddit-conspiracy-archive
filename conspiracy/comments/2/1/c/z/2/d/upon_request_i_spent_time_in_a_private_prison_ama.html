<p>The charge I was there for was Burglary of a Building.</p>

<p>EDIT- Good time means you get out earlier, basically time off for good behavior.</p>

<p>EDIT #2- Also, there was no getting out early for good behavior. If you were sentenced to 2 years you did exactly 2 years no matter what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife is a CJ major as well, and I have known some very awesome cops who should be very proud of what they do. I&#39;m certainly not one of those people that hates entire groups of people based on the actions of a few, or even the majority. Judgments must be made on the individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>-Yes, it was an open 52 man dorm. Along 3 of the walls were the bunks divided into groups of 4 and along the 4th wall was the toilets and showers. Lots of shit went down after lights out.</p>

<p>EDIT- To be specific, only medium security was 52- man dorms. M2 and Max were much smaller.</p>

<p>-Yes, I went to the hole quite often. </p>

<p>-I think the jobs were divided into 8 hour days, but to be honest I quit working within a few months of being there. When I first got there they put me in the fields but I refused after a few days. I would have gone to maximum security pretty quick over it but I happened to get put on a medication that had a sunlight restriction so it worked out. I then got place in the kitchen but got kicked out of there for stealing a cake.  Then I was made an SSI, but I ended up going to max security after a few weeks so I couldn&#39;t work after that. I was actually in max during the attacks on 9/11 and didn&#39;t even learn of the attacks until almost 2 weeks after they happened.</p>

<p>-None, there is no pay at all for work.</p>

<p>-Minimum security (called low-risk) left the farm for work every day. They were the greenskeepers for a local golf course. They were also the ones who brought in most of the contraband for the unit, mostly tobacco. I never even came close to low risk status, and it would have been practically impossible for me to achieve anyway so I never tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was nothing like the &quot;hole&quot; in the movies. Also, I never heard it called the hole. Segregation was on 2 floors in a big building that kind of made a semi-circle. It was bright and it was loud. Probably about 10 feet by 8 feet, with nothing in it but a bed and a toilet/sink. There was no limit to how long you could be in for, the longest stretch I did was about 6 months. Some people, such as &quot;confirmed&quot; gang members never leave, they are permanently in seg.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I feel like I should say that I was charged with Burglary of a Building, I never said I did it. I did commit a crime, but what I committed was vandalism.</p>

<p>As far as advice to someone going to prison my advice would be don&#39;t join a gang. As far as the advice you always hear such as don&#39;t back down from a fight or something like that, I&#39;m pretty sure that type of advice is pretty pointless. You&#39;re true nature will come out, either you&#39;ll make it or you won&#39;t. I saw some seriously bad shit come to those who were weak. So my advice would be don&#39;t be that guy but the reality is you either are or you aren&#39;t and you&#39;re not going to know which one you are until it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but you could receive books from the outside as long as someone purchased it and had the publisher send it to you directly.

    <div class="md"><p>I was in maximum security when 9/11 happened and we had been on our worst behavior for a long while. Normally there was a TV in the day room we could watch once a day, but because of how crazy it had been we were locked in our &quot;houses&quot; (6-8 man cells) for a month or so. The guards really stayed out of our area, other than just walking down the walkway for count occasionally. There were never pleasant conversations with these particular guards, but they did turn on the Cowboys game a couple weeks after 9/11 and that&#39;s how we found out about the attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Medium(regular) custody- You get up around 5:30 for necessities(laundry). Then you go back to your dorm for about half an hour and then breakfast. You are supposed to have 20 minutes to eat, but  what you actually get is 5. In the winter you can wear your jacket and when they put the pancakes on your tray you put them in your pocket and the inmates will play dumb and give you more. Eat. Rarely any fighting in chow, as it&#39;s a major case in the chow hall. Normally it&#39;s a minor case, which doesn&#39;t mean shit.  Then you go back to the dorm, and soon after turn out for work or classes. There is also rec Then lunch. Food sucks, really fucking bad. Back to dorm and then another rec. Our unit had weights, I believe we were one of the last in Texas to have them. Side note, my dorm also had dividers in the bathroom between the toilets and showers for my first few months, but the guards found out we were using the brackets as wrenches to get into the electrical sockets and took them all. Then supper and rec again and then lights out. And then fights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was definitely violent, though not as bad as TV makes it out to be. Or I guess you could say it can be that bad, but it&#39;s not all the time. There were only maybe 3 full out riots while I was there in my dorm. Fighting was very common and could happen anywhere at anytime, though it was usually in the dorms and scheduled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually what I did. You get wrote up, it&#39;s a minor case. Once you get a certain number of minor cases, it becomes a major case, then the process starts over. Once you have a certain amount of major cases you go up a security level. Eventually when it&#39;s all said and done you wind up in maximum security.</p>
