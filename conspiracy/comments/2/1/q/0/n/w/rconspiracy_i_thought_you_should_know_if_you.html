    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem with looking for a sub which doesn&#39;t really effect you personally, rather on larger scale. The default subs have the most traction and sphere of influence. You can start your own sub or join a more obscure sub that deals with the same content. That doesn&#39;t stop anyone else from still being a part of that larger sub and receiving or not receiving information which they use to form opinions. So the larger subs disseminate to a group on a much larger scale therefore, the influence is much more profound.</p>

<p>People are lazy and basically don&#39;t give a shit if the ship is being captained by a corrupt mod as long as they feel they&#39;re not being effected personally. This story will pass in a few days and nobody (including the admins) will do anything about it. In an unspecified amount of time, some mod will show themselves to be corrupt again, the whole deal will repeat itself and be forgotten again. You can see similar behaviour in real life where people vote for liars and corrupt politicians and parties, seem to have a bout of amnesia and do it all again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like calling people names but people are basically incredibly docile and gullible and will keep going back the watering hole that&#39;s full of crocodiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen some of your posts here and I enjoy them. I try and help people as well but it&#39;s a dead end sometimes because the conversation contains the word conspiracy. I first came to Reddit and it looked promising to me. The discussions were vibrant and wide ranging and some of the posters and information was new to me and eye opening. I&#39;ve seen this trait quickly spiral into trolls, the acquisition of subs by corrupt people and constant personal attacks in an attempt to undermine information.</p>

<p>Even here, there&#39;s only perhaps under 30 posters that have very well sourced material that doesn&#39;t stray into complete fantasy land. It&#39;s not an attack on this sub, I like coming here and the mods seem fair but it&#39;s just worsened like the rest of Reddit and that&#39;s due to a huge amount of trolls that can&#39;t stand people discussing things they don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Thank you. That made me feel like I&#39;m on the right track. </p>

<p>I took Jesse Ventura&#39;s advice and now whenever &#39;strange&#39; things happen and I&#39;m talking to someone like that I call it a &#39;coincidence&#39;. That usually works. </p>

<p>Same for me. I was all starry-eyed like &quot;Wow. So I can just share all of my ideas with people? This is so awesome.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Same. It really hit me once I saw the bots are posting threads on Reddit. Such a letdown that people are willing to stoop to so low just to interrupt progressive discourse. </p>

<p>I get that feeling too, but in the end my goal is to at least wake up as many people as I can. I don&#39;t want our society to become like <a href="http://www.sickchirpse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Wall-E-2.jpg">this.</a></p>
