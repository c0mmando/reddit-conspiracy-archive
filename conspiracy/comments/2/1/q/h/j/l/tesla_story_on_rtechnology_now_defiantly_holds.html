       It's mod-initiated, which means almost nothing, versus admin-initiated, which means the user was engaged in something naughtier.

       While that is true, I don't think that is very important.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       has been designed from the start to be a discussion subreddit, which means that content can and will be removed if it is abusive or deliberately trolly, at the discretion of the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Removals have so far been few, and submission removals are documented in
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is broader in its remit than
       <a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">
        /r/TheoryOfReddit
       </a>
       , from which many of the most interesting discussions are removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subreddit
       <a href="/r/PoliticalModeration">
        /r/PoliticalModeration
       </a>
       is available for discussion, but the subreddit rules there explicitly forbid content removals, except for doxxing or CP, and the subreddit has traditionally been used as a "last resort" for documenting submission removals from the rest of reddit, and not a discussion sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pointless to have a subreddit to discuss reddit censorship if the people involved in that censorship are excluded from the sub, so I have included a broad range of redditors in the mod team to provide a wide range of views and to encourage discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been arguing for free speech and greater moderation transparency on reddit for years, and have included
       <a href="/u/go1dfish">
        /u/go1dfish
       </a>
       in the team, who has actually built many tools to assist in providing this transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the mod team acts up in any way, there will always be a guaranteed outlet for outrage in
       <a href="/r/PoliticalModeration">
        /r/PoliticalModeration
       </a>
       , such as it is.

       Not quite: I like the mods I've chosen, and trust them to moderate
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A whole lot of stuff gets deleted from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       : I haven't been here much in the last couple of years, but I know those deletions have lead to a lot of distrust on the part of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       While
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       is small, I think we'll be able to get by without deleting much at all, so the allegiances of the mods should not matter much at all.

      <p>
       If the sub grows bigger, these issues might become more important.

       We've had some mods here before who have gotten out of control, but generally when it's happened the place went nuts for a few days and then the mod in question was gone and we've elected new ones. Overall, I think we've done pretty well here as far as mod teams go and many of our mods I am straight up a fan of.

       I've had a couple comments deleted here because I legitimately went too far, in an argument I was in, and a mod messaged me and we had a cordial exchange.

       Hi. Speaking of "insane", while you're here denigrating this subreddit would you care to explain why a number of the original RT4 insiders are calling what you and your peers did to that movement "sabotage"? Thanks!

       You could give it a shot by creating a series of subreddits to create an inner Redidit inside Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a sub called DEReddit (democratically elected Reddit) and have a post of each default sub (like
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       ) and have people run for mod by commenting. Then the winning candidate(s) create the

       I think reddit needs to step in at a senior level and engage the services or at least consult with the directors of Wikipedia. Reddit at the top-level subs like
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       etc needs to take whatever actions are necessary to clean out the trash, and to stay clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has far too much scope, influence and potential to do good - we can't allow it to go the way of the Digg disaster.

       I think he's saying that Wikipedia is an internet site with a similar size and scope that also works with volunteer mods. They have been able to survive this long and seem to have good mods so maybe they can help the Reddit admins develop a new system of mod accountability and oversight.

       Yes but the way wiki mods work is many specialize in certain subjects or fields and are In charge of handling those. Much like reedit is broken into subs based on subjects. There are some differences that's for sure though.

       It is different - but the core problem of gaming or deliberately messing with the system (and the truth) is exactly the same.

       Wikipedia devotes massive resources to making sure their approved editors, senior editors and submissions are as free from inappropriate or paid influence as possible.

       Wikipedia is even worse than reddit in terms of censorship and corporate/government control.  For most topics I find it informative, but you have to be aware that there are major biases for other topics in wikipedia.

       Digg was gamed by its own management, not its userbase as much (articles making it to front page based on hidden selection, which was based on ad revenue). Also, powerusers were really just an illusion since nobody really understood why how stories made it to the front page, they just started following these high karma users like some kind of cargo cult practice.

       That's pretty much the whole point of r/conspiritard. Funny enough, the term "conspiracy theorist" was coined and introduced to the English lexicon by...the FBI after the Kennedy assassination. The term is meant to be a derogatory term to blanket skeptics, which actually adhere to the most scientific stances of social studies and understanding of world events.

       The best way to suppress a conspiracy theory is to introduce some crazy nonsense conspiracy theory. In a trial, if you show the prosecution introduced fake evidence, then even real evidence against you can get thrown out as inadmissable.

       It's really hard to say which way the wind blows, but money always talks. There are rumors that telsa has active reddit astro-turfers. I wouldn't think about it much either way.

      <p>
       Also, for a bit of an eye-opener... you can readily duckduckgo "buy reddit uppvotes" and you'll see a ton of real websites where anyone can buy upvotes nearly instantly. All of reddit is fair game, the question is what content you are seeing was paid for, and is the seemingly popular and accepting opinions of something in the comments really so?

       Sadly, people fall pray to authority consensus very easily. This has been well documented in sociological studies: people never go against the herd.

       I know this is sarcastic but people with that position that no one here is important is a big, steaming pile of shit. Reddit is obviously an important hub for advertising because you can see Hollywood marketing upfront for movies every week with AMA's from various celebrities. Free advertising to a massive number of people saves huge amounts of money and reaches a large audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought that the underhand marketing is done through deals with Reddit anyway. With mods in place to maintain the integrity of the marketing which has been white listed from the top, who exactly is going to question it? Not only that, but rival companies can be suppressed because of deals that have already been struck. Do people not wonder if the founders of Reddit or mods aren't taking money to plant innocent looking stories? I think it was
       <a href="/u/AssuredThrowaway">
        /u/AssuredThrowaway
       </a>
       that has been exposing Reddit corruption and I'm sure I've seen here (IIRC) that one of the Reddit founders owns a PR company while still being on board with Reddit, which seems like a profitable marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider all the other kinds of interests either personal or from governments that want to give off an appearance and you have a conspiracy that isn't far fetched.

       R/technology mods are especially abusive. I posted this story one evening. It received a couple thousand points of karma, and 500 comments, and was permanently banned from posting on the sub, for no reason.

       They are complaining when someone said something on reddit they didn't like (usually feminist and equality stuff). They then link to those comments and vote-brigade it (downvote it en masse). This is theoretically against reddits rules but strangely SRS (and only them) are allowed to do it. If you dissent there/argue/discuss you WILL get banned. You will not only get banned when you argue poorly but you will get banned no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the threads they are linking provide scientific evidence they still get pissed. They are a hateful bunch.

       To travel further down the SRS conspiracy theory road, some people think masculinity is being actively suppressed through media and social shaming. SRS sort of fits into that theory because they have a weird agenda. And this new brand of "feminism" is so new and has spread so widely through the Internet.

       This is the third Tesla related post that I personally have submitted that has been taken down. This is AFTER the mod posting claiming that Tesla posts will NOT be removed. I have messaged them as to why, and have received no replies. One of those three was put back up, but only many hours after it was originally posted, and therefore had absolutely no chance at making the front page.

       routinely place

       in automod's autoremoval wiki; so if your comments are not being acknowledged in either of those subs you must remember to go to the permalink of the comment in question and log out of your account to see if your posts are allowed to go through.

       Presumably just because electric cars are a threat to the oil industry. It doesn't have to e a government conspiracy, anyone who thinks BP and Exxon don't hire PR firms to AstroTurf the Internet should think again.

       Look at the mod in question, he moderates over 400 subreddits. He could be working for a single entity or he could be a free agent offering his moderating services in some sort of censorship black market.
      </p>

       He could also just be an asshole with a lot of time, but that seems increasingly unlikely given the pattern of censored stories on

       Check out the documentary "who killed the electric car?" I think it's available online.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about an incident in the 90s where the California government mandated the car companies produce a certain number of electric cars, even though the car seemed designed to fail they sold like hotcakes to hippy dippy California people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, all the cars were recalled and destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that's the version of the story that I can remember off the top of my head.

       Why would an oil company hate electric cars? Pretty sure plenty of oil is used in the production of these cars, let alone looking at the paint on them. Haven't seen an electric semi so they would still be in use for delivery. Trains use oil as well, I dunno man I'm just thinking out loud here haha

       Even 4chan is no longer safe and free, the mod team there have long been infiltrated and I even suspect moot gave in already to threats (vague or direct) or sweet deals. Worst of all, I suspect that mods are reading past posts that I made based on my IP address to make snark counter comments. I don't even consider them arguments, really just snark comments that suspiciously mentions something about a post I made long ago or related to a post I made long ago. I don't use trips and the board doesn't use IDs, so there's only one way they could post a fail counter post meant to "shock" me or make me feel shaken (ie. "how could this guy know this and that about me?"), and that is reading past posts of a certain IP address. There is a strong possibility that there are shills in the 4chan moderator team.

       For all the blatant removal of Tesla-related articles, I feel like if there ever was a company/person who has developed either a creepy cult-like fanatical following or just hires people to post positive comments about it/them over and over, its definitely Tesla/Elon Musk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just kinda creepy--sure its a good company making some very unique decisions, but he is still a rich investor who happens to have a good PR team. I don't know why reddit seems to be all "hate all rich investors (except elon musk hes dreamy).

       I would exclusively purchase Tesla vehicles if I was able to afford one. It is a no brainer. All electric, looks stylish, and beats a BMW M5 in a 1/4 mile? Sold.

       What we really need is trancparency. The tools the mods have are important to enforce high quality, but there should be a category [deleted] next to [hot], [top] etc. to see what the mods are deleting. So far
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete

       is the only way to keep track of that.

       We've had some mods here before who have gotten out of control, but generally when it's happened the place went nuts for a few days and then the mod in question was gone and we've elected new ones. Overall, I think we've done pretty well here as far as mod teams go and many of our mods I am straight up a fan of.

       Not quite: I like the mods I've chosen, and trust them to moderate
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A whole lot of stuff gets deleted from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       : I haven't been here much in the last couple of years, but I know those deletions have lead to a lot of distrust on the part of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       While
       <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">
        /r/RedditCensorship
       </a>
       is small, I think we'll be able to get by without deleting much at all, so the allegiances of the mods should not matter much at all.

       If the sub grows bigger, these issues might become more important.
