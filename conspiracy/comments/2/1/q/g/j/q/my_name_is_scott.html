<p>I am, at my core, filled with hate and contempt. I feel like I see things that the average person should see, but doesn&#39;t. This world we live in is based around who is best. It consumes all of us. We all want to be better than everyone we know. A shining light in the bastion of complacence we call life. I know people who have overcome insurmountable odds to live a mediocre life filled with strife, and I know people who have let themselves fall prey to mediocrity. It&#39;s a fucked up thing, this life. It&#39;s a fucked up thing to be alive. Wanting everything, getting next to nothing. You could fall into a perfect thing only to have it ripped away from you because someone else says so. A livelihood cast away on a whim. Because someone decided that wasn&#39;t what they wanted. And humanities answer is simply “Life isn&#39;t fair”</p>

<p>But who are these people saying that life isn&#39;t fair? It&#39;s the people who have also been cast out. No one at the top has to ever say to themselves that life isn&#39;t fair. They have money and lawyers and a whole system built around them to make sure that life is more than fair to them. We have been programmed to use the language of the unencumbered to describe our own lives. We rally and fight against our own people. To speak the dialect that we have been taught by the rich. Those that would never feel our pain. Those that would never need, or want. They tell us how to feel. What to think. They turn us against ourselves and we allow it. Their diatribe makes us feel that we are all fighting the same war. </p>

<p>But they fight no war. They make the war and we fight it for them. Then they pat us on our heads and say “SUPPORT THE TROOPS” as they cut benefits for those that have fought their never ending, unexplained wars. </p>

<p>They show us how they live and let us dream about the things that they have and we never will. They buy and sell their way out of everything that might possibly harm them and they come on our TVs and tell us that we should never give up our fight. Anyone can make it. Yet they hold us down at every turn. Negating civil liberties promised to us, and we stand her in complacence. Posting things online that show how corrupt and vile they have become while doing nothing to remedy this situation. </p>

<p>Well I&#39;m sick and tired of being sick and tired. Sick and tired of the police that would jail us for arbitrary laws. Sick of wars waged in the name of capitalistic gains. Sick of what this great country no longer is. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling for violence. I&#39;m asking for people to take a stand for what is right. No more will we stand for arbitrary things. No nonsensical, never ending wars. No more should we idly stand by while this machine forces us into debt for higher learning. </p>

<p>We must break free from these shackles, and we should no longer be afraid to say these things. </p>

<p>My name is Scott, and I am no longer afraid. Who are you?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">10</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lastresort09.html">lastresort09</a> 2014-03-30</p>
    <div class="md"><p>If you want to take the next step, there is really only one. </p>

<p>I think you already have an idea what that is. First of all, in our lives we waiting around for people to choose us. If they don&#39;t choose you, then &quot;life isn&#39;t fair&quot;. The important message to understand is that we should take the step towards choosing ourselves, and not wait around for others to pick us. These rich people don&#39;t have to wait around hoping that they get chosen, and that&#39;s what makes them different. True freedom is being able to do whatever you want, and having the freedom to pursue that. </p>

<p>Sure, I can plan to do this for myself (and if you want to, I highly recommend the book Choose Yourself), but personally that&#39;s not enough for me. I don&#39;t want people to fight for the right to be themselves in every single generation. We are not tools for the rich to make more money, and our lives shouldn&#39;t be wasted only having the choice of what tool to be. </p>

<p>We need our freedom to be human and pursue our own creativity. Most of our lives are mediocre because society puts down anyone who tries to deviate from the path. </p>

<p>The issue is with how society is built. Currently it is built to keep us doing what we always have i.e. to keep us doing things to benefit the rich. We are slaves of a different kind, but still slaves.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how to work with one another, and we don&#39;t know how to help one another. We are as divided as we could get, and we are as selfish as we could get. Our society is build on competition. </p>

<p>The solution is simple, but it will take time and effort to convince people. We need to educate people about the importance of depending on one another, helping one another, sharing, accepting, and showing kindness to one another. If our priority is to do what is best for everyone, and be less selfish, then we are more less likely to sabotage one another, and more likely to help people when they are in need. Accepting and loving one another is also important, as that helps each one of us achieve what we want to be, rather than what we need to be. This will also teach us the importance of depending less on money, because our end goal isn&#39;t to be rich and own material goods, but rather to pursue our own dreams and help one another reach our potentials. We were evolved to live together as a global community, but now we are devolving to the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; attitude which is only going to leave this world in ruins and each other in misery. The problem with our society is just that - we have divided ourselves over things that don&#39;t matter in the end, and we have forgotten the importance of being there for each other. I have joined many others to start working towards this goal at <a href="/r/UnitedWeStand">/r/UnitedWeStand</a> and perhaps you can join us too. </p>

<p>Keeping up with politics will make you upset because all you see is how criminals are getting away with murder. In a way, it is meant to keep us hopeless and helpless, so that we can never be a threat to them. So if you can, try to take a break from it, and instead work towards solving the issue instead. There is no savior that will come to fix this country, and we ourselves have to step up because if we won&#39;t, then this will continue to happen to our children, and their greed will certainly destroy this planet soon enough. </p>
