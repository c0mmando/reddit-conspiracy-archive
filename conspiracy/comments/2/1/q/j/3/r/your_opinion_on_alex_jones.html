<p>I sympathize with him because I also get as angry as he does when I witness injustice, in my opinion, that makes him human, not a shill or whatever the haters call him.</p>

<p>As far as his products go, I see nothing wrong with selling movies, filters, generators, cameras &amp; supplements. All of which work. Guy&#39;s gotta fund his business somehow, why not sell things that are catered to his audience?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you should bear in mind is that whenever Jones say &quot;I&#39;m not against ....&quot; he is really saying he&#39;s against it. Example, he says &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing against gays.&quot; Translation, he hates gays. He says, &quot;I&#39;m not a name dropper.&quot; Then he immediately goes on to drop names. He says &quot;I&#39;m not bragging.&quot; Then he immediately starts to brag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s radio, you ramble on for hours and go back and fourth between subjects, if he name drops he checks himself, if he&#39;s going on about gays he checks himself. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you that he hates gay people, but I can personally tell you that I know that there is a gay agenda, and the more they try to push it down everybody&#39;s throat the more hate its going to breed, especially when they try to indoctrinate children and confuse their sexuality at an early age.</p>

<p>I <em>personally</em> (can&#39;t speak for Jones) hate those that are actively pushing any sort of sexuality on children. The current situation with homosexual child abusers in England and the Pedophile Information Exchange, has made me even more awake to the gay agenda and it&#39;s incessant goal of sexualising kids.</p>

<p>I have no time nor patience for political correctness, the truth is the truth.</p>

I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s wrong to hate gays, I&#39;m just pointing out that he hates gays, but says he doesn&#39;t. I believe he&#39;s right that children are being sexualized too early in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homosexuality and pedophilia are two completely different things.  A grown man that has sex with or molests a young boy is not a homosexual.  He is a pedophile.  The idea that homosexuals are likely to molest a young boy is like saying that heterosexuals are likely to molest young girls.  Pedophiles molest young kids.  Heterosexuals have sex with consenting adults of the opposite sex.  Homosexuals have sex with consenting adults of the same sex.  There is no overlap of these ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree. A man having sex with a boy makes him a homosexual pedophile, to ignore this is to be in denial and completely ignores basic facts.</p>

<p>I have to point out that I have nothing against homosexuals, but I know that there is a subculture inside the community that strives for the legalization of child sex, shocking words, but true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So by that logic a heterosexual man is equally attracted to a 2 year old girl as he is attracted to a 20 year old woman and the only thing keeping him from having sex with the child is the law?  I don&#39;t know about you, but I can&#39;t get an erection for a 2 year old girl even though I&#39;m attracted to females.  Pedophiles are the only ones who are attracted to kids.  Normal functioning adults <em>physiologically are incapable</em> of having sex with children.  If a 30 year old man has sex with a 2 year old girl he isn&#39;t a normal heterosexual man who also is a pedophile.  He is a pedophile.  It actually bothers me that some people think this is even debatable because that makes me think that they would/could have sex with children if not for the law preventing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t find little girls attractive, that&#39;s just another diversionary attack to take attention away from facts.</p>

<p>Pedophiles are attracted to children and could very well be attracted to adults, it is their choice of gender that makes them gay or &quot;straight&quot;. A pedophile that is attracted to little girls isn&#39;t a gay pedophile just a pedophile. </p>

<p>A male pedophile that likes boys is a homosexual pedophile (and likely attracted to other men), very simple.</p>

<p>And since we&#39;re openly talking about homosexuals and the homosexual agenda, can you explain to me why it is so important to espouse whom you are attracted to during every goddamned public gathering?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what about a guy like Jerry Sandusky who was a man married to a woman but was having sex with little boys?  He was a heterosexual man that was also a homosexual pedophile?  Ooooor was he just a pedophile who was living a lie as a heterosexual man?  Pedophilia is his sexuality.  This is why psychologists don&#39;t classify pedophiles as gay or straight pedophiles.  That doesn&#39;t exist.  The fact that a person is attracted to a prepubescent child is a sexual defect and they are no longer hetero or homosexual.  They are strictly pedophiles.  </p>

<p>As far as why homosexuals are constantly speaking about their homosexuality in public now more than ever, it is because they are currently trying to garner support for equal marriage rights across the country.  You don&#39;t see many million man marches with black people now because they are legally able to vote and marry members of other races across the country.  Now it is gay people trying to do that same thing.  As long as they are only talking about it and not engaging in any sexual acts in public it is nothing to worry about.  You are either born gay or straight.  Kids seeing that gay people exist isn&#39;t going to make them somehow turn gay.  It isn&#39;t contagious.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I truly doubt this is true. The &quot;subculture&quot; might exist but it&#39;s not within or supported by the Gay community. There are pedophiles who prey on little girls and I&#39;m sure they want it legalized but most heterosexual people are appalled by them. Don&#39;t try to lump in pedophelia with homosexuality then say &quot;I have nothing against homosexuals&quot;. If you weren&#39;t trying to push your biases forward you wouldn&#39;t have tried to correlate two entirely different subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate how he continually criticizes the so called dinosaur media, when all he and his team do is scour that same media for stories.  He makes more money than many newspapers but never sends reporters to hot zones to report &quot;the truth&quot;.  Say what you like about Fox, BBC, CNN, MSNBC but all of them have reporters on the ground in almost every hot zone on earth and over the years quite a lot have been killed doing their job.  I think the &#39;alternative&#39; media is doing a bang up job, viewership of all msm channels is falling and Alex is laughing all the way to the bank.  Public sympathy for the msm is at an all time low and now gvt is attempting to curtail the freedom of the press.</p>

<p>If the msm disappears how the hell will we hear of any news?  Alex jones isn&#39;t about to actually use his millions to pay real reporters is he?  So we&#39;ll rely on places like reddit where it could be paid shills giving their false versions of current events.  Matt Drudge is just as bad, pages of links to real reports, who did those reports?  Journalists who work for the dinosaur media, that&#39;s who!  As AJ proudly boasts he has a greater quantity of listeners than CNN and MSNBC combined yet he doesn&#39;t have a single real journalist on his payroll. </p>

<p>The BBC flat out said he&#39;s CIA.  A real journalist said as much.  I think his role is to undermine the msm, reduce public confidence in them so that eventually we have no news.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge issue because we rely on mainstream sources for so much information.  Even the current weather is supplied by mainstream sources, without them we are seriously fucked.  Yes they do misreport and push the left wing agenda, but at least they report it and we can pick at it to reveal something approaching what might be true.</p>

I agree he is a little too much sometimes. Make up your own mind, but he provides facts and opinions for a lively debate. </p>
