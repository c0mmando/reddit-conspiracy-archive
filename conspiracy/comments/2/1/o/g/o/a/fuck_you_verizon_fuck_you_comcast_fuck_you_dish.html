<p>Information and communication, electricity and gas are ALL basic human needs and we should not have to constantly fight greedy bastards who want to build mansions on other people&#39;s poverty and broken lives.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember when regulation meant something, when politicians acted to protect the common man from monopoly and usurious market manipulation, and when integrity - both personal and corporate, ruled the day.</p>

<p>Do you think we can ever wrestle control of the modern world back from the 1% and their evil, soulless corporate minions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Hughes Aircraft takes money from US Government to design and launch the satellites that eventually became DirecTV and we all want to act like it was private enterprise that made that shit happen. </p>

<p>So Verizon was originally Ma Bell that held the largest communications monopoly on earth before it was splintered into a thousand pieces only to be reassembled into the behemoth we now call Satan Wireless, err, Verizon Wireless. Again, all infrastructure build-out and air waves (frequencies) licensing have been provided by good ol American Tax dollars,but they want to act as if it was private enterprise that made that shit happen.  </p>

<p>Comcast, Dish Network both have their reliance on government subsidized and favored tax status to credit for their overwhelming growth these past 20 years. Dish is a technology pirate. Comcast is a monster that decided to use government subsidized broadband build-out with the broken promise of better reach and coverage to acquire leverage into content ownership. Now they want your house under their control and then they will own those utilities you so cherish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it hilarious when people call for &quot;regulation&quot; and are surprised when those &quot;regulations&quot; end up benefitting the privileged few. It&#39;s as if you people actually believe governments aren&#39;t taking bribes and then writing legislation in favor o the large corporations. </p>

<p>If you want the income gap to shrink the. You all better start advocating for the end of the state. </p>

<p>I mean, every single state that ever was and ever will be is going to reward those individuals who know how to use the state to their advantage. Yet you people clamor for more leaders or &quot;good people in government&quot;; something that will never ever happen ever. </p>

<p>But you&#39;ll continue the cycle and co e up with that dumbfounded look on your faces like: &quot;why does this keep happening?  Better go vote again, that&#39;ll solve the problem&quot;</p>

<p>I truly feel bad for you people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem with this country and I will be the first to admit I am guilty of it myself. When we complain about something nothing happens you know why?. It is because they (ie. Corporations, government, banking system) don&#39;t care so calling your representative will do nothing NOTHING because you to them are asking for somethine. The only fucking thing in the fucked up world that ever worked and the is get fucking mad do you out there in internet land. Not clicking the keyboard ranting about the problem DO SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. When Bank of America tried to raise fees on there debt car to five dollars you got pissed off enough to do something that mattered when in mass you cancelled your accounts with them and they backed down. When the government tried to go into Syria we all collectively screamed no and we will recall you if you do. AND THEY BACK DOWN BECAUSE YOU GOT MAD AS HELL that is the only time we were able to derail the international bankers plan. This is something to remember it&#39;s this actions without consequence will always be abused.</p>

Point the <a href="http://youtu.be/lD369FCSYdU">finger at the state.</a> Additionally, corporations are legal fictions created by the state, essentially to protect business owners from liability when they break the law.

    <div class="md"><p>You lost me with the whole &quot;public utilities dressed up as corporations&quot; thing.  </p>

<p>Yes, I agree these things are a basic human right.  But I am pretty sure there is nothing misleading or ambiguous about their corporate status.  All corporations basically exist for one reason.  To extract profit from a market.  I don&#39;t think they are hiding anything there. </p>

<p>If by &quot;public&quot; you mean state or community owned, well, this my friend they are not...  unless of course you own stock.</p>

<p>They are just corporations doing what corporations do.</p>

<p>I encourage any effort you wish to make to change the situation.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to sound repetitive, by I can’t stress this enough. Contrary to what you hear, we’re already in an economic collapse, except that most people haven’t a clue.
