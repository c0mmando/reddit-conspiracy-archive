    <div class="md"><p>We are taught to be selfish. There is no way we will all stand up for the entire people when we don&#39;t even share the same goals. The reason OWS failed is because there was no purpose i.e. they didn&#39;t know what they wished to achieve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep certainly. Empathy, sharing, kindness, love, being there for people to lean on in times of need, accepting our differences and bonding with each other. This is how we take back our power, and this is how we can create a better world. Every person and every bit of effort counts. Once we are able to understand each other and share the same vision of the future, then we will be much more capable of creating solutions, and be willing to stand up together against those who use power to do evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We understand this problem is not just in the US but something people lack every where around the world. Many other nations, even UK, have issues of the government overreaching into their lives, and the people being divided. Sometimes the divisions across nations are also used to promote wars and kill innocent people. </p>

<p>So with all this into account, the sub is actually for all human beings everywhere, and not just restricted to the US. We can all benefit from living in a society where selfishness and competition among individuals is not necessary, and we could help each other grow and do things that we actually want to be doing. </p>

<p>Through the sub, we wish to think up ideas and ways through which we can bring this mentality into our daily lives, and lead by example. Lending a hand to someone in need, or just merely listening to their troubles, to show we care. So you could join us in helping us discuss how promote this idea to our local communities, and even introduce the sense of belonging to one&#39;s own life. Motivation and support through submissions or self posts is always welcome. Every person counts. We can&#39;t wait for a savior or leader, and so we have to step up and do somethings ourselves, because no one else will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting idea...  It would have to last longer than two days to have any kind of effect.  As it stands, you are basically calling for a random two day vacation.  What would be better is if you called for everyone to dump all their credit cards (regardless of debt), become self-sufficient (growing food on their property or organizing community gardens, hunt, etc.), pull all of their money out of banks and close the account, set up community based schools (no federal or state funding), and finally no longer comply with any federal dictate or law and non-compliance/cooperation with ANY federal official.  If you could get enough people to do this, then you <em>might</em> see some results.  But calling for two random days off won&#39;t accomplish a thing.</p>

<p>Lastly, non-violence is a great philosophy and very admirable, but it is not very applicable outside of theory.  Non-violence will not stop a bullet nor deflect a punch/strike.  Nor will it dissuade (in the moment) a person from using violence against you.  Moreover it is a subtle form of silent consent because there is nothing and no one holding the violence wielders accountable for their actions.  If evil people are allowed to run amok, then other evil people will see it as an acceptable form of behavior.</p>

<p>This quote from Gandhi sums up my feelings on most people&#39;s idea of non-violence: &quot;It is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You quote Gandhi, but I believe you misunderstand him. Gandhi nearly starved himself to death because people following his lead against the British government decided to attack the &quot;enemy&quot; with force. In fact, the <strong><em>only</em></strong> reason he had such wild success was his non-violent approach. They had to assassinate the man to stop his movement, because he was going to unite India and Pakistan as one sovereign nation. 
His campaign was both righteous and just because of his peaceful approach. Had he encouraged people to fight back with weapons, the international community would have backed England and not Gandhi, because it would have been unclear who the true aggressor was. As such, it was obvious that the British crown, by ordering police to massacre peaceful protesters, was way out of line and significant pressure was placed on the British to resolve the issue without further bloodshed. How do you think a violent revolution would have played out in India???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the brief history lesson, though I was well aware of this history already.  I don&#39;t think you understand how I interpret that quote.  I (and this is my personal view) see Gandhi as saying that there is a time and a place for violence as well as non-violence.  It does not have to be one extreme or the other.  And if we do have violence in our hearts it is better to act on it than it is to lie to ourselves while attempting to be righteous.</p>

<p>I get the feeling from your response that you think I&#39;m attacking Gandhi or trying to marginalize the tactic he took.  I assure you I&#39;m not, nor is this my intent.  </p>

<p>I think the philosophy of non-violence is admirable in theory but not always practical in practice.  For example: you come across a hungry predator who decides it can make a meal of you.  Can you convince it of your peaceful intentions and dissuade it from eating you?  Does a non-violent approach protect you from being a meal?  No.  </p>

<p>But given the scale human conflict can now reach, a purely violent approach as an initial tactic is now no longer viable.  So a non-violent approach should become the standard for the safety of us all.  But we shouldn&#39;t throw violence completely away because there will always be people that will see non-violence not as a peaceful solution but as a tacit endorsement of their actions.  &quot;no one seems willing and/or able to stop me, so I&#39;ll keep doing it!&quot;  Such thinking must be met with an <strong>active</strong> (or even pro-active) response not a passive one.</p>

<p>Now as to your question at the end of your response; I have no idea how violent revolution would have played out in India and I see no reason why I should speculate on it here.  I don&#39;t think it was the OP&#39;s intent to discuss the hypotheticals of historic geo-politics (I&#39;m sure there is a sub-reddit for it).  Would you like to weigh in on the OP&#39;s idea of two days of non-compliance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of the OP, I&#39;ll address your final paragraph first. I gladly support any non-compliance with the system as it stands. Organization is key, though. Otherwise it can easily be co-opted into something other than its intention, as in the instance of the Occupy movement. Two days of non-compliance is good. I wish to move towards a lifetime of it, but two days is a good place to begin and I like the idea getting exposure. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree, deceiving oneself and the world with a fake sense of righteousness does no good. Gandhi, however, sought to replace the violence in men&#39;s hearts with mercy. 
I apologize if it felt that way - just the other day another person I was speaking too <em>was</em> deriding Gandhi and non-violence, and I must have carried those preconceptions of your position to this discussion. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What good is non-violence as just a theory? I understand you opt for a more moderate position somewhere in between the two extremes, but I believe in the case of causing others harm, there can be no compensation. However, I don&#39;t condemn those who do choose to fight because I, like all others, have been there. I just don&#39;t think it works. Choosing peace has kept the police away from my home lately, and this makes me thankful. 
As for your example of the hungry predator, again, I can&#39;t condemn the one who chooses to defend their life in single combat. Especially in a situation where both parties are willingly entering into the fight. But I would applaud he who avoided being cornered by the predator in the first place; I would applaud she who overcame the predator without mortally wounding it; and most of all, I would applaud he who willingly gave his life to the hungry predator, becoming nourishment for another living being rather than becoming harm to it. The final choice is the most difficult for anybody to make, and what I believe enlightenment must mean. </p>

<p>I agree that our power to destroy is too great for us to carry on as we have. Maybe we should have a serious, global discussion about the place of violence in the world today. Maybe we can find a place for it. I would like it if we could find a better way to get rid of that negativity though. 
You&#39;re right, people often misinterpret non-violence as silent compliance. But I don&#39;t think non-violence needs to be silent - or even quiet. I would argue that it is not passive, but far more active to resist the urge to retaliate against an aggressor. 
You can hinder the war machine&#39;s growth and weaken it&#39;s hold on the world without killing the driver. The driver deserves forgiveness as much as anybody, because nobody is personally responsible for the mess we find ourselves in. Everybody for the past few thousand years seems to have a hand in it. The only question of responsibility is: who will stop it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I would like to thank you for your thoughtful and polite response.  I appreciate getting to know another person&#39;s perspective as it gives me an opportunity to learn.  Again, Thank you.</p>

<p>I would like to focus first on the last paragraph of your response.  Violence can be integrated into a compassionate mind frame, the best example of this is Shao-Lin.  Buddhist martial artists.  They have a saying:&quot;Avoid rather than hurt, hurt rather than maim, maim rather than kill.  A life is easy to take but impossible to replace.&quot;  It is a progression one follows when confronted by something that means you harm.  Now this doesn&#39;t mean this system of martial arts doesn&#39;t know how to hurt, maim, or kill (they do know and have refined it).  They realized long ago that situations will arise where one can&#39;t avoid violence, where hurting a threat won&#39;t stop it, when maiming won&#39;t end the situation.  This is why they practice and know killing techniques, crippling techniques, <strong>and</strong> how to get out of the way.  </p>

<p>This martial art is one of the best examples of integrating violence into a compassionate mind frame (though it is not the only one).  But this is also only effective if one embraces violence.  One must be comfortable and skilled enough to apply this.  Should an individual ignore this, they effectively reduce the number of options available to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What good is non-violence as just a theory?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it makes us think, interact (look at our current conversation), and promotes empathy.  Many theories can be useful without being practical.  The danger comes when we accept such theories as not only applicable,but as the only and best option for <em>every</em> situation.  Life is fluid not static and a rigid uncompromising approach can be detrimental not only to the individual but to society as a whole as well.  So a theory is indeed useful as long as we don&#39;t hold onto it like its gospel truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I would applaud he who avoided being cornered by the predator in the first place; I would applaud she who overcame the predator without mortally wounding it; and most of all, I would applaud he who willingly gave his life to the hungry predator, becoming nourishment for another living being rather than becoming harm to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can respect that.  Though I would applaud the individual who not only survived the encounter, but also made a meal out of the threat instead of backing down or sacrificing themselves.  I&#39;m not big on giving up.  One cannot affect positive change when they&#39;re dead.  I also would feel contempt for the individual who would kill their out of such an encounter only to leave a carcass behind.  Such a waste!  Killing without intent or simply for the sake of killing is wasteful and stupid.</p>

<p>The last thing I would like to bring up is restraint.  There seems to be an incredible lack of it these days.  It would be very beneficial to humanity to cultivate more of it and apply it to much of our everyday life.  I would like to believe this and compassion would temper the human &quot;condition&quot; enough that we could become not quite as psychotic apes as we have been up till now.</p>

<p>Thank you again for taking the time to read this and for your previous thoughtful response.  It is refreshing to converse without the conversation turning nasty.  Thank you!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not big on giving up either, but giving up one&#39;s life is not always admitting defeat. If all one is fighting for is one&#39;s life, then I say to the victor go the spoils and may the best predator win. 
My personal view is that enough people are fighting for their life. I have been fortunate enough to not spend all my time fighting for my life. I&#39;ve learned in that time, and I&#39;ve learned that the world needs people to fight for Life itself. Killing another creature is detrimental to the warrior fighting not for his life, but for Life.</p>

<p>One cannot affect positive change when they&#39;re dead.</p>

<p>Does one&#39;s soul depart the Earth when they die? There have been so many martyrs in the past century and beyond who still exert an influence on the present. The Buddhist monk who burnt himself alive to protest the Vietnam war thought that he could effect change in death. Maybe he did. I wasn&#39;t alive at the time, but maybe his act had an effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last thing I would like to bring up is restraint. There seems to be an incredible lack of it these days. It would be very beneficial to humanity to cultivate more of it and apply it to much of our everyday life. I would like to believe this and compassion would temper the human &quot;condition&quot; enough that we could become not quite as psychotic apes as we have been up till now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bahaha, psychotic apes. That about sums us up. 
Compassion is key to restraint. Accepting realities that you can&#39;t feel, but that you know others can feel, is key to surrendering to peace. </p>

<p>Indeed, but has that influence been positive?  I like to compare Jesus and Siddhartha.  Both became acknowledged holy men around the same age in their life.  Jesus preached and taught for a few years and was promptly nailed to a piece of wood.  After attaining Buddha-hood, Siddhartha spent another <strong>thirty</strong> years clarifying his teachings and philosophy.  Now look at how Jesus&#39;s teachings have been skewed, manipulated, and co-opted since his death and compare that to Buddhist teachings.  Not many pogroms and holy wars carried out in the Buddha&#39;s name nor is there much ambiguity surrounding Siddhartha&#39;s teachings.  Christianity on the other hand (and the myriad of institutions around it) have been pulling shenanigans in the name of Jesus for how many centuries?  I doubt Jesus would have approved.</p>

<p>My point is that any organization or institution can call on the memory of a martyr to justify whatever action they feel they must justify.  This is the problem with martyrs.  As such I see being a living example as being a far greater force for <em>positive</em> change than any martyr.  How much more positive change could MLK have accomplished were he still alive today?  Would Gandhi be a force for geo-political peace were he still alive?  I would like to think so.</p>

<p>I would like to take this moment to say that I am thoroughly enjoying this discussion!</p>

<p>May You Never Know Thirst!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, you really got me thinkin&#39;! <sup>_^</sup></p>

<p>You make a wonderful point about how a martyr can be used for nefarious purposes. It&#39;s no good to die misunderstood. The tree that doesn&#39;t bear fruit and spread its seed dies and leaves no mark on the world. Jesus would have been better served fully enlightening one person at a time than hundreds or thousands within just a few years. 
However, one must consider the different geopolitical circumstances both Jesus and Buddha were born into. The religious and political landscape Jesus lived in was more oppressive, it seems, than ancient India&#39;s. Maybe I&#39;m wrong about that and we simply don&#39;t know everything about Jesus&#39;s history and what got him killed. But India&#39;s prior experience with the native Hindu traditions must have primed it, and indeed Buddha himself, for an Enlightened One.  </p>

<p>Life can certainly achieve infinitely more than death. Death is final, while life always continues to grow, and in all directions. Who knows what Gandhi and MLK could have achieved. Both had such great ambitions. Too ambitious for our times, I guess. :/ </p>

<p>This is why we need to first work towards changing the mentality and teaching people the importance of standing up for everyone, regardless of whether you can gain from it.

    <div class="md"><h3>This idea as a whole will not work.</h3>

<p>I like parts of the idea, but not all of it.
Let me explain why, with an example.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p>UPS and Feddex</p>

<p>UPS participates and strikes for 2 days.
Feddex does not.</p>

<p>Anyone who needs anything shipped on Oct 1 and Oct 2, who does not wish to participate in this event, and who is a customer of UPS, will permanently switch to Feddex. </p>

<p><strong>Never let an opportunity go to waste.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Competitor not working? Critique the shit out of them, and let the world know how un-reliable they are.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, there are many businesses in the USA not run the the US Govt.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_classic_prisoners.27_dilemma">Prisoner dilemma</a>  will make all these business not co-operate. <em>(See Wikipedia link provided.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Ideas are good. Keep them coming.</strong> I just happen to disagree with this one, but I am just some guy on the internet. I could be wrong...</p>

<h3>I do like the following:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>On the strike days walk your children to park, play with them in your back/front yard, talk to them about the days, talk to your neighbors, connect with one another, &amp; realize you can live without all the things that you learned can not live without them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should be done weekly, not just once a year in October.</p>

In all these cases lives could be lost simply because these people took 2 days off work.</p>
