       I'm not the one to scream conspiracy/NSA every time I see something shady. Given this, Reddit accessing webcams , even with permission from users, is unnerving to be honest. Unnecessarily putting users (especially young ones with impressionable minds and in the whole April fools mood) in this situation is not "just a joke" IMO. There are many more ways to be funny other than users sending their photos linked to their accounts to dubious servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they have a privacy policy on how they'll use these pictures? Or is it clubbed into "we hold the rights to your content" policy of regular redditing?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, apparently they give Reddit gold if you balance something on your head for 60 seconds. I wouldn't send them my photo even if they give me $1000. Shady as fuck.

       It is so interesting and I really don't understand it.  Why waste so much time disagreeing with people?  I find it fascinating to think there is a whole group of people with the sole intent of trolling other people about something they find interesting.  I guess they are interested in what we deem interesting?  Weird.

       I heard this somewhere:
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be like if a group of people didn't like The Walking Dead. So they'd create
       <a href="/r/thewalkingdeadsucks">
        /r/thewalkingdeadsucks
       </a>
       . They discuss how they don't like the show. But that's not good enough. They go into
       <a href="/r/thewalkingdead">
        /r/thewalkingdead
       </a>
       and spread their hate for the show there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now which is worse? The people who like the show (EVEN IF THE SHOW SUCKED) or the people who hate the show so much they cross borders to spread their hate.

       I understand what you mean, but sometimes paranoia turns out to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard about people discussing the possibility of webcams being hacked. At that time people said that it was just paranoia because the light with the webcam is hardwired, and therefore, you would know if someone is recording you. But turns out, they were able to work around that and still record you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was paranoia when I first heard about shills, and then the leak came out saying how it is very much real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was paranoia when people told me that government tracks all our calls and keeps info on all of us, and tuns out that was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was paranoia when people we would live in a orwellian world with big brother constantly watching us, but here we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       People told me I was being paranoid when I was skeptical of Obama using his charisma to become President, because everyone said "well a President can't really do much damage at all because there is a balance of power, so you are worrying too much", and look what has happened so far.

       If you choose to run any and all Javascript on your machine without vetting it first, it is as stupid as running other random software before asking where it came from. I said nothing about the language itself.

       Yeah I caught that a short while back. First of all running scripts on your browser is a bad idea in and of itself, even if it is reddit, especially if it requests webcam access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, this is not an April fools prank, i.e nobody's fooling anybody. This is a feature beta test on 1st April. Nothing to do with April fools thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the third,
       <em>
        nothing is sent back to reddit servers
       </em>
       is a demonstrably false statement. The "balance on head for Reddit gold" thing reports back to reddit servers to vet the process and give reddit gold. Hence, the claims that "nothing is sent from your browser" is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there's no way to tell if the script shown in github is used in reddit servers without malicious changes. I guess trust in reddit as a company that they would never attempt to be malicious for profit is a major factor here. I don't trust reddit.

       It's been shown that even when the LED is "hardwired" via some sort of hardware interlock, it is still often controlled via the chip, not directly wired in the camera "on" circuit, and good hackers can activate the camera without the light by modifying the firmware of the camera's chip.

       It's pretty smart. The goal is always to connect to Facebook or add a picture or any way to prove you were actually the one tied to that account. That way when you start protesting and the government wants something to use against you they can search your accounts for something incriminating and have proof that you owned that account at least at one point.
      </p>

       But Reddit would never be open to something so invasive.  UNLESS you can disguise it as a joke and spam it with positive responses before people realize they're being violated.

       I know you come from conspiratard or something but you do know that leaked documents have already shown that the government does indiscriminately take screen caps of users using webcam chat services at regular intervals right? So yes, someone there is interested in taking picture of "neckbeards" and storing them in case there's any possible ways of using them in the future.

       The five I's spy on the citizens of each other and then share them each other to get around the legality issues. So UK spies on something our agencies are not allowed to spy on, and the give the info to us. This has also been revealed in the leaks but I believe the documentation on this goes back at least a decade.

      <blockquote>

        Great idea, because the goverment wants to see the face of a paranoid neckbeard in his moms basement.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       implying that the government has no interest in recording us through our webcam without our knowledge. But the leaks directly contradict and proves that yes, they do want to see the faces of those paranoid neckbeards. In fact, if those neckbeards used the programs the government was able to infiltrate, the government ALREADY saw the faces of all those neckbeards.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to now argue that the pictures they gathered was useless, then you should have argued this from the beginning, instead of implying the government has no interest in using your webcam to spy on you. And remember, this is what has been leaked so far. The five I's have repeatedly shown that they want to get their hands on any information they can. If they have the option to turn on your webcam at this exact moment and record everything in the highest resolution possible, they would. There's NO reason to believe they wouldn't. If it's not legal for your own intelligence agency to spy on you, Britain's or Australia's will spy on you and then give the data to your country's spy agencies to get around the legality issue.

       I don't know what you're trying to do here but if you are trying to discredit conspiracy theorists, discredit them on something that's not already a proven and documented conspiracy.

       Well, anybody can hack a webcam.  It's good practice to cover any camera connected to the Internet if you aren't using it.  Not because of government, but because of random people.

       Hell, you can google search and find insecure webcam streams...

       Unless you were using a proxy consistently with your old account deleting your account does nothing once your identity has been linked to your IP. And yes, Reddit Inc (Newhouse Jr's playground) collects everything you do including your IP. This information is extremely valuable and probably used for nefarious purposes.

       You got me, it worked. Epic maymay prints on the wall, decent bone structure on white skin. It's like you represent the reddit demographic. And you came all the way from your default subs with your cutie pie account to prove that even beta guys in moms house turn on their leddit webcams for april fools shenanigans. A little old for pretentious self shots aren't you? Are you that deluded that your whole face is exposed in the shot voiding your argument or is that the punchline?

       I'm not sure but neither are you, that's the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not possible to effectively and appropriately moderate that many subs.  Sure you might be responsive to reports or complaints, and even visit a good portion of the subs you moderate but you cannot honestly say you are on top of all of the context for each sub.

       Use ManyCam or similar virtual cam app to force and image or video clip to be shown as your webcam stream (keep your webcam covered of course :), AFAIK it works even if you don't have an actual cam connected to your computer. Then you can experiment with what the whole joke is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an ideal world, this would be an actually funny joke, using your face to navigate the site and discovering the easter eggs (the gold, the cat cam, etc) but given the current state of affairs regarding identity access by third parties, having the face of users from a site that supposedly had as one of its perks being able to use it anonymously is quite worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, reddit itself may have not any further intent that using the video of users for a funny compilation. But given the accepted notion today that all kind of shady third parties can be snooping on just about anyone's communication channels, adding your face to your reddit account is too much of an easy gift to give away.

       I know you guys aren't the most technically-minded people on the planet, but did you ever think to just ... watch your network traffic while headdit is running? None of the image data is being piped over the internet, the face detection and image rendering is happening entirely in the browser.

       Since you're so keen to advertise yourself as someone who understands technology and who could presumably very easily provide some proof that images from your webcam are being sent to reddit's servers, why don't you do so?

       Of course, if using a network inspector or just using Chrome's built-in inspector is beyond you, well, best of luck in your career.

       More like standing at the bottom of a canyon and not worrying about the river that made it. It's there, the canyon has already been formed, all the top soil is at the bottom of a sea or lake downriver. Maybe go fishing instead of cursing a lost life I've never known anyway.

       You can't put the genie back in the bottle. My point is that 'privacy' is a false worry, there are far more important things to concentrate on. Whether its corporations, the government or your neighbor, somebody is gonna have their nose in you business.
