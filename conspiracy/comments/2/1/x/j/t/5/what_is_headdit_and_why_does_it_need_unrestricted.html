       I had already read the article about it, already assumed it was "reddit's April Fool's Day prank", and had looked beyond that to the implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is reddit, now... at this time... in the aftermath of HUGE Snowden leaks... why are they encouraging people to unlock their webcams for
       <em>
        reddit
       </em>
       ?

       no way its a coincidence that its April 1st... no one launches a new fearture on April Fools. As such, this is reddit pulling a prank.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree, it's a lame one. With Schwatz death and the fact the gov has  infiltrated pretty much every social network out there (facebook, twitter, etc.) ... asking users for access to their web cam is a really stupid thing to do.

       Uh...that wouldn't work. It would most likely be seen as a rootkit and be removed by most anti-virus software. And if you don't believe me look inside of your registry keys and see if there is something new.

       The thing is, if reddit uses the images in a way that we did not agree to, then it will be bad. But if it's only for the features and they aren't storing anything to use it, then it's kinda harmless.

       If reddit is so corrupted, why do you still use it? It's not like you are being forced to, if you had no choice in the matter I'd expect your 'contempt', but you do have the choice of not using it.  They also are not 'demanding' you use your webcam, you  have the choice there too. Jinkys dude, calm down before you get an aneurysm and a webcam request becomes the least of your worries!

       Reddit is based on privacy, the idea that we can say whatever here behind our username. Obviously if someone was interested enough they could get all our information anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, as a prank, let's have a majority of reddit users let us take their pictures. Just for fun and games though! None of this information will be stored. &lt;chuckle chuckle&gt;

       It does more than that. It encourages people to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         trust reddit

         unlock their webcams

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If it's a "prank", it's an irresponsible one. Even if it goes away tomorrow, it has already breached an ethical boundary in encouraging people to be irresponsible with their technology.

       Oh, right... It's okay... The NSA can already turn on your webcam anytime they want. May as well give reddit absolute control over it. Nothing wrong with that.

       I would also be against Reddit turning on webcams without my permission, though that isn't what is happening here. The site requests webcam access from your browser, and then you have to grant it. An explination of it was on the frontpage, and it's not at all necessary for using the website. As someone who usually keeps a cap on their webcam to avoid getting spied on, I do value my privacy. That said, I think this is a harmless prank just like in previous years.

       I'm not the one to scream conspiracy/NSA every time I see something shady. Given this, Reddit accessing webcams , even with permission from users, is unnerving to be honest. Unnecessarily putting users (especially young ones with impressionable minds and in the whole April fools mood) in this situation is not "just a joke" IMO. There are many more ways to be funny other than users sending their photos linked to their accounts to dubious servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Do they have a privacy policy on how they'll use these pictures? Or is it clubbed into "we hold the rights to your content" policy of regular redditing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: Apparently they give Reddit gold if you balance something on your head for 60 seconds. I wouldn't send them my photo even if they give me $1000. Shady as fuck.

       If reddit is so corrupted, why do you still use it? It's not like you are being forced to, if you had no choice in the matter I'd expect your 'contempt', but you do have the choice of not using it.  They also are not 'demanding' you use your webcam, you  have the choice there too. Jinkys dude, calm down before you get an aneurysm and a webcam request becomes the least of your worries!

       I read through the whole post. A bunch of half-wits that can't form a cogent response to, what is quite obviously, a conspiracy. It's as if they are allergic to the word.
