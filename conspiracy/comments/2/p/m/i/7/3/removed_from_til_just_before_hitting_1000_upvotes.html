    <div class="md"><p>Considering how deadly the treatment of psychiatric patients was prior to the advent of antidepressants, I would say the conspiracy is more that a drug whose actual antidepressant efficacy doesn&#39;t surpass placebo yet has a range of undesirable effects yet still gets the seal of approval and is sold by the megaton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study I&#39;m thinking of was this one in JAMA:</p>

<p><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157">&quot;The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms.&quot;</a></p>

<p>So, I should clarify that it was found to be effective for major depression, but not so much for the milder variants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this is pharmaceutical companies do their own trials with no oversight. They can &quot;Find&quot; anything they want. They then turn their &quot;Results&quot; into FDA, where pharmaceutical companies have people on the &quot;Advisory boards&quot; that judges the trials that had no oversight and approve without pause.</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely on the honor system...other than the 1 million dollar application fee of course.</p>

<p>It does not matter if the test/trials are accurate, the game is rigged in the publicly traded pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Western science is compartmentalized to the peoples destruction. As an example, about a year ago, there was an extensive study that showed sugars/fructose and HFCS was the cause of Gout, just about two months ago another study states that gout causes diabetes.</p>

<p>If it was not so compartmentalized, they would likely come to the conclusion that gout is a precursor to diabetes in some people. Nobody wants to point the finger at sugar, the root cause of both.</p>

<p>Once you have seen it from the inside as a business, you quickly understand what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read this <a href="http://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/07/anr-again-placing-politics-ahead-of.html">http://tobaccoanalysis.blogspot.com/2005/07/anr-again-placing-politics-ahead-of.html</a></p>

<p>Our medical community is smoked at the hands of special interest (NGO&#39;s) funded by pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a business owner that deals with FDA continously, and all parties involved are corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they have control. They fund all politicians at federal and state level, on both sides, both dems and repubs.</p>

<p>They fund the NGO&#39;s and foundations like the AHA, AMA and hundreds of others that lobby laws and policy change in their favor, in concert with their lobbyist, giving a public perception of a consensus, when they are all nothing but revolving doors.</p>

<p>They control what science is peer reviewed, and anyone who stands against them are blackballed instantly, some to never work in their field again.</p>

<p>They ignore test, studies and trials if it contradicts moves against their profits.</p>

<p>The electronic cigarette is such as product as an example. The first studies and test suggested that 40% quit smoking with them, later ones around 20%, but even at 20%, that is 15% higher than any current FDA approved cessation product. I own an e cig company and have a close friend that owns one too, who has patents. This is not speculation.</p>

<p>They falsified results (FDA) and mislead the public with their test in 2009. The AMA, AHA, ALA and hundreds of quit smoking groups that are funded by them are actively lobbying and presenting pre-written bills at state &amp; local levels to ban them when all independent science states that they could possibly eliminate tobacco cigarettes over the next 20 years.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical companies stand to lose big if e cigs stay on the market. The cessation market is a 2.3 billion per year gig for them. CDC states that smoking cost right at 200 billion a year, half taking care of them and the other half in lost production. So now we are roughly at about 60 billion annually they stand to lose. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even want to get started in cosmetics (Yes, I own and market some of that too).</p>

<p>I am planning on shutting both down over the next 18 months because they are going to monopolize the industry and hand it over to big tobacco. The e liquid is where they will control it. They will place the manufacturing of that in the hands of less than 6 large corporations and eating up any potential profits to the smaller guys.</p>

<p>We live in a fascist dictatorship...sad, but true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Below is what happens when you don&#39;t know what an acronym means and assume it isn&#39;t that important to the meaning of a post. I feel like an ass now. </p>

<p>IME?</p>

<p>In any event, mood stabilizes and anti depressants often don&#39;t play nice together, and optimal is a pretty absurd thing to say when reactions and responsiveness to these meds vary so widely between people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m diagnosed bipolar, was prescribed different meds for 5 years before I saw any improvement, and that improvement didn&#39;t even stem from the meds at all. Took another year of tapering my seroquel dosage from 400mg to nothing with my psych&#39;s guidance before I started really feeling better in any capacity. At this point, i&#39;ve been free of meds for two years and functioning much better than when I was. Dealing with my shit myself after researching ways to manage my symptoms is much easier for me personally than seeking out therapy on a regular schedule while trying to balance the awful side effects of meds that aren&#39;t doing shit for you with the potential payoff of not wanting to kill yourself after years of failed experimenting. Lessons learned: most of these have pretty awful side effects, not least of which include seroquel and lithium. Hell, I stopped taking one of my meds after a week when it resulted in an exaggerated orthostatic hypotension reflex (head rush) knocking me the fuck unconscious without warning. That one was on your anti depressants + mood stabilizers combo fyi.</p>

<p>Claiming some kind of optimal crap indicates to me that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, and that hit a nerve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize if I came off that way, IME was meant as in my experience, because in my experience with bipolar disorder (diagnosed type 2 in July) after a while the meds seemed to be working and I was stable, even for a month or two after I quit because I thought I didn&#39;t need them, and now I&#39;m back where I was six months ago, essentially. </p>

<p>For the record, I took 750mg of trileptal, something like 5-10 of risperdal and was up to 50mg of sertraline (I know that&#39;s not a lot, and that probably has to do with why it working sort of fell apart after a while but I had to stop there, and before my next increase I quit). Although I will admit, non-prescription <em>things</em> have helped more, in less time and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to use for the last 3 months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a conspiracy. A conspiracy to cover up and continue making money. Just like the auto companies. There have been cases where poorly designed cars would spew fuel when side hit or rear ended and the companies decided that a few lawsuits were less expensive than a recall and redesign. So they just rolled the dice with human lives and paid out the cheaper lawsuits. I think big pharma is playing the same game and the government allows it. </p>

<p>If you look at the medical history of many of the school shooters and mass killers quite often you will find they have been involved with mental health care professionals and prescribed drugs of some sort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it unlikely that the average doctor would deliberately give someone drugs in hopes that the person would go out and kill. But the fact remains that psych drugs can and do sometimes cause violent reactions and most doctors know that. So they roll the dice. </p>

<p>Just in the same way that car manufacturers knew that their defects were killing someone. Of course they didn&#39;t design them with that intention but after the facts were known they decided that it was cheaper to pay out the lawsuits than have a massive recall. Their own internal memos made that clear. </p>

<p>I have noticed that many of the mass shooters had been to see doctors that were associated with the military. There&#39;s that. I think it could be possible that there is a connection to the government there. So, some of the killings could of been carried out with the patient under a combination of mental illness that predisposed them to violent actions and then this was combined with a course of psych drugs and hypnosis. No solid proof but it is plausible. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t suicidal, but I was pretty depressed. I kind of have a natural kind personality, I try my best to always see things in a better light. By the end of high school that was gone, and I was pretty much burnt out from the public education system. I am better now though! :D</p>

<p>I hated school because I did not have interest in the material being taught, and the other kids were bullies and didn&#39;t care about each other. They treat each other like trash. I like to learn about all kinds of things (mostly technology and science and nature) but I hate the school environment, so they misdiagnosed me with ADHD when I didn&#39;t want to do coloring projects at 8 years old (gee, I wonder why an 8 year old male has a hard time sitting still when all we do is <strong>sit inside a building and do activities meant for girls?</strong>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing that often goes unspoken is that a lot of hard drug users <em>started</em> with prescription drugs.</p>

<p>I have a close friend who died around this time last year of a heroin overdose, one of over 10 in my hometown in the last year alone, and most of those people (including my friend) started out with anti-depressants and painkillers.  He wasn&#39;t prescribed them, he bought them from others who were to do recreationally - and this is a <em>huge</em> problem in this country.  Prescription drugs being as over-prescribed as they are means that there are tons of pills for sale to anyone who wants them and these things <strong>do</strong> (or at least often can) lead to harder drugs over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is part of the problem with antidepressants. They work, but sometimes in different ways, and sometimes with disastrous effects on the mind and body.</p>

<p>But even worse than when they don&#39;t work well is when they <em>do</em>, where people think they are cured and stop taking the meds, ending up slingshotting back into their depression.</p>

<p>The over reliance on antidepressants can cause major problems, but at the same time it is an important tool in mental health, to be used with supervised care by a physician or psychiatrist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-depressants are just medication, the major problem with them being  the fact that the brain is a machine of such complexity that we still don&#39;t understand it completely. That being said, it is not a shot in the dark, if it were we&#39;d have this kind of medicine 100 years ago, which we didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Different medications work on different people in different ways, sadly some have horrible side-effects, which is not restricted to antidepressants.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be for you to, instead of looking up big pharma bullshit, actually try to understand science. To make something that would make everyone suicidal would require an extremely extensive and detailed understanding of the human brain which we absolutely don&#39;t have. To make something that would cure everyone with depression would require an extremely extensive and detailed understanding of the human brain which we absolutely don&#39;t have. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, antidepressants are medicines that work for some people and don&#39;t for others, have side-effects that range for handly-noticieable to devastating. To think they are suicide pills to get rid of people is a view so ridiculously childish and retarded that it only shows you have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about, you&#39;re overestimating our understanding of the human brain while ignoring the obvious scientific facts behind the creation of medication in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the basic misunderstanding of science here is that most medicines have side-effects, a lot of times these side-effects end up being exactly what the medicine is trying to cure, this is especially dangerous and hard to predict when we&#39;re dealing with extremely complex chemical balances like that of the human brain.</p>

<p>Every single medicine out there has adverse effects, antidepressants have an amazing amount of adverse effects on a lot of people, that&#39;s why there&#39;s a crapload of them, most depressed people need to find the one that suits them best, it&#39;s that simple, it is not evil big pharma woo-woo bullshit, it is just the reality of pharmaceutical sciences, there is no chemical cure-all magic compound, what we do is find something that should be helpful in most cases, the complexity of the human body does NOT permit perfect medication that works for everyone at any time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say the pharmaceutical industry is a benevolent good-seeking institution, they&#39;re probably just trying to make money, but instead of pretending everyone is seeking you trying to fucking murder everyone you could at least try to seek a minimal understanding of how stuff actually works, the scientists who figure out how to treat diseases through chemicals know what they&#39;re doing, they are trained professionals, just don&#39;t expect them to be white mages, they are very well aware of their limitations and no well-trained pharmacist will tell you an antidepressant works for everyone and has no side-effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no data that supports that.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll explain a bit better. To prove something cures some disease or that something causes disease takes a long time and a crapload of studies. Healthcare sciences are already quite slow-moving , it usually takes a while for a new treatment or theory to be accepted, as that&#39;s for a good reason: Again, the human body is incredibly complex, determining how something works in the very complex system that the human body is requires a lot of studies to be published and a lot of testing on it. </p>

<p>So even though something suspect might be happening, one study done on 20 people is retardedly small to prove or disprove anything realted to pharmacology, it is the kind of thing anyone who really cares about finding the truth wouldn&#39;t even care about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One guy talking about it doesn&#39;t mean much. Again, that&#39;s not how science is done, and this guy is an executive, not a scientist. To prove or disprove anything in this area requires much more than some dude in the industry creating a shitstorm, you need several papers peer-reviewed and published, and then after that a lot of people all over the world will probably redo your experiments several times.

    <div class="md"><p>The man is a doctor who worked his way up to executive level, he was involved in bribing governments to put dangerous drugs on the market.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not exactly a big secret now that anti-depressants increase the suicide risk, they even all had a warning on their boxes, but then that increased the suicide rate further.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this out in the open too, the majority of people here know that posters like you are paid posters, you have the typical style.  You obviously won&#39;t admit that as you&#39;d lose your job.</p>

<p><strong>Warning that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide led to MORE people trying to take their own lives</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the suicide risk increase from labeling is most likely related to the nocebo effect. </p>

<p>Also, even if the guy is a doctor, no, his words do not overthrow published science. I know believing in bullshit is easy, but again, science works in different ways, Einstein himself didn&#39;t believe in a lot of quantum mechanics, this doesn&#39;t mean the field is a lie, authority is not an argument.</p>

<p>You clearly read more bullshit than science and your only way to present a point is through &quot;look at this guy who said I&#39;m right&quot; while delivering a free downvote. I said many times and I will say again, science is not built through one person saying one thing, if is many people doing a lot of fucking research.</p>

<p>I know to you your argument seems like the most convincing thing ever, but thing is, if you were to step into any decent university by some miracle (a point at which I&#39;d probably not have to explain this basic shit to you) you&#39;d probably find bookshelfs upon bookshelfs full of peer-reviewed publications. This is how the scientific method works, this is how humanity finds the truth, if the only way to understand the universe was to find your closest woo-woo witchdoctor &quot;whistleblower&quot; and ask him the meaning of the cosmos we&#39;d probably be a much more advanced species by now.</p>

<p>Also, your accusation is probably a great way to convince yourself that what I&#39;m saying is wrong. I have the typical style of anyone who is marginally scientifically literate, something that conspiracy theorists generally aren&#39;t (unless you have some secret woowooology college somewhere), that derives from the fact that most conspiracy theorists are regular, gullible people who think they can see the truth around them without putting any effort into actually studying something, the world is very easily seen when all you have is basic dichotomies and everything that seems bad has some &quot;extremely clear&quot; explanation behind it, as if this were a comic book of some sort.</p>

<p>Now, if you think I&#39;m a paid poster... I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the kind of person who I could convince otherwise. I guess I have used this account actively for around 2 years barely coming to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> just to advocate that pharmacology is an actual science and not bullshit woo-woo magic to this one person in one comment in one thread. </p>

<p>If there is someone out there paying people not to be dumasses please tell me where to go, I feel like I&#39;m doing neckbeard-level arguing here and if throwing non-bullshit at nutheads can be profitable I&#39;d probably be the first one to apply.</p>

<p>No.  Brain chemistry is ridiculously complex.  That&#39;s why throwing anti-depressant drugs at people who aren&#39;t depressed is, get this, possibly a bad idea.  Imagine if you made someone with a non-broken arm/finger wear a splint.</p>

<p>SSRI&#39;s help balance out abnormal brain chemistry.  What they should <em>really</em> call depression is &quot;serotonin and dopamine deficiency&quot; because that&#39;s what it is.  And it makes people understand it as much more of a medical issue than just someone &quot;is sad or crazy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how lexapro was for me, ended up attempting suicide on it when I missed a day. It made me feel like a robot. On the other hand, celexa has greatly improved my quality of life. I hate the idea of taking ssri&#39;s but since marijuana isn&#39;t legal where I live I have to settle for a chock full of side effects SSRI :( Thankfully, since I&#39;ve been taking Celexa correctly, 20 mg in AM 20 in PM its leveled me out and kept me generally content with no suicidal tendencies. Also gave me my motivation to get out of bed back. (just typed this so others possibly going through depression can see how they need to find one right for them, like celexa is for me)</p>

<p>EDIT: granted this Celexa could all be a placebo effect because I&#39;m a drug addict so it puts my mind at ease to pop a pill in the morn and at night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true for many psychiatric drugs, if you take the drug and don&#39;t have the underlying condition that the drug treats, you may start to show symptoms of that illness. This is the danger of the over prescription of these medications. If your brain neurotransmitter levels are normal and you take an SSRI, you will have bad side effects, like suicidal ideation. The over diagnosis of depression, and the over prescription of the drugs that treat it, are dangerous not only to the ones that are mislabeled as mentally ill, but to those who are actually clinically mentally ill, and for whom these drugs actually work pretty well. Not everyone who broke up with thier girlfriend has depression and needs an anti-depressant. It lessens the perceived severity of clinical depression, in which a person may be depressed for no reason but that thier brain is deficient in serotonin. Psychiatric medications aren&#39;t bad because those without the illness have these side effects when they take it, the over diagnosis and doctor&#39;s getting kickbacks for writing as many prescriptions as possible is the problem.</p>

<p>Edit: the therapeutic amount that the drug companies suggest are usually way too much for the average person.  A psychiatrist should always start with a low dose, but they usually start with the therapeutic dose.  And if you are prescribed these meds always start by taking half of what you are prescribed at first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot more evidence inplying that I&#39;m the &quot;rule&quot;. Even the commercials for them say side effects are worsening depression and increased suicidal tendencies.  I&#39;ve read more studies saying the side effects are more common than the benefits. Yeah certain ones really work for certain people I&#39;m aware of this. But the trial and error method for figuring out which kind and dose is right for someone seems to cause a lot of the negative mentalities about it.  If someone had an amazing experience with Prozac switching to Zoloft could be life threatening. The problem with this is that a lot of people, myself included, probably try 4+ that are horrible before finding a good one or giving up.  None of this makes me the exception and there is no rule.  Saying they are always good or always bad is the most wrong anybody could be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vast majority seems like a stretch.  A lot of people sure, but they also harm a lot of people.  Certain ones help certain people which is really great so for that reason sure they can be extremely helpful. But like I said if 1 completely solves every problem in someones life a different one could mess that same person up worse than before.  So what I&#39;m trying to say is that SSRI&#39;s as a whole are a lot more dangerous than most people are willing to admit.  The way they are randomly selected for people can cause a lot of problems.  The over prescribing of them is extremely dangerous.  Not 100% of depression is caused by the chemical imbalance that SSRI&#39;s are meant to fix.  Depression is not understood enough for the dragnet way they toss these medication at people.  I&#39;m not ignoring any studies, and I&#39;m not saying that they don&#39;t help a lot of people.  They can help a lot of people who happened to get the right kind at the right dose and still be dangerous as a whole because of the way they are prescribed.  If doctors had some way of testing people that could accurately determine which medication at which dose would actually help somebody then I would be all for them because sure, they can work.  But right now it&#39;s basically just here take this see what happens.  When what happens can be suicide I personally think that&#39;s pretty dangerous. So how bout this:  fuck the way SSRI&#39;s are prescribed. Better? Can we all sleep at night now?  </p>

<p>I do not take them now (though probably should), but the year before I started, I had been slowly spiraling towards suicide after a lifetime of general depression. </p>

<p>When I started them, it was so my family would know I was depressed, and so that when I eventually took my life, they&#39;d think &quot;Oh, there wasn&#39;t anything we could have done, he was just depressed&quot;. Probably stupid, but it made sense to me then, and does now. </p>

<p>I took them for a couple months, and woke up one day realizing I didn&#39;t feel like killing myself anymore. Didn&#39;t feel like doing anything else either, but I wasn&#39;t suicidal. </p>

<p>Few weeks later, I actually felt almost normal. After a couple years, I decided I didn&#39;t need them anymore, and stopped taking them. </p>

<p>That was a couple years ago, and I can feel myself starting to spiral again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, unless you have some sort of life changing experience, you are probably going to have to take medication for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Learning from my own experience, you should start taking it now before it gets worse man, cause it will take a few weeks to even a couple of months before the meds really kick in. The way I learned it was that basically the meds help build up certain chemicals in your brain which help prevent depression or w/e illness you have. Of course, within the year you will feel great and feel as if you don&#39;t need to take the meds anymore. Then within the next 6 months, if you do stop taking the medication, you lose all of the chemical buildup and being to spiral again once it completely loses its affect. </p>

<p>Wait wait wait, did you just tell me someone who takes anti depressants are more likely to kill themselves? NO FUCKING SHIT, they are depressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re sticking your head in the sand and going &quot;lalalah, no problem here&quot;. The military has an increased suicide risk because it is a brutal place full of bullying, stress and violence. They condition people to ignore their emotions and break their spirits until they do exactly what they are told. That sort of mental conditioning is going to cause people to become suicidal. It has nothing to do with the age group, which is also incorrect as the largest group of suicidal people BTW. The largest group is men in their 30-50 range, followed by teenage girls. </p>

<p>Depressed people who take anti-depressants have a noticeable increased suicide risk over those who don&#39;t take them. There have been multiple studies done and a lot of evidence that these medications aren&#39;t safe for general use, but you&#39;re choosing to ignore that because it doesn&#39;t fit your idea of modern medicine. </p>

Then explain to me why I can barely function without taking antidepressants, and why my anxiety levels were through the roof before I started taking them. I started taking antidepressants at age 13, and before then, I was having panic attacks every single day, except I didn&#39;t know they were panic attacks. (This was in the 90s, when much less was known about anxiety and panic attacks.) Do you even know how terrifying it is to have panic attacks without knowing what they are or how to control them? And all of those panic attacks were making me suicidal, but I guess you don&#39;t give a shit about that. You don&#39;t give a shit about any of this. All you care about is being right.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t believe me? Lol.. you know that side-effects start immediatly when comes into your blood stream, right?  ESPECIALLY the first days/weeks are crazy, after that your body gets used to it/adapts to it and you will start to notice the mental benefits (if its the right medicine, it normally works for 60% of the patients in a way it was meant to work; helping with depression and/or anxiety/obsessive complusive disorders).</p>

<p>Havent you ever read instructions of use which come with antidepressiants, or havent you ever spoken with a doctor who subscribes them? They warn you for this, BIG TIME! Its also the reason why so many quit taking them within the first days/weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and Maria both describe immediate effects. I&#39;m a layman and took Prozac for a few months. I personally felt no change until at least a week. Somehow, I&#39;m inclined to think that the reaction you two had is a rarity.  I think it may be valuable to collect more anecdotes and stats. SSRIs are likely a road to hell (or normalcy, in my case) researchers paved with good intentions. Once more research revealed the frequency of bad effects, suits owned it and never gave a fuck.</p>

<p>Plus, even if you personally had some kind of immediate reaction to it, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a worthwhile drug for the general public. Some people have adverse reactions to penicillin too, we just give them a different kind of antibiotics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can speak from personal experience of taking 2 separate SSRIs. They&#39;ve done nothing but help me. They ain&#39;t a miracle cure for sure.  Any medicine has side-effects, but I barely notice mine. Occasionally tinnitus, nausea when you first start taking them, thats about it. We also have to remember the less prescribed SSRIs have more adverse side effects. The reason they show up during the acts of mentally unstable people are just that. The mentally instability is treated by SSRIs, the SSRIs don&#39;t cause the issue. Sure, we shouldn&#39;t rely totally on SSRIs and they may be somewhat over prescribed, but there just a modern medication like any other. </p>

<p>Do you have any type of degree in medicine? </p>

<p>By the way, the fact that you seem to think either doctors are lying to you or are out to get you is rather worrying, considering the discussion at hand. I would get that checked out.</p>

<p>Also, just because some drugs didn&#39;t work for you doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work for everyone. Your argument seems to work around the assumption that our understanding of how mental illness works is rather solid. We barely understand it. The fact that we have medicine that does work is incredible. Everyone is different, and that includes their chemical makeup. </p>

<p>In the future, please try to not jump to such large generalizations just because of something that happened to you personally. Look at the statistics. Millions of people are on antidepressants, and the fact that we are not a country of insanity immediately disproves this point you made earlier:</p>

<p>One of the issues I&#39;ve heard from others who take SSRIs is that they start on a massive dose. I take 50mg (just enough to take the edge off so I can work through my issues cognitively) and some people I know STARTED at 300mg!

    <div class="md"><p>Im also thinking how the medical community, especially with just walk-in or family doctors, aren&#39;t all in on a big scam, they are legitimately trying to treat people. I think part of the naivety lies in the opinion that doctors are pharma companies are just concerned about profits. We don&#39;t have a perfect drug that cures anxiety or depression. Do you really think we have advanced as far as to have completely figured out the human mind? That would be very very naive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate the level of bribery that comes on in these situations. Often the doctors are literally using pens given to them by the companies who make the drugs they&#39;re prescribing on clipboards the companies gave them while their waiting rooms are covered in posters advertising the same medication. There are good doctors who try their best for their patients, but that isn&#39;t the majority of cases from what we&#39;re seeing. Try reading Norah Vincent&#39;s book on her time in 3 mental health wards, it is a very interesting read and might help you understand where I&#39;m coming from and why doctors may not be in the pocket of these companies, but apathy and bribery are rampant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you can call it teaming up when they literally send you on a cruise to learn about their new drug, put you up in 5 star hotels and such.. There is a line that shouldn&#39;t be crossed and it often is. I&#39;m not sure on Zoloft exactly but I&#39;m sure there would be evidence out there that it causes problems if you want to check documentaries on Youtube. One of the problems we have is that the trials are often done by the drug companies themselves, they have their hands in every step of the chain and so manipulate it to push drugs.</p>

<p>House of leaves is a good book.. well the 3rd I read was cool about the door appearing in a house. the other 2 parts didn&#39;t interest me so I skipped them and just read the story I enjoyed, although now I&#39;m creeped out by walls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much any SSRI drug can give these side effects. Usually it gets a lot better after a couple of weeks when the body has gottten used to them.</p>

<p>Like someone said, it&#39;s not a secret. It says so on the little paper slip thing that comes with the medicine.</p>

<p>And why would healthy non-depressed people eat SSRIs? If you have your serotonine in order, start eating Zoloft will probably mess you up in some way. Excess serotonine can&#39;t be good. I guess.</p>

<p>Im guessing healthy non cancer ridden volunteers would get really unhappy trying chemotherapy aswell, no real point in this study imo.</p>

Later they shut down because of bad publicity when a young woman killed herself in a study of  an antidepressant. So I drive a lot to other places further away. The driving is the most dangerous part of the job. My own experience with zoloft is that it made me not care. I watched 9/11 happen, had the tv on the today show when the second plane hit, and i noticed I didnt care. Stopped taking it soon after that. Now I just muddle through. My depression isn&#39;t acute as long as I avoid high stress situations like jail or a job. I used to have a law practice, now I just do drug studies to get by and support my reddit habit.</p>

I also took Zoloft, at the recommendation of a family member who had been on it for years. I started taking it after my wife left me and my 2 young daughters. The first 2-3 months I felt great, so much energy, enthusiasm and happiness. Then I turned into a &quot;robot&quot; as I call it. I felt nothing really, all that energy and enthusiasm was gone. I lost all friends and some family. I still took care of my girls but it was a struggle. I got off it after about another 5 months. Fuck Zoloft and Wellbutrin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making people depressed and suicidal is a billion dollar industry.  Pharma companies found a way to make people suicidally addicted to their drugs.  Its absolutely criminal.</p>

<p>Raising serotonin isn&#39;t all SSRIs do.  I saw a study not long ago that said just one dose of an antidepressant is enough to change the brain.  It described a reduction in connectivity in all parts of the brain.  Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/antidepressants-can-change-your-brain-immediately-study-271371">http://www.newsweek.com/antidepressants-can-change-your-brain-immediately-study-271371</a></p>

<p>Pharma drug studies are careful in what they say about pharma drugs so they didn&#39;t mention a very specific brain region that also gets a &quot;reduction in connectivity&quot;.  The frontal lobe.  The part of the brain that houses personality and emotion.  If there&#39;s a &quot;reduction in connectivity&quot; in all parts of the brain that includes this important one.  Does this mean SSRIs and antidepressants in general are sort of chemical lobotomies?  Too me a reduction in connectivity to the frontal lobe sounds like it.</p>

<p>These drugs are suicide pills.  This small study proves it.  If you are someone who can&#39;t live without these pills, in my opinion, you are not a victim of your own depression, but are a victim of antidepressant drugs.  These drugs give a person a brain problem when there most likely was not one to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see a statistic of suicide victims that took antidepressant drugs.  I guarantee its high. </p>

<p>Since suicidal people tend to be depressed, they will be more likely to be on anti depressants. Correlation doesn&#39;t prove causation.</p>

<p>However, the chemical lobotomy is interesting... create the solution by treating a perceived issue...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>after this I&#39;ll probably delete my account, damn.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my 30s. In my early 20s i was an obnoxious athiest, in that i argued with any theist about anything. Sometime in my late 20s i had someone quote at me &quot;you&#39;re dead, it doesn&#39;t matter&quot; as a response to a general question about anxiety over death.</p>

<p>Sometime in california in the past 10 years i&#39;ve been prescribed by a doctor or PA buproprion to quit smoking and quell social anxiety. I&#39;ve always come off as abrasive, it&#39;s a character trait picked by my PC on initial roll. Buproprion is an SSRI, which basically means that receptors that receive serotonin in your brain constantly say &quot;i am happy!&quot;: this is the cute way of saying it.</p>

<p>However, on Buproprion i became morbid. Nearly every waking minute was spent fantasizing about ways i could die at the exact moment. it was obsessive. I half-ass attempted suicide in my early 20s because of some lady(20 missed calls, no less,) but i&#39;ve never been suicidal. However, ways to die painlessly (in my mind, super quick) started popping up in an invasive manner. Planning how to have it least affect those close to me.</p>

<p>I did sort of quit smoking. but i weaned myself off Buproprion because i did not like my doctor, and that was the safest method. I&#39;ve been on several brain altering pharmaceuticals (due to being a problem kid in the 80s, see) and the &quot;side effects&quot; last a lot longer in me than usual. This is only to preface this: to this day i still have occasional thoughts about dying and how to die properly... whereas i never did (dying was sort of irrelevant) prior to Buproprion. </p>

<p>Now fast forward some period within the last 4 years and I managed to get medical insurance, so i visited a doctor to stop smoking and handle social anxiety again. This time i was prescribed paroxetine (another SSRI) at an increasing dose until i was on max dosage, and Lorazepam 5mg. I told the PA about the experience with buproprion, as well.</p>

<p>within 3 months i was literally acting crazy. I requested a leave of absence from a well paying job to pursue another company. They bought it. I then QUIT over some pettiness, both jobs. I was risk-taking. I was pushing everyone i knew away, hard.</p>

<p>I weaned myself off the paroxetine over a month&#39;s time, after taking it for several months. It&#39;s hard to tell a doctor that the drugs they want you to take make you want to die or constantly think about death. It&#39;s also hard to tell them that they&#39;re making you insane in a weird indescribable way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard living with mild depression, social anxiety, and a plethora of other &quot;mental defects&quot; that make me dismiss pretty much every source of information. However i still manage to blunder through each day, with occasional thoughts of death and dying.</p>

<p>Now, recently i&#39;ve heard that the SSRI can have four effects. A. You can get serotonin storm (and probably die or whatever). B. Nothing C. thoughts that a  depressed mind cannot put into action become possible. this also includes suicide. D. you&#39;re happy, now, kid. go eat a hot dog.</p>

<p>These drugs are fucking <em>over prescribed</em> - they can be effective if the attending prescription writer knows what to look out for; they need to know the things that go on while on these drugs. Perhaps they should take them themselves for 6-9 months, something like Paxil or Zoloft, then some lorazepam, then maybe an anti-psychotic, a mild one like they prescribe for half-crazy white girls in beverly hills. Then they might know what to look out for, what questions to ask... </p>

<p>tl;dr: doctors don&#39;t know the questions that patients don&#39;t know how to ask or even that they should ask. Over prescription of SSRI is dangerous, IMO.</p>

Something mad me stopped to read yours through, it might have been your opening. Anyways, i sped read your comment for the most part (it&#39;s almost 3am my time) but i noticed we took the same meds and had similar experiences on them. And i agreed ssri&#39;s are over prescribed and the side effects are ridiculous. I&#39;m glad i don&#39;t take them anymore, i found that talk therapy helped a lot more. I coped with my depression and anxiety by building a support system that included: a therapist and a support group (both were temporary, like 3-4 months. The support group helped me realize that depression is temporary and that a lot of people experience the same feelings as i did); and friends (at the time when i started taking the meds i had basically zero friends i could talk to. I ended up making friends by taking a leap and throwing myself into activism, i ended up finding a handful of trusted friends); ceramics (it calmed me a lot); and bud (it helped with energy, appetite and my mood, i had smoked before but not really often or without purpose). This system i built for myself helped me a lot, it isn&#39;t until now, when I moved away from my system, that it has failed me. I hope you figure out a system that helps you. Sorry for the long reply and you really don&#39;t have to retain anything i wrote, it&#39;s cool :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really difficult to base this all off the guardian article. A lot of people are really blindly believing this article. The reporter never mentions the legitimacy of the study at all. Is the reporter qualified to even write and understand an article like this? Most of her experience is in infectious disease (HIV/AIDS and Ebola) or diet. Was the study randomized? If so, how? What was the statistical power set at? Did the researchers determine what sample size was needed to determine statistical significance? Does this study consider other studies looking at differences between depressed people and non-depressed people? How would sertraline compare to placebo? These drugs have been out for years now. Were the patients asked what they knew about the drug before they started taking it? I know everyone wants to take this very mainstream, tertiary review of a scientific article as proof that they were right all along, but without considering the primary document or the author&#39;s biases, making judgments or claims of proof on this is potentially very misguided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The apparent common thought is that the black box warnings are there because the drugs gave already suicidal people the energy to finally commit suicide.  This study shows that if a mentally healthy person were to take the drug there&#39;s a chance they can develop suicidal thoughts.  That shows there is a big problem with a drug if it can actually cause what its meant to treat.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the black box warning is very vague and protecting of the drug because of its wording.  The warning says may <strong>&quot;increase&quot;</strong> suicidal thoughts rather than <strong>&quot;induce&quot;</strong> suicidal thoughts.  It would be more accurate for it to say it may induce rather increase these thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One common misconception with antidepressants is the expected out come. It sounds like the opposite of depression should be happiness, but nothing could be further from the truth. Those medications DO not make you feel happy, they keep you from feeling sad. There is a big difference between feeling happy and something preventing you from feeling sadness. Every antidepressant I ever took, which over the years was more than a few, basically turned my emotions off to varying degrees. A numbness encompassed me both physically and emotionally. I definitely didn&#39;t feel sad anymore, but the problem was that i felt nothing. It was a nothing like opiates used to provide minus all the euphoria that comes along with drugs. It wasn&#39;t until i stopped EVERYTHING, legal and illegal drugs that i began to recover.  Also SSRI&#39;s have horrid withdrawal symptoms. Someone earlier mentioned &quot;brain zaps&quot;. Those alone made me so desperate to keep a supply of the drug that i felt just as dependant on a &quot;legal&quot; drug as i ever did any other &quot;illegal&quot; ones.  Depression is such a wide range of feelings, and sometimes the lack thereof, that to give millions of people a drug that they don&#39;t really know the mechanism as to why it actually works is just mind boggling to me(no pun intended). I am glad that it works for some, but it seems to not for a much larger group that take it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, these drugs are the cause for the unbelievable suicide epidemic.  And oh yes there is a cover up about it.  The media can&#39;t say anything about these drugs because drug companies are one of their biggest sponsors.</p>

<p>Kurt Cobain I&#39;m sure was on antidepressants or had a history with brain altering antidepressant drugs when he committed suicide.  People wonder why he would do it.  It was the drug that warped his mind and made him do it I think.  I don&#39;t think Cobain&#39;s autopsy was even released so who knows what was in his system.  The media made no effort to investigate it.  They get paid off to not report it.</p>

<p>The media even reported &quot;No drugs in Robin Williams&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29963564">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29963564</a></p>

<p>That is an absolute lie.  There were not <strong>illegal</strong> drugs found in his body.  Robin Williams had <strong>two</strong> types of antidepressant drugs in his system.  Also a week old prescription of a powerful anti-psychotic medication was found at his house too.  It also has a strong black box warning for suicide.  Some media sources that report the antidepressants in his system, only mentioned it like it was an nothing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/07/robin-williams-cause-of-death-suicide_n_6123858.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/07/robin-williams-cause-of-death-suicide_n_6123858.html</a></p>

<p>You say your friends dad described his skin crawling and a horrible loss of hope.  The skin crawling and general horrible uneasiness is called akathisia.  Its reportedly a feeling that makes a person feel like they are jumping out of their own skin.  This is the &quot;energy&quot; people like to say these drugs give already suicidal people.  Its just awful that he was prescribed something for natural grief. </p>

<p>Its happening everyday that people are being prescribed antidepressants for grief.  Its terrible.  Whats even more disturbing is what it actually means when the drug does help with the grief.  When an antidepressant &quot;helps&quot; with the grief what that really means is its taking away the care you had for that person.  No more love for that person.  It makes you not care.  People report all the time that whatever antidepressant &quot;helped&quot; them or &quot;helped them finally move on and become a functioning human again&quot; after grieving for a loved one.  These drugs chemically take away love and emotion.  Sometimes permanently:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/47262-antidepressants-affect-feelings-of-love-for-partner.html">http://www.livescience.com/47262-antidepressants-affect-feelings-of-love-for-partner.html</a></p>

<p>Another disturbing thing that antidepressants &quot;help&quot; with is guilt.  Veterans suffering from PTSD when they come back from war feel guilty lots of the time for what they had to do.  SSRIs &quot;help&quot; with the guilt by chemically taking it away.  It doesn&#39;t just take away the guilt for the things they did, but now they can&#39;t feel it in anything they do.  Again made uncaring.  Makes sense now that all the mass shooters were on these drugs.</p>

<p>Antidepressants, when people like them, just put the person into an emotionless state.  No more sadness, no more guilt, no more grief, no more anxiety, but also not more true happiness, empathy, hope, or even love.  Just emotionless content.  They just put a person into logic mode.  Everything is just okay.  Its sounds awful, but the drugs sort of &quot;spellbind&quot; a person into liking them sometimes.</p>

<p>There have been documentaries on antidepressants and the horrorible effects of them.  One in particular I found interesting was the 2012 documentary titled &quot;Who Cares in Sweden&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a clip from the documentary that describes antidepressants effects on empathy and why the numbing of empathy &quot;treats&quot; social anxiety.  No more empathy means less caring about what others think of you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7eBv4H8mXo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7eBv4H8mXo</a></p>

<p>These drugs are bad news.  They are an epidemic and the public is unaware because of pharma company influenced media and governments.  What drugs we need to research is MDMA and Psilocybin.  These drugs in a few doses have been found to have a lasting increase in love, empathy, and happiness.  Its too bad that the pharma industry wants nothing to do with drugs like that because there is no money in a drug that only needs to be taken once or a few times to make a person feel better.</p>

<p>My coworker told me they gave her daughter anti-depressants because she has digestive problems. I just about said, &quot;what the god damn fuck did they do that for?&quot; She told me its a regular thing for doctors to prescribe anti-depressants for this. WHAT THE FUCK, MAN. </p>

<p>WHAT.
THE.
FUCK.</p>

<p>So now her digestive problems subside, but she will now likely have suicidal tendencies because her doctor is a fucking moron. </p>

<p>It&#39;s shit like this that makes me want to give up on humanity.</p>

Microwave Telepathy
To refresh, microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation. Microwave technology allows us to heat a burrito and transmit wireless power, but it also allows us to induce the perception of sound in both hearing and deaf individuals. Neuroscientist Allan H. Frey published the first paper on this microwave auditory effect back in 1962, stating the following:</p>

<p>“Using extremely low average power densities of electromagnetic energy, the perception of sounds was induced in normal and deaf humans. The effect was induced several hundred feet from the antenna the instant the transmitter was turned on, and is a function of carrier frequency and modulation. Attempts were made to match the sounds induced by electromagnetic energy and acoustic energy.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm. SSRIs are the devil. I was diagnosed with depression and given a laundry list of meds. All made me feel dead and worse. If you feel dead suicide makes sense because you are already there. I ended up getting diagnosed next with bipolar since I told my docs the meds made me feel even worse. Another laundry list and 3 months on mind numbing lithium later I was at another doc who diagnosed me with adhd. Got put on adderall. That drug is a miracle. Mood boost and I can focus and get shit done. I guess what I am saying,  is docs are too eager to write a scrip and boot you out the door. If I wasn&#39;t terrified of meds and knew what to look for mentally I totally would have offed myself. I do think they work for a few people...but the willingness to overmedicate by medical professionals and do trial by fire is dangerous indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm.
Was prescribed 25mg for first two weeks, then 50mg for next two weeks after. Ended up on 100mg within six weeks. 
Within eight weeks the absolute crushing numbness was apparent in everything I did.
Tried to kill myself within two months of using them, something I had never dreamed of.
I mean, depression gets bad, really darkly bad, but killing myself wasn&#39;t an option. Setraline makes you feel indifferent to anything, as though your incapable of feeling anything anymore. Before the tablets I could feel sad and sometimes happy, but with Zoloft that all changes and I just wanted to die, the futility of everything seemed so strong that I honestly felt their was no point anymore.
Stopped taking them and, after a while, I was able to feel again. I still suffer from depression but I don&#39;t feel suicidal anymore. 
My advice to anyone considering medicating with setraline is simple: find another way because this will not help you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t exactly news though...almost all anti-depressants have &quot;suicidal thoughts&quot; as a side effect. Sometimes your body doesn&#39;t react to the medication properly, and while 10% is really high for a side effect, this really isn&#39;t something that has a giant cover-up.</p>

<p>I have no idea why it was removed from TIL though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried the stuff for a few days for fun as a healthy guy.  The first day it was pretty cool it was like nothing fazed me at all at work and essentially I just didn&#39;t care about the minutiae of the workday, the petty concerns etc.  </p>

<p>But the second day I found I was a bit more aggressive with customers and staff.  The third day too.  And I felt like there was an obvious come up and come down rather akin to taking ecstasy where I experienced the strength of the drug in waves of rushes.  </p>

<p>All in all, I found it to be a net negative experience.  I can understand why some people would feel suicidal, as in, they would feel aggressive towards themselves, especially those people who don&#39;t voice their frustrations about other people and so direct frustration at themselves.</p>

Just some good old fashioned talking and personal responsibility gets most people straight.

    <div class="md"><p>The question shouldn&#39;t be whether these pills are good or bad, they are tools. And as such, can be used correctly or be misapplied. The main problem with SSRIs, SNRIs or any other long term psychoactive treatment is that they are used far too much today. In my experience, these meds are used to sort of replace conversational therapy and are therefore sustained for far longer than they should be. The best use case would be to see a therapist during the whole time one takes the pill so as to be under regular observation and to be able to exploit the eventual dampening of the depression to work through the underlying issues causing the depression. Otherwise, you&#39;ll just be addicted to a new substance that treats some of the symptoms but not the cause of depression. And it comes with some side effects that can be debilitating long term. Reduced sexual desire for example could be ok for a shorter period, but over the course of multiple years, it could alter one&#39;s behavior in undesired ways. I&#39;ve been on SSRIs/SNRIs for PTSD for many years now but quit recently since I didn&#39;t like the person I&#39;ve become. Aside from reduced libido, I&#39;ve become much more meek, pliable and willing to compromise, what I consider to be a pushover. And I guess that&#39;s what western society would like me to be, a &quot;good&quot; worker. But that&#39;s not what I am and I don&#39;t want to alter my personality chemically to become that anymore. But I must say, it&#39;s a fucking ordeal to come off these drugs after long term use. Right now, I&#39;m so emotionally unbalanced that I barely function but it&#39;s getting better every day. NO MORE! I&#39;ll stick to ganja in the future...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that SSRIs give people more energy and thus more motivation to commit suicide? SSRIs are not meant to get rid of suicidal thoughts like a magic pill, instead they&#39;re meant to make people motivated enough to not sleep in all day and stop zombie like depressive states.</p>

<p>Its through giving back serotonin that people can find the means to die. Its not that the drugs themselves cause the suicidal thoughts, its the suicidal thoughts coming into action when you finally feel like you can do something for once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard this suggested, and while the idea is not without merit and it may sometimes be the case, however I think that there is a very distinct difference between &quot;suicidal ideation&quot; and depression. My strong suspicion is that some antidepressants may work to &quot;fix&quot; or patch depression, while at the same time triggering an increase in suicidal ideation or violent or bizarre thoughts. I personally believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that it IS in fact the drugs that cause suicidal thoughts, at least in many, many cases. </p>

<p>Here is my personal specific experience that lead to this conclusion:</p>

<p>I have been diagnosed with chronic migraines. Chronic is defined as 4 or more times per week. Many women say that a migraine is worse pain than giving birth; I once busted both wrists, my elbow, and several fingers at the same time. I literally laughed it off; it was absolutely nothing compared to a single migraine. I once had a headache for two straight years. </p>

<p>I was offered anti depressants several times over the years, but my personal belief system was such that I chose to avoid antidepressants at all costs. Eventually, I broke down and tried them. The result was that slowly, very very slowly, my migraines became less and less frequent. Astonishingly, my constant back pain which I had believed was due to herniated disk also went away. In addition, my irritable bowel went away. I was, for the first time in a quarter of a century, mostly free of pain and sickness. </p>

<p>But the visions of violence that were in my head played out constantly, like a comic book. Not.... suicide, necessarily, and not the same as &quot;imagining&quot;, or at least, my previous understanding of imagining: it was as if there was a movie playing in my head in full, vivid technicolour constantly, and all it could play was fantastic, blood drenched, gore filled violence. I would get on the escalator, and imagine that I missed a step, and fell all the way to the bottom, breaking my neck. I would be sitting and relaxing at home in my recliner, and look at my arm, and have visions of taking a chainsaw and just ... chopping my limbs off. I went to my neurologist and mentioned it, and we backed off the dosage very slightly, and slowly it went away. I have literally never mentioned it to anyone else, ever, not even my own wife, out of fear of what they might think; and basically I was completely secure in my mind that this was the effects of the drug purely, and nothing what so ever to do with me. Additionally, I was in no way shape or form depressed. I was literally the happiest I&#39;ve been in decades. The only reason I mention it here is to shed light on the situation; to help you to draw your own conclusions regarding conspiracy, and perhaps I suppose it might help someone who is struggling with this same issue.</p>

<p>The doctors, very simply do not understand AT ALL the most basic mechanisms of action behind which antidepressants work. They have theories. Many of the theories are quite simply and completely wrong. All they really know is: statistically, antidepressants result in less depression than placebo. Full stop. </p>

<p>I do not believe that there is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; here. Antidepressants are an attempt that is not fully understood to fix depression. There is a conspiracy (small c) of drug companies to hide the fact that antidepressants cause suicidal ideation. The motivation is money, and that&#39;s all. This is an imperfect world.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t think antidepressants are inherently bad, but you are right in that companies probably not stress the potential side effects for the sake of cash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think its necessarily wrong if depression itself causes a decrease in seratonin. But that&#39;s my opinion anyway. Back to the article, it is a brilliant study on how such drugs affect those without an inherent decease or are seemingly healthy beforehand.</p>

<p>I think the most neutral opinion is that everyone reacts differently to the drugs, and that healthy people or those with minor issues should not be given full blown antidepressant medication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Varenicline (marketed as Chantix) and Bupropion (marketed as Zyban, Wellbutrin, and generics)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s probably healthier to keep smoking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>risk of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients using these products.</strong> These symptoms include changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and attempted suicide. The added warnings are based on the continued review of postmarketing adverse event reports for varenicline and bupropion received by the FDA. These reports included those with a temporal relationship between the use of varenicline or bupropion and suicidal events and the occurrence of <strong>suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in patients with no history of psychiatric disease.</strong></p>
