       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       but today was just incredible.

       Original article on

       They're back with bizzaro claims. This is insulting to our intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enoguh, OP's article mentions two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Albright being instrumental in Kosovo effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Fear that Albright wants Russian resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what: Albright
       <em>
        actually took
       </em>
       Kosovo resources. And here to report on this is ... no other that New York Times:

       Can anyone tell me how this is violating any of the
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       guidelines for comment posting? AFAIK, I am not being hateful or bigoted towards anyone. I'm just calling out known liars for their propaganda.

       Interesting articles, this kind of stuff is informative and important. Regarding your censorship plight all I can say is it is really tragic how far reddit is falling right before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure you can post as many links related to "The Interview" as you want there and not even have  to worry about it being seen as spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       As selfish as this sounds I have to admit I am kind glad when the big subs heavy-handed mods censor people and they come here to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       and become contributors to the sub. This place is fast becoming the last large outpost of free speech on the internet.

       I have to ask why you find it odd that you're posting here? My assumption is that you've been persuaded that we are all anti-semites or something like that. One reason for this is the constant fake accounts that come here and post anti-semitic content. A notable example is the mod of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , Bipolarbear0, creating an account and accidentally leaving proof of his real username in the submissions. The account was
       <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">
        /u/interrogatorybunny
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       He posted this:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you click the link and then click the actual submission, you can check the link flair and realize he screenshotted it while logged in as Bipolarbear0. A perusal of the other submissions from that account shows it was clearly an attempt at painting this sub as anti-semitic.

       I very rarely see a lizard people post, and when I do, it's usually a troll and it gets downvoted to oblivion. I don't think I've ever seen a perpetual motion post here, but I'm sure that kind of thing has been posted at least once. There are of course other things that could turn people off that do get some publicity here, I'm not denying that. I just wanted to set the record straight on the Jew thing. Cheers.

       Much of the time here I feel there is a misconception to newcomers that the sub is anti Jewish,l which is somewhat of a misconception. The prevailing attitude of hostility here in this context is mainly towards the ideology of Zionism and it's expression through current Israeli policy. These issues are quite aside from antisemitism or animosity towards Jewish people as they're not mutuality exclusive no matter how hard the main stream news sources push that sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a fringe sub, a lot less so these days but in the same sense it it's no surprise the extreme right occasionally attempt to co-op threads on such matters. Just see it those schmucks for what they are I guess.

       isn't just anti-Israel, it's straight up anti-Jew. I think there is definitely a neo Nazi contingent here.  Instead of denying it, I point out that it has no bearing on the other stuff.

       There are over 200k people subbed to this sub. There is a lot of content here. If you don't like some of it, ignore it, and don't judge the rest of the content based on that. I really can't believe how often I have to explain this to people. This is a content aggregator that takes user submissions, literally ANYTHING can be posted here.

        I agree. But put that [idea that there are lizard people] in the context of the world we live in. What percentage of people, globally, believe in a god or some other deity?
       </p>
       <p>
        There is as much evidence for a god as there is for lizard people as there is for santa claus. Yet, one group you associate as unstable and another you would call "normal".
       </p>
       <p>
        If the vast amount of people on the planet are so irrational as to believe in a god with no evidence, then how can you justify dismissing an even smaller group of people on that basis?
       </p>
       <p>
        If we follow this thought process even further... if we live in a world that is dominated by irrational people, wouldn't their instinct be to call those who are rational "crazy" because irrationality has been normalized?

       I'm curious what you'll find to be racist or not. But the most sad part is
       <em>
        the user was already banned for posting racist things to the subreddit.

       So if you're aware it's the same user using an alt...why is it allowed?

       If a user posts racist things and gets banned, I don't see the issue. The person behind the accounts will eventually learn not to post racist things. Additionally, banning their new alt for a previous alt's content will give them motivation to create even more alts and spam the hell out of this sub with more racist things than you otherwise would have to deal with. - Dealing with trolls 101

       I'm not trying to win the argument here. I'm just trying to explain that if you get people angry at you, sometimes they sit back for a while and hit you with something they conjured up, such as a coordinated spamming of racist garbage on this sub. "

       On the other hand, you could just let him do his thing as long as he's not being racist, and as soon as he posts racist garbage, ban it and he will make a new account.

      <p>
       Further, using a similar account name with only 1 digit off proves that he is in fact only one person who is a racist member of this sub. If you ban anything that looks like his account, he will create something that sounds completely different, and the majority of people will think that this is
       <em>
        another

       That article is just pathetic btw. A NY-Times correspondant in moscow told us that Santa has been seen talking with Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just believe that they can sell shit for truth. Instead of actually having some correspondand or somebody who represents the Russian gov. saying that (also with actual propf backing it up) they just say it was some correspondant who said that, the equivalent would be saying "well some dude tolde me on the street that..".

       A lot of good points here.

      <p>
       I usually don't like correcting people. Especially when it's clear what they mean, as it really adds nothing to the conversation. That being said, I wouldn't want someone reading these get thrown off by a simple typo.

       In the second paragraph, enough is spelled wrong.
