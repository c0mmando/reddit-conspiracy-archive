       It seems in the past few weeks some thing big happened. With SOPA passing, all these lies about North Korea hacking Sony, Cuba, Peshawar. I just wonder is something big went down or if this is the start of something. The NK hype seems like a 
Cover-up for both the torture report and a hack by NSA(?). Does anyone else just get this feeling that all this is related?
Apparently FBI just confirmed North Korea as the perpetrators of the hack.

       Yea I just realized. Apparently EBOLA is no longer a problem in the world and ISIS has just dropped of the map if you would believe what the media would tell you. This hack is a way to draw attention from what? The torture report?

       The worst is I've started noticing weird shit in this sub. I've never commented on content here but I've been watching since before I had an account. Our place of discussion and conspiracies is slowly becoming oppressed by someone or something. Useless content is upvoted, relevant content downvoted. Comments that serve only to distract and take away from discussion are becoming more frequent. Go to any post with 1000 plus upvotes and look the comments that were ignored or downvoted. It's scary that someone might compromise the last place I trust for UN biased news. If this subreddit falls whore then do we go?

       I personally think this hack by 'North Korea' May have actually been executed by some corporation or branch of government that would benefit from an internet where large companies are afraid of having their secrets revealed. Everyone is mocking this event but it could very well become the basis for allegations that the internet is no longer secure and we need the NSA blah blah blah. It scares me to think about it

       I've been around reddit for -- let me check my original account -- 7 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit started degrading about after they got acquired by Conde Nast and when they started exercising the admin system. Frankly, I think this was a design oversight (intentional perhaps?) which assures that discussions aren't
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       free.
      </p>
      <p>
       I quit reddit for good about 3 years ago, and have only recently picked up
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after the James Corbett AMA. Things have changed, but not all that much...

       Reddit is a good case study of how Going Big today means Going Sour. You might've noticed that it's not just reddit -- shilling is up all over the nets. People arguing is probably a consequence of our split narrative, amplified by the reddit platform and size of user-base.

       Once you go from niche to mainstream -- that's when the vultures swoop in. If you don't fight them, they win.

       That sounds like reddit in general now, and in fact the entire internet. It's all owned by shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all truthfulness, I don't think there's anywhere left that isn't tainted. I suggested awhile back: somebody needs to get hold of technology that can identify individual posters across sites by their word usage patterns, and use it to identify shills. This would serve two purposes: lift the veil to expose the shills, and allow us to recreate reddit/news media comments without the shills.

       What buggs me is the fact that all reports from the Donbass area suddenly just stopped, just as the thing with Cuba and Nort Korea started. I follow a news channel thing on youtube where people from Donbass report on what is happening. They usually upload like 6 vids a day. They have been silent for 5 days or something. I heard that they blocked all traffick for Ukrainian airports. No planes coming in or out. Except for NATO planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure, I think we should watch the Ukraine closely. There is going to be either a huge false flag (like some nuke going off or something) or they are preparing their NATO sacrifice so that Russia finally makes a mistake and attacks them so the west can declare WWIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that I don't know of anything else happening. Maybe something in Syria? Because it's been quiet on that front aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant everybody.

       You totally forgot the market manipulation of energy prices to screw over Russia and their economy, this is blatant (market manipulation) that will have serious impacts on the economy and that might be the real con.

       We are all happy about low prices and just care more about that bull shit movie than what is happening.
