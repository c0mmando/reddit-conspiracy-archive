Apparently FBI just confirmed North Korea as the perpetrators of the hack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst is I&#39;ve started noticing weird shit in this sub. I&#39;ve never commented on content here but I&#39;ve been watching since before I had an account. Our place of discussion and conspiracies is slowly becoming oppressed by someone or something. Useless content is upvoted, relevant content downvoted. Comments that serve only to distract and take away from discussion are becoming more frequent. Go to any post with 1000 plus upvotes and look the comments that were ignored or downvoted. It&#39;s scary that someone might compromise the last place I trust for UN biased news. If this subreddit falls whore then do we go?</p>

<p>Reddit started degrading about after they got acquired by Conde Nast and when they started exercising the admin system. Frankly, I think this was a design oversight (intentional perhaps?) which assures that discussions aren&#39;t <em>too</em> free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is a good case study of how Going Big today means Going Sour. You might&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s not just reddit -- shilling is up all over the nets.

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like reddit in general now, and in fact the entire internet. It&#39;s all owned by shills. </p>

<p>In all truthfulness, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anywhere left that isn&#39;t tainted. I suggested awhile back: somebody needs to get hold of technology that can identify individual posters across sites by their word usage patterns, and use it to identify shills. This would serve two purposes: lift the veil to expose the shills, and allow us to recreate reddit/news media comments without the shills. </p>

<p>personally i&#39;m to tired to bother</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What buggs me is the fact that all reports from the Donbass area suddenly just stopped, just as the thing with Cuba and Nort Korea started. I follow a news channel thing on youtube where people from Donbass report on what is happening. They usually upload like 6 vids a day. They have been silent for 5 days or something. I heard that they blocked all traffick for Ukrainian airports. No planes coming in or out. Except for NATO planes.</p>

<p>I am not sure, I think we should watch the Ukraine closely. There is going to be either a huge false flag (like some nuke going off or something) or they are preparing their NATO sacrifice so that Russia finally makes a mistake and attacks them so the west can declare WWIII.</p>

<p>Other than that I don&#39;t know of anything else happening. Maybe something in Syria? Because it&#39;s been quiet on that front aswell.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant everybody.</p>
