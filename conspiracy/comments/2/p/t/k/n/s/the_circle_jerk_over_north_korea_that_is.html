       I'm a reasonably well educated person and I cannot wrap my head around the Hollywood vs. North Korea fiasco of the last few days. What the hell do these hackers have that is so fucking compelling you embargo a 10 year old claymation, stall a Christmas time block buster, and outright cancel some future steve carrell rerun still in production. 
If he is making threats, what exactly is he saying? Whats his username? How is he communicating with you? Can you publish the communications? Can you provide any evidence which substantiates this threat as legitimate other than sorry please just trust us at our word. 
For some reason, I feel like we are in day 3 of a really hostile takeover of our system by a new player with a ton of leverage over some very powerful people in our country. Don't even get me started on the timing of these events with the Cuba devolopments. 40 something years and this is the week it drops? Coincidence?

       The MPAA and other organizations are trying to censor and tear down the internet and I believe that this is a coordinated effort with other interests to distract people away from not only the former but the Ukraine, Syria, Russia situation that is happening. People love movies so why not distract the flies with some light and turn their attention away from the economic and military war happening in a place the United States has no business being.

       Well think about it. The majority seems to simply trust that there actually were threats. So you don't even need to fake any of the evidence. YOu never need any in the first place. After all, you are Sony or X/Y major corporation and thus you can be trusted because you would never lie.
Same goes for the government which of course only works for the greater good of all its citizens.

       Well, they are after all called credible sources in a way. Just like any MSM newspaper/TV channel is considered credible. What people need to finally get into their goddamn skulls is that they are basically calling themselves credible. It's as if I said everything I say is right and I can then spew all kinds of lies.

       I would not say that WWIII is imminent.  Tensions with Russia have been high for a while but the U.S. hasn't escalated to a full blown war at all.  I guess we'll just gradually wait for the country to go downhill without any wars.

       The story goes: Sony made a comedy about assassinating Kim Jong Un. Sony gets hacked: terabytes of information are stolen - movie scripts, emails, internal memos etc. Group of hackers is called Guardians of Peace, they release damaging information, they make demands, threaten to make more or all stolen info public. They say people will be hurt if the film is released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sony allows cinema chains to not show film. No cinema chain wants to show the film. Sony decides they'll cancel the film's release. FBI blames NK. Obama says the film should be released.

      <p>
       And now it's being released?

       This is one of the most ridiculous events so far. The majority conclusion from the tech industry is that it was an insider and couldn't have been North Korea. The bigger news media says otherwise. They are implying it gently though as everyone has jumped on the NK boat. Stories questioning the narrative will probably be corrected in the next week as everyone gets their story straight. North Korea makes insane declarations all the time yet they haven't said anything about this.

       It's not the fact that we can't see the film in the theater. We don't really give a fuck about that. It's more that by removing it it shows that Nork can bully us around and change things by threatening the citizens of our country (911 style attacks on the theaters). By giving in to them, it sends the message that we won't stop them when they bully us.

       No. But from the standpoint of the majority of users, they believe it's true. Me, personally, I am unsure, and theres no major proof to show any reason. But from looking at the frontage, it seems that most redditors believe that Nork hacked sony, and by canceling it in theaters this complies to what they believe are NK's wishes.

       Ok... so here is the thing that you need to do.  Understand that people lie, and then demand proof of their claims if they are to be taken seriously.

       You can not allow yourself to be influenced because Anderson Cooper said that a Sony executive something and then Obama commented on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not proof... the only thing that there is actual proof of is that it is a propaganda film and that Sony was working with the State dept.

       Yeah, because Reddit is notorious for loving and supporting Dick Cheney and the torture program. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much bitching about short attention spans, and yeah, it is an issue. But I gotta laugh at it in this instance, you people act North Korea is being talked about completely out of the blue, it's totally not like they make headlines just about every fucking month and have been doing so for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly is your point anyway? People should not to be angry with or focus on anything that doesn't currently outrage you? Sorry, time didn't stop in 2003. Lots of other things have happened since then, and lots of things will happen in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, everyone knows that people that wanna talk about the CIA torture program are just trying to distract people from the real NSA issue. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not convinced North Korea is responsible. I'm not convinced America is going to use it as pretext for something batshit crazy like attacking them either. I think the most likely outcome is it'll be used as an excuse to clamp down on internet freedom. In what form, I don't know.

       I am willing to bet they found oil/gold or some other precious resources in north korea.  I guess as early as the early 2000's being a axis of evil.

       There are some questions being asked that I don't see.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, and I'm not a North Korea sympathizer, is how would any other world leader like President Obama or Israel PM Netanyahu feel if some other country made a comedy film about their assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second point is that all these people, including Obama are coming out and saying Sony was wrong to cancel the release of the film BUT what if Sony didn't cancel the movie and then violence DID happen at one or two theaters?  Then Sony would be damned for NOT pulling the movie.  Sony spent millions on The Interview but those millions spent isn't worth the price of a single human casualty.

       I thought one wasn't supposed to negotiate with terrorists. Even if something bad were to happen, you can't be held accountable because you're following the policy blindly. Even if something bad
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       happen, everybody accepts that it's more important to discourage future would-be terrorists.

       I don't feel it's negotiating with terrorists.  I feel that it's Sony not wanting a shit load of lawsuits that would likely to occur if the movie was released and a bunch of people got hurt in a theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, how would you feel about Sony if you or one of your family members got hurt while watching that movie despite the warnings of great harm?

       Well, for example in the recent "Sydney Siege" he asked for an ISIS flag and a chat on the phone with the prime minister. Neither were provided, probably on account of the policy I mentioned. However, two hostages were killed. Does that mean the families could open a lawsuit against the prime minister for not making that call?

       That's a different scenario because the terrorist had an intention to hurt people and was at the location wreaking havoc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sony situation is a threat that people will get hurt if that movie is released.  The only time people are going to get hurt is
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the movie is released.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please answer my question.

      <p>
       How would you feel if you or a loved one got all jacked up while watching The Interview?  Would you say it wasn't Sony's fault and let them slide on this one even though they had clear advanced warning that people are going to get hurt if they release that movie?

       Of course I'd be really upset about it, that goes without saying, but secondly I'd be pretty shocked that whoever is behind this is actually serious enough to kill people over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd realize immediately that North Korea couldn't possibly be behind it because that would likely be considered an act of war and lead to potentially devastating consequences for them. Nobody doing it "for the lulz" would kill people over it, which rules out most everybody except for state intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that level of audacity of whatever intelligence agency allied with the west, well, I don't know what I'd think. I guess I'd lose my last remaining thread of faith in the establishment, which is that they'd show a tiny bit of restraint in carrying out these false flags. Yes, lots of people were killed in 9/11, but there was a "big prize" there. If they started killing people wantonly when it comes to these soft agendas (i.e., not much money or power to be gained, more a psyop) I'd become very concerned indeed that a new precedent had been set.

       This is the general consensus but let's pretend for a moment that it was N. Korea that hacked Sony.  You or me or the general public or Sony or the Govt don't know
       <em>
        for sure
       </em>
       if N. Korea is or isn't going to do something bad if that movie is released.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's pretend that Sony ignored the warning and released the movie and N. Korea did do something horrible where a bunch of innocent people got fucked up.
       <strong>
        EVERYONE
       </strong>
       would want the Sony executives heads on a platter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why risk it over a stupid movie?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how about we cry foul about
       <strong>
        Really
       </strong>
       being censored by our own government instead of crying about our 1st amendment rights being shot down because a major corp isn't going to release a lame movie and they're going to lose all this money.  I could care less about Sony because we got bigger problems on our hands.

       It was China. They're framing NK and NK may or may not know because China knew they'd be happy to go along with it.

       Sadly given the recent disclosures there is also the sick, sick possibility it was one of the three letter agencies. I don't believe that though because the FBI / CIA usually use "anonymous" as their cyberthreat boogieman.

       There's a difference between the government and corporations. We all knew what the CIA did and to what extent the tortures were. I'm surprised so many people here needed a release of information to learn about it. Sure you didn't know the details but c'mon, ya'll couldn't have been that ignorant. As for everyone making a big deal of a movie getting canceled, yeah IT IS A BIG DEAL. Wanna know what this nation has been doing for the past +10 years? Fighting terrorism. Wanna know what a corporation just did? Prove that it works. Thanks SPE. Way to be counter-productive. Release the movie and antagonize the threats, they won't wage war against the US and its allies and every other nation that wants it to be demolished over a damn movie about killing the North Korean Stay Puft man

       You both agree. The point is the scare tactic of "losing against terrorism" is the psychological angle. He is saying if the MS narrative is accurate, then we have literally just lost that war. We all know there is more to it than what we are told.

       , i was talking about the US. Sorry about that confusion, I should've clarified. I've had many friends and acquaintances blame the US for Sony's decision, a majority of them actually. And there has been way too many posts/threads on reddit in general talking about how big of a coward America is for pulling The Interview when no one is talking about the CIA report.

       2) I don't think blowing the shit out of Al Qaeda really sponsors their acts of terrorism. That and the entire terms of Obama and Bush are riddled with "War on Terror" headlines. The debate of whether America is fighting or funding is neither here nor there, Americans are still aware of the terrorism part. And if we were talking about "here" being

       No torture is not okay but NK regime does it just as much to its own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is we should not be extorted in any form nor have our privacy hacked like NK did. The same goes with all the worlds intelligence services including our numb nuts at the NSA. Everyone in each of their country should be afforded to have privacy and not hacked.

       The MPAA and other organizations are trying to censor and tear down the internet and I believe that this is a coordinated effort with other interests to distract people away from not only the former but the Ukraine, Syria, Russia situation that is happening. People love movies so why not distract the flies with some light and turn their attention away from the economic and military war happening in a place the United States has no business being.

       Well think about it. The majority seems to simply trust that there actually were threats. So you don't even need to fake any of the evidence. YOu never need any in the first place. After all, you are Sony or X/Y major corporation and thus you can be trusted because you would never lie.
Same goes for the government which of course only works for the greater good of all its citizens.

       1.) Not many who frequent here were surprised by the findings of the torture report and in fact many of us believe the public got feed a PG-13 version of the report.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) No one here believes that what America has been doing for the last 10+ years is "fighting terrorism." Sponsoring it? probably. Implementing it? absolutely.

       Of course I'd be really upset about it, that goes without saying, but secondly I'd be pretty shocked that whoever is behind this is actually serious enough to kill people over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd realize immediately that North Korea couldn't possibly be behind it because that would likely be considered an act of war and lead to potentially devastating consequences for them. Nobody doing it "for the lulz" would kill people over it, which rules out most everybody except for state intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that level of audacity of whatever intelligence agency allied with the west, well, I don't know what I'd think. I guess I'd lose my last remaining thread of faith in the establishment, which is that they'd show a tiny bit of restraint in carrying out these false flags. Yes, lots of people were killed in 9/11, but there was a "big prize" there. If they started killing people wantonly when it comes to these soft agendas (i.e., not much money or power to be gained, more a psyop) I'd become very concerned indeed that a new precedent had been set.
