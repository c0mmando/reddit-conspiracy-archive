       I dont post here often, but why the fuck is no one talkin about Project Goliath? I havent seen it mentioned once on the front page of reddit or in any comment threads. The MPAA is conspiring with 6 major movie studios to push internet censorship. And people think North Korea will be responsible when the censorship comes. This is a blatant false flag and NO ONE on reddit is talking about it!

       Exactly. Its amazing isn't it? People look in the direction they are told to look in. North Korea likely has nothing to do with it anyways, but what a great things to capitalize on. Hey everyone, post memes and jokes about North Korea like the media has spent months prepping you up for.

       This is why we have so many idiots running their mouths about killing all the Muslims/Arabs when they should be blabbing about closing the borders and returning to a nation and away from the open-border globalist pile of waste the US is today. That way we don't have to see Muslims and Arabs and we can leave them alone and stop funding their terrorists.

       There's no need to militarize anything. The US military is so far beyond any opponent that really all they have to do is research and develop. The border is fine the way it is, they need to start using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many American jobs are going overseas and there are too many free trade agreements hurting many nations today. Reconstitute the money supply to the government, make the money accountable to tax payers, bring industry back and make corporations play by the rules. If they want to go somewhere else where they can get their slavery fix, take their cookies away and nationalize their businesses at home. People think that it's too difficult to reign in corporations. It's done every day. And pretending that the US is about capitalism is a sham. The US is a monopoly already. Take that monopoly and put it in the hands of the government and then make the government accountable. They should be anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are borders for a reason. To preserve the way of life of a region of people. Make the government use the border. And that doesn't mean a strictly physical border. Neo-liberalism is a huge problem in the world. It is causing serious pain and suffering for many people who are treated like slaves and paid like slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their labour is worth just as much as anyone's. If you back the money supply by labour, the world is on equal footing and those who produce and sell the most win. That's capitalism. Today, we have industrialists using governments to fight economic wars with their competitors over stupid shit. Labour and service is the only thing that matters. It is universally equal and valuable. It is more valuable than gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debt is only harmful if you believe it exists. As a nation, the US can easily dig its way out financially if it were to adopt an Americans first attitude and start developing the home front.

       How do you bring industry back when there is cheap labor in other countries? Why would an international corporation want to have a factory in the US where the worker gets $10-20 an hour when they can have it in Bangladesh and pay the worker less than that in a day?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just wish away debt by not believing in it. The people who lent the money are still waiting to be paid. Half of the US debt is owed to itself and to the fed reserve but the other half is owed to China, UK, Japan, Germany, etc. Without debt this country would never have even existed. Do you think the monarchies of Europe would have helped our dumb asses out of all those wars in the early days if it wasn't for the fact that we were accruing vast amounts of debt to them in the process. When somebody owes you money it is in your interest to help them to succeed so you can profit off of the interest that they can now afford to pay.

       The whole globalist thing is part of the elite agenda. They don't want humanity to exist as a series of strongly unified groups (ie. nations, communities, families etc.) So the plan is to introduce and enact policies that work against this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see family values under attack and globalism going against a strong national identity.

       Have you ever actually read a scientific study on anything? The whole point of the scientific method is that it can't lie. It's built in to the system that way. The problem is you have to be scientifically literate to understand what is going on.

       So every scientific study that comes out is actually using the scientific method?

       No that's why a study is just a study and anyone in the world can apply the scientific method to the same substance and find out if the existing studies are bullshit or flawed. I understand that big money and/or governments can influence this process. I was worried that you were expressing similar thoughts to plenty I have seen on here about how anything that doesn't fit a preconceived idea is suspect. I think between 9/11 and global warming a lot of people are rejecting science outright without understanding it. I apologize.

       Interestingly, NYT gives us all the details except that the hacked Sony emails are the reason Google knows about this.

       Edit 2: I just so happened to have left the tab open from earlier and decided to reread the article. They changed the article. I took a screenshot in case anyone is interested in comparing the two: Article from earlier:

        http://i.imgur.com/ZnygwyZ.jpg

       Article as it is now (in case they change it again):

       They omitted the part about Fairsearch, along with several other changes.

       It doesn't matter. He was pushed into the spotlight with no talent whatsoever. He will always be B-list at most.

       People will see any movie and not think twice about it. They have to see something. Might as well be a talentless jew. He's so warm and fuzzy. You have to love him.

       I'd say gaining the admiration of millions of fans and maintaining a hugely likeable public persona... while still seeming down to earth and relatable.... He makes enjoyable, funny movies,  Pushed into the spotlight by whom???  He's a household name,,, and he's been successful and he seems to be having a good time and people like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure he's not a Denzel Washington... but I'm still not sure why you don't think he's A-List... okay maybe he's a B-list Actor.... but you should admit that he is an A-list Celebrity

       Of course it's more than that.  Yeah it's an industry circlejerk... but that's the industry that makes Billions and gives Billions of people around the world some entertainment... Movies are a wonderfully powerful form of expression and the Oscars are the most well regarded form of recognition that you can receive as an actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Braveheart, The English Patient, Gladiator, Million Dollar Baby, No Country for Old Men,   These are Classics. Forrest Gump was a classic.

      <p>
       It's much more.....

      <p>
       Yeah it's celebrity culture but it's been around for 86 fucking years!!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not enjoy movies??  Sure you can hate on the marketing and the pageantry and the Pandering for votes but c'mon get over your hip- holier than thou attitude   I'd say most of the films nominated are usually pretty great movies... yeah you'll get your films that you dislike but that's just down to different tastes....

       they can be, but much more often they are poorly concealed morality plays and subsitutes for dwindling church attendance - as well as straight up pandering to the lowest common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
       the last movie I enjoyed was a Terry Gilliam film, it was remarkable.  I'm not talking about those few gems, but the mass marketed industry of pure crap prevails.  they know their audience well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't watch  Forrest Gump if you paid me.  I'm not arguing there aren't good craftspeople in the film industry, just that the actors are terrible, and the films are also pandering to lowest common denominator and often have no value other than to waste your time.

       Okay.. I think that we're just a difference of preference
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people like movies
and
Some people don't
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like those Crime/detective/Courtroom Books that you always see on the bestseller list....  Tom Clancy,  John Grisham
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people just want some "switch off the mind all out entertainment... they want to laugh and be excited and see shit blown up and laugh some more
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies and Books and Music and stuff like that can be an Escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to go to the 1$ movie theater and I would see some pretty shitty movies. but I never walked out. Why not finish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everytime I walked out of their I'd say to friends or to myself if I went alone. "well, it was worth a dollar"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I wasted my time even though bad movies didn't enlighten me or give me new insights or make me cry or whatnot... It's a break from life,, it's a movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people like them
Some people don't

       It's also important to note the sudden lack of interest in the CIA torture scandal. If another another country was found to be carrying out such atrocious acts of violence, Americans would lose their shit. Those responsible for these acts need to be put on trial in front of the UN and accept whatever punishment is deemed necessary.

       Seems like they've been trying to push this in various forms for years though. Is there a counter movement to this one yet? I know other forms of this trying to go through failed because of counter movements generally.

       If anything, Kim Jon un would come out and say it wasn't them, just to Fuck with America. But he isn't, why? I have no idea, honestly. Project Goliath sound plausible. I've been torrenting since the beginning of torrenting, and let me say it setting slightly difficult every day that passes.

       Well, if Sony appeared to back down to North Korea's threats, doesn't that make them look more relevant and powerful?  Maybe he doesn't want to admit that he didn't scare the US after all?

       Look at what I was replying to.  I never said North Korea did it, just that North Korea has no reason to publicly admit that they did not.  In other words, the propaganda generated by US benefits them.

       Not necessarily. They would also have a huge incentive to take credit for it, even if it wasn't them. Since the hack was so successful.
