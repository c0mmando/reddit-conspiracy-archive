I hope that through revelations like these people will finally figure out that you should not just rely/trust on what X/Y major news channel reports. L</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noticed the same thing. So I decided to find out.</p>

<p>I was doing some experiments in r/worldnews with my username before this one and then this username. At the same age, one was allowed to post as often as it liked, despite being under a month old and never having confirmed my email.</p>

<p>The second (this one) was put on that time ban fairly early, then it appeared my username was flagged and my comments would take minutes to appear between me clicking the button and seeing it on the page. During this time I also got banned from r/politics.</p>

<p>What was the difference you ask? The first account made no waves and went along with the circlejerk. The second account did the opposite. </p>

<p>Big surprise huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have wondered about those things myself. Your list of possibilities is right on the money. </p>

<p>You know what else is interesting, when you have a large comment section, what/who decides which comments get put under a (load more comments) link? You know what I mean, not the one at the bottom of the page, the multiple ones that appear when a certain comment thread gets popular and turns into a tree. Who or what decides what gets hidden and what stays in view, because when you just look at it, it seems pretty random.</p>

<p>When you think about it, a little thing like that actually means a lot. The difference between everyone seeing it as a matter scrolling through the thread, or a person having to click a link to see it. </p>

<p>does it? this sub has been used many times to expose other subs and their mods, they pay a lot of attention to us despite what they will publicly say, there is a reason they build entire subs dedicated to disrupting/steering/mocking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>I have no clue why you stay here and i have no clue why the mods are so automate about keep people here which isn&#39;t an option or they send people to dead networks like whoaverse. I&#39;m scared for people who still use r/conspiracy, it exceedingly looks like a CIA honeypot.</p>

<p>I try to facilitate a bit of internal resistance to some of the more nefarious practices within reddit inc.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see a viable alternative to reddit popup; but the issue is that reddit has not yet undergone it&#39;s version of digg v4, so alternatives are useless at the moment (for the most part). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Sorry to inform you that your account has been shadowbanned by the reddit admins.</p>

<p>I am not sure when this happened or what you did to draw their ire, but your only option at this point is to send a modmail to the admins at <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>.</p>
