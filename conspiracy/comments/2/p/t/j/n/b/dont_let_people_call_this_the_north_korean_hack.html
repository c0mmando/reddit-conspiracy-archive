       So far the only thing connecting North Korea to this Sony hack is that the FBI says so.

       <a href="http://marcrogers.org/2014/12/18/why-the-sony-hack-is-unlikely-to-be-the-work-of-north-korea/">
        This article makes several very strong points against the idea that NK is behind this hack
       </a>
       or that the hack has anything to do with The Interview in the first place.

          It’s clear from the hard-coded paths and passwords in the malware that whoever wrote it had extensive knowledge of Sony’s internal architecture and access to key passwords. While it’s plausible that an attacker could have built up this knowledge over time and then used it to make the malware, Occam’s razor suggests the simpler explanation of an insider. It also fits with the pure revenge tact that this started out as.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The attackers only latched onto “The Interview” after the media did – the film was never mentioned by GOP right at the start of their campaign. It was only after a few people started speculating in the media that this and the communication from DPRK “might be linked” that suddenly it became linked. I think the attackers both saw this as an opportunity for “lulz” and as a way to misdirect everyone into thinking it was a nation state. After all, if everyone believes it’s a nation state, then the criminal investigation will likely die.
         </p>

        Wired has just covered this exact point –

      <p>
       So I say next time you hear someone call this the NK hack you correct them. The US and the media are latching onto this and we should demand they show us the evidence before we start backing whatever crazy response they're going to plan for this.

       If they want to find out who hacked them find out who made money or gained advantage from it.  This is another big hack for them, they have to improve or it will happen again.  Changing to Macs and putting a password on the Wi-Fi wont cut it.

      <p>
       Occams razor doesn't really apply to this, an angry insider doing this isn't any more simple than a rogue hacking group owning Sony (which has happened multiple times). Their passwords and other sensitive information are leaked all the time, attackers could gain this information with mass-spishing attacks or through other means. It's also extremely likely the attackers were in SPE's networks for an extended period of time due to the volume of data they were able to extract.
      </p>
      <p>
       There evidence pointing to North Korea or someone from the very beginning making it look like North Korea, the attackers didn't suddenly start imitating North Korea when the interview shit hit the news. The malware was extremely similar to malware NK used in the past even using the same C&amp;C servers, and the attack had other similarities to NK and Russian attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I think it could be someone other than North Korea is because they'd have to be extremely stupid to not cover this up better.

       Even if the second part was real (that the event was planned as a reason to attack North Korea) the first part is ridiculous.

       A film like

       The difference with Argo is that they weren't making anything. They were only claiming to be scouting locations, and everyone was in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make the content we've seen in the trailers for
       <em>
        The Interview
       </em>
       would take a sizable crew (at least dozens, if not hundreds) - all who would realise that they weren't shooting a whole movie and all who would see the trailer for the film and all the publicity and know exactly what they'd been part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/fullcredits">
        IMDB page for the film
       </a>
       lists hundreds of cast and crew, all with credits on a huge range of other projects, all who would have to be in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, some people have seen it - it was already out with reviewers and some journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's really no question that a film was made.

       I think it's very plausible that NK, possibly with the assistance of China, pulled this off. Sony appears to have horrible IT security, layoffs and social engineering could possibly help.

      <p>
       Kim jung-un had also been struggling with power in the last few months.  What better way to establish your strength and superiority as a great leader then a successful attack like this. NK has been making threats and demands since the interview was announced. Not a long shot to say they started months ago on this.

       Yea I'm waiting to see their reaction. I'm not sure if it's smarter to Take credit or pretend it isn't them if they did it. If they didn't do it to you pretend you did?

       With such rules i would never let anyone talk about anything, people constantly push beliefs they haven't even started to verify.

       I didn't to "never let" anyone talk about this. I said not to let them frame it as an NK hack which is unproven. That's how this kind of propaganda works. It's not even questioned because everyone just calls it the NK hack.
