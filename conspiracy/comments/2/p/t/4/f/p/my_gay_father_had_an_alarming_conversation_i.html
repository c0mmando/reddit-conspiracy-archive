        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The late 90&#39;s was a very different time in regards to aids. The few hours of conversation I was lucky enough to have raised thought about the way it effected them. I have so much empathy for those who have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. There is such a bullshit stigma involved with it. Long story short. Apparently one of his close friends was a doctor at the time (of high status) and claimed that they had found an aids cure, this was around 2000. A week later, the doctor and his partner packed up and moved to basically never be heard from again along with a fat paycheck to keep his mouth closed. The more I think about it, the more alarming these thoughts get. It&#39;s hard to imagine a medical industry that lacks so much integrity. Any thoughts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>[T]he House of Rockefeller has had its own &quot;nominees&quot; planted in all Federal agencies that have to do with health.</strong> So the stage was set for the &quot;education&quot; of the American public, with a view to turning it into a population of drug and medico dependents, with the early help of the parents and the schools, then with direct advertising and, last but not least, the influence the advertising revenues had on the media-makers.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It was thus easy for the Rockefeller Trust to persuade the Associated Press Science Editor to adopt a policy which would not permit any medical news to clear that is not approved by the Drug Trust &quot;expert&quot;, and this censor is not going to approve any item that can in any way hurt the sale of drugs.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>To teach the Rockefeller drug ideology, it is necessary to teach that Nature didn&#39;t know what she was doing when she made the human body. But statistics issued by the Children&#39;s Bureau of the Federal Security Agency show that since the all-out drive of the Drug Trust for drugging, vaccinating and serumizing the human system, the health of the American nation has sharply declined, especially among children. Children are now given &quot;shots&quot; for this and &quot;shots&quot; for that, when the only safeguard known to science is a pure bloodstream, which can be obtained only with clean air and wholesome food. Meaning by natural and inexpensive means. Just what the Drug Trust most objects to.</p>

<p>When the FDA, whose officials have to be acceptable to Rockefeller Center before they are appointed, has to put an independent operator out of business, it goes all out to execute those orders. But the orders do not come directly from Standard Oil or a drug house director. As Morris Bealle pointed out, the <strong>American Medical Association (AMA) is the front for the Drug Trust</strong>, and furnishes the quack doctors to testify that even when they know nothing of the product involved, it is their considered opinion that it has no therapeutic value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that &quot;cure&quot; is completely fake, and relies on people not understanding chemistry, and using lots of technobabble. First of all, ions can&#39;t just fire electrons, and secondly, single electrons can&#39;t electrocute viruses and kill them. I also like how they claim it&#39;s not toxic, it just causes your liver to swell, and can often cause serious damage to it. </p>

<p>Method of curing AIDS with tetrasilver tetroxide molecular crystal devices </p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>The diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag.sub.4 O.sub.4) is utilized for destroying the AIDS virus, destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens and immunity suppressing moieties (ISM) in humans. A single intravenous injection of the devices is all that is required for efficacy at levels of about 40 PPM of human blood. The device molecular crystal contains two mono and two trivalent silver ions capable of &quot;firing&quot; electrons capable of electrocuting the AIDS virus, pathogens and ISM. When administered into the bloodstream, the device electrons will be triggered by pathogens, a proliferating virus and ISM, and when fired will simultaneously trigger a redox chelation mechanism resulting in divalent silver moieties which chelate and bind active sites of the entities destroying them. The devices are completely non-toxic. However, they put stress on the liver causing hepatomegaly, but there is no loss of liver function.</p>

<p>It has plenty of integrity. You assume medicine is a servant of the people. You have to know what the purpose of an entity is in order to determine integrity. </p>

<p>This hour long documentary explains the basic ideology: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMkt1Vq7tJ4">Who&#39;s Afraid Of Machiavelli</a> I can elaborate, but its fairly straight forward. That is a kickass doc btw.</p>

<p>Lead, various cancers, toxic chemicals/heavy metals, mercury, fluoride, fruit with trout DNA, and everything else makes us sick. They prescribe antibiotics for viral infections and SSRI&#39;s for fun.

In my mind, this is some Soylent Green cannibalism shit. I can&#39;t find the infamous FEMA biscuits online anymore. </p>

<p>Disease, infection, and media reports do an outstanding job of honing societies, economies, populations, etc. Why fix it?</p>
