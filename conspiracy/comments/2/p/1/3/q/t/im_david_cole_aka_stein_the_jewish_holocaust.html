       I’ve been called “powerful and dangerous” (by the Jerusalem Post), “the Antichrist” (by Phil Donahue), “Asscole” (by a member of Friends of Abe), “Asshat” (by Pamela Geller), “fucking Nazi” (by the head of the West L.A. GOP), “Nazi scum” (by the Jewish Defense League), “a nerd” (By Professor Debbie Lipstadt), and “clownish” (by Sir Robert Faurisson the Great). Only the latter two insults are accurate, although I do wear hats. Just not “ass-hats.” Here is my Twitter page for proof that I’m not the ghost of Irv Rubin or an Illuminati imposter:

       I don't like the term "Inside job".. It is loaded and can be interpreted differently (could be used to direct all or most blame to insiders in the US, making it easier to not talk about other people and groups countries like mossad ISI or even international cohorts.

       9/11 was a bunch of murderous Muslims. In the view of way too many conspiracy theorists, Muslims never kill anyone, and it's all Jews framing 'em. You believe that? Cool. Go to Iran or Yemen or Saudi Arabia and draw Mohammed in a public square. My condolences to your kin.

       Holy shit...I feel the same way.

      <p>
       What the fuck?  I really thought David Cole for a moment might have actually been someone that could be listened to....Then this shit?  Wow.  Like...
       <em>
        right out of the blocks

       the dude shows himself to be just as much a part of the problem.

       Damn.

      <p>
       Came here hoping to find some cool/interesting David Cole information...left here very disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I guess finding out that the dude is actually this much of a shill is very informative in itself, so...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Having read through pretty much all his responses, I will amend my previous vitriol a touch and say that Cole mentions that he is a Zionist, but feels that EVERYONE should have their own land.  That tempers me only a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       bit, however, because this doesn't do away with the fact that Zionist Jews in Israel are being amongst the worst types of racists around, and it needs to stop in no uncertain terms.

       In his book, he only briefly mentions the Zionism thing, and in one sentence says he doesn't have time for 9/11 conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy chooses his battles. He was a conspiracy theorist, almost was killed, and decided to never look back.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was partying in the 2000's with the Hollywood elite, not researching 9/11 conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's made his mark and now he's just living his life.
      </p>

       I wasn't disappointed by this AMA. For those that were, they need to really think about Cole's answers here and understand where he's coming from.

       Okay.  "Zionist" in itself means that it's a person who supports the existence of the state of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, it needs to be found out if any supporter of the existence of the state of Israel ALSO happens to support the genocidal acts that they have been responsible for perpetrating upon the Palestinian population.  One thing is not
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       equal to and the same as the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's a Zionist that happens to absolutely hate and abhor what Nettanyahu (or however tf you spell that motherfucker's name) is doing there and feels that it SHOULDN'T be happening, then I wouldn't say that that's a horrible thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you also have to wonder about what these types of Zionists think about exactly HOW Israel got formed in the first place.  What do they feel about the fact that Israel is illegal? and got formed through The Balfour Declaration, which was essentially a treaty that got England to basically
       <em>
        steal
       </em>
       the land from the Palestinians in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do Zionists feel about that?  If it's a Zionist that says "Look.  I feel that Jews SHOULD have their own land, but I think that it shouldn't be Israel because we got that land ILLEGALLY
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       on top of that, a lot of Jews there are fucking killing and torturing and being racists to the Palestinians, and I VERY much don't agree with that!" then hell...that's a Zionist that I could actually agree with and get behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       However - and this is a big ass "however" - how many Zionists have EVER actually felt this way or expressed any sentiments even
       <em>
        similar
       </em>
       to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       None, you say?  Yeah.  I say that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       All names and labels and categories aside, I think that anyone who agrees with and supports racism and violence and death and apartheid is...my enemy.  Flat out.  Simple as that.

       I knew this Jewish family many years ago, and they really were SUUUUPER nice.  I liked them very much.  One of the girls - who was the first person I met in the family and who I have INCREDIBLY good and positive memories of - took various trips to Israel and, presumably, supports her people and Israel itself quite a bit.  I haven't talked to them in MAAAANY years, and all of this was before I actually knew anything whatsoever about Zionist racism and apartheid, but all I remember of them is that they were really suuuuper nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if either the entire family (who was pretty well off, btw) - or at least the children in particular - didn't know much about Zionist apartheid either...but I also wonder if their point of view/perspective - especially on the issue of Israel and its existence - turned a blind eye to what is happening to the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       That WOULDN'T be good...and my point here is that, even a family as beautiful and wonderful and kind as that family seemed, if they were
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       kind, but they ALSO happened to support and agree with what Israel is doing to the Palestinians or conveniently turn a blind eye to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then
       <em>
        fuck them
       </em>
       .  That shit is unforgivable as far as I'm concerned, and even these people who I still think about as beautiful and nice...are my enemy as well.  That shit is just
       <em>
        not.  Right.
       </em>

      <p>
       It definitely is a loaded term, but I think it's loaded because - very similar to what I just explained above - although I'm sure there are some nice/good people who are Jews who also support the existence of Israel, I KNOW there are many Jews and Zionists who support all the horror that's being inflicted upon the Palestinians...and so long as anyone does THAT and supports
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , then I think they are part of the problem - whether they are a "nice" Zionist or not.  If they support Israel and what Israel is doing then they are in the wrong in my book.

       Fair enough, but it's just...odd to dedicate so much of your life to ONE aspect of heinous Zionist chicanery (holocaust lies), yet completely, actively ignore another area of it that is possibly even MORE damning still (direct Zionist involvement responsible for the 3K American murders on 9/11/01 and the millions of American and mid-east citizen deaths that have happened in the wars of aggression that have happened as a result since then).

      <p>
       Okay.  However, that was then.  That was a long time ago.  He's had quite a bit of time to come face to face with some of the shit that's going on and that Zionism seems very much responsible for.  I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       he's aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And...for that matter, if he wasn't researching 9/11 conspiracies in that time, I'd say it was because he was conveniently ignoring their factual existence - which you have to think that he definitely knew about, since he definitely is as aware as he is about the lies that Zionism tells regarding the holocaust.  He HAS to know and put two and two together.  He  HAS to be very aware of just how likely it is that the level of deceit responsible for the holocaust lies means that the Israeli involvement in 911 is very likely, as a result, absolutely true as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just ignore that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that he does is...not very good, and pretty damning, it seems to me.

       Fair enough.  I'm not trying to fault him for not undertaking some sort of one man mission to bring down Zionism, etc.  Of course not.  I'm just faulting him for being AS MUCH of an abject denier of what seems to be the truth of 911 chicanery as he seemed to be in the statement he gave above.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spent years of his life bravely fighting being labeled a holocaust "denier/revisionist", and for that I definitely commend him, but then he turns around and, in effect, becomes the very same type of denier where it regards what happened on 911 and who was really responsible for it.  WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's some pretty fucked up mental gymnastics on his part, if you ask me.

       i read all his comments and there wasn't anything interesting he wrote i mean he concluded that jews were killed and thats fine - its obvious though and said it wasn't 6 million jews killed it was 3 million. like that is really different its still a lot of of people being killed wether they were gassed or not its not a big deal tbh they were still killed. over the years of researc he slowly increased the figure from 150k to 1.1million to 2 million to 3 million and soon according to him it will be 6 million just as the mainstream historians wrote but they weren't gassed- so what - it just seems like a little disinformation, I don't know, further reading is needed I guess. Not much of a conspiracy here.

       Not everyone can be on top of every single topic. David specializes in Holocaust revisionism so just because his opinion differs from yours doesn't mean he's a shill, especially not a "Zioshill" since his revisionist work really doesn't make the official story for the creation of Israel look good.

       No way in hell am I giving a self admitted Zionist any of my money, let alone reading his book. I used to defend David against people saying he was a shill and now I find out that he is a Zionist AND he believes the official story of 9/11. Dude is just out to make money for himself, so pissed off at myself for defending this guy............ Here's a question for David: Why don't you go out and get a normal job like the rest of us? Do you think you can skate off your celebrity status for the rest of your life without having to work for a living? Maybe you'll just get back into politics and buddy up with whomever agrees to pay you.

       No, not everyone is a sellout. David's Holocaust revisionism was and is a huge eye opener for me but it is incredible that he is openly Zionist, and openly pro-Republican despite exposing the lies Zionists use as an excuse for the creation state of Israel (mainly the lie that 6 million Jews were killed, and that they were "gassed to death" in Auschwitz).

       OK, I understand your point and I am certainly far from perfect...but I also enjoy truth and would never sell out in order to monetarily gain by supporting Israel, Zionism, the Republican party (or Democratic party), or the official story of 9/11 (or any of the other numerous false flags). I'm no saint, but I won't beg you for donation money or try to sell you a book full of my bullshit. I will ask you "would you like your grass mowed" or "do you have any handyman projects around your house you'd like to pay me to do?" because that's the type of monetary gain stuff that I personally do.

       Uhh, being open and honest about how I make my living is more honest than believing contradictory things in order to maintain a pseudo-celebrity status. Also, if I had to, I would flip burgers at McDonalds or bag groceries at Walmart, I'm sure David Cole thinks he's too good for those things so he sells out by kissing ass to the Republican party, Zionism, and the official government stories of basically everything except some things about the Holocaust during WW2...and expects us to buy his book and keep supporting him. Nope nope nope, I have way more integrity than to support someone like him and yes, I am a better person than him. You are of course entitled to think whatever you want about me or him.

Everyone can do what they want to do and you have no right to think you're better because you're not smart enough or interesting enough to write books for a living, or you think writing books is somehow dishonest, or is it just selling the books is dishonest?

       Oh sorry can I just ask one last question. I always like to ask this to the anti-Zionists (I don't have a dog in the fight, personally.) Assuming you're an American, do you have any plans to give up your home to a Native American tribe? If not, why do you feel you can judge Israelis for their colonialism/ ethnic cleansing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: As an aside, don't you love that term "ethnic cleansing" it's such a nicer way of saying genocide. Like oh, I feel so fresh and so clean.

       Israelis wouldn't have to give up their home nor would Indians have to take way my home, we could simply live amongst each other in peace. The only reason "we" are fighting amongst each other in those two examples is because of things the governments do/did. No government=freedom. Jews were living in Palestine just fine before the creation of Israel....some Jews saw they could get "free" land if they supported a government that would steal it from Palestine.

       That's a cop out. You're talking hypothetical ideal Utopian K-PAX with Kevin Spacey. I'm talking real life. Here in the real world, where you reap benefits from a corrupt government what give you the right to criticize others for doing the same? How do you expect anyone to live in peace when you point your finger and judge them for doing the same things you do, only when they do it it's bad because they're slightly different from you and when you do it it's good but when the other does it it's bad. See this is the real problem. It's not Governments. Governments are just people. People are the problem. Human nature.

       Yeah I don't know what the hell is going on in this AMA. I think David thought he could get more buyers for his book but so far he turned me, a hardcore fan of his, into a huge skeptic of him in just two of his posts. (The one about his stance on 9/11, and the one where he openly admits to being a Zionist).

       I first found out about you through a youtube video of you on Phil Donahue. I had turned it on to get a cheap laugh at some dumb neo-nazi holocaust denier. I came away with a whole new take on history. It really bums me out to see you being so dismissive of others who seek the truth. 9/11 was an obvious false flag attack. Much more obvious than your holocaust revisionism. I mean, fucking PNAC for Gods sake! They came right out and announced to the whole world exactly what they were gonna do!

       If you want a fellow Republican's opinion, Paul Craig Roberts has plenty of great articles on the subject avalable on his website.

       Of course we can't leave out the PNAC document itself, Rebuilding America's Defenses, with it's plans for American military dominance of Earth and Space, biological weapons to target specific genotypes, and it's statement of the necessity of a "NEW PEARL HARBOR" to galvanize Americans for a rapid, radical transformation of their nation into "tomorrow's dominant force."

        9/11 was a bunch of murderous Muslims. In the view of way too many conspiracy theorists, Muslims never kill anyone, and it's all Jews framing 'em. You believe that?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I don't believe that.  However, it is pretty insulting for you to be painting with such a broad brush.  For someone who has faced down religious extremism, I would hope that you had realized that individuals make their own decisions; not groups.

        Cool. Go to Iran or Yemen or Saudi Arabia and draw Mohammed in a public square. My condolences to your kin.

      <p>
       So what you are proposing is that you go and do something that is offensive to people and expect them not to react?  I have, in fact, actually been to Pakistan and, I have to tell you, they were the nicest people I have met.

       "Muslims" are not the enemy in the same way that "Jews" are not the enemy.

       this was potentially a serious question, it's quite unclear to most (including me) who really owns it. My understanding is that banks have shares in it, but who has what percentage? You probably don't know either though.

       You were targeted by the far right Jewish terrorist organization, the JDL, for assassination from what  I understand. Could you expand a bit on what happened there and the steps you have taken to protect yourself from such extremists?

       When the JDL leadership died in prison (2002 - through - 2005), the threat pretty much dissipated. I could have reemerged then, but I was too happy with my life as "Stein." Honestly, these days, the hate emails and calls I get are all from former GOP colleagues. To my knowledge, the JDL is a dead entity.

       What's your current take on the ADL?  How broad, and deep, is their reach with regards to US politics?

       Also, if you've been targeted by them who is spearheading the effort?

       Look, I try to provide evidence for everything I claim. I never ask anyone to take my word for anything. The fact that my foe from the '90s, Dr. Michael Shermer, was recorded saying I'm probably right, and admitting that he lied about my work, ought to mean something to you, right? I mean, HE has credentials galore, right? Me? I just try to present evidence and let folks make up their own mind.

       Regarding credentials, I am not a Ph.D. Rather, I had the good fortune to be on the scene during the second Zundel Trial, the death of IHR co-founder David McCalden (whose books and files I inherited), the pre-Schindler's List phase of the Auschwitz State Museum (when the staff was more honest and less interested in tourism), and the Pressac Report (I was able to meet with Pressac in France and review his papers). I was the right guy at the right time. I found my "peer review" by doing talk shows. I write at length in my book about how I manipulated my Donahue Show appearance in order to get my work reviewed by the top names in the field. Short answer, my experience has been practical, not academic.

       All a PhD means is that you have the propensity to stay up late and still get to work on time.  No one magically comes out of college unable to stub their toes, they do however find themselves in a mysteriously large amount of debt.

       No, a PhD demonstrates that someone is willing to make a significant commitment.  18 years of grammar school, 4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of masters and another 4 years of PhD...30 years of education.  If someone gets through all of that with a degree, it demonstrates their commitment and dedication to learning a subject matter, their seriousness.  Sure anybody can get OJT, but it's not the same thing

       It was a civilian internment camp, a forced labor camp. An affront to humanity, yes, but not an extermination camp. Many deaths did happen there, especially during the typhus outbreak of 1942. No child should be sent to a labor camp, ever. Having said that, the story that the kremas built in '43 were gas chambers is a myth and fairly easily debunked.

       Moreover, it's not practical to exterminate people with louse disinfestant (hydrogen cyanide) as alleged (dumped through holes in the ceiling and swept out the door), a more practical method would have been to use the same apparatus used in delousing chambers to dissipate the gas.

       The second Krakow test intentionally decided not to test for iron-cyanide compounds, despite iron being in brickwork, and the alleged "gas chamber" structures being made essentially of brick. If you don't look for the long-lasting, stable iron-cyanide compounds, then the measurements are obviously lower, and the delousing chamber will have the same trace levels of cyanide residue as the "gas chamber". Exterminationists use this to say there therefore must've been "gassings" in both structures... but, as I say, to get the results necessary to make this argument, you have to decide
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to test for iron-cyanide compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another argument is that because humans are more sensitive to cyanide gas than lice, and because in these conditions its very difficult (in reality, not) to form Prussian Blue (iron-cyanide), that the gas chambers somehow didn't get enough exposure to hydro-cyanide gas for
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       to form there, and that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       explains the results of Rudolf, Leuchter, and the first Krakow test:
       <em>
        "see? Gassings took place here, but so little gas was used that it didn't stain the walls with Prussian Blue, like it did in the delousing rooms."
       </em>

       Germar Rudolf, was a chemist at the prestigious Max Planck Insitute when his research was released. His Ph.D thesis, which was approved by 170 academics, was about ferro-cyanide compounds in brickwork and masonry. He was imprisoned in Germany for doing the tests on the gas chamber walls and writing about it.

       I've already pointed out the issues with the claimed "first Krakow report" (the issue being it's not actually real). Also, Rudolf makes the same error as Leuchter, only he should have known better, while Leuchter has the excuse of having no clue what he's doing.

       It's that neither report is actually good, since both rely on the exact same flaw. To be fair, Rudolf at least tried to fix up the other issues aside from the glaring issue of only looking for Prussian Blue, which Leuchter has absolutely no clue what he was doing.

        He argues that it would've been too difficult for Prussian Blue to form in the "gas chambers" because they "weren't exposed to enough gas". But there are documented cases where Prussian Blue has formed after a single fumigation.

       All he's doing is attempting to regurgitate the arguments of Green and Mathis. There's a great thread at CODOH where Mathis ('aemathisphd') turns up, makes a couple of okay points, but then quickly humiliates himself [and accidentally points out that Green confuses water and sulphuric acid!], before fleeing:

      <p>
       The post-Pressac pseudoscientific buffoonery is just a desperate rear-guard action by the defenders of the Hoax. The problem is this: due to the arguments for why there's no Prussian Blue in the gas chambers being of a more technical nature, they're slightly more difficult to expose than the more obvious historiographical, logistical and structural problems (etc), and so people like PersonMcName can attempt to trick others into thinking they have a credible scientific refutation, as in that first link, and that all of the tests (except the second Krakow test) must've been wrong. It's a strategy which likely prevents many non-technically-minded believers from losing their faith: "oh, see, SCIENCE WORDS confirm that revisionists are wrong!"
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit: If you look at my conversations with him, you'll see how he simply ignores my requests that he substantiate his position by quantitatively defining the variables, and thus the minimum exposure level, for Prussian Blue to form in brickwork. It's all just
       <em>
        "well, there wasn't enough cyanide gas used, um, because."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Elsewhere I've explained how Pressac (an Exterminationist) estimates 5-7kg of Z-B per gassing because (1) Z-B out-gasses slowly, over 2hrs, much longer in cold weather, and (2) the witnesses all say the victims died within a few minutes, i.e. very early in the Z-B out-gassing cycle. So, it turns out that the first technical study of the gassings by an Exterminationist -- almost 50 years after the events -- shows that a lot of Z-B would've been necessary, not merely the amount to achieve the LD100 for humans after the complete gassing cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, of course, raises the problem that when the SK enter the gas chamber, the Z-B is still releasing its gas, and would continue to do so for at least another 1.5hrs. To get around this, Pressac simply invents a mechanism by which the Z-B is removed from the chamber after everyone is dead, despite no evidence of such a mechanism, and no witness or historian mentioning one before him.

       The anti-revisionist laws in many countries are foul and stupid. They exist as part of a larger picture of political correctness that also outlaws "Islamophobia," "homophobia," "racism," etc. Thankfully, here in the U.S. the First Amendment has held firm in the face of attempts to limit political speech. Other nations are not so fortunate.

       PC nonsense is born from the desire of people of all races, ethnicity, gender, religion, etc., to play the role of victim. "Oh, poor us! We need protection!" It's a cancerous way of thinking. Fighting it is one of the most important things a conscientious person can do.

       Interesting way of looking at it....I often looked at it from another way, e.g if the Elite want to bring in loads of cheap workers from one country to another to save themselves money on wages, they need to ensure that these cheap workers will actually be accepted and employed by the people whose country they have arrived in, if the British people are discriminating against cheap Polish workers then it makes it difficult for the Elite to save money.

       Thats not true. PC helps fight against polarization of a society, the polarization which allows differing sides to get away with accepting mindless ideologies about others. PC allows for sensible discussion between differing groups without cutting out progression as opposed to a virulent even violent stalemate.

       Do you realize that your 2.5 million dead Jews number becomes quite questionable when you say you're a Zionist and you actually think Muslims did 9/11 despite the evidence?
      </p>

       All this tells me is not to believe anything you say, and to lean toward the accepted number of (maybe) a couple hundred thousand dead from Typhus.

       2.How did the actual holocaust happen in your view? How much of the "official" story are just lies from eye witnesses and how much of it is true?

       3.Outside of you books where is your main source of income? It would seem exceptionally difficult to get a job given your reputation, or are there decent people out there that gives jobs to people despite others defaming them?

       We have direct reports of the mass-shootings of Jews, and other situations (Treblinka, as an example) in which gassing is the most likely cause of death. Sometimes, there are elements in history where "most likely" is what we have to settle for. Folks still debate how Stonehenge was built. But the continued debate doesn't negate the reality of Stonehenge. As the Coen Brothers wrote in "A Serious Man," "accept the mystery."

       there is no "Most likely" in Triblinka, and unless you can refute the evidence in these fact driven documentaries I suggest you speak more honestly in stead of misleading and confusing those who are truly interested in Holocaust truth. That truth being that there was no planned extermination of the Jews.

       It's a shame that reddit is the way it is, and that Cole has been put forward as an example of a legitimate "revisionist". I mean, Cole has never published anything and makes it quite clear that he doesn't use the word "citation" very often.

       But I would disagree that re-examining history adds nothing constructive to the world we live in today. Deep down, the mythology of WWII really does form the foundation of the contemporary Western propaganda matrix.

       Your problem may be that you grew up in the Jewish mentality, which is genocidal. Germans, however, did not, and were never genocidal. Germans would not do such a thing; only Jews would, based on history (Armenian genocide for one). Since you ascribe to the genocidal Jewish mentality, you project this onto others. It's called psychological projection. But you cannot project Jewish mentality onto Gentiles; this is a mistake.

       No kidding! That's the root of most of the world's problems. People think that the enemy also thinks like them. They can't fathom how warped and twisted the "mind" of the enemy has always been. Look at what they've done, for heaven's sake!

       yes the Paris cemetery comparison is neat, but honestly, the 4 hour video above and an a more recent work debunking a really ridiculous made for TV archeological dig are worth the time. The work done on these sites is no less substantial than your earlier work. And clearly no one has the time to refute a claim in this forum, I am merely suggesting that "Most likely' does not hold water, for the same sort of off handed generality could be made when one explains the later added chimney or whole in the roof at Auschwitz.

       I'm legitimately surprised at how certain users who
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be supporting him seem to be throwing David under the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude was almost killed for his research so he vowed to give it up forever. This was before 9/11 even happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be fucking fed up with all this bullshit too if someone literally put a bounty on my head. I wouldn't even look back.
      </p>
      <p>
       He openly admits he hasn't even
       <em>
        looked
       </em>
       into the 9/11 conspiracy. It's not on his radar. He's no longer a "truth" warrior like so many armchair warriors on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's picked his battles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with his views on 9/11 and Zionism, but I still
       <em>
        respect
       </em>
       the man and his opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not shoving his Zionism in peoples faces. He was simply being honest and answering questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I warned him that his beliefs on conspiracy theories would not be popular her. He knew what he was getting into...and he was true to his convictions, and I commend him for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm surprised at the amount of people who claim to have followed Cole for years who are "shocked" at his "revelations" that he's been open about for a long, long time.

       Early reports state that victims at Treblinka were electrocuted and steamed to death like lobsters. The latest theory is that the Evil Nazys decided to use the most inefficient method of killing available: carbon monoxide from a diesel engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 700-900k bodies were then buried in enormous mass graves (which would've had to have been many times larger than witnesses describe), dug up some time later, and the damp bodies stacked 20-30 high, in rows on top of rail tracks, and burned in the open air, year round, with no wind shield, and 70cm of room for wood fuel beneath. The piled up bodies allegedly burnt down to ash and skeleton. The bones and teeth were totally crushed and with the ashes were scattered, and disappeared without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite being the "end of the line", numerous survivors report being transited through Treblinka.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: My only hope is that I can one day get as drunk as David Cole so that I too may believe this.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit: Pretty much all other revisionist researchers agree that Treblinka-2 was a transit camp:

       A very good documentary on Treblinka is

       All these resources used to feed, clothe (striped pajamas), catalogue, and delouse people explicitly marked for death, not to mention the ineffective and very wasteful Dr.Evil-type method of extermination.  All this while germans were abandoning tanks (which they couldnt even blow up due to lack of explosives) and dropping like flies from starvation and lack of medicines/medical attention while retreating from the Eastern front.  In the cities and towns, German civilians were dying by the thousands from typhus and famine, yet we're supposed to believe this Zionist's tale?

       All of this is a moot point because the holocaust story has very little credibility to begin with. From the very early 1900s to 1939, the holocaust story has been told from all over Europe and Russia in Western media. They initially wanted to use the Russians as a way of making war by pushing holocaust tales from the Russian backlash. It didn't catch on. It's been repeated as fact for decades and only caught on when Hitler started deporting them.

       The Korherr Report (Himmler's statistician) puts the number of murdered Jews at a little under 2.5 million by early 1943. Deniers can't account for those Jews. It's because they were indeed dead. Add to Korherr's figure the Jews who died after the extermination camps were closed in '43, and you'll get a ROUGH figure of 3 million. It's a Holocaust, no doubt. But not 6 million.

       I don't know if I buy that explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why lie about an additional 3 million deaths when 3 million deaths is in itself quite horrific?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard from many other revisionists that the number of Jewish deaths was likely a whole order of magnitude less than has been historically reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding this tremedous lie makes much more sense to me than simply exaggerating an already incredible number of deaths.

       There's a Talmudic phrase interpreted to mean that 6 million must be lost before jews can reestablish the holy land.  There are two news reports prior to ww2 (you can find images of the newspaper reports online, im not finding them again) where the number 6 million was also used and some people think this is evidence of Zionists trying to force the number into consciousness in order to be closer to fulfilling prophecy, which was successfully done in ww2.  I want to make clear I'm not convinced either way, its a little fishy though.  Also fishy that revisionist talk is outlawed in some countries.

       Newspapers were printed saying 6 million Jews died in Russia and others that 6 million surviving Jews would need X money to rebuild.  Also once a Jewish friend told me that some people that he knows believe that only 6 million Jews will be left in some sort of end time.

        It's a Holocaust, no doubt. But not 6 million.

       <p>
        c.1250, "sacrifice by fire, burnt offering," from Gk. holokauston, neut. of holokaustos "burned whole," from holos "whole" + kaustos, verbal adj. of kaiein "to burn." Originally a Bible word for "burnt offerings," given wider sense of "massacre, destruction of a large number of persons" from 1833. The Holocaust "Nazi genocide of European Jews in World War II," first recorded 1957, earlier known in Heb. as Shoah "catastrophe." The word itself was used in Eng. in ref. to Hitler's Jewish policies from 1942, but not as a proper name for them.

       But at least there's some freedom of religion. For example, the Hare Krishna can dance and try to convert others on the beach in Tel Aviv. Oh and there's no religion/modesty police. You don't go to prison or worse for things like adultery.

      <p>
       This whole thing reminds me of a story a wise old man told me long ago.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         There was an old man and his wife, they had lived together for many years
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The old man was growing frustrated with his wife because she had become very hard of hearing, and no matter what the old man did or said he couldn't convince his wife that she needed to have her ears checked.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         One day the old man devised a plan to prove once and for all to his wife that she needed to go have her hearing examined, so the old man sneaked up behind his wife while she was washing dishes, He stood about 10 feet behind her and said "Can you hear me?" in a bold voice.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         His wife said nothing in return so he crept up a few feet closer and repeated himself "CAN YOU HEAR ME?", again she didn't reply so he got even closer to her "CAN YOU HEAR ME!"..
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         When his wife failed to reply this last time the old man walked right up to her ear, leaned in close and said "CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?"
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         His wife spun around with an angry look on her face and said "For the fourth time! I CAN FUCKING HEAR YOU JUST FINE!"
        </strong>

       The problem I have is that there is no difference between 3million and 6 million its still a massive figure and if true its still genocide. it seems there is not much of a conspiracy if all the difference was the jews weren't gassed or used for soap they were still killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       in David'd earlier work he highlighted that the concentration camps were used as much for detaining christians, and general opposition to the third reich and not predominantly for jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       after years of further research perhaps? David came to the conclusion that it was a holocaust and there were actually slightly less than 6 million killed. wether its 1 million 3million of 6 million its still a huge number.
      </p>
      <p>
       overall there is not much of a conspiracy here as i thought it would be if the facts are what David said.

      <p>
       All his other opinions I have no interest in knowing since he is blind as a bat when it comes to geopolitics. A disappointing AMA in my opinion.

       6,000,000 minus 3,000,000 equals 3,000,000, but don't take my word for it because I'm not a mathematician.  The difference is 3 million.

       Yes IMO it is no different although in the US's case the soldiers and the citizens thought they were liberating iraq but the CFR/builderberg/illuminati/bush/rockerfellar/rothschild/mossad whoever decision it was to invade instead wanted to divide, destabilise, kill and profit (Haliburton, Carlisle group). it was planned many years ago. I urge you to watch this he was killed later

       I know you are speaking what you believe from your current analysis of historical events are true and that the germans were trying to be evil etc but actually you must be objective and use common sense. What would be so overtly evil achieve? i would recommend you see another side of the story such as this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       while I wouldn't trust this completely but reading so many different articles and journals i found that the background of events which lead to WW1 WW2 and the zionism and the state of israel is pretty clear and i would disagree completely with your statement regarding germany just from the evidence alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go on to say that I would put more trust in every country's historical accounts than the british and american versions.

       You write that "you can't prove that Jews weren't killed at Auschwitz in 1944."  Are you at all persuaded by the claims--made prior to his recent indictment for war crimes--of Oskar Groening, an SS officer stationed at Auschwitz, who affirmed the essentials of the traditional Auschwitz death camp account, including exterminations in excess of one million.

       Post-war testimony is an unreliable basis for historical research, especially 70 years later. Both the former inmates and the former guards were tainted in their testimony. Science, on the other hand, doesn't lie. No blue stains in the krema walls? Floor-level air extraction vents that would have been blocked by the bodies? These are more important than the recollections of a scared old man.

       Winterd - "if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue." That's exactly the problem. The "experts" have not explained the different "conditions" to account for why there's blue in the delousing rooms, but not in the kremas. Whenever they try to explain, the explanation falls apart.

       In 1990 a forensic analysis was performed at Birkenau using microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from (suspected) extermination chambers, delousing chambers, and a control group. The control group tested negative while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal gas chambers. This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.

       It's most likely because they either never saw it (again, two sites, and not even major ones at that), or just do not care, as it's so obviously sketchy it's not even funny, and they have given literally no proof that it's real aside from telling us that "we totally got this from an insider source who we can't talk about and who is super real, we swear".

       Well, it's been presented to the public -- what more do you want? Pages of figures in columns

       generally get reproduced in historical journals.

       This is one of the most heated, and active debates within this area of history. It's been going on for over 20 years. Neither the Krakow instiute, nor any pro-Holocaust participants in the debate (e.g. Green) have denied or questioned the leaked report.

       Clearly not, since literally no-one but those two sites even acknowledge it existing, and both of them give the exact same amount of proof (none).

       It's a science journal. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but those pages of figures are kinda one of the most important parts of the entire report.

        This is one of the most heated, and active debates within this area of history. The simply fact that the Krakow Instiute, nor any of the pro-Holocaust participants in the debate (e.g. Green) have not denied or questioned it, is fairly conclusive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not really, since again, it's so hidden away that even many holocaust deniers are unaware of the claim. Also, the Krakow institute has no way of searching every single site ever created, looking for what people say they did, and then writing a response to all of them. That's just a waste of everyone's time.

       How many documents have been created regarding this? The answer is probably a fairly large number, and since again, the only source for this is from an IHR journal, which I'm going to guess is not where they would have published it if they even did write it in the first place (hint: they didn't)

       It's a science paper, it doesn't matter what journal it's in (and as a side note: you'd be hard pressed to even be able to consider anything by the IHR a "journal"). If you read it, you'd see that there is apparently data, but it's just never written up (which just makes the legitimacy even more suspicious than it already was)

       Firstly, the footnote also links the the IHR, which is telling. Secondly, even after following the link, I'm still finding the identical lack of evidence, or even the study in the first place. It's still a secondhand claim, and this time there isn't even a source given.

       It's not an opinion, there is literally no evidence it's real. In fact, we have evidence it's fake, since there is still no original source, and there isn't even a data or in depth results page that is pretty much a requirement for all scientific papers.

       Like I say, it's irrelevant. Exterminationists like Green, Mathis, and Pressac acknowledge that you won't find iron-cyanide compounds in the "gas chambers" -- as the Leuchter, Rudolf and the test in question show.

       I have shown that Prussian Blue can form easily, whereas you have continuously argued, a priori, that it is

       for it to form.

       The test you cite is a worthless anti-scientific sham, which specifically excluded water-insoluble compounds, thus guaranteeing that the levels for the delousing chamber and the "gas chamber" would be the same. This is indefensible.

       First of all, I find it hilarious that you're claiming the Krakow test was an anti-scientific sham, when that's pretty much the accepted definition of both the Rudolf and Leutchter reports. Secondly, please explain to me why the levels being the same with regards to the cyanide residue would  somehow prove that there was no gas used in the chambers, and how excluding iron-cyanide compounds guarantees similar levels, because it just sounds like you pulled that out of your ass.

       We're talking about the second Krakow test, which you claim proves gassing. This is done by looking at the trace levels of soluble (i.e. short term) compounds in the delousing chamber and the "gas chamber", noticing they are roughly the same, and deducing "aha, so the gas chambers were
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       exposed to cyanide."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, measuring soluble compounds clearly won't tell you anything about what the walls were exposed to 50 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only an idiot or a liar would claim the second Krakow test was in any way scientifically valid.

       The water-soluble compounds are there too, and all you have to do is test both the delousing and gas chambers to see similarly elevated levels compared to everywhere else, and then use the data from the delousing and gas chambers to find out how much there originally was.

       I'll explain this real simply.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We can all agree that cyanide was used in the delousing chambers
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We test both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers for residual cyanide.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We then compare the numbers to other areas in the camp that were not used as gas chambers.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's exactly what the Karkow institue did, and they found that in both the delousing and gas chambers there was a much higher level than anywhere else, and so it's safe to conclude that cyanide was used. We don't need to know the exact ppm that existed 50 years ago, we just need to definitively know whether or not large amounts of cyanide were used in the chamber.

      <p>
       And in both case studies, they left if for a long time. The rate of formation of Prussian Blue is around 30 hours at minimum. Fumigations of that size can easily last that long, and they used somewhat high levels on top of this. And before you point out the levels in the gas chambers, remembers that a) it took far less time, and b) the delousing chambers would have had an proportionally larger level too, which is why it would have formed there but not the gas chambers.

       <p>
        the [second] Polish study (Markiewicz et. al.) aspired to
        <strong>
         measure only the water-soluble cyanide components
        </strong>
        , i.e. those components that might be presumed to no longer exist, because soluble cyanide compounds are notoriously unstable and decompose under the influence of air humidity with a
        <strong>
         half-life of mere days
        </strong>
        and thus cannot be expected to have survived five decades of exposure to the elements. Hence,
        <strong>
         whatever can be measured
        </strong>
        with such a method, it certainly
        <strong>
         cannot conceivably appertain to soluble cyanide compounds deposited 50 years earlier
        </strong>
        , no matter how reproducible the results.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
        <strong>
         Excluding insoluble iron cyanides
        </strong>
        from the analysis, as the Polish study did,
        <strong>
         means excluding the majority of detectable cyanide components
        </strong>
        , which is hardly a valid approach.

       Firstly, Prussian Blue can still weather away. Secondly, we can still test for traces of cyanide and use that in comparison with other areas to definitively test the amount of hydrogen. Since Prussian Blue, again, is very slow to form.

       I have. They just serve to cement my points. In all of them all you do is refuse to admit that Prussian Blue is an unfavourable reaction, you cling to the assumption that Rudolf would never lie, and you do not actually understand any of the chemistry behind the issue, since even when I tell you word for word the answer to your questions, you just ignore it.

       And in both those examples, there was somewhat high concentration, and it took  a while. Fumigations take a long time to do, so to have a single fumigation create the residue would not be surprising.

       So what? This proves
       <em>

       about the amount of exposure to HCN necessary for PB to form. Clearly it formed in the delousing chamber - so how precisely were the conditions different?

       IIRC is already gave you all the data needed to solve it, from the rate of reaction, the exact steps with balanced reactions, and everything. All that's left is just a lot of stochiometry, which I would assume you are more than capable of. The fact that you refuse to do the calculations despite me giving you all the info strikes me as lazy.

       Because it takes more gas and more time to kill lice than humans, since lice are more resistant to cyanide. Because of this, it's more likely for the formation of Prussian blue to form, since it's not a particularly favourable reaction.

       Look of the reaction for the formation of Prussian Blue from Cyanide. For example
      </p>
      <pre><code>     Fe+2  + CN-1 ---&gt;  FeCN+1

     FeCN+1  + CN-1 ----&gt;  Fe(CN)2

     Fe(CN)2  + CN-1  ---&gt;    [Fe(CN)3]-1

     [Fe(CN)3]-1  +  CN-1  -----&gt;   [Fe(CN)4]-2

     [Fe(CN)4]-2 +  CN-1  -----&gt;   [Fe(CN)5]-3 

     [Fe(CN)5]-3  +   CN-1  -----&gt;  [Fe(CN)6]-4
</code></pre>
      <p>
       This is just the reaction the form the water soluble compound that has the potential to combine with more iron to form Prussian Blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3). It's a very unfavourable reaction, and to have it form requires either more heat, concentration, time or the use of a catalyst. It turns out that in the delousing chambers, two of those were used (concentration and time).

       Lol. All you did there is break it up into minute steps, to intentionally try and make it look like a more "unfavorable" process than it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're so expert, tell me then, what is the approximate threshold for the formation of Prussian Blue? (Or, if you prefer to answer it another way -- how much Hydrogen Cyanide were the delousing chambers exposed to, and how much the "gas chambers"?)

       According to "Directives for the Use of Prussic Acid (Zyklon) for the Destruction of Vermin (Disinfestation)," NI-9912 as cited in Jean-Claude Pressac, Auschwitz: Technique and operation of the gas chambers, the walls in the delousing chambers may have been exposed to HCN for over 20 hours at a time at levels up to 16,000 ppm.

       Well, this doesn't have anything to do with defining the minimum amount of cyanide gas exposure necessary for Prussian Blue to form in brickwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway. I'm glad you mentioned Pressac.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Pressac, because of the time it takes for the Zyklon-B to out-gas (over 2hrs, longer in colder weather), and because people were said to have died very quickly, roughly 5-7kg of Z-B would have been used per gassing -- many times more than is necessary to achieve 300ppm over its release cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, witnesses said everyone died quickly (wildly varying reports, but some as short as "a few minutes") and that SK entered to clear the "chamber" either immediately or after a short time.
       <strong>
        Therefore the Z-B is still out-gassing when they enter.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       To get around this problem, and the problem of the high amount of Z-B used -- thus maintaining the defensive argument that
       <em>
        "welp, I guess the gas chambers just weren't exposed to enough cyanide gas!"
       </em>
       (lol), according to Pressac, the Z-B was then
       <em>
        removed
       </em>
       , a short time into its out-gassing cycle (!) -- which none of the "witnesses" or historians ever mention, even once. No evidence of a removal device exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Pressac is inventing history, without evidence, to counter the arguments of the skeptics. This desperate rear-guard action is typical of Holohoax fraudsters.

       Green is right though. The conditions in the delousing and gas chambers were different, and it shows in the diffent amount of Prussian blue buildup. In the reaction I listed, it's clear that the limiting reagent is Cyanide, which explains why adding more cyanide would give you an actually completed reaction.

       No, he didn't. He quoted the lethal dose for humans. Pressac points out that due to the long release cycle of Z-B, and because witnesses claim that everyone was dead within minutes, many times more than the amount necessary to reach 300ppm would have to have been used. He suggests 5-7kg of Z-B "crystals" per gassing. (There's also the problem that the Z-B would still be out-gassing while the SK were removing the bodies!)

       Yes, but that doesn't prove Green's assertion about there being "not enough" cyanide gas exposure for ANY iron-oxide compounds to form. Obviously the conditions were

       Here's a much better quote, from Pressac - on your "side", in case you don't know who he is -- when he came to realize that the forensic side of things couldn't be reconciled with the testimony which forms the basis of the official historiography:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Michel de Boüard, former "Nacht und Nebel" at Mauthausen, considered that
        <strong>
         "the dossier [on the concentration camp system] is rotten"
        </strong>
        . On the one hand, resentment and vendetta prevailed over conciliation. Then memory over history.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand,
        <strong>
         the communists' grip on the main organs of command in the camps
        </strong>
        , the setting up after the liberation of associations under their control and the establishment for fifty years of a "peoples' democratic" history of the camps have
        <strong>
         introduced the virus of antifascist cant
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Approximation, exaggeration, omission and lying characterise the majority of the accounts of that period.
        </strong>
        The unanimous and irrevocable discredit in which the communist writings are held can only rub off on a concentration camp experience tainted by their ideas and annihilate it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Boyard's comment, referenced by Pressac, was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I found myself torn between my conscience as a historian and the duties it implies, and on the other hand, my membership in a group of comrades whom I deeply love, but who refuse to recognize the necessity of
        <strong>
         dealing with the deportation as a historical fact in accordance with sound historical methods
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
        <strong>
         The record is rotten to the core
        </strong>
        . On one hand a considerable amount of
        <strong>
         fantasies, inaccuracies
        </strong>
        , obstinately repeated (in particular concerning numbers), heterogeneous mixtures, generalizations
        <strong>
         and, on the other hand, very close critical studies that demonstrate the inanity of those exaggerations
        </strong>
        . [i.e. very close critical studies = revisionist analyses.]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Boyard was a former inmate at Mauthausen, honorary dean of the Faculty of Letters at the University of Caen, member of the Committee for the History of the Second World War, member of the Institut de France. He made those comments after stepping down as president of the Calvados (Normandy) Association of Deportees in 1985.

       I never claimed that just because there were a lot of steps that the reaction is impossible. That's just stupid. What I said, was that considering Cyanide is the limiting reagent, the fact that among those reactions are quite a few unfavourable and slow reactions, and that because of these it takes either a much larger amount of time to form, if it even has the time to complete all the different steps.

       Since you've taken chemistry apparently, it should be no problem. Just account for the volume of the chamber, the concentration of cyanide added, the reaction rate for all the steps listed (and accounting for both the rate limiting step and the limiting reagent). And then calculate based on how long each gassing was, how much of the reaction would have formed. The number you'll get will be extremely small, if it even manages to form at all given the time constraints.

      <p>
       It does actually. In all of these cases, cyanide is the limiting reagent, which means that when it runs out, no matter how much of the other compounds there are, you can't form more. This is important, because it means that there was nowhere near enough to complete the reaction, especially considering the timeframe, and glacial reaction rate.

        <strong>

        It took chemical analyses of the plaster to determine the causes of this blue discoloration. These analyses confirmed the initial suspicion that the substance known as Berlin Blue had formed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chemically speaking, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a very weak acid. It is bound by damp, highly alkaline brickwork through neutralization. This produces calcium cyanide (Ca(CN)2), for example:
       </p>
       <p>
        2 HCN + Ca(OH)2 Þ Ca(CN)2 + 2 H2O
       </p>
       <p>
        The cyanide ion is a highly reactive ion, which joins with metals to form very stable complex salts. The best-known complex salts are the yellow and red iron cyanides. These compounds form when iron ions combine with cyanide: with the iron(II) ion, the yellow ferrocyanide forms, and with the iron(III) ion, the red ferricyanide is produced:
       </p>
       <p>
        6 CN- + Fe2+ Þ [Fe(CN)6]4-
       </p>
       <p>
        6 CN- + Fe3+ Þ [Fe(CN)6]3-
       </p>
       <p>
        In the presence of excess iron(II) or iron(III) ions, the yellow or red iron cyanide then reacts to form blue compounds which are described in the literature as Berlin Blue and Turnbull's Blue, respectively:
       </p>
       <p>
        [Fe(CN)6]4- + Fe3+ Þ [FeIIFeIII(CN)6]-
       </p>
       <p>
        [Fe(CN)6]3- + Fe2+ Þ [FeIIIFeII(CN)6]-
       </p>
       <p>
        The formation of these compounds was what had caused the discoloration at the plaster's surface in the church. Conclusive proof of this was easily furnished. Spraying plaster surfaces which had not yet turned blue with a solution of iron(II) or iron(III) salts, respectively, produced a spontaneous blue discoloration, which otherwise would have formed only slowly, as the reaction progressed by itself.

       If they went by the book they would've aimed for 5 grams per cubic meter for all of
       <em>
        two hours
       </em>
       . (What does that work out to in ppm?)
      </p>
      <p>
       And they presumably didn't hose down the church afterwards, which would've increased absorption, as happened in the "gas chambers".
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, due to
       <a href="http://vho.org/GB/Books/trr/Image19.gif">
        the [slow] out-gassing cycle of Z-B
       </a>
       , and the witness statements that victims died in just a few minutes, the exposure of the "gas chamber" walls would've been much higher than 300ppm -- they would've had to have achieved that level after about 10% of the Z-B's outgassing cycle, depending on air temperature, (i.e. in winter they would've used much more Z-B.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They would've aimed for a level higher than 300ppm, also, as human sensitivity to cyanide gas varies quite a bit - 2000ppm is used in US gas chambers. Pressac estimates 5-7kg of Z-B per gassing. Thus the "gas chambers" were exposed to levels as high as the delousing chambers, if not higher, just for less time.

       You don't really need death though. Just lose of consciousness long enough to throw them in the crematory.

      <p>
       Much higher than 300ppm? By the time the concentration reaches 500ppm they would all be dead from cumulative exposure and guys would start ventilating the room. I would look for prussian blue in the ventilation system more than anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it would probably take at least an hour if you could move 1 body every 2 secs. Which doesn't seem normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       5grams, a cubic meter of air is 1.25-1.29kg. So at highest is 0.004. Or 4000ppm for 2 hours. This is for the rooms that had prussian blue formation after 1 exposure?
      </p>
      <p>
       The question then is how does frequency of exposure affect for formation? They don't delouse cloths 3 times a day do they?

       Note that, depending on whose account of "ventilation" time you accept, the Z-B would continue to outgas for approximately another 1.5-2hrs, as the room is being cleared. Thus the rest of the crematorium complex would also be exposed to cyanide gas -- something no "witnesses" mention.

      <p>
       Presumably it increases the amount of formation, as in the delousing rooms. However in citing these two case studies, I intended to show that iron-cyanide compounds can form in brickwork/plaster/etc after just a single exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       To really understand this, we need to define the minimum level of cyanide gas exposure necessary for the reaction to occur in the "gas chamber" brickwork. (Concentration, time - and the environmental variables: brick components, porousness, humidity, temperature - etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any estimates for the above?

       Right, which is why it annoys me that people can assert, a priori, that the conditions of alleged repeated exposure in the "gas chambers" was always too low for PB to form, without attempting to quantitatively define what the necessary conditions for formation are.

       Except we're talking about ZERO iron-cyanide compounds forming in the "gas chambers". It's not a matter of "how much" PB accumulates -- the argument being made is that conditions were such that its formation was

       He was stationed close to Auschwitz and according to his account he regularly had to visit the Auschwitz main camp as part of his job. He claims he only visited Auschwitz-Birkenau once or twice and described it as dirtier and nastier than the Auschwitz main camp or Stammlager where inmates were relatively better off, having luxuries and distractions available to them such as a swimming pool, theatre and even a brothel. He never saw any evidence of gassings at the Auschwitz main camp and yet today tourists are shown a phoney gas chamber that was "reconstructed" after the war by the Soviets. The work of Cole and others has shown beyond any doubt that this facility could never have served as a homicidal gas chamber. The authorities even admit that this gas chamber was "reconstructed" after the war by the Soviets. David Cole got the head of the Auschwitz State Museum to admit this on film, and yet tourists are still told that people were gassed at this facility.

       Lots of people worked at Auschwitz.  They certainly wouldn't tell everybody that worked there if there were exterminations going on in one corner of the camp.  I don't doubt for a moment that Christophersen was being honest.  He saw nothing.  But that's beside the point.

       The point is the gas chamber shown to tourists at the Auschwitz Stammlager is a fraud. Cole's documentary on Auschwitz clearly shows how and why this so called gas chamber never could have served the purpose that is claimed. The thing has a chimney built onto it that connects to nothing within the so called gas chamber. It's purely there for show. Also the Zyklon B induction holes on the top of the gas chamber are mysteriously missing in aerial photographs taken by allied reconnaissance planes taken during the time when the mass gassings at Auschwitz were supposedly taking place. How many more clues do you need to work out someone is pulling your leg?

       A rather important point!  If you're an Auschwitz SS guy who knows it was all bull, you might remain silent for fear of prosecution--but you'd sure as hell leave your refutation in the form of a memoir.  We have a rather curious incident (a la the dog that "did nothing in the nighttime") with a gigantic absence of Nazis who would have been there and in the know not leaving counter-claims at their deaths.  Mengele insisted to his son that the Jews he experimented on volunteered and got "goodies" for doing so.  But there's no indication--to my knowledge, at least--that he denied the Zyklon B mass gassings.  (If it were I, I'd make damned sure my wife or some other loved-one got my personal account out to Ernst Zundel or somebody!)

       You (and other revisionists) have amply proved that the room on display at Auschwitz wasn't the gas chamber it's been passed off as.  But that was a big camp and any real gas chambers would have gone the way of Treblinka and the other Bug River death camps--dismantled!  Some eye-witness testimony is indeed "tainted," and other claims might be subject to challenge or refutation.  But let's remember, when Groening made his remarks, he wasn't quite so old, nor was he under indictment.  He was a guy who got pissed off that some were claiming that things he was involved with and aware of didn't happen.  (I doubt you'll have time to get back here, but I respond "for the record.")

       bhasse -- please don't act like the Birkenau gas chambers could have been anywhere at Auschwitz. The claims have been firmly fixed to kremas 2, 3, 4, and 5. 4 and 5 are gone, but 2 and 3 are still around to be tested. I do think Jews were killed at Auschwitz by Hoess (most likely, without orders) in '42. But the '44 extermination period is centered on the four kremas.

       I am making no claims or assertions, but am rather attempting to remain open to evidence.  Historians have gotten a good lot wrong on this issue.  They should be held accountable.  But if gas chamber murders really happened, we would expect the evidence to have been erased.  If they never existed, you're right and it will be hard to "prove a negative."  I ask my questions because I want to know, and right now, it's damned hard to dismiss the claims of a Nazi who was there.

       Hey, I don't believe for a second that 10,000 bodies were being cremated a day in the crematoria of the Auschwitz/Birkenau camp complex.  It's a technological impossibility.  Nor do I believe Kurt Gerstein's ridiculous numbers.  But he saw a gassing at Belzec.  I'm willing to be persuaded one way or the other on this (the Auschwitz gas chamber) issue.

       Good question, I'm interested in that as well.  Here is a quote from an article by Mr. Groening, ' he decided to make it public after learning about Holocaust denial, and has since openly criticised those who deny the events that he witnessed, and the ideology to which he once subscribed.'

       You have to prove that the number 6 million was derived from
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       formula for your argument to have any implications. Proper historians wouldn't rely on potentially bad data and would always confirm through multiple sources. Therefore, this would be the least preferable method to determine the Jewish death toll of WWII. This wasn't how they figured out those numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the 3 million Polish Jews were dead by the end of WWII. That's 2.5 - 2.8 million Jews alone... Just from Poland. The facts show that there were 9 million Jews in Europe before WWII, that they were gathered from across Nazi-occupied Germany into ghettos and camps and that there were only several million European Jews left in the world after WWII. Even today, the number of European Jews is very close to the number in 1944 -- something that you would not expect unless there was a drastic decrease in population. There are many, many ways to estimate the number of Jews who were killed in WWII. Historians constantly come to a number very close to 6 million. This is always more than 2/3 of European Jews. This is a higher proportion than any other community. If you've read Hitler's Mein Kampf and studied the politics of Nazi Germany, it is an inescapable conclusion that Jews were targeted for extermination.

       Why haven't the number of European Jews in 2014 increased
       <em>
        far beyond
       </em>
       that of 1944? Especially considering the relative success of Jewish people as a minority. If millions of Jews were not killed then there should be tens of millions more Ashkenazi than there are.

      <p>
       The question I have for you is... Why did the Nazis take away my grandmother's child sister? Where did all of the kids go? Where were the daycares at Auschwitz for the kids? My answer is, they were taken to be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you should know that all of the ameneties at Auschwitz, such as a single reservoir converted into a tiny pool, where not for the prisoners but the prison guards (ie. Nazi soldiers). That's obvious.

       You have "maybes" of your own, I see.  To answer your question, many died of Typhus and malnutrition in the camps, just like germans did in their cities and towns.  WW2 was horrific, especially for millions of civilians.

       As I state in my book, there was never a central plan. Policy toward Jews varied by year, and by country. From 1942 through 1943 there was a policy, quite clearly described by Goebbels in his diary, to reduce the population of Polish Jews by about 60%. That figure was backed up by the Korherr Report. Separately, Jews from Germany were sent east, with the idea that once the Germans defeated the Russians, they'd be expelled. When the Front stalled and turned to shit for the Germans, it was decided that it was dangerous having so many Jews in the Ostland, and most were liquidated. These are all individual pieces of a tragedy. But there was never a single "plan."

       What's more, there's evidence in 1942 that Hitler had ordered the solution to the 'Jewish Problem' postponed until after the war.

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/Germany/Kempner/">
        In 1945/46 a prosecutor at the Nuremberg "trials" disappeared a 1942 document showing that Hitler had ordered this postponement. The original was found in the German Archives in the 70's.

      </p>
      <p>
       We also have a 1942 quote from Hitler (in 'Table Talks') which explain what his plans were. The policy isn't even one of a total, forced expulsion. Rather, Hitler stated that after the war he would

       There's no point - you don't want it to be true. The Holocaust is what happens when your belief system - racism and intolerance - is put into actual practice. 11 million people are slaughtered. You'll do anything to make that uncomfortable feeling go away, so you deny the event ever happened, or you change it so in your mind it's not such a big deal.

       Soon the last Holocaust survivors will be dead. There will be no one left with a first-hand experience of what happened at these camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are sowing doubt in places where there isn't any. Every year that passes there are fewer eye witnesses to defend the
       <em>
        very existence
       </em>
       of millions of these murder victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you not notice how you are treated here because of your beliefs about 9/11 and Israel? Many people who join "truth movements" do it for other reasons than the truth. To these people, conspiracy is a worldview and a religion. Since you
       <em>
        disagree
       </em>
       , you're the enemy who literally serves Satan (aka. the NWO, Jews, etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust revisionist movement will always be dominated by these types of people. You are adding confusion to the legacy of survivors at the first point in history when we don't have their personal experiences as an asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a world where people believe that the Boston Bombing or Sandy Hook were not just conspired, but completely fictitious events.
      </p>
      <p>
       To call these well-documented events is an understatement. They are fully documented beyond any shred of doubt. The truthers claim the people didn't even exist, despite there being a hundred thousand+ personal contacts of victims and witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people to whom there is no evidence that can convince them they're wrong. Do you think that your activities will really result in good? Why do you have to add more fuel to the crazy fire? This is a time in history when Holocaust museums are targeted by shooters almost annually. There has never been a faster spread of hoaxes and lies than now. All you're doing is becoming the darling child of the degenerate faction of society who hate you because you're Jewish anyways.

       My father's parents were Polish Jews. 90% of all Polish Jews were murdered during WWII. My grandfather and grandmother lost their friends, villages and most of their family.

       My question to you is do you believe that they're lying about the details of their past or that they have a bad memory? If it is possible that they mis-remember details, then where were their missing family members and friends? Where did the 90% of Polish Jews go?

        Conspiracy of Silence, a documentary listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine was to be aired on the Discovery Channel, on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, a rough-cut of the documentary was leaked..this is the leaked version.

       Hey David, thanks for being here.

       In my book, I transcribed recorded phone calls between us from 1994, in which Shermer admitted that he lied on the Donahue Show, and that he lied to his readers about my work in "Skeptic Magazine." I also transcribed a recorded interview he gave in early '95, in which he admitted falsely calling me an anti-Semite, and in which he admitted that I'm probably right regarding the gas chambers. When Sherm learned about these transcribed calls, he had his lawyers threaten my publisher. Within 24 hours, I got them to run away like mice, with their tails between their legs. He hasn't troubled me since.

       to be fair the GOP has lots of infighting, civil wars, libertarians, neo-cons, and all sorts of things, where as the democrats are always content with what they have. it is also the only seemingly right-wing way to get any power in america, due to the two party monpoly.

       dennis kucinich the guy who voted for obama care? yea ok. the guy who has no following, no movement behind his name or persona or beliefs? where was the huge push to get him in office instead of obama like grass roots voters did for paul? where are his hordes of followers who would like to see a change in the democratic party? nowhere. there is no dissent in the democratic party. everyone is happy with the establishment in that party. theyre all in on it, not one  person in that party has integrity or a vision or a fight within them.

       Obamacare is Romneycare, a conservative plan enacted by DLC dems.  Kucinich and Paul, both controlled opposition to promote the illusion of "honest" elements within an utterly corrupt system.  There's no right and left, there's no divide between the parties.  As for divide within the dems, you have populist, supposed rogue elements like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders (who is an independant in name only), whom are just a veil.  Corporations rule both parties.  I hope you awaken to this.

       No, Duke is poison, and a con man. Remember that I go back a long way. Back to the '80s, and the Willis Carto days. We all knew who the con men were. Duke can get a fancy little plastic surgery nose, but he can't surgically alter his personality. Jared Taylor, on the other hand, while dismissed by many as a racist, is an intelligent and literate man whose presence is needed to balance out the race baiting that comes from the left. The GOP will never embrace Taylor, and I understand why, strategically. But he's a good guy who serves a good purpose.

       Can you elaborate on what makes Duke "poison" and a "con man".  Some may find this to be hypocritical as you have gone into hiding, changed your name, and were literally living as someone else for a large portion of your life as well as making money off your deceptions.

       And you're a Neoconservative Zionist Jew.  Duke and Taylor are far more respectable than you'll ever be.  It's Jewish Neocons like you who have destroyed the Republican party for white men.

       David quit the Klan over 35 years ago.  David Duke was also a former Republican State Representative of Louisiana as well.  He's a highly respectable man, and I even own an autographed copy of one of his books.  Although I think I'm gonna read David Cole's books now as well.

       Someone asked about what you thought of National Socialism but then deleted it. I think it's a good question. My personal opinion is that NS was controlled opposition, as it was socialistic in nature and thus Jewish nonsense meant to control and deceive.

       That was me and I didn't delete it; thanks for bring it to my attention that it has been banned. That to me is a clear sign that they don't want us talking about it. If it were controlled opposition, then why are they hiding discussion of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism itself is simply a group working together for the benefit of all. It does not mean it's necessarily Jewish. That was the difference between Communism and NS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen you around on this thread and you seem pretty versed...perhaps you haven't read all the benefits that NS brings to a people. ANP14.com would be a good place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NS. I want workers to be treated fairly, industry to stay in the the country, no fake money or ridiculous debts, real talented people creating art from all walks of life instead of Kardashians...I could go on, but I assure you it's not controlled op. Listen to the ANP talkshoe.

       I think it is still taken legitimately, and I think that itself is legitimate, because 3 million deaths can certainly be considered a Holocaust. The problem is that the deniers understate the severity of the event (and thus lose credibility), and the mainstream historians overstate it (and thus lose credibility to anyone who's exposed to genuine revisionism).

       Can you leave your race out of it and consider that some deniers are not so much understating the events but rather refuse to let the Jews own the narrative? Imagine an other perspective, one that sees the Jews as contributors to the conflict, as where some many different forces, not the primary victims. And are you capable of seeing the Germans as victims?

       How do you rectify that statement with the rise of a Germany that no longer feels it needs to remain quiet because of the Holocaust? Along with the center of geopolitics shifting to nations that never originally believed in the evil nazi propaganda that originated power world war 2?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also please define deniers and what qualifies people to be classified under your label for sake of debate. Denying the Holocaust as a narrative is not the same as denying anyone died, so I'm hoping you have some distinction between the two.

       Believed it happened is not the same as consider it important or relevant to their day to day lives. Appeal to majority is also a logical fallacy and not a reasonable argument. The majority believe many things both trivial and important to be true that simply are not.

       As a matter of inquire which Holocaust are you referring to that people believe happened? There were quite a few claimed, but only the World War 2 event stuck even though Holocaust scholars now admit 6 million was an outright exaggeration.

       GOPs can barely control their bowels, let alone elections. There's no GOP election-rigging conspiracy. You noticed that we lost big in '06, '08, and '12? If we're rigging elections, we're doing it wrong.

        The Clint Curtis / Tom Feeney Vote-Rigging Scandal, 10 Years Later
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Incredibly enough, it's been ten years this month since we broke the story about vote-rigging software whistleblower Clint Curtis.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's not surprising as it involves election fraud, touch-screen voting systems, Florida, a powerful Congressman, the Bush family, Chinese spies and several disturbing deaths.
       </p>
       <p>
        In short, Curtis was a software programmer from Oviedo, FL who claimed in a sworn 2004 affidavit and then sworn testimony before members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, that he was asked to create a vote-rigging software prototype for touch-screen voting systems back in 2000 by then Rep. Tom Feeney (R-FL), a very powerful Republican in the Sunshine State and a close friend of the Bush family.

       They successfully silenced Ron Paul but I think that's about the extent of their vote rigging. Honestly, if Romney would have won, he would have used Sandy Hook to implement gun control because the sheep who worship Republicans would have supported him, in my opinion. But because Obama won all the Republicans wanted to do the opposite of whatever Obama wanted to do.

       I know this goes against the spirit of an AMA, but all I can say is that my "conversion" away from atheism was personal. I don't mean personal as in, "don't ask me about it," I mean personal as in, "not something I can explain beyond my own experiences."

       Nope, haven't seen it. There's very little new denier research these days, and very few real revisionists (as opposed to deniers). The "new" stuff is usually retreads from the '90s.

       Spielberg's 'The Last Days' was only released in 1999. The documentary I linked to is an expose of the many, varied and blatant lies of the witnesses throughout that film.

       What about the Red Cross documents, those are very new? And why divide the research field into denier and revisionist? It seems manipulative, as in divide and conquer.

       Some people say that Israel was really a state created for the House of Rothschild; they wanted their own land nearby the Suez Canal with it being such an important waterway both strategically and economically. Giving the Jewish people a home was a convenient excuse for the land grab, just as the British once moved Lowland Scots people to the North of Ireland in an attempt to keep control of the whole of Ireland.

       I'm a Zionist. I don't buy the conspiracy theories. A group of people wanted a homeland. There was a massive refugee crisis at the end of WWII. The Arabs were less than welcoming, war ensued, land was won in battle. No different than what happened for centuries in Europe with land passing hands from one nation/nationality to another. It's all just part of human behavior.

       All I can say is this: I used to be a fan of him and now I'm glad I never gave him a single penny before this AMA. I have come across people like him in the "conspiracy" movement before and now I can honestly say that whenever someone refuses to answer some questions, and has a book/product to sell, they are full of crap. I always wondered why Ryan Dawson never asked David about 9/11 and now I can say confidently that Ryan Dawson and David had behind the scenes deals to promote each others work (try to make money for each other) as long as they agreed to certain rules. Absolutely disgusting. I stopped following Ryan after I saw him constantly beg for donation money and now I'm done with David Cole.

       When the person trying to make money is doing so in a desperate attempt to not have to work a "normal" job like the rest of us peasants have to do (not all of us have the privilege of selling out to work with the Republican party) it most certainly brings into question everything they are doing in order to make a living.

       Honestly that would make more sense to me but I thought his alliance with the GOP was just to keep himself safe, I didn't think he actually thought it was a good entity until this AMA. And either way, aligning yourself with either of the two parties (two wings of the same bird) is absurd for anyone calling themselves a historian to do. My personal opinions on politics in America are that they are completely rigged, along with the mainstream media/music/movie industry. David is just someone trying to make money rather than search out the truth and speak truth because the truth these days does not get one a lot of money, it gets them targeted... so I wouldn't doubt that he is just saying he's a Zionist and pro-GOP to save himself but that's not going to stop me from not supporting him.

       I don't make money from my book, nutjob. I got paid to write my book. I got my money up-front. If it sells ten or ten-thousand copies, it's my publisher who gets the dough. I don't lose jack-shit, even if it never sells. Not that you care one bit about facts or reality.

       I was really a huge fan of yours but now I'm a nutjob because I see through your scheme? There are a ton of people like you in the "conspiracy" movement, all of you are just toeing the line to make money for yourselves rather than talk about the big picture, because that's too dangerous. I can understand wanting to stay safe but selling out is disgusting (let me guess, other Zionists paid you to write that book, didn't they?).

       I appreciate your work in "Cole Goes to Auschwitz" but I now see you for what you really are. Have fun supporting the Israeli government and the official government stories of all the recent false flags, most notably 9/11.

       No need to call him a "nutjob", David.  That attitude wont get you any new customers.  Zionists tend to sell themselves well yet always resort to ad hominems and strident attacks.

       Thanks for the support. I forgot to mention in my reply to him that he ignored my question about how he can support the creation of Israel despite exposing the lies that Israel used ("6 million Jews killed!") to get created but it all makes sense to me now. David, along with every other person who wants to promote their book or beg for donation money, is only out for themselves. They couldn't care less about the big picture, and I'm sure any other questions I have will now be ignored. It's actually hilarious if you look through my post history for today and see how quickly I went from defending him in multiple posts, to now seeing what he truly is. I actually defended this guy a lot over the past 6 months on the internet...lesson learned.

       I don't understand how people are confused about this subject. Israel is not being created. It was created 70 years ago. Being a Zionist doesn't mean you think the past was 100% moral. In this day and age, Zionist means that you don't think that Israel should lose its sovereign status. Furthermore, it means that you're against anti-Zionism, which is usually fueled by Arab Nationalism (reverse Zionism), anti-West or even anti-Jew sentiments.

       Anti-Zionist does not mean anti-jew. Present day Israel is disgusting, a blockage on the Palestinian people that only "allows" them 2400 calories worth of food per person per day on top of numerous other restrictions. Blowing them up by the hundreds for every one Israeli they are blamed for killing. I cannot believe David openly admits to being a Zionist, let alone anyone else who considers themselves a historian.

       It's impossible to say what anti-Zionist really means because there are so many definitions of Zionism. I don't know what facts or world view you subscribe to, so there's not much I can say. If you literally have different assumptions, any dialogue between us is pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum to be considered a Zionist means that you support a sovereign state for ethnic Jews. If you are anti-Zionist in this sense, but you support a sovereign state for ethnic Iranians or French, then you are anti-Jew. If you claim to be anti-Nationalism in its entirety, but you only talk about Israel, you are probably anti-Jew, whether or not you've admitted it to yourself. There are other more dangerous Nationalist movements in this world, for example in Greece, that do no receive 1% of the international attention of Israel.

       So what? If I told you that I think that ethnic Turks should keep their sovereign state of Turkey, does that mean I support all of their countries crimes against humanity? It's a country with a record just as bad as Israel. No! In fact, because I am not anti-Turkish, I do not equivocate rights of the people in the state with the actions of the state.

       Yes, your definition doesn't impede on anything I or the other guy was saying, you can fully support that ideology and oppose THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, while supporting the notion of a jewish and/or Israeli state.

       In addition, I don't have to have a position on the ideology, the legitimacy of the government or the notion of a Jewish or Israeli nation-state. I don't have a position on equivalent concepts for other countries. I can be completely neutral and be against anyone who would say that a country should lose it sovereignity. According to anti-Zionists, I am a Zionist. In reality, I am not an anti-Zionist and I am not a Zionist.

       The way I see it, when you have strong opinions on a subject, where failed outcomes have no bearing on your life, you are a meddler. When you have no skin in the game, you simply can never understand the issue as someone who suffers the consequences day after day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally, we would all be informed world citizens with well-reasoned opinions about current issues that affect human welfare throughout the world. But at the same time I know my opinions are based on
       <em>
        limited and biased information
       </em>
       . I care enough that I want the outcome to have the greatest possible good. I know enough to have some understanding of the situation. But I do not demand that they give up anything because I must satisfy my devotion to my personal ideals. With no skin in the game, I do not have the right to meddle... nor am I that self-righteous and self-satisfied. I've been wrong enough too many times to be that delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       The route to peace is through compromise. That may be an ideal but it is also a fact. No country was born without guilt and I'm not going to start with Israel if I get the grandiose desire to fix the past.

       It then stands to reason that when Jews declared war on Germany in 1933 that they had a right to defend themselves. Do you think Jews share some of the blame in the war or are they always the victim?

       Jews had a right to oppose the Nazi government. The Nazis were opposed by many non-Jewish Germans, too. That was politics. Putting kids in concentration camps isn't politics; it's filthy, disgusting, and inhumane. It was beneath the Germans as a people.

       In a country of 60 million, the approximate population of the concentration camps in 1939, was 10,000. Most of them were 'anti-social' criminals.

       During wartime, all other nations locked up hostile foreigners. The various statements/activites by international Jewish groups to the effect of a "holy war on Germany" justifies this policy by the NSDAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there were many nationalist, assimilationist German-Jews (especially veterans from WWI) who seemed to support the goals of the NSDAP, but the "Nazis" turned their back on them.

       Thanks for your reply David, very interesting, not the reply I had anticipated.  While there was a lot of Rothschild involvement in initially setting up and funding Israel, the 'Rothschild controls Israel' idea will have to remain as conspiracy as there is no hard evidence like you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's quite a lot about their involvement with Zionism and Israel on their family Wikipedia page, it also mentions their financing of the Suez Canal project.

       The Rothschilds are just one of many families that pertain to aristocracy, i.e. a noble family. They don't possess extraordinary power besides Federal Reserve and Zionism (political movement/ideology), there are
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       families who have dominion. Goverment and Global politics are not what they seem, one cannot say 'x' runs 'y' state, because all families have stakes in all states.

       The Balfour declaration was signed before the second world war even started and it was negotiated by lord Rothchild to establish a jewish (but predominantly zionist) state. To say it was as a consequence of sympathy to the jews after what you told us about the holocaust and the arabs not welcoming is ridiculous. Arabs and jews were living peacefully in palestine for 200 years prior to 1947.

       David, what about the evidence presented by Jim Condit Jr. that Hitler was directly supported and financed by high Zionist financiers? Smells like a conspiracy to me. Hitler was completely controlled, especially by way of his homosexual blackmailability.

       Dear David, from Moonlit History of Facebook:--
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in concordance with you, Irving and Weber on the Reinhardt camps and the mass-killings on the Eastern Front. It happened and it was horrible. However, it is strange how that small portion of Jewish death is the most sought-after element of the bloodbath we call World War II.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get a lot of flak from "deniers" too because of my views. But I believe a wanna-be historian, such as myself, should always adhere to the principles of honest criticism towards history and not allow bias opinions to formulate answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it's obvious that the Jewish holocaust story has shifted and changed throughout the decades. The holocaust story of 1945 was a lie to the world. No extermination camps or gas chambers were on German soil--yet the Western forces claimed to have liberated many death camps. No Jews were made into soap or lampshades; no Polish prisoners had their head shrunk (and none of these pieces of "evidence", which were displayed at the Nuremberg Trials, were ever recovered by the allies to be authenticated).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some good ol' fashion propaganda. Few people seem to remember the propaganda used during World War I. Some of it was anti-German, like the stories of Belgium babies and crucified Canadians. All of which were lies crafted by the "allied powers." There were many reports of 6,000,000 Jews being persecuted and killed. But it wasn't by the Germans, it was the Russians. The Library of Congress has a lot of those articles archived. Here are a few examples:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My question to you is: why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why lie to the world? Why create a holocaust story that is entirely different from the reality it resides in? To exploit the Jewish suffering for reparations (Finkelstein, 2000)? To provide a reason for Israel's existence and wars of survival (Segev, 1993)?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nuremberg Trials were to for ever demean the Germans as evil monsters. At the expense of an awful level of double-standards committed by the "four most mightiest of nations." The German invasion of Norway, under Article 6 (a) of the Nuremberg Charter, was labeled a "crime against peace" and a "war of aggression"--but the British and French were already planning to invade Norway before the Germans did (which was code-named Operation Stratford).
      </p>
      <p>
       The American and British forces, during the Sino-Japanese war, treated the Japanese far more equally than the Chinese. Shanghai was split up into concessions, with each foreign country governing a permitted part. And all of this at the expense of the Chinese population, who starved and suffered the most from such an Imperialist occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1938 the American population showed more distraught over Hitler's seizing of Czechoslovakia than Japan's fragmentary conquest of China (which was possible through purchased British and American war materials).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was only after the endangerment of economic interests--in the Philippines and China from Japanese expansionism--when the West decided to severe ties altogether. Which pissed the Japs off and eventually led to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Well, what do you expect? 80% of their oil came from the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the holocaust truly the worst and most vile thing humans ever did, as Justice Robert Jackson tried to portray during the International Military Tribunal? Was the "10 years of Jew-baiting" only a dye of the National Socialists and no-one else?--The truth is, there have been worse events in history. The Native American Holocaust, that took place over an entire landmass, lasted for hundreds of years and was perpetrated mainly by Christian European settlers who raped, enslaved, burnt, starved, raped again, and made the populations convert to a foreign mythology. We never got our homeland back. We never got reparations. And we almost completely died off (along with the native people of Australia, New Zealand, etc). And to further offer Hitchensian rhetoric: it was not the Nazis' influence that led to the mass-killings, it was actually from "the result of 2,000 years of Christianity. Based on one verse, of one chapter of St. John's Gospel, which led to a pogrom after every Easter Sermon every year for hundreds of years." Pope John Paul II was kind enough to apologize for the church's totalitarian rule of 20 centuries. He apologized for: the Inquisition; the burning and killing of women, Jews, homosexuals, and other religious sects; the African slave trade (that led to the death and enslavement of at least 60 - 100 million souls, by some estimates); the Crusades, etc. (For furthering reading: The Guardian, "Pope Says Sorry for Sins of Church," March 13, 2000.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something wrong with this world. I would not say it is entirely a "Zionist conspiracy" of sorts (although Zundel, the Neo-Nazi, was acquitted on that charge in the 80's), but it's more like a human conspiracy to "distill our uneasy conscious" over the brutal warfare and hypocrisy of our past. We have given the burden of guilt onto a scapegoat, which happens to be the Nazi Bastards, by "training and sensitivity on holocaust awareness" within school systems and textbooks and pop-culture. Hell, Stalin was more damn evil than Hitler--and he was a damn ally! Stalin doesn't get the recognition Hitler does when it comes to "evilness." He should. Stalin killed more people than Hitler and he was planning to exterminate all the Jews in Soviet territory before his death! Pogroms, mass deportations, and purges had already happened. (For further reading: UnitedwithIsrael.org, "Soviet Jews Saved From Stalin’s Genocidal Plans on Purim," March 10, 2014.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypocrisy, thy name is us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am glad I live in a country where there is Freedom of Speech and Expression (so I can be typing this up and posting it on here). That is the true outcry to all this. We deserve to hold opinions and to express them, no matter how strange they might be. Sure, I don't exactly agree with the folks from the Westboro Baptist Church, but they have a right to voice their opinions.

       There was no 'holocaust' in New Zealand, what the hell are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       For reading of Maori, 'wh' makes an fff sound, I makes an ee sound and A is an ah with O making an oh sound and U making an ew sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relations with Maori were relatively good, and European sailors regularly traded with Maori. Yes there  was early instanced of violence and death from these meetings, but they went both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early settlers and missionaries trade for the land they settled by the respective tribes who you could considered 'owed' the land. Though early Maori didn't really believe in ownership as we do today, more of a custodianship that was scared, and the protection of land for future generations, tribal boarders were constantly changing as Maori culture was one of inter-tribal warfare and had been their custom for a long time before settlers arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <strong>
        1820
       </strong>
       , Hongi Hika was given gifts by King George IV, for the help of spreading Christianity through  New Zealand. Medicine that the missionaries bought with them were embraced by the Maori, Christianity was similar to their already exiting spiritualism - it wasn't spread at the barrel of a musket. The missionaries also gave the Maori a written form of their language that previously was only oral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hongi Hika traded the gifts he received from King Gorge IV for muskets on his return to New Zealand in  Australia. Hongi Hika then went to war with a neighbouring iwi (people/tribe) Te Morenga. Maori were a  tribal culture that were constantly at war with one another for dominance and land, as was their custom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homgi Hika's men killed around 5,000 and enslaved many more for their neighbouring tribe. After
       <strong>
        1835
       </strong>
       around 900 Maori boated to the Chatham Islands once again with the guns and modern weapons such as metal axes and essentially wiped out the Moriori, who they declared their slaves, even after that Morior, who were pacifists, attempted to share their resources and work with their related cousins, the Maori. The Maori refused, the men women and children who weren't taken as slaves were eaten, even children.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the Maori commented: 'We took possession …in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us. These we killed, and others we killed – but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The British preferred a peaceful arrangement with the Tangata Whenua (indigenous people, Maori) and the treaty of Waitangi was signed on the
       <strong>
        6th of February 1840
       </strong>
       , by the crown and 46 Maori Chiefs. The Crown continued to collect signatures, including in the South Island, which had a very small population of Maori, some Chiefs refused but by
       <strong>
        May 21st
       </strong>
       more than 100 Chiefs has signed.
      </p>
      <p>
       New Zealand’s immigration and economy grew for the next nineteen years. However Maori unrest grew in the Taranaki region as Maori became unhappy with the amount of land was being sold to settlers and less settlers were trading with Maori as they were becoming self sufficient. This came to a boiling point when the New Zealand’s government attempted to force a land sale in Waitara region, and the second New Zealand war erupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Maori Chiefs again split in opinion, but many remained allied with the British. The Chiefs that did not side with the British were advocates of preserving Maori identity and self rule. The ‘rebel’ Maori fought against a force of roughly 5000 British regulars, settlers and Maori loyalists. The continued war started to depress industry and New Zealand’s economy, so  In
       <strong>
        1866
       </strong>
       the British withdrew their forces (also, they were getting pretty badly beaten by what is considered today as ‘Gorilla tactics’ that the British army didn’t really have a strategy to match).
      </p>
      <p>
       The war continued till
       <strong>
        1872
       </strong>
       when the war ended, the ‘rebel’ Maori dead since 1895 was more than 2000 with around 560 British killed and 250 kupapa (loyal) Maori. Since around 2012 The Office of Treaty and Settlements New Zealand has settled more than $950 Million
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements#List_of_Treaty_Settlements">
        list of treat settlements
       </a>
       , with more to come. A lot of this money has been invested into sustainable business, such a fisheries, tourism, forestry, hotels, shopping malls, and dairy to name a few as well as various plots of land that the Crown will rent in perpetuity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In New Zealand, our national anthem is bi-lingual, and both the English and Maori version are sung back to back, public schools teach all children Te Reo Maori, with most New Zealanders knowing basic words in Maori and how to read Te Reo Maori. There are always special cultural classes, Kaupapa Maori (platform/base of Maori language) and Kapa Haka (Maori performing arts) classes in every public school and any child can attend to attain a greater understanding and appreciation for Maori culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most schools have their own Haka (essentially a preformed challenge, if you’ve ever seen the All Blacks play, each school region will tend to have its own version of that) and their own Powhiri (welcome ceremony) students generally take great pride when performing it as it is part of our cultural identity. There are special grants for Maori students to attending tertiary education often with most school having reserved spots for Maori students. There are special tuition classes that go side by side at primary, secondary and tertiary schools that give Maori and culturally rich environment in which they can learn in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maori have their own political party and guaranteed seats for representation in parliament. They have their own sports teams, TV and radio stations. We also have many, many Maori and Pacific Islands festivals in which New Zealand celebrates Maori and our greater Pacific Island neighbors who can immigrate to New Zealand whenever they want with permanent residence and apply for citizenship without question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the original colonial people do everything right by the Maori? No, not by a long shot, but to compare it even slightly to what happened in Australia to the Aboriginals is belittling to what the Aboriginals suffered, and what they suffered was great. Also, but no means could you even come close to describing it as a holocaust. New Zealand has been working hard, with critical self reflection and improvement since 1840 when the treaty was first signed. The date of the treaty is a national holiday in New Zealand and Maori culture and largely identified with Kiwi culture, even if you’re Pākehā (of European decent, fair-skinned).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this is so large, but it’s not accurate, or fair to throw New Zealand in the same category by any means as Australia and American natives.

       Death threats from the JDL, and a $25,000 bounty put on my head in late 1997. Plus, I was in my '20s and really not wanting to die at that moment. These days? Meh, sure, whatever.

       The large majority of this subreddit voiced displeasure with your AMA here, and their comments and votes overwhelmed the announcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think there's so much conflict with your topic of choice?

       Do you think banning the users here who voice their distaste for this stuff is the way to go about it?

       Look, the mods will do what they feel best. Personally, I'm never in favor of banning anyone who hasn't engaged in direct threats or other violations of the rules. But please understand that I'm new to Reddit. The mods here have been kind to me, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

       Mr. Cole,
      </p>
      <p>
       since you're new to reddit, allow me to explain this situation to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admins are paid employees of reddit INC
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods, like me, are volunteers of the SUB-reddits like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Admins have shadowbanned these users for presumably violating reddits ToS agreement.  most likely because they are just one person pretending to be a dozen unique people and voting for themselves while down voting people they don't want heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       sorry if this is confusing.  Basically these users want this community to remove me as a volunteer mod because i refuse to ban people like you that they consider to be racist or antisemitic.
      </p>

       1) How many Jews do you actually think were killed? How many were targeted by "evil Nazi German white men" for extermination, and how many just died due to circumstances?

      <p>
       2) How many non-Jews were in concentration camps? How many Jews were?

       3) What do you think of the theory that Hitler was a NWO pawn serving his masters, which explains why he bumbled about and was stupid enough to declare war on the Soviet Union? Some think Hitler was actually a Jew, and considering his body disappeared, it seems to me he was not genuine at all.

       Below you said you were a Zionist. I support that. I believe the Jewish people should have a homeland just like everybody. Therefore, do you support Germany being a state for ethnic Germans only? And all the other ethnicities having their own racial states?

       Well, I'll go this far. I don't believe in a double-standard. If the rights of "indigenous people" are enforced in Africa, they should be enforced in Europe as well, as whites are the indigenous folks of that land. I don't mean creating a "racial state," but I do believe that Europeans have the same right as Africans to preserve their culture. Indigenous is indigenous, right? On the other hand, America's greatness is in its diversity (shit, I know that sounds so damn cliche, but I believe it). I like that about my country. I like the fact that no one is truly indigenous (even the damn Indians, although we're never supposed to admit that).

       Firstly, I'm delighted to see you're still alive and the JDL didn't murder you.  1) What are your opinions on the recent finds at Sobibor, namely the walls of the gas chamber that they claim to have discovered? 2) Why did you run-off the Donahue show?  I've watched that episode on Youtube and I have to say that one thing that really lowered my opinion of Shermer was that he wouldn't defend Smith when the old woman in the audience was making the soap claims.

       The Sobibor "find" is meaningless. A wall fragment? What, is this Mars, where any evidence of human habitation is the find of the century? Sobibor was demolished in '43. Of course there were walls there. No one, revisionist or not, doubts that there were walls there, and rooms, and people, etc. I do believe that people were killed there, but the proof is in the Nazi documents, not a few bricks found under some dirt.

       Hello Mr. Cole, welcome to reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people were introduced to you through your earlier work, specifically your tour of Auschwitz and appearance on Donahue's show, and haven't kept up with you since you stopped being David Stein. What has changed since? Do you still deny the existence of gas chambers? Why did you go into hiding?

       Familiar? I've known Germar since 1994. Yes, I'm familiar. He's a solid guy, a serious researcher. That doesn't mean we agree down the line. But he's solid, and his persecution at the hands of the governments of Europe and North America has been an atrocity.

       Hello Mr. Cole,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really what you would call a fan, I wasn't even familiar with your works before my fellow mods managed to set this AMA up with you so my question is not going to be about the Holocaust directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take a lot of flak for refusing to silence users of this subreddit who express unpopular opinions and beliefs.  I feel like it does society a disservice to pressure people out of opinions or silence them directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took a lot of flak for defending this AMA, so that it could take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you've suffered similar defamation from both sides of the Holocaust debate, what would your advice be to me, about continuing down this road of protecting free speech in its ugliest forms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I remain anonymous? Should I abandon ship before I get identified?

       Do you have any plans to release your "Cole Goes to Auschwitz" on DVD? I have seen it on Youtube and love it. Thanks.

       The IHR has it on DVD, and there used to be an ISO of it up on TPB, I'm sure it's on some other trackers.

       If I release anything new, it'll probably be video that I never got to release in the early '90s...video of other camps. There isn't too much I can add to the Auschwitz video, and, besides, I signed away the rights to that one in 1997.

       I didn't know you had other stuff from that era that you haven't released yet. Very much looking forward to seeing that stuff. I guess I'll have to use a Youtube downloader tool to make myself a hard copy of "Cole Goes to Auschwitz" so if/when it gets completely removed from the internet I can still be able to show it to others. Very eye opening, and well made documentary... I especially like the lack of bias in it.

       The number is faulty. Himmler's statistician Korherr's numbers put the Jewish death toll (by murder) at a little less than 2.5 million by early 1943. Add the deaths after that, and you get about three million, give or take. The "six million" figure has achieved near-religious status, but it can't be supported.

       I think that most people with intellectual careers are very timid.  There are not a huge number of ways for them to earn as basically they can work for a university or write books.  Working at a university is a cake job that comes with a community of people to associate with and staff parties to be had and writing books is incredibly hard and lonely in comparison.  So if you communicate about something that goes fatally against the orthodoxy then you pretty much need to be acting solo and going direct to consumers to earn a living.  That is a lonely and difficult route and its not just about doing that in a vacuum but groups like the ADL will try to shut you down if you actually manage to have some success in that route.  Another thing about having a university position is that it is very political and for a long haul you need to cover your ass a bit.  Basically even with tenure you will have an ax over your head if you piss them off in this way.  Then people will just be waiting for you to foul up in some other technicality.

       Fashion model Rosie Tisch, and the 30-years-older New York Post writer she was living with (Michael Walsh aka David Kahane) outed me at a Second Amendment event by showing everyone my old revisionist videos and talk show appearances on their iPhones. It was April 20th, 2013. But I don't think they chose that date on purpose; it just so happened to be a night when I would not be attending that event, so they knew they wouldn't have to face me in person.

Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children."

        Hi Mr Cole. I really enjoyed your Auschwitz video from the early 90's. I've noticed recently that you're engaged in an argument with Eric Hunt (and others) over the position you've taken on the Reinhardt camps. Would you mind please responding to criticisms raised here: (

       I don't debate with Hunt. However, for other deniers, I have repeatedly issued this challenge: If the nearly 2.5 million "departed" (in Korherr's words) Jews weren't killed, where did they go? I can't debate those who have no alternate theory. It's like saying, "the Titanic didn't hit an iceberg." "Okay, then...what happened to all the people on it?" "I dunno." That's not a real debate. Give me an alternate theory for the nearly 2.5 million "departed," and I'll talk.

       You must have some idea where these people went. Your experience on the Montel Williams show, where brothers ended up being reunited, after believing the other was dead, clearly shows the Iron Curtain confuses the numbers.

       That was my question you answered - I got here late.

       I think elsewhere in the thread you called Eric Hunt "mentally ill, by his own admission", or some such nonsense. This is your excuse for not debating him... really?

      <p>
       I've got to say, I'm really disappointed with how little effort you've put into answering questions in detail, and how much you seem to rely on just calling people names: "crazy", "denier", etc.

       The plane and the people were destroyed in the sky by a missile.  The plane was meant to go into WTC7 but got delayed in airport congestion, because it was late it had to be shot down.  This of course caused the nightmare of performing a controlled demo on WTC7 with no place crashed into it, this has since raised many eyebrows.

       Hunt is not a historian. He retreads old claims and work from decades ago, but he has no ability to interpret or understand documents. He's a troubled kid, a self-admitted mentally ill delusional. I wish him no harm, but I refuse to have any contact with him.

       How is he "mentally ill"?

      <p>
       A lot of geniuses are "mentally ill" by our modern, silly standards. Much of the time it simply means they're geniuses.

      <p>
       Calling someone mentally ill is, 9 times out of 10, just a personal attack because the person making the attack has no real argument against the argument of the person they are attacking.

       I didn't call Hunt mentally ill. He called himself that at his trial. His defense was that he's psychotic. I'm not sure why you somehow (bafflingly) want to hold me responsible for his words.

       The Leuchter Report was faulty, and Leuchter himself is kind of a moron, but the report's essence was supported by subsequent (better) tests. At this point, the question isn't "are there blue stains in the krema walls that indicate high Zyklon usage," but rather "why AREN'T there blue stains." So far, supporters of the "Auschwitz as killing factory" theory have yet to satisfactorily answer that question.

       I do not understand why you have to refer to people as morons and mentally ill. That is what I expect to read on a FB page where people do not know how to or appreciate debate. Really discredit by name calling? I think it begins to make your current work irrelevant.

       Leuchter's tests - the first - were devised and carried out under serious time constraints. Cole is correct when he says that there are better tests (e.g. Rudolf).
      </p>
      <p>
       However the Leuchter report doesn't merely consist of chemical tests, but an expert analysis of the structures and design of the alleged "gas chambers" also. As someone whose small company was the top/only supplier of equipment (and design consultant) to the US states using cyanide gas for executions, Leuchter was uniquely qualified to assess the structures.

        In the past, he had been contracted by governmental authorities of several states of the United States to improve the design of instruments for capital punishment,  but no longer does so, primarily because of his lack of any formal engineering experience, but also because of charges of running a "death row shakedown" in which Leuchter threatened to testify for the defense in capital cases if he was not given contracts for his services by the state.

       If there had been more used, and there had been more time for the reaction to complete, you probably would have seen the identical formations as the gas chambers. In fact, this is backed up by the Krakow report, where they found very significant traces of cyanide in both the delousing and gas chambers.

       Honestly? No. The JDL is done, my book makes it clear that I was never a "denier," and anyone who follows my work knows that I'm slowly killing myself with booze anyway. Murdering me would be like killing Kirk Douglas. Better to just wait and let time take its course. I have indeed received hate mail from my former GOP colleagues, but they're all pussies. They masturbate to their guns; they don't use them.

       Why would the Jews want to inflate holocaust numbers? What are the more closer estimates then the 6 million? Any interesting facts about the Holocaust that is never talked about because it's negative to Jews?

       All wartime casualty numbers need reexamination. 80,000,000 deaths under Mao? 20,000,000 under Stalin? These are estimates, based mainly on demography, not bodies. We are lucky in the case of the Holocaust to have the Korherr Report, ordered by Himmler to provide an exact (or as exact as possible) number for Jewish dead by early 1943. We get a figure of a little under 2.5 million. Add the Jewish deaths from then until 1945, and my rough estimate is 3 million.

       I've done no fact checking but here's a snippet that gives one possible explanation..
      </p>
      <p>
       “Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must ‘vanish’ before the state of Israel can be formed. ‘You shall return minus 6 million.’ That's why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the ‘sacred 6 million’ is an attempt to transform the holocaust story into state religion… Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in ‘burning ovens,’ which the judicial version of the holocaust now authenticates… ‘Without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.’”

      <p>
       Do you think exterminating jews was any part of Hitler's plan?
      </p>

       I think Jews were indeed killed in the "Reinhardt" camps. I think this task was delegated to Himmler, but Hitler approved the broad outline. I doubt he was ever informed about the specifics, though. I don't buy David Irving's assertion that Hitler was "in the dark." I think he approved the general idea, but the specific details were delegated to Himmler, who delegated to Globocnik, etc.

       The use of the word 'NAZI' is  a derogatory slur, vague and of little use in true fact finding and inquiry into the history of WW2. Can we agree to have a larger and less bigoted scope in this Q&amp;A session David?

       I haven't been in touch with him since my "outing," and I'm not sure that, under his current legal situation in Germany, he can "associate" with revisionists. I have not attempted to contact him, for fear of getting him in trouble. His wife Ingrid, though, does not like my book! She's a bit dotty, though, so no harm no foul.

       It's certainly possible that I could be arrested or prosecuted. Certainly in "free and democratic" Germany. But no trip abroad is in the cards right now, so I don't think about it much.

       I have not kept up with his life at all. It's not even on my radar. My feeling is, I can afford to be clownish, because I was outed against my will. The "I don't want to be here" card buys a lot of leeway.

       OK, straight up, david, can you debunk anything the neo nazis say? not the retarded cointelpro ones, the coherent ones, like andrew anglin? if hitler didn't do a holocaust then... was he not right? have you seen "adolf hitler the greatest story never told" (you are in it)? do you agree with biologist james watson that subsaharan africans, who consistently test below 75 IQ, have less IQ then whites who have around 100+? Do you believe that europe is being invaded currently and whites genocided in eu, USA, SA, etc? I'm not pushing this agenda I just want to hear how you argue against it... If you can present any sort of coherent argument I would love to believe these people are wrong but I see no one able to address these big questions taking in all the factors, so decompartmentalized, are you and all this other information not proving that hitler was right about most if not everything?

       Awhile back you asked Facebook if you should out someone big time that sent you a message that they agreed with your views. I think they were deceased? What happened with that outing?

       I think you are referring to Mel Gibson's father and it seems to be in poor taste. A cheap shot for more publicity. Why not out more of those whom outed him? Unless he has an agenda like those that wanted him to shut up and sit down so badly all those years ago.

       David, as you may know, there was an influx of liberal atheists into the ranks of the neoconservative party's strident propaganda machine post 911.  This happened just in time to push the Iraq and afghanistan invasions on all fronts.  Im talking of people like Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris.  Even
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2yBfBQ1.png">
        Richard Dawkins
       </a>
       has jumped on the bandwagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people, except Hitchens (rip), are still used today as leverage to move the maleable young left towards a rightwing agenda, mainly zionism and colonialism in the middle east.  The same could be applied to fence-sitters and holocaust doubters.  Since you became a neocon about the same time they did, do you have any knowledge of what their price might have been, were they blackmailed, or was it just all an incredible coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do you think of the Da Vinci code as a manufactured tool of catholicism to validate the existance of Jesus by using controlled opposition?  Creating controversy about the Jesus' story, but at the same time cleverly setting in stone that he actually existed?
      </p>
      <p>
       See a parallel there, by the way?

       That's useful thanks.  Was it put to a vote?  How did he get in there?

       How can someone who's not even willing to entertain the notion of a well known, if not completely proven, conspiracy be a mod here?  It's crazy.

       Incidentally, I was banned a couple days ago for making a half-veiled aside which attacked the talmud and the "chosen ones".  Not even a warning.  It all makes sense now.

       Do you have any comments on the Jew World Order? It seems that "elite" Jews play a key role in the New World Order, and it seems that they have been at the forefront for millennia. To what extent is the grand conspiracy of the ages toward world rule Jewish?

6 million deaths are the ones at least accounted for. realistically the death total of just those with Jewish ancestry was someplace in the 100's of millions.

       The anti-revisionist laws in many countries are foul and stupid. They exist as part of a larger picture of political correctness that also outlaws "Islamophobia," "homophobia," "racism," etc. Thankfully, here in the U.S. the First Amendment has held firm in the face of attempts to limit political speech. Other nations are not so fortunate.

       Anti-Zionist does not mean anti-jew. Present day Israel is disgusting, a blockage on the Palestinian people that only "allows" them 2400 calories worth of food per person per day on top of numerous other restrictions. Blowing them up by the hundreds for every one Israeli they are blamed for killing. I cannot believe David openly admits to being a Zionist, let alone anyone else who considers themselves a historian.

       In 1990 a forensic analysis was performed at Birkenau using microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from (suspected) extermination chambers, delousing chambers, and a control group. The control group tested negative while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal gas chambers. This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.

       Because it takes more gas and more time to kill lice than humans, since lice are more resistant to cyanide. Because of this, it's more likely for the formation of Prussian blue to form, since it's not a particularly favourable reaction.

       It's most likely because they either never saw it (again, two sites, and not even major ones at that), or just do not care, as it's so obviously sketchy it's not even funny, and they have given literally no proof that it's real aside from telling us that "we totally got this from an insider source who we can't talk about and who is super real, we swear".

       Yes IMO it is no different although in the US's case the soldiers and the citizens thought they were liberating iraq but the CFR/builderberg/illuminati/bush/rockerfellar/rothschild/mossad whoever decision it was to invade instead wanted to divide, destabilise, kill and profit (Haliburton, Carlisle group). it was planned many years ago.

       It's that neither report is actually good, since both rely on the exact same flaw. To be fair, Rudolf at least tried to fix up the other issues aside from the glaring issue of only looking for Prussian Blue, which Leuchter has absolutely no clue what he was doing.

       Look, clearly you're convinced it's a fake. You're welcome to that opinion. Maybe you need to get in touch with Richard Green or Andrew Mathis (or J. Markiewicz, W. Gubala, J. Labedz, et al!) and point it out to them - perhaps for 23 years they have simply not noticed! :)

       If you think the IHR is in any way at the center of revisionist scholarship then you're more clueless than I'd initially thought. The best research is done by the Europeans.

       No journal? What are you talking about, dude? Seriously, email Richard Green, I'm sure he'd be happy to correspond with a fellow cult-member. He can probably set you straight on a few things.

       The point is that Exterminationists such as Green are now at a point where they
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       that the results of Rudolf - and first Polish test - as  correct in not finding iron-cyanide residue in the "gas chambers".
      </p>
      <p>
       As you know, their angle is that "not enough gas was used, because, um, lice and stuff" and therefore that explains the results. Again, the results are not in dispute -- just the interpretation of the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they
       <em>
        admit
       </em>
       in the second test that they specifically excluded testing for iron-cyanide compounds, and attempt to justify that decision. This is the test which you claim "confirms gassings"!

      <p>
       Get it?

       You're quibbling over an irrelevant point.

       6 is a Talmudic magic/power number.  People through around 6 million this and that concerning alive and dead Jews in Russia and Germany.  They just really like that number.  Now its a symbol of loyalty.

       Well, it is since you've been gamed by Nazis for
