        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does it seem suspicious to anyone else that after linking the &quot;North Korean Sony &quot;hacking&quot; false-flag to the MPAA&#39;s Project Goliath (the MPAA and the US government orchestrated the hack to keep the media occupied while this brazen Internet censorship plan went into effect), suddenly this NYPD shooting is taking up all the TV news time? </p>

<p>The timing seems quite coincidental, and if you watch the news conference you can see the people speaking (namely the NYPD Police Commissioner) appear overly emotional and appear to switch emotions almost on cue, something actors are trained to do. The photos from the crime scene are also suspicious... One you can see the &quot;blood&quot; on the &quot;suspect&quot; is not the right colour. </p>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>Judging by the seemingly automatic downvotes I must be on to something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just another day in PTSD America, keep the people afraid and confused. It could be a false flag or it could be legit. After Ferguson (Mike Brown) and the killing of Eric Garner, people are starting to take matters into their own hands. This could be a legit incident of a man retaliating and encouraging others to do so as well. If this is the case, and becomes a trend, then we are in for some bad times. All it would take is for a couple incidents to happen before there is an all out war between LEO&#39;s and us. And this is definitely possible, because in inner city areas where gangs are prevalent, there is already this mentality.</p>

<p>There are multiple chessboards being played right now, and this fits into the homeland/civil rights chessboard. I don&#39;t personally think it was a false flag, I think it was legit and they will use this to slam the hammer down. &quot;Never let a crisis go to waste&quot; - Rahm Emanuel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s examine the facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The suspect in NY was supposedly acting in revenge for the Garner case.  </p></li>
<li><p>Both officers killed were minorities </p></li>
<li><p>The suspect in NY also killed his girlfriend for <em>some</em> reason even though all of his anger seems to be directed at the police</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Seems a little strange to me that someone upset about racially motivated violence form police officers wouldn&#39;t think that a white officer might make a better target.  Nah, this is some horse shit.  I&#39;ll eat my hat if they don&#39;t try to push new legislation or something because of this.  They did this.  Whether they pulled the trigger or got someone else to do it, they knew this was coming.  This is just so they can point and go &quot;look how dangerous our jobs are!  We put our lives on the line every day!  This is why we&#39;re so quick to shoot and this is why we need more guns!&quot;</p>

<p>But people will gobble it up and we&#39;ll lose another right somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I agree I think it&#39;s equally as important that <em>we</em> don&#39;t take this bait either.  If we make him a hero we just give the pigs more ammo against us.  &quot;see! These conspiracy nuts even support a murderer!&quot;.  I think we should chalk it up as a victory and just watch it very closely because there is almost certainly going to be more to this story than what we know right now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel like that&#39;s a dangerous mindset.  It feeds right into their agenda.  They <em>want</em> people to fight back, just not <em>everyone</em>.  If little isolated incidents like this keep occurring, they can paint themselves as brave heroes and justify spending even more money on military hardware.  I think if we want to see any real change we need to get more people to get brave at once.  If we got enough people to wake the fuck up we wouldn&#39;t need to kill anybody.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s a bit of a pipe dream at this point and it seems things are about to start getting very much worse before they ever start getting better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I heard there was an anti-terror drill going on at the time, which is their signature. <del>Need a cite.</del></p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2014/12/20/2-nypd-cops-shot-execution-style-in-brooklyn/">Gunman executes 2 NYPD cops in Garner ‘revenge’</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were working overtime as <strong>part of an anti-terrorism drill</strong> in Bedford-Stuyvesant just before 3 p.m. when they were shot point-blank in the head by lone gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who had addresses in Georgia, Maryland and Brooklyn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has always been like it. Heck, the Sony North Korea hack was a distraction in itself.  I even think that the torture report was a distraction (c&#39;mon, do you really believe they didn&#39;t know all this time?).</p>

<p>So yeah, your idea seems pretty plausible to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because the sony hack story was full of holes and way too many people started questioning it, they decided some story should take its place until people forget about it.</p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s probably legit, but the story is quite obviously being blown out of proportions</p>

<p>Oh, people are focusing on the elections and trying to pay attention to all of the bullshit we&#39;re spewing and trying to expose our lies?  Not any more!  Now people are worried about ebola even though it&#39;s not anywhere near an &quot;outbreak&quot; in most of the world.  Oh the elections are over?  We can stop talking about ebola now.  Oh, the people are pissed off about the torture report?  Not any more!  Now people are pissed off about The Interview!  Oh shit, our Interview plan is falling apart and people are starting to figure out we probably lied about the whole thing!  Not any more!  By the end of the day people are gonna be talking about the two brave officers that were &quot;assassinated&quot; by some lunatic!</p>
