    <div class="md"><p>David Icke talks/writes about what he claims to have seen and know about. This include reptilians, satanic sex rings, global surveillance, climate change (skeptic), 9/11, etc</p>

<p>Should he censor himself in order to gain public acceptance, and keep silent on what he knows and deems to be important so that he isn&#39;t ridiculed? If he is to do so, why even talk about NSA? Why talk about child sex rings? Why risk the public ridicule?</p>

<p>David Icke obviously knew what was in store for him when he started including reptilians in his work. He knew he would be ridiculed, and that most people would dismiss him as a nutjob, a tinfoil hat, a crazy loony. How could he not, when he worked for the BBC as a media presenter!</p>

<p>Maybe he gets some of it wrong, maybe he got everything right. With regards to reptilians, I haven&#39;t seen them with my own eyes, and there is little documented research to go by, but i&#39;m not going to be so ignorant, so naive, and so stupid as to dismiss him just because to some people, reptilians sounds &#39;crazy&#39; (and british pedophilia, MKUltra, weaponizing of dolphins doesn&#39;t?). A lot of things sounded crazy in their time, but turned out to be factually true. People think David Icke is crazy, and many people also think conspiracy theorists are crazy, stupid and &#39;soft in the head&#39;.</p>

<p>To me, David Icke is a person who turned down a nice cushy job working as a BBC presenter to write about what he thinks is important to humanity, and despite knowing the massive ridicule in store for him, refused to back down and continued fighting the good fight. Maybe some of his stuff turns out be wrong (how many people who write on as broad a range of subjects as David Icke does get everything right?), but even if it were so, he is still a better person and has done far more for humanity than the overwhelming majority of people living on our planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he doesn&#39;t do much as far as lending credibility to the truth movement. I&#39;ve been chagrined when introducing people to conspiracies by how unhinged he comes across as. His books, especially the early ones are quite cringey.</p>

<p>But, you can&#39;t have both. You can&#39;t expose as much as he does and you can&#39;t actually react <em>in a natural way</em> to these revelations without appearing somewhat crazy. I mean really, if your concept of reality was completely congruent with The Official Story<sup>TM</sup> you&#39;d pretty much have a screaming fit as Icke does in text form a number of times in &quot;I am Me, I am Free&quot; <em>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!</em> </p>

<p>Seriously, he wrote that.</p>

<p>But anyway, Icke was the first to introduce me to any of this stuff when I read &quot;The Robot&#39;s Rebellion&quot; in 1994. It totally blew me away and I&#39;ve been an ardent truth seeker ever since. Thanks, David! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite (and even partially because of) all of the backlash he receives, he is a brave man.  I don&#39;t know about his &quot;reptilians&quot; theory, whether he uses it as a metaphor in order to protect himself or whether he actually believes it or any other number of things, but there is no doubt that he has been <em>spot on</em> with many of the other things he&#39;s said over the years.</p>

<p>He has been talking about these pedophilia rings for decades, literally, and he&#39;s one of very few people who have done so.  All of the attempts that have been made to discredit him over the years actually scores him a few points with me to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, I mean, I had never really listened to any of his lectures or anything, but after seeing a VICE documentary (though I don&#39;t trust VICE for shit since Murdoch got involved), I decided to look him up.</p>

<p>He has quite a few lectures on youtube and they are all great. Most of the stuff he talks about is very smart and when he begins to spitball some of his wilder theories, even those take great imagination and he seems to understand and make it known to the audience when he cannot back something up with anything more than his gut.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have heard almost nothing about the &quot;lizards&quot; in any of these lectures. It seems that the only people who harp on that are the people who think it is some hilarious way to make fun of a guy they have actually never listened to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve always assumed (I also haven&#39;t personally listened to any of his lectures or read any of his books - yet) that the &quot;repitilian&quot; theory was a metaphor describing the R-complex in the triune brain and people who seem to be predisposed to the traits inherent to the R-complex like greed, aggression, violence, dominance, ritual displays, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, I read about that in &quot;Dragons of Eden&quot; years ago when I was a teen. Very interesting stuff, one of Carl Sagan&#39;s best books in my opinion. I have always taken it as a metaphor and hell, if he really believes that an actual race of lizards run the world, maybe that is just a side-effect of a mind dedicated to thinking outside of the box.</p>

<p>The thing that I never understood is how a person gets <em>entirely</em> discredited based on one crazy thing. How many crazy things do people think all around the world. The Pope, the President, various Kings, etc...</p>

<p>Its not like anyone on the planet doesn&#39;t have some crazy ass belief about something or other, and franky, if you don&#39;t, then there is something wrong with you. Every person should have an imagination and if it does not go too far sometimes then that means a person isn&#39;t using it. And using your imagination is a cornerstone of critical thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest and admit I&#39;ve never actually seen any of his videos or read any of his books.  The only people I really hear talking about &quot;reptilians&quot; are people making fun of conspiracies or trying to discredit his work.  It seems possible that he was misled at some point but the other possibility is that he purposely uses &quot;reptilians&quot; as a metaphor in order to protect himself.  The third possibility is that he&#39;s actually right, although I have to agree that I doubt it.</p>

<p>The only thing that gives me pause is that what I have heard of him, and of the articles and things of his I have read, display a high level of intelligence, insight, and knowledge of history and global affairs.  So all in all I&#39;m not sure what to make of him.</p>

<p>I have his book &quot;Perception Deception&quot;, I&#39;ve gotta read it one of these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to youtube and search &quot;Arizona Wilder David Icke&quot;, that was the chick that started the whole reptilian bs and Icke was naive enough to run with it without hard proof. It was really his mistake and he&#39;s paid immensely for it. He the &quot;reptilian&quot; guy now and that&#39;s hard to live down. Obviously, he no longer talks about the reptile aliens (at least not in recent interviews and videos I&#39;ve seen, never read any of his books).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I&#39;ll definitely check it out.  So basically he&#39;s retracted his position on &quot;reptilians&quot;, or at least doesn&#39;t openly espouse it anymore, and yet it&#39;s still used to attack his credibility <em>constantly</em>?  This just makes me even more convinced that he&#39;s onto something.  I really need to look at some more of his work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He just went mum completely on it without ever explaining it. When its brought up in interviews now he just changes the subject asap. Its obvious that he&#39;s embarrassed about it and it really has tainted his whole catalogue of work, its an unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>You should check out his interviews with Arizona Wilder from the early 90s. She&#39;s the one (if not the first at least one of them) that started it off. Obviously she has disappeared into the woodwork since.</p>

It really was his fault he got duped but he no longer talks about it and his lectures are much better for it.

<p>I don&#39;t know if <em>he</em> has been attaching those ideas to the conspiracy movement.

I get the same false prophet vibe from Icke as I do from Alex Jones. They give me the creeps. They are charismatic and can talk for hours, but in the general public&#39;s mind their personalities and ideas are forever attached to those who don&#39;t accept state/corporate-sponsored &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>On a related note, I find the issue of organized pedophilia/sex abuse to be as important as things like 911 Truth. Maybe a lil sub could be dedicated to this. I imagine it would be relatively small but full of passionate and enraged users, and a centralized subreddit would be a great way to keep tabs on new developments!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reptilians are in no way meant to be taken as a metaphor. They do exist and are the main force responsible for controlling this reality. Funny that the people who give him stick or claim that is garbage usually haven&#39;t actually read one of his books. They have watched a five minute youtube clip (often not even made by David anyway) and feel they are qualified to make a definite decision on their existence. Pretty shit reasoning to be honest. David is a brilliant man and one day you will see just how right he was. </p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the &#39;outlandish&#39; reptilians and other alien species I recommend looking up Simon Parkes on youtube. He is a man who claims to have experienced these beings first hand. (I believe him entirely). </p>

<p>People who hold crazy outlandish opinions right next to little known but truthful ones. That way, as the idea becomes popularized, it is coming from a controversial and non-credible source and so people will remember it as false. </p>

<p>This tactic is effective, as the thing that is actually revealed by actual sources later on will take a while to catch on and face a hill of incredulity already there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, there are different periods of what he said and may or may not reflect his current views.  Like you or I, we change our positions over time when we get better evidence.  But he may still feel that way and to tell you the truth, who is to say he is wrong?  Sure its out there to a lot of people who live in a bubble, I mean people believe in a god but there is no proof of it and these people will kill each other over this belief.</p>

<p>In saying that...</p>

<p>The reptiles is likely a form of superior race or symbolism for an evil group of humans like we may call someone a snake due to their behavior, we don&#39;t mean they&#39;re a reptile but the snake is a symbol.  Make that what you will, but we have always had these sorts of vague words that don&#39;t mean what they say throughout history.  We have seen throughout history that high profile people are likely friends and some may actually have rituals much like a college fraternity has rituals or modern day religious rituals that call on wearing costumes and wearing weird hats.  Humans can be freaky, disgusting to each other, so is it a surprise that a ritual might be possible, even one that evolves blood?  I think its reasonable to say that yes there are some people that rape kids, likely do weird shit with blood as a symbolism to their beliefs.</p>

<p>Not really sure why he doesn&#39;t deserve credit, he has been suggesting that high profile members in our society do rape children and have rituals.  Turns out some politicians do this as well as religious leaders.</p>
