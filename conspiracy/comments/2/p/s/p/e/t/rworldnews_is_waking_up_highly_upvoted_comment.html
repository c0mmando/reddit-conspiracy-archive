    <div class="md"><p>The cognitive dissonance is strong in that thread. </p>

<p>I am In a argument right now on that thread and what&#39;s happening is interesting.  No matter what there are people trying to not call it what it is. They use every term they can find but the one that describes it the best.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy. In this case it&#39;s a conspiracy to rape and kill boys while walking away scot free.  Whether it&#39;s financial manipulation, or big pharama cover ups of new drugs or the myriad of other things fucking over the human race by a collective few. </p>

<p>But no don&#39;t say the word conspiracy then your a nut case and a moron and your opinion is not valid.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is that history is literally nothing <em>but</em> conspiracies.  Think about every major historical event that&#39;s ever happened - the vast majority of them are, by definition, conspiracies to some degree.  It&#39;s the mark of a weak and confused mind to dismiss something on that basis but I don&#39;t blame these people as they&#39;ve been indoctrinated with these ideas every day of their lives.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t easy to overcome the programming and accept that yes, there is true evil in the world and yes, most of it originates from those who rule us and their many minions.</p>

<p>The &quot;elite&quot; have been documented raping and murdering children for literally hundreds of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear and read talk from intelluctual types, people I really admire in most cases, about how unlikely conspiracies are.  The main argument, it seems to me, is that it&#39;s extremely difficult for groups of people to keep secrets.  But, I think one obvious counterpoint to that is compartmentalization.  Theoretically, there may be very few people or only one person in control, with 10s or 100s or 1000s working towards a certain goal that have no idea about said goal.  In this instance, though, the argument about keeping secrets is right, but with an ironic outcome.  The conspiracy is revealed because people can&#39;t keep secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I covered this YEARS ago extensively and was told by everyone that I was just a batshit conspiracy theorist, I also accidentally started that whole &quot;Pedogate&quot; on 4chan, but it spiraled out of control a bit. Good to see that time as proven me 100% correct.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho</a></p>

<p>I would recommend every single person watch this documentary, it shows the exact same thing happening in the United States. This documentary was also BANNED.</p>

<p>Also to quote the experiences in the Liberal party by Father Kevin Lee, the lead witness in the royal commission by Labor in the child sex within the church and person that exposed the church pedophile ring here in Australia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I made a similar mistake with Bill Heffernan but when he started using expletives and telling me Tony Abbott asked him to call, I knew he must be authentic. He talked for a long time and my ear was getting hot from the mobile phone radiation before he even mentioned the reason for his phone call.</p>

<p>He told me he knew about my book exposing pedophilia in the Catholic Church. “You have no idea how deeply the problem has penetrated not just the Church, but the police and the judiciary” he said. “During the Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption the topic of organised crime protected by police led into the topic of organised pedophilia rings in Australia. Suddenly Justice James Wood himself called a halt to proceedings and ordered a break for lunch. After lunch the topic was never returned to, or raised again. The issue would touch too many important people who have secrets they don’t want to be known. You will never get to the bottom of pedophilia in the clergy because too many people in high places are involved…”</p>

<p>“What about if there was a Royal Commission into the Catholic Church?” I suggested as that was what I and many others had been agitating for, for years.</p>

<p>“It’ll never happen” he said. “Labor don’t have the political will and when we return to power we’ll never initiate one. So what are you thinking about doing with your book?” Heffernan asked.</p>
