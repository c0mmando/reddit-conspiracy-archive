       I'm certainly not foolish enough to claim it was anything more than a coincidence. However, it certainly was a remarkable one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/?sort=top">
        Here's the original thread
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355502572&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world">
        here's the book
       </a>
       that I used as a source for this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, the book's author was off with respect to location (he was predicting Phoenix), but the fact that the event happened
       <em>
        11
       </em>
       days before Christmas 2012 is certainly interesting in light of the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the summary that I wrote (disclaimer: I don't
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       this, I just find it interesting):
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       effective that it incapacitated the majority of the world's population. The event was so diabolical, so
       <em>
        grand
       </em>
       , that it brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their "matrix", and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why are the 4 flight numbers on 9/11 so important?
      </p>
      <p>
       11...175...77...93...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and what do they have to do with "the wickedest man in the world",
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">
        Aleister Crowley?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Jachin and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the "Salomon's" Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Crowley's own words: the number 11 is "the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley's name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]"
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn't already).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the
       <em>
        77th
       </em>
       floor of the other tower. We'll get to the 77, but for now what's the significance of 175?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're in the realm of Crowley, let's see what he had to say about 175.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The 'First Method' consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley">
        Here's the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley
       </a>
       . Note that 175 says "On uniting oneself to a Deity."
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I'll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don't count).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again in Crowley's own words: "I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat">
        "The Pet Goat"
       </a>
       in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another "hijacker" trained at. What a coincidence!
      </p>
      <p>
       This "reading" of The Pet Goat was essentially a "Black Mass", a "satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn't leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed ("I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,") during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm's way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers ("Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties")--conjuring the image of
       <a href="http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg">
        The Tower tarot card
       </a>
       --all taking place in..."Paradise," the city of Sarasota's unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked,
       <a href="http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg">
        here's an image that may give you a hint
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!
      </p>
      <p>
       AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, "could not fly at all." And yet he was able to pull off an
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD's accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the
       <em>
        day before
       </em>
       the attacks they they couldn't account for $2.3
       <em>
        trillion
       </em>
       in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is.

        Here's their seal
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       AA77 anyone??
      </p>
      <p>
       From The Book of Lies: "7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Mass anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 "infernal names" of the "Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell."
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west">
        <em>
         77th meridian west!
        </em>
       </a>
       . Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a "New World Order" on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I'm not demonizing
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       evil, I don't believe a number can be inherently "evil." After all, "Symbols don't kill people; people with symbols kill people."
      </p>
      <p>
       Any more 77's we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure most of you are familiar with the "mystery plane" that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001">
        since been identified
       </a>
       as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the "Doomsday Plane".
      </p>
      <p>
       A FOIA request
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac
       <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg">
        form a pentagram!
       </a>
       ...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).
      </p>
      <p>
       So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy's dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the "Deity", hit the 77th floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the
       <em>
        easiest
       </em>
       to associate with the diabolical individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there's an entire
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29">
        Wikipedia page
       </a>
       on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with "93" or will sign correspondences with "93/93" at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It's 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, "represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry").
      </p>
      <p>
       There is of course a
       <em>
        whole
       </em>
       new can of worms to open with respect to the
       <em>
        astrological
       </em>
       importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, more information can be found in this
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&amp;feature=player_embedded#!">
        well-made series of Youtube videos.
       </a>
       In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be "Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       bode well for the people on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       relevant is that TPTB
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       From "The Most Dangerous Book": "Today's Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year's Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius' heliacal rising."
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never guess which date
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were "initiated"...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September
       <em>
        11th
       </em>
       1941.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it's important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word "Sirius?" You betcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you'll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it's overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don't really get how these events work. The
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.

       For more information on the occult significance of the numbers and astrology behind the events of 9/11, I recommend

        this article

       and
       <a href="http://vftb.net/?p=3984">
        this interview

       with the other of another book on this topic (which I haven't read) "Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order".

       As I finished writing this two years ago, the events at Sandy Hook began to unfold...11 days before Christmas.

       That was you! Great post that left an impression. Good example, too, of how deep the discussion on here is allowed to get. Way over the heads of the Bush apologists that wander over.

       I'm a relatively new user on this sub, I tend to lurk and read thread after thread including every comment, often times reading submissions 2 to 3 years old. I found your mega thread and have to say I am impressed and grateful for the contribution. I am interested, as another has said, where you were able to get started in this subject.
Maybe you'll find this video interesting if you haven't already seen it. If you have seen it I would be interested in your thoughts on it.
This video is someones theory on Sandy Hook being an occult ritual connected with the Maya/Aztec

       I love your numerology work, Axol, but I believe flight 93 landed in Cincinnati and was swapped out with a drone:

       That's totally possible...but it doesn't change the numerological aspects of this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What matters is what they
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       us happened. It doesn't matter what ultimately happened to flight 93, what matters in this context was that it

        was
       </em>
       number 93.

       Got any theories on what's coming up next? I think your hypothesis is very interesting. One way of verifying a theory is to see if you can use it to make predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what significant upcoming occult dates are there... and when would you expect to see something happening next?

       without consideration to conventional morality at the time.  Espouse unity with the divine.  And also probably worship one many pagan gods, Saturn, Venus, Mercury but not good ole Jupiter.  Basically do everything counter to Christianity.  To a Christian anything that isn't is going to hell because is satanic.

       I have absolutely no doubt.  I've had other accounts I've had to close because of similar posts they only recently consider to be a form of sedition by stealth legislation.  The intelligence community employs sockpuppets to heroically downsuppress things on a scale that must be automated (reddit bots) and condoned/collaborated with the admins on reddit.  They once cracked my password for a throwaway account, multiple times, as I was engaged in a battle with resetting it.  I PM'd you regarding this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a form of interference that made this orwellian shit-real for me...they were trying to keep me from posting a argumentative essay
       <a href="/r/inthenews">
        /r/inthenews
       </a>
       about how the NSA domestic snooping was a violation of a required business secrecy as it pertained to intellectual property; ie: their snooping was a violation of an implicit non disclosure agreement / privacy expected when developing an idea.  The slipperly slope is where does the gov draw the line between suppressing an idea they deem subversive before it is out.  It's a minority report of ideas, giving them the ability of spotting futureproblem-forthem-ideas, and why wouldn't they use it to squash dissent and subversive antistatusquo novelties?
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       masquerade and brigade this forum specifically as racists, trolls, anticonspiracy theorists (I call them conspiratards, which is what they call me of course), intolerant-sciencefanboys, gmo-proponents (you don't know the science!), they even masquerade as goons and btards which is a real good imitation game thing they are doing.  God help you if you mention anything about psychotronics, psychoenergetics or scalar waves.

       Way to bring it back again, Axolotl_peyotl.  I wish there were a special one-time superupvote like the ugly fairy girl's one time thing from true blood, because I would use it on this 911 mega occult thread.  Whether you read it as legit occultism or as a free thought experiment or like the dan brown crowd as 'kooky fiction', it stands up on its own.  You did a great job here.

      <p>
       Speaking to the 9/11 occult mission of the ruling class to bring about the one ring to rule them all, in honor of their god Saturn, I discovered an interesting related anecdote regarding the tarot in an old 1974 occult book, Andrew Tomas'
       <em>
        Beyond the Time Barrier
       </em>
       .  It said that the tarot represented a forecasting of the overal motif of each century after their advent, which was purported to be originally ancient Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 21 cards shown here starting with
       <em>
        Il Bagattel
       </em>
       representing card 1, or the 1st century BC, and its motif was 'the ancient mystery cults'.
       <em>
        La Papessa
       </em>
       , card 2, 1st century AD was the rise of the Christian church;
       <em>
        IL Papa
       </em>
       card 5, 4th century ad was emperor Constantine, the first pope.
       <em>
        L'Appresso
       </em>
       the 11th century was the crusades; 13th century the rennaissance in
       <em>
        La Temperanza
       </em>
       ; "the fool before the abyss" was the 20th century "IL Matto
       <em>
        ; and finally the 21st century is *IL Mundo
       </em>
       -- the world.  Tomas records this card as 'the space age' / brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Tarot cards did seem to make stunning predictions, Tomas took liberties with some of them. It's too easy to start at 1974 and
       <em>
        make things fit
       </em>
       by looking backwards.  After all, we are looking at symbolism and iconography and there is a certain amount of arbitrariness in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, looking at
       <em>
        IL Mondo
       </em>
       , we see the iconography of a female in the center, holding a 2 colored scarf betwixt her legs; one color in front and a color behind her.  Is she a shemale?  She is encircled by a wreath and sometimes depicted holding a rod.  At the lower corners of the card, a bull and a lion; upper corners an angel and eagle, both with halos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bull represents a strong industry, the lion represents royalty; the angel represents heaven or divinity and the eagle represents ---??  whatever it represented in ancient egypt--Probably ambition or ascention. Not freedom. That's our American additon to the eagle sybolism.  The eagle has a halo also, which means it is connected up to divinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe this tarot card is saying that Gaia will come again--call it Hecate, call it Isis, but this tarot card is called 'the world' and at the center of the world is a female figure, encircled by competing forces of the mundane (industry, royalty) versus the spiritual (heaven and ascention).  Its basically saying that the 21st century will be Alchemical in nature; the unification of opposites, the
       <em>
        coincidencia oppositorum
       </em>
       will occur because of the union of heaven and earth through the ressurection of the female goddess.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case, then unfortunately we are going through the
       <em>
        nigredo
       </em>
       or blackening part of this process where all the bullshit is separated from the goodness.  What remains to be seen is what role the ruling class is playing here?  Our cultural jungian shadow, a catalyst in the process or are they part of the chaff?

       I too read that book, several times and I'm sure will again. I'm with you on not subscribing to the theories but they sure are super interesting. I'm attempting to familiarize myself with the claims he made and from what little I've learned so far it seems a number of these things are correct. Now if only we could find out if our world leaders hold any beliefs in this stuff.

       MH370 also showed some improbable numerical coincidences. It disappeared:
      </p>
      <p>
       on 3/7 (GMT)
flight 370
on a 3700km flight course (CNN)
at 37000ft (flightradar)
      </p>
      <p>
       (37
       <sup>
        4
       </sup>
       - 1) /411 = (number of days since sept. 11, 2001 - or 911)
      </p>
      <p>
       37
       <sup>
        4
       </sup>
       -1 / 4560 = 411
      </p>
      <p>
       too coincidental for me.

       Any number can be given mystical significance. That's not interesting unless you can demonstrate that the parties involved specifically selected a number for the given reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also the case that in an event as large as this, you'll find any pattern you want to, as long as you're willing to exclude the majority of the data.

      <p>
       How about you don't arm-wave and just include facts.

      <blockquote>

        Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer)...

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, because any reference to light is a reference to Isis and Lucifer because... of reasons. Still, it's not a conspiracy theory until you've pulled in the Egyptians and Lucifer, so props, I guess.

      <p>
       And you do because you have this inclination to ascribe tremendous importance to every random fact you find. Gotcha.

       I have absolutely no doubt.  I've had other accounts I've had to close because of similar posts they only recently consider to be a form of sedition by stealth legislation.  The intelligence community employs sockpuppets to heroically downsuppress things on a scale that must be automated (reddit bots) and condoned/collaborated with the admins on reddit.  They once cracked my password for a throwaway account, multiple times, as I was engaged in a battle with resetting it.  I PM'd you regarding this.
      </p>

       This was a form of interference that made this orwellian shit-real for me...they were trying to keep me from posting a argumentative essay
       <a href="/r/inthenews">
        /r/inthenews
       </a>
       about how the NSA domestic snooping was a violation of a required business secrecy as it pertained to intellectual property; ie: their snooping was a violation of an implicit non disclosure agreement / privacy expected when developing an idea.  The slipperly slope is where does the gov draw the line between suppressing an idea they deem subversive before it is out.  It's a minority report of ideas, giving them the ability of spotting futureproblem-forthem-ideas, and why wouldn't they use it to squash dissent and subversive antistatusquo novelties?
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       masquerade and brigade this forum specifically as racists, trolls, anticonspiracy theorists (I call them conspiratards, which is what they call me of course), intolerant-sciencefanboys, gmo-proponents (you don't know the science!), they even masquerade as goons and btards which is a real good imitation game thing they are doing.  God help you if you mention anything about psychotronics, psychoenergetics or scalar waves.

       S.K. Bain's book (that this is based on) and Crowley's "777" come to mind.
