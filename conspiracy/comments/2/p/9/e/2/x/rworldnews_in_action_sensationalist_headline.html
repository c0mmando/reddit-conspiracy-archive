        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The r/worldnews article/comment section: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2p7mn0/for_the_second_time_this_year_a_russian_military/?sort=confidence">For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials have said.</a></p>

<p>The Guardian article: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/13/russia-plane-near-miss-passenger-aircraft-sweden">Russian plane has near-miss with passenger aircraft over Sweden</a></p>

<p>Interpreting the media 101: This article immediately (2nd sentence) starts misleading the average reader:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swedish authorities said that on Friday, <strong>a Russian military aircraft nearly collided above southern Sweden</strong> with a commercial passenger jet that had taken off from Copenhagen in Denmark. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sad things is that it actually mentions that it happened in international airspace in 2nd to last paragraph. But try posting that in the comment section, see how much visibility it gets. </p>

<p>The &quot;average reader&quot; skimmed the article <em>at best</em>, at worst they just read the loaded headline. Now we have a front page reddit story, exposed to millions of people, giving one more strike against Russia. When the reality is that it happened in international airspace and even the Swedish Minster of Defense concluded there was no violation.</p>

<p>And that, ladies and gentleman, is how a propaganda machine works. Pumping out these kinds of stories regularly and slowly building a very biased narrative inside of people&#39;s heads. So that when they see the next level of propaganda, they are already ready to accept it as truth.</p>

<p>.............</p>

<p>Swedish Article: <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20141213/near-miss-in-swedish-airspace-concerns-military">Confirmed: Military plane was from Russia</a></p>

<p>Source: <em>The Local</em>, Swedish News in English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The passenger plane nearly crashed into a foreign military aircraft after military air traffic control reported an &quot;invisible&quot; plane was circulating in the area. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s about a Russian military jet. We have identified it via Swedish combat pilots. There are no doubts about what kind of government aircraft it was,&quot; <strong>Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told the TT news agency</strong>.</p>

<p>He added; &quot;This is serious. It&#39;s inappropriate. It&#39;s downright dangerous.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Initial reports stated that the incident took place in the Swedish airspace</strong> but Hultqvist claimed this was not the case </p>

<p><strong>&quot;It was over international airspace. There has definitely not been a violation,&quot; added Hultqvist</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>................</p>

<p>And I am sure that I will be attacked for being &quot;Pro-Putin&quot;. Since when do you have to either accept every anti-Russian piece as fact OR be &quot;with Putin&quot;. Why are there only 2 choices? Why can&#39;t I be skeptical of both sides and point out when one is lying?</p>

<p>The amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare">&quot;Red Scare&quot;</a> logic used on reddit these days in alarming.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter that the US is bombing countries, torturing prisoners, supporting terrorists, and their own government has just signed another massive bill to go oppress more countries, spy on their own citizens, and give banks more freedom to fuck everyone over, but fuck all that, a motherfucking plane in international airspace is literally a Putler terrorist invasion and the biggest threat to world peace.</p>

<p>*Edit: Even the airlines director is wondering what all the fuss is about &quot; It happens in international airspace, and there have military plane allowed to be, so I can not understand all the drama that is about it here&quot; He says even the pilots didn&#39;t care: <a href="http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/cimber-direktoer-passagererne-maerkede-intet-til-kursskifte/5354423">http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/cimber-direktoer-passagererne-maerkede-intet-til-kursskifte/5354423</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no no no.</p>

<p>This is a massive misunderstanding of the difference between international and sovereign airspace, which leads to a dramatically wrong interpretation of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>The difference between &quot;Swedish&quot; and &quot;international&quot; airspace makes <strong>absolutly no difference</strong> to the severity of the incident. None whatsoever. </p>

<p>The fact that early reports label the airspace incorrectly is in <strong>no way</strong> making this an &quot;anti-Russian&quot; piece. The aircraft was reckless and extremely negligent, we&#39;re lucky there wasn&#39;t a collision. Saying that the &quot;reality&quot; is that it happened in international airspace is just weird and shows the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>&quot;Swedish&quot; airspace as a sovereign concept extends to 12 miles from shore, just like with sovereign waters.</p>

<p>Beyond that is international airspace that is split into Flight Information Regions (FIR). Responsibility for the safety of aircraft is split up according to FIR. In this case Malmo FIR, where Swedish controllers ensure that aircraft in international airspace do not collide. 
International airspace doesn&#39;t mean a free-for-all. It just means it&#39;s outside the 12-mile limit. Controllers are still responsible for separation, pilots are still obliged to follow clearances and instructions, and unidentified traffic that&#39;s not showing up on radar, closing in on civilian aircraft is extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Example - in this incident the estimated distance was around 300 feet. Our <strong>minumum</strong> separation is 5 <em>miles</em>. It is not sensationalist to say that this was an extremely dangerous move by the Russian aircraft.</p>

<p>The Russian aircraft deactivated it&#39;s transponder, which makes it impossible for controllers to safely guide traffic in the airspace. This is an incredibly dangerous, foolhardy and unforgivable action, and the fact that early reports labelled it as &quot;Swedish&quot; airspace rather than &quot;international&quot; makes no difference.</p>

<p>For the severity of the incident keep reading the second article</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Suddenly the military plane took a sharp turn and the way I understood it is that there was about a minute from being a collision course with a passenger plane,&quot; Daniel Josefsson, who works in combat management at the combat control centre in Luleå, told the newspaper. </p>

<p>After becoming aware of the foreign plane the military air traffic control centre gave a frantic message to their counterparts in civilian air traffic control.</p>

<p>&quot;Our staff gave them a clear recommendation - &#39;do something, turn away&#39; - the civil traffic controller then did that,&quot; added Micael Bydén to TT.</p>

<p>The situation is very similar to an incident in March this year when a Russian military plane nearly collided with an SAS plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;This incident in the spring was way too close, maybe 100 metres or less. In this instance we managed to avoid it getting that close,&quot; said Bydén.</p>

<p>OP - read up on how airspace structure works, if you like I&#39;d be happy to type more. But what we have here is a basic misunderstanding leading to conclusions that aren&#39;t reasonable.</p>

<p>Source - ATC working in Western Europe. This kind of thing gives me nightmares.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But Ops post had this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Initial reports stated that the incident took place in the Swedish airspace but Hultqvist claimed this was not the case &quot;It was over international airspace. There has definitely not been a violation,&quot;</p>

<p>So basically what they did was not nice, but nothing like what the entire point of OPs post is: that reddit is hysterical with Putin hate over his plans of world domination and baby eating.</p>

<p>I get that you know your stuff. But most people do not and it absolutely changes the tone of the story for <em>them</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the article is clear about the severity. Crystal clear. </p>

<p>Your post has the idea that saying it happened in Swedish rather than international airspace makes it an inherently anti-Russian piece. That&#39;s not borne out by the article at all. Neither is it borne out by the events.</p>

<p>The read the comments, particularly the top hundred or so. The proof is in the pudding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re ascribing an awful lot of meaning to a mistatement of what is essentially aeronautical legal geography.</p>

<p>The details of the story that describe the aircraft turning off the transponder and coming within 100 metres of civilian traffic just might have something to do with people&#39;s response.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve e-mailed in to the AP corrections slot. I&#39;d suggest the same to you.</p>
