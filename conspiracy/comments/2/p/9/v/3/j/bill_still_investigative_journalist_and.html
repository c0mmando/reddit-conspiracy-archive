        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">196</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-12-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Orangutan.html">Orangutan</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bill Still is a former newspaper editor and publisher. He has written for USA Today, The Saturday Evening Post, the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, OMNI magazine, and produced the syndicated radio program, Health News. He has written 22 books and three feature-length documentary videos.</p>

<p>Still reveals the greatest rip-off in history: the real ways in which money and debt are created and controlled. Jekyll Island argues the case that economic depressions are abnormal, that nations across the globe do not need national debt, and that governments are not printing too much money, but borrowing wildly.</p>

<p>In the face of mounting debts and a reduction in the standards of living worldwide, he explains that those who are profiting from this crippling financial problem, want us, the public, to remain confused about what money really is and how it was created. However, Jekyll Island’s good news is the claim that we can fix this global problem, without wars or a revolution; just a clear understanding of the problem and its surprisingly simple solution.</p>

<p>In 1996, we produced the highly acclaimed documentary, The MoneyMasters. It predicted the economic events that are just starting to befall this country. This is now considered THE classic work on monetary reform. Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman guided us during the editing process for this 3 hour 23 minute documentary and provides his endorsement of it on our website.</p>

<p>Jekyll Island: The Truth Behind the Federal Reserve unravels the secretive 1913 formation of the privately owned Federal Reserve and the creation of National Debt by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller and Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., at Jekyll Island in Georgia, USA .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no shortage of them on topics such as this. Take two of the most famous: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence</p>

<p>If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. -Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both fake. </p>

<p>If this credulity was shown towards the documentary, it would be known very easily that quotes such as Wilson&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m a most unhappy man&quot; are fake, instead of being repeated. And that doesn&#39;t even touch on the bad economics he spouts. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what-just ask him in the AMA that is in a few days. That will end any ambiguity, unless you think the guy doing the AMA isn&#39;t him either.</p>

<p>Well thats a tune changer, he made no such mention of that in Seattle. With that said, just a hunch from a personal take on documentaries, could not many of them use some updating, or all they home run hitters with no mistakes. I have always believed that discretion must at all times be used on any subject matter, and left to the individual to further his or her knowledge. History is like conceptual semantics, I wasn&#39;t around to witness the facts, so I have to break it down through various avenues of information to come up with the simplest lie possible, which I then feel <del>is</del> maybe the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>This user is trying to incite folks against the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods.</p>

<p>The users that were supposedly &quot;banned&quot; by the mods here for &quot;asking questions&quot; actually ended up getting shadowbanned by the reddit admins. </p>

<p>Notice how the account is 2 days old...that&#39;s when the shadowbans occurred. </p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to make an &quot;issue&quot; out of the fact that Cole identifies as a Zionist, when that&#39;s been common knowledge about Cole for decades. </p>

<p>This same group of folks were the ones who initially tried to discredit us for having a &quot;neo-nazi&quot; for an AMA.</p>

<p>When it became clear that he&#39;s nothing of the sort, they reversed course and chose the Zionist route instead.</p>

<p>The amusing thing is their laziness...if they had actually taken two seconds to look up David Cole, they would&#39;ve learned that he&#39;s a Zionist Jew and that he dismisses a large amount of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Again, the goal of folks like this is to sow the seeds of discontent here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice though...it&#39;s extremely indicative that we&#39;re doing something right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, the problem is that the production of money is monopolized by the state, not <em>just</em> that there&#39;s interest to be paid back on every dollar created. There is quite literally no power more coveted than the control of money. The real solution is to legalize competition in the production of money. </p>

<p>Of course, the state will never willingly give up that power which is why personally I think the way to defeat the powers that be, the illuminati or whatever you want to call them is to disengage from their money. IMHO I think bitcoin has some very real potential to peacefully create the separation of money and state in the same way we have separation of church and state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is but money will always be influenced by trading. Unless you want to become isolationist. Which I am all for. Globalism is a scam. It&#39;s used by the wealthy to fix rates and let them destroy economies and wages. However, even under globalism, if your money is backed by something solid it can work. Like under the NSDAP in Germany, they based their money off of services and labour provided. They were surrounded by sanctioning nations but their society grew despite that and they began barter trading with neighbours who recognized their strength. Money is imaginary. The people behind it are not. Bitcoin is imaginary and there&#39;s no one behind it. Thus it won&#39;t be effective. And since people already pay taxes, they should get something for it. Like a currency that works for them. Something they don&#39;t need a chip to use and spend. Since America gave away all its gold or rather was forced to give it away to European bankers and investors under FDR, they should think about what the NSDAP did and back their money with something even better. The hard work of the people. You can rig the trading game but labour is labour in any nation. It&#39;s worth a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but that is a pithy amount compared to the $85 billion they were printing every month earlier this year. A small return on money created out of nothing that is used to finance wars and a surveillance state (while overall staying in the red) is not an argument for why the Fed is needed.</p>

Dear Bill Still, thanks for your awesome documentaries! I&#39;m russian and it would be great to hear your view on what&#39;s going on in Russia these days, the ruble has fallen 200% already, seems like a typical managed crisis like US&#39;s great depression,  but the thing is that in RF the heads of it&#39;s Central Bank are put in place by dictator Putin himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have references to back up the historical claims you make in this film? You&#39;ve gotten rid of many of the obvious myths that were in <em>Money Masters</em>, but there are still many questionable statements in it, as well as some clear errors.</p>

<p>(Again, this is in reference to the 2 hour version I saw.)</p>

<p>For example, one quote that you give is said to be in a letter from JP Morgan to his brother, but it is actually <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGC0-ujiR-sC&amp;amp;pg=PA283&amp;amp;dq=%22as+a+man+of+the+world,+I+like+confusion,+anarchy,+and+war.%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=W4STVLvcMJGGNtCGg-gN&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22as%20a%20man%20of%20the%20world%2C%20I%20like%20confusion%2C%20anarchy%2C%20and%20war.%22&amp;amp;f=false">from Henry Adams to his brother</a>.</p>

<p>In another place, you say that only 22% of the House of Representatives stayed to vote on the Federal Reserve Act, but it was actually 78% who stayed and 22% who were absent.</p>

<p>There are quite a few other things that I think are wrong, but if you gave references to support them, I might be convinced.</p>

<p>You claim, about Richard Lawrence, the attempted assassin of Andrew Jackson, that &quot;after his release from prison, Lawrence boasted to friends that powerful people in the banking industry had engaged him for the assassination and promised to protect him if he were caught.&quot;</p>

<p>Lawrence spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum. I&#39;ve never seen this quote before. Andrew Jackson never said anything about suspecting that bankers were behind the attempt.</p>

<p>You claim that the Rothschilds stopped lending in America because they were &quot;incensed by the defeat of the 2nd Bank&quot;, but they were only involved with the Bank of the United States <em>after</em> the defeat of the rechartering. While the Bank was still a national bank, they were associated with Baring. From what I know, the Rothschilds stopped doing business in America several years later, when a state government defaulted on its debt and the federal government refused to do anything about it.</p>

<p>There are many things you say about the Rothschilds that I haven&#39;t seen any good evidence for. You claim, as a few others have, that the Rothschilds had an influence on the Jekyll Island meeting. But is there actually any evidence for this? Or even evidence that they knew about the meeting beforehand? It was claimed that Warburg was their agent, but he denied it when asked, and I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that he was. Certainly it was August Belmont &amp; Company who officially acted in their behalf in America.</p>

<p>You also say something like &quot;Napoleon knew that the Rothschilds would not rest as long he was in power unless ...&quot; The Rothschilds were pretty small players until after Napoleon left power. Did he even know about them?</p>

<p>Even though you have cut out some of them compared to earlier works, there are still quotes and documents you cite that are almost certainly hoaxes. For example, the quote from Salmon Chase, &quot;My agency in promoting the passage of the National Banking Act was the greatest financial mistake in my life,&quot; is unknown until after his death.   The American Bankers Association Memo and the Panic Circular put words in bankers mouths like &quot;farmers will become tenants as in England&quot;, which they would have no reason to say, but make sense if someone is trying to depict them as villains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no shortage of them on topics such as this. Take two of the most famous: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence</p>

<p>If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. -Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both fake. </p>
