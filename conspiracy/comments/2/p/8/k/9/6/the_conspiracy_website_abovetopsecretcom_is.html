        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how many people know that abovetopsecret (ATS)  is controlled opposition.  I&#39;ve searched this sub&#39;s history and although there are posts about it none are very clear or have received many views.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping more people see this and understand that you can&#39;t trust certain or even very many conspiracy or truth sites.  Some are controlled opposition from the beginning, fooling unsuspecting truth seekers into joining the site.  But when any site starts gaining in power, reaching a large amount of people and disseminating truth, then you have to start looking for the signs that the site is being infiltrated (like Reddit).  We know by now that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing">atroturfing</a>, paid shills, and disinformation artists are active on the internet and have been since soon after 9/11.  If you still don&#39;t believe this,  or need more convincing, go <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy">here</a> for more.  But most of us don&#39;t need to be convinced, we all have seen this happening for a long time (and have been laughed at and insulted a lot for pointing it out).  </p>

<p>This is a battle that will only increase in complexity.  The internet is being forced into the mold of a propaganda machine, and a tremendous amount of resources is being spent in order to make it fit.  The truth will become harder and harder to find and/or tease out of the mess of disinformation.  Go <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=irj4Fyd5">here</a> to understand more about disinformation and shill techniques and how to spot them</p>

<p>As for ATS this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16mh2v/is_abovetopsecretcom_run_by_agentscia_something/c7xe6w8">comment</a>, posted in response to someone asking about the possibility of it being controlled opposition, goes over what the group Anonymous exposed about the site.  And this <a href="http://www.insanemedia.net/ats-exposed-above-top-secret-censors-sandy-hook-cointelpro/442">site</a> has compiled a lot of information about it after ATS was blasted for censoring discussion about Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Once we do spot a site like ATS, do not always swear it off forever, because it is good to study these sites and gain knowledge of our enemies and how they operate.  Maybe, if you are good,  you can turn it around and even infiltrate the site yourself...</p>

<p>Remain vigilant friends.  </p>

His products are sensationalized bullshit and the amount of advertisements and commercials I&#39;m forced to sit through every time I try to listen to his show is a joke, but he has some great rants. People label him a shill because he refuses to talk about Zionism but that&#39;s simply because he knows talking about it will lose him probably all of his money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it happens more often than not. When I was on a different account I was the owner of a sub for primarily historical articles on the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Didn&#39;t really cover a lot of the modern topics and the torture stuff, I wanted items that were as uncolored by emotion and outrage media marketing as possible.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t advertize, but eventually picked up a few dozen subscribers anyway. A few months ago my mod inbox showed that someone asked to take over the sub since my account was inactive. I quickly replied I certainly are NOT inactive. A few days later I realized that I wasn&#39;t getting up/downvotes or comments on anything at all regardless of which sub I was in. After about a week total it dawned on my that I&#39;d been shadowbanned globally. About a month after that the new owner of that sub dropped a self post. I was too ticked to really read it. I have no real explanation for what happened. </p>

<p>It almost certainly is currently under &#39;attack&#39; by a group of people using this forum to associate all &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; with neo-nazi holocaust deniers and nazi apologists - basically anything that will make sure the normal, every day John &amp; Jane Average reading reddit will dismiss out of contempt anything that comes from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or categorize any viewpoint or story that goes outside their official social narrative because it&#39;s associated with ridiculous shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine the modern COINTELPRO would still be at it attacking/infiltrating/subverting groups that have dangerous ideas(you know, like the civil rights movement and their idea that black people should have equal rights and not be treated as subhuman were &quot;dangerous ideas&quot; to the US government and the people in their employ), only these days there is no physical group to infiltrate or any leader for them to target, so they would instead want to subvert the effectiveness of any major social forum or outlet that offered a breeding ground for any resistance or &#39;dangerous ideas&#39; - they would want to have one of their own become moderator here, or perhaps a few of their own, they would want to brand this whole subreddit and the topics that it&#39;s founded on as garbage(like jew-hating neonaziism is garbage).</p>

<p>Maybe they&#39;d want to figuratively hamstring us, hang some fly-tape in &#39;the air&#39; here to control and limit the ability of all the individual little flies that come through &#39;this room&#39; with their own little ideas or bits of information by distracting/diverting attention from real issues by promoting ridiculous ones, and catch the flies with the meaningful thoughts &amp; information by making sure it&#39;s associated with things that the majority of society find despicable and retarded, like the recent stickied AMA from a random holocaust denier, while simultaneously discrediting us and the whole topic by association. What a coincidence we have a moderator named Flytape, one named Three_Letter_Agency, and one named &quot;User_Name13&quot;(presumably one of his alts, of his accounts numbered 1-12 and 14-20).</p>

<p>These people (or just the elite intellectuals over at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>) love throwing it in your faces that you&#39;re idiots, and that&#39;s exactly the type of play on words / metaphor that they would think is very clever. Just like how there&#39;s someone(<a href="/u/the_guard">/u/the_guard</a>) inviting people here to a private conspiracy subreddit with no explanation other than &quot;you know why you&#39;re here&quot; named Private PanOpticon - which implies a place for you to post your ideas where you can always be monitored by someone.</p>

<p>They did it with past social movements when they were meeting in front of townhalls or in churches/bars/cafes - they&#39;ll be doing the same thing now when people are meeting in cyberspace and using places on the internet as social forums. It&#39;s obvious that this subreddit is under some kind of attack, it&#39;s full of borderline skinhead BS half the time that somehow consistently gets upvoted to the frontpage, videos from christian fundamentalists embodying the stereotype of &#39;crazy conspiracy theorist nut&#39; making videos about how &quot;the jews are working for satan&#39;&#39; in his hat and robe getup as if he fancies himself pope of his own private church, jew-bashing that isn&#39;t even actually &#39;a conspiracy&#39;, and AMAs stickied by mods from holocaust deniers that 99% of us here have never heard of before. This means there is collusion from the mods here. The other mods should investigate and figure out what&#39;s going on, because right now this subreddit&#39;s greatest effect is subverting and discrediting all the topics discussed here and doing the opposite of what this place was founded for. It&#39;s funny, because they&#39;ll <strong>sticky</strong> that AMA under the guise of &quot;this being a bastion of free speech with all ideas welcome&quot;, but when you try to point something like this out, you get a message from moderator &quot;User_Name13&quot; 3 <em>minutes</em> later telling you to shut up or leave.</p>

<p>This has all happened before and it is all happening again. What happened in the civil rights movement when someone caught on/got wise to it was the agent/provocateur with the agenda would try to silence or ridicule them, or bar them from the group entirely so that they could keep running their little game on the other people involved in it. This subreddit is being subverted, and I just don&#39;t believe there are <em>that</em> many neo-nazis who just all happened to migrate here over the last year or two in order to explain all of this as being organic, so that only leaves a couple other options. An outlet for alternatives to the views/explanations offered by the official social narrative on one of <em>the</em> most major social media websites on the internet would be a prime target for these people, so here we are. It used to be that you could mention 9/11 on reddit and the majority of people on this website knew there was something majorly wrong with the official conspiracy theory offered by the Bush administration to explain it(which was then used as a justification for unspeakable changes in our society, not least of all were the wars based on lies that killed hundreds of thousands of people), now though the majority of people will just link you to the other things that are constantly on the frontpage of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and use that to ridicule and dismiss you, or think you&#39;re one of those neo-nazi hitler apologists - gee, I wonder where they got that idea from?</p>

You&#39;re exactly who I&#39;m talking about, and here you are, dutifully doing your job trying to avoid the actual points in my post and falsely define the context of conversation here  to distract from the real issue. Whether or not &quot;the nazis weren&#39;t nearly as bad as the &#39;official&#39; story&quot; says is totally irrelevant to your life, my life, and everyone else&#39;s life / the world today. Whether the nazis killed 1,000,000 or 6,000,000 jews during WWII is totally irrelevant to your life, my life, and everyone else&#39;s life / the world today. The only purpose that serves is to distract people from real issues that effect our whole society and color anyone talking about them with a neo-nazi brush by association with people like you whether you&#39;re a normal person or someone working for the establishment paid to control online social forums and make sure they don&#39;t have any effect on anything by keeping them less than credible in the minds of average people on sites like reddit.</p>

<p>It only serves to distract from the actual meaningful, productive content that should be on the minds of everyone here that actually <em>does</em> effect all of our lives and our entire civilization while poisoning everything here by association - <strong>which is why there are so many accounts like yours, 1-2 months old with names like Twozerozero and TTrns with posting histories full of borderline neo-nazi skinhead bullshit/holocaust denial/etc.</strong> Here you are, avoiding all of my points while trying to drag people into a diversionary, irrelevant argument that serves no purpose except to associate this subreddit &amp; the people in it with stormfronters/nazi apologists. You say &quot;hating zionism and pointing out ..<em>blahblahblah</em>.. is not being pro-nazi&quot; and your very next statement in the very same sentence is &#39;the nazis weren&#39;t nearly as bad as people say&#39;. It&#39;s hilarious but dumb. You should be banned and someone should find out whose alt you are/who your account actually belongs to. If you&#39;re just a legit poster who just happens to have joined within the month to come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and start posting, upvoting, and pushing nazi apologist bullshit to this subreddit, then know that what you are doing helps no one, doesn&#39;t help you, and will have no productive effect on our lives or our society, but you know, totally keep focusing on that and using your time and energy on it. You and all those other month-old accounts that is, just happening to show up here around the same time we get fake AMAs and stickied holocaust denier posts kept indefinitely at the very top of the frontpage of this subreddit by some mod - coincidentally right around the time we&#39;ve had a couple of new mod recruitment drives, the last one recently and the one before that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assuredly am not posting from a lifetime of indoctrination in the &quot;the establishment&#39;s approved version of history&quot;, I&#39;m posting from a lifetime of knowing that a small racial group comprised of religious/racial supremacists without the power to even form themselves a <em>state of their own</em> until 50 years ago, and even then, who got a strip of land out in the desert surrounded by their enemies <em>doesn&#39;t control the fucking world</em>. You should use your own brain instead of reading books about hating jews or how a single racial group or religious group are responsible for everything that&#39;s wrong the world, because you&#39;re obviously indoctrinated and have stopped using your own ability to reason(if you ever had that at all). </p>

<p>Frankly it&#39;s embarrassing, and there&#39;s a reason why everyone laughs at you. The ideals in &quot;zionism&quot; are absolutely no different than the ideals of any other cultural grouping, many of which <em>have already been carried out</em> and have influenced the world for centuries, formed states, formed empires, and have policed the whole globe before &quot;zionism&quot; even became a thing - but none of you are talking about those other groups and their states or interventions in the wider world(<em>except as it relates to you trying to connect everything to jews, who weren&#39;t powerful enough as a people to even form their own states or raise their own armies for thousands of years, until someone gave one to them and began using it to control the arabs and their Islamic culture that had it&#39;s own power-base in the world separate from the Anglo-American establishment&#39;s</em> - <em>this is what &quot;zionism&quot; and the state of Israel are actually meant to do, and it&#39;s the real reason why you aren&#39;t allowed to criticize Israel here in the west - it&#39;s very simple</em>). You are short-sighted and looking for a simple solution to your anxieties and political frustrations, so here you are. You are looking at something and seeing it completely backwards, in a way that is totally unproductive, and so my friend I think it&#39;s safe to assume that you are the one who has been tricked by the establishment.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and there are anti-Semites pretend to just have a problem with Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure there are, but there are a lot of things that get brandied around as &quot;antisemitic&quot; that aren&#39;t necessarily antisemitic at all. Like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Criticizing the largely Jewish-run film industry for its &quot;blacklisting&quot; of celebrities who support the Palestinian cause. Recognizing that an industry has a tremendous presence of Jews in it is no more antisemitic than pointing out that the NBA is dominated by blacks is racist.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling out the tremendous influence that Jewish interest groups (AIPAC, ADL, etc.) have on our government</p></li>
<li><p>Holocaust denial. In and of itself, denying the currently accepted version of the Holocaust is not an anti-semitic act. Claiming that certain parts of history may have been exaggerated to further political causes is not a hateful claim. Otherwise, every 9/11 conspiracy supporter would be anti-American by definition.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Antisemitism (also spelled anti-Semitism[1] or anti-semitism) is prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews as a national, ethnic, religious or racial group.&quot; - Wikipedia</p>

<p>You can hold all of the views above (and many more) without actually hating Jews as an ethnoreligious group. Furthermore, some Jews can be very antisemitic as well, such as some of the Israeli protestors who don&#39;t want black Ethiopian/Somalian Jews to share their ranks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a black and white issue.</p>

<p>Probably because you&#39;re a part of a vote-rigging brigade and a group of people trying to pretend all of this irrelevance, unproductive, discrediting bullshit is actually a legitimate or organic part of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Ever since about a year and a half ago this subreddit has been under attack and <em>immediately</em> there was a change when all of a sudden the frontpage was full of laughable bullshit and anti-jewish fervor/holocaust denial/hitler apologists <em>constantly</em>, all the threads having lots of 1-month, 2-month, or 2-day old accounts posting in them in a game of &quot;let&#39;s-pretend-this-is-organic-and-people-actually-think-this-here&quot; - and here you are again, what a surprise that is. </p>

<p>Magically my little post in an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread that had 7 replies total at the time received 8 replies from people like you in a matter of a few hours and overnight has 70+ replies in total, most of which posted with accounts that have a very short posting history focused on very specific topics - that&#39;s the largest number of replies I&#39;ve ever gotten in this subreddit, even though I&#39;ve had my posts golded here multiple times. Most of the replies being attempts to shift the topic onto something totally irrelevant and discredit or detract from the whole conversation without ever addressing any of the points being raised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Jewish people today are medern/moderat/secular Jews (they take the good and leave the bad).</p>

<p>However, most of the &quot;Jews&quot; in power are (political/Rothschild) Zionists pretending to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Jewish people and evil (political/Rothschild) Zionists are not the same thing! This above mentioned form of Zionism is a very racist, genocidal, greedy, self-serving, unsympathetic, sociopathic, psychopathic, and fundamental ideology. There are Zionists that are not claiming to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, but &quot;Christian&quot; (faux Christian), such as the Bush Family and Biden. Many of the Zionists claim to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, in part, to discredit any and all critics with a dismissive conversation ender by calling them &quot;anti-Semites&quot;. Zionists that claim to be Jewish are about as Jewish as terrorists claiming to be Muslim (as in, not at all true to the (modern/secular/moderat) religions).</p>

<p>Part of the plan by these (political/Rothschild) Zionists that claim to be Jewish is to have the masses hate actual Jewish people and Israel for their atrocities; The average uninformed/missinformed person may mistake these Zionists as true Jewish people, and falsely blame humanist Jewish people for all of the atrocities of the Zionists (War, Coup de tats, Usery, human rights/constitutional defying laws/policies/actions, etc.).</p>

<p>The three big (political/Rothschild) Zionist Occupied Governments (ZOGs) are the USA, the UK, and Israel. Many other countries are also controlled, owned, and operated by the Zionists (through Central banking, mega corporations that politically lobby federal politicians, mainstream media, etc.). Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.</p>

<p>The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.</p>

<p>Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).</p>

<li><p>our entire civilization in the modern world lied into multiple wars/occupations that killed hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands of Americans, and wasted $6 trillion</p></li>
<li><p>the economy and black-budget in terms of someone using our economy to fund a separate economy, this break-away group using trillions of dollars siphoned out of what people think of as the &#39;real&#39; economy using all means available, not least of all mortgage fraud so bad that it rocked the entire financial system in recent history</p></li>
<li><p>the way that the voting system is rigged and the candidates you are allowed to vote on are first picked by others, and both are picked by the same people to provide a false dichotomy/false opposition, and falsely contextualize the entire &#39;political debate&#39; and social narrative in America to distract from real issues, while any <em>alternative</em> view is almost entirely ruled by or jumped on by people who do nothing but offer distraction and diversion/pointless conflict to keep us(the people) from ever organizing or becoming too homogenized in our ideas about the crimes that are obviously being perpetrated against the American people. People at the top of the establishment benefit greatly from the masses at the bottom being in constant conflict with <em>each other</em> rather than realizing their real conflict should be with the people who have made their way to the top who are destroying the lives/families/future of the common folk at the bottom who they view as cannon-fodder.</p></li>
<li><p>the way the media serves as nothing more than a medium of exchange between the financial elite who owns it and the masses who don&#39;t, and as a &#39;media&#39; through which one class can influence the thinking of the other. the way the media endorses an official social narrative that ridicules and tries to discredit any discussion about either of the above topics - incidentally sometimes by connecting it with neo-nazis on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>the fact that our entire culture of new laws is backwards and full of Newspeak, like the Patriot Act, the Victory Act, the operations &quot;Operation Freedom&quot; and &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; which killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people and killed or maimed for life tens of thousands of American kids in the armed services, all while basically instituting a covert form of martial law.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And fucking thousands of things that I don&#39;t feel like typing out that are <em>infinitely</em> more relevant and important than whether 1,000,000 or 6,000,000 jews were killed by Hitler in WWII, or whether Hitler was secretly a kitten-lover and enthusiast at heart, or whether a school shooting was actually a drill publicized as a real incident. Those things are analogous to leaking faucets in a house that is on fire and <em>currently burning down</em>. Most of those things are used to discredit and detract from any discussions about the issues I listed, which is funny seeing as they&#39;re mostly discussed by people with brand new reddit accounts 2 days old, 1 month old, 2 months old, etc. Either they&#39;re people who don&#39;t understand the seriousness of what is happening here in your own society, or they&#39;re paid agents of the establishment trying to fill this forum/social outlet up with near-meaningless distractions and diversions which are used to simultaneously distract the people who are actually users here organically while also discrediting them/us all by association.</p>

<p>Your own account, DumbledoreSays, is one of them. DumbledoreSays, redditor for 2 months.</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t think people were shot in that theater? You don&#39;t think anything happened at the Boston Marathon? You should go and look up what the word &quot;hoax&quot; means, because I don&#39;t think it means what you think it means. </p>

<p>..then you immediately connect those things with &#39;who was really behind 9/11&#39; - this is what I think your type is here to do - there is an attempt at associating real issues effecting our entire civilization and everyone in it with a. bullshit, b. racism, c. lunacy in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and &#39;alternative view&#39; social forums the internet-wide, while adding a bunch of irrelevant argument and minor distractions that you treat as major events to the pot and then trying to mix it all together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get real. The Jews have always worked for the Protestant establishment. You want a global, far reaching conspiracy look to Protestantism not Zionism. Any -ism sucks but as far as scope of power Catholicism, Islamism, and Zionism can not compare to Protestantism.</p>

<p>But Confucianism is really giving the Protestant (USA and UK) establishment a run for its money. The U.S. has no real answer to China, because the U.S. has no clue about how China and its power structures are organized. It&#39;s like comparing the Mafia to Triads and Tongs. </p>

<p>The Chinese own the entirety of Asia, mostly through soft power but hard power (aircraft carriers) are catching up. I&#39;m in Thailand right now and the bulk of the elite here, the land and business owners, are of Chinese descent. Same in Malaysia, same in Vietnam, same in parts of Indonesia. </p>

<p>Now they are taking over the USA. While ignoramuses complain about Mexicans stealing landscaping jobs wealthy Chinese are buying up property coast to coast. Canada too. Ever been to Hongcouver? Toronto? CHINESE. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not anti Chinese. I am fascinated with Chinese culture and history. Martial arts, herbalism, the language, etc. I am in awe, and that is what I mean by this post. It&#39;s just so funny to me that the Chinese are basically doing what Hitler feared the Jews would do if left unabaited. </p>

<p>I personally welcome the Chinese and think they have a lot to offer the world from their long and ancient cultural history. I&#39;m just writing this post to demonstrate how myopic people are who focus on Jews as the source of all the world&#39;s problems.</p>

<p>Protestantism (sun never sets on the British empire!) usually used what&#39;s typically called hard power to dominate the world. IE wars, bombs, guns. The Chinese have this great concept of soft power which is more like cultural or meme warfare. (Though, as I mentioned, their military is gaining too, plus they have gotten pretty aggressive in the S. China sea, which is a development I don&#39;t like.)</p>

<p>You are a fool if you believe this. These people have simply just learned recently, most likely thanks to <a href="http://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/">TGSNT</a>, that the rabbithole is far deeper than many of us have imagined. The malicious lies about the two great wars and national socialism, the identities of the actual warmongers and profiteers are the foundation and very core of the system and ideology which most of us here try to expose.</p>

As I state in my reply to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p8k96/the_conspiracy_website_abovetopsecretcom_is/cmui93l">sudo-tleilaxu</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;If he would switch his brain on he might figure our why some people with controversial views prefer to have multiple accounts or create frequently new accounts on reddit, especially considering what we learned in recent month. Then again some people have so much craving for recognition they probably cant even comprehend the rational behind such a choice.&quot; </p>

<p>This right here is spot on. Whoever these controllers are they need to protect their government programmed &quot;public schooling&quot; property. Just think if you had something you spent lots of money for and needed for the future you&#39;d want to do &quot;anything&quot; to protect / shield it from the truth because if it sees the truth it will turn on you.</p>

<p>They are watching their young grow up, be programmed and groomed to be placed in the system. The system needs bodies to survive and always will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wondering if you have ever read anything related to the history of Zionism? My guess on this would be that you have not. So now that I have questioned your knowledge on this subject, I wonder, are you going to paint <em>me</em> with this same broad brush and label me a controlled op disrupting agent in the this sub also? </p>

<p>It sounds to me, that at least on the issue of Israel and Zionism, you are posting from a lifetime of indoctrination into the Establishment&#39;s Approved Version Of History. You seem to have never really lifted your eyes to see what else there is around the looking glass you have spent your life thinking through.</p>

<p>I am not going to address <em>everything</em> you posted in both of these longer posts you have made, because the length of them in some ways is the intellectual equivalent of, when it comes to the issues of Zionism and Israel&#39;s war crimes and influence on US history, the equivalent of plugging your ears, and with a whole lot of verbose blustery bombardment, yelling &quot;<em>la la lalalalala</em>&quot; so you don&#39;t have to even hear other aspects of the past that are not The Establishment&#39;s Official History Of The World.</p>

<p>Just because you can post long combative screeds doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be close-minded and intellectually dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know why my account is only a month old? I state my opinion, people like yourself flip the fuck out and start harassing me, so I have to make a new account. So far you haven&#39;t harassed me but your mindset is the same as people who would love to find me in &quot;real life&quot; and commit violence against me for having my own set of opinions. I don&#39;t know how many times I have to say I&#39;m not a neo-nazi, I&#39;m just pointing out lies in history. If/when you finally accept that you have been told lies you will see the &quot;bad guys&quot; are just as bad as the &quot;good guys&quot; but they simply didn&#39;t win the war so they don&#39;t have the power to indoctrinate their children with their side of the story. If you don&#39;t want to look into those things, fine. Just don&#39;t try to label me a shill just because I personally see things differently than you. The &quot;you&#39;re a shill if you disagree with me&quot; thing is childish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; as user through_a_ways <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2dda6l/the_somewhat_new_meaning_of_antisemite/cjoucnx">pointed out in a thread a few months back</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and there are anti-Semites pretend to just have a problem with Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure there are, but there are a lot of things that get brandied around as &quot;antisemitic&quot; that aren&#39;t necessarily antisemitic at all. Like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Criticizing the largely Jewish-run film industry for its &quot;blacklisting&quot; of celebrities who support the Palestinian cause. Recognizing that an industry has a tremendous presence of Jews in it is no more antisemitic than pointing out that the NBA is dominated by blacks is racist.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling out the tremendous influence that Jewish interest groups (AIPAC, ADL, etc.) have on our government</p></li>
<li><p>Holocaust denial. In and of itself, denying the currently accepted version of the Holocaust is not an anti-semitic act. Claiming that certain parts of history may have been exaggerated to further political causes is not a hateful claim. Otherwise, every 9/11 conspiracy supporter would be anti-American by definition.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Antisemitism (also spelled anti-Semitism[1] or anti-semitism) is prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews as a national, ethnic, religious or racial group.&quot; - Wikipedia</p>

<p>You can hold all of the views above (and many more) without actually hating Jews as an ethnoreligious group. Furthermore, some Jews can be very antisemitic as well, such as some of the Israeli protestors who don&#39;t want black Ethiopian/Somalian Jews to share their ranks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a black and white issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Jewish people today are medern/moderat/secular Jews (they take the good and leave the bad).</p>

<p>However, most of the &quot;Jews&quot; in power are (political/Rothschild) Zionists pretending to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Jewish people and evil (political/Rothschild) Zionists are not the same thing! This above mentioned form of Zionism is a very racist, genocidal, greedy, self-serving, unsympathetic, sociopathic, psychopathic, and fundamental ideology. There are Zionists that are not claiming to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, but &quot;Christian&quot; (faux Christian), such as the Bush Family and Biden. Many of the Zionists claim to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, in part, to discredit any and all critics with a dismissive conversation ender by calling them &quot;anti-Semites&quot;. Zionists that claim to be Jewish are about as Jewish as terrorists claiming to be Muslim (as in, not at all true to the (modern/secular/moderat) religions).</p>

<p>Part of the plan by these (political/Rothschild) Zionists that claim to be Jewish is to have the masses hate actual Jewish people and Israel for their atrocities; The average uninformed/missinformed person may mistake these Zionists as true Jewish people, and falsely blame humanist Jewish people for all of the atrocities of the Zionists (War, Coup de tats, Usery, human rights/constitutional defying laws/policies/actions, etc.).</p>

<p>The three big (political/Rothschild) Zionist Occupied Governments (ZOGs) are the USA, the UK, and Israel. Many other countries are also controlled, owned, and operated by the Zionists (through Central banking, mega corporations that politically lobby federal politicians, mainstream media, etc.). Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.</p>

<p>The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.</p>

<p>Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).</p>
