I was drug tested to deliver pizzas, work in a pet store, do customer service and to work in a shoe store but they are running a country and are government employees, right? Can we not get some petition going to drug test them? I wouldnt care if any of them had marijuana in their system but coke, heroin, PCP, or some other drug is not cool with me. </p>

<p>Im being totally serious. I would really like to see these bastards get drug tested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MENSA has a methodology and calculator (for the lazy) to estimate general deviation based on most standardized tests. The President, for example, based on his public LSAT score, was estimated to be one deviation above standard, so around 115-120. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking more of a general knowledge test instead of an IQ test. I&#39;m from Canada so we don&#39;t have the SATs but I thought something like that but harder would work. Every top profession requires the candidate to write tests... Doctors, lawyers, etc. Why not politicians? </p>

<p>It should cover all things... History, science, economics, technology, etc. And we can use their score to rank them. Then if someone who failed the technology section tries to pass a new &quot;net neutrality&quot;  bill we can tell them to STFU. </p>
