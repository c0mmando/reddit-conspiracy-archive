       I mean... The people are the power, right? Can we not ask that our politicians are drug tested regularly? I was drug tested to deliver pizzas, work in a pet store, do customer service and to work in a shoe store but they are running a country and are government employees, right? Can we not get some petition going to drug test them? I wouldnt care if any of them had marijuana in their system but coke, heroin, PCP, or some other drug is not cool with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im being totally serious. I would really like to see these bastards get drug tested.

       MENSA has a methodology and calculator (for the lazy) to estimate general deviation based on most standardized tests. The President, for example, based on his public LSAT score, was estimated to be one deviation above standard, so around 115-120.

       I was thinking more of a general knowledge test instead of an IQ test. I'm from Canada so we don't have the SATs but I thought something like that but harder would work. Every top profession requires the candidate to write tests... Doctors, lawyers, etc. Why not politicians?
      </p>
      <p>
       It should cover all things... History, science, economics, technology, etc. And we can use their score to rank them. Then if someone who failed the technology section tries to pass a new "net neutrality"  bill we can tell them to STFU.

       Its to hinder any rebellious attitude or independent thought. Conform or starve and eventually die, or turn to crime. Either way; the system is designed to only work for the few, and those foolish enough to endlessly work for it without question. One big giant machine fueled by the ignorant and egotistical bunch.

       No look, they are the professionals, when they pass a law it is always in your interest. Don't try to ask questions about these laws though, since you are just a citizen and don't know what you are talking about.

       they make the laws. So they wrote it in/omitted to be in congress and not get drug tested. Not to mention all the other boons they wrote for themselves into law.
