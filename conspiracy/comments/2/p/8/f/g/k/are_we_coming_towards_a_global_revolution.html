    <div class="md"><p>If you mean Bitcoin, that is a techie thing that will never be taken seriously by the real world.  Normal people trust the stability of the US systems.  They don&#39;t trust a system based on crypto and distributed ledger and other things.  And one that fluctuates in value, has a finite supply, etc.</p>

<p>I think at some point, the US govt will make a crypto form of the US dollar, in addition to the current physical and electronic forms of it. Suppose Fed issued, say, $100 billion of US dollar crypto-currency, in addition to the existing US dollar supply ? Best of both worlds: anonymous (maybe), digital, online, very low or zero transaction cost, easily convertible, guaranteed 1-1 exchange rate with US dollar, backed by US govt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this in the most polite way possible, but I think that the idea of the federal reserve bank issuing anonymous crypto currency is extremely naive. The whole added bonus of online/digital/debit card  exchange is that it can be tracked, while cash cannot. This is why you will get arrested for attempting to play  the money laundering game the US government plays with drugs, weapons, etc. I think the control structure wants a cashless society, simply because it offers even more control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m not sure the Fed would go for the &quot;anonymous&quot; part of it.  But every other feature of crypto-currency would work for a crypto US dollar: digital, online, very low or zero transaction cost, easily convertible, guaranteed 1-1 exchange rate with US dollar, backed by US govt.  A crypto-dollar makes a lot of sense even if it isn&#39;t anonymous.</p>

What&#39;s funny is that other than pure speculation, VERY few people know what&#39;s really going on. I know someone who is executive-level in one of the world&#39;s largest banks, and they won&#39;t even talk about ANYTHING related to finance, stocks, government, etc.. Based on how he acts, I&#39;d guess no more than 500 people know the global market game plan(s). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what we are seeing is the shift from industrialization to an attempt at global corporatism/fascism. The &quot;3rd world&quot; will simply remain as resource mines, for the most part. Labor, minerals, livestock, etc. </p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the US and its allies are squaring off with the BRICS nations, but I can&#39;t tell if it is a resource war which will precede the shift, or if it will simply be another world war. Pretty much every &quot;revolution&quot; that has been televised over the last 20 years is just a CIA coup, and seemingly part of the Western corporatist playbook, not a revolution of or for the people. </p>

<p>This is purely speculation based on the nuances of all the bullshit I have seen in my time here on this rock. </p>

<p>Considering in the past 6 years we&#39;ve had Bankers commit mass fraud internationally, NSA drag-netting everyone globally and now the land of the free engaging in torture and back in yet another extra-judicial war while simultaneously trying to kick start neo-cold war. This still doesn&#39;t seem to be catalytic enough for America to do anything. </p>

<p>How can you expect others to have a domestic revolutions if you guys can&#39;t even take care of shop at home? Not withstanding each time someone attempts to have a domestic revolution the CIA just swoops in and, as Rage Against the Machine put it: &#39;I think I herd a shot!&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer: no.</p>

<p>All through history, people have been saying &quot;Oh my God, right now is the worst time EVER, it&#39;s all going down the toilet, things can&#39;t go on like this&quot;.  Sometimes they&#39;re right (the Huns or Mongols were at the city gates).  But usually they&#39;re wrong, and we muddle through.</p>

<p>Are things really worse today than they were during WW II, when Nazis controlled most of Europe and Japan had most of SE Asia ?  Worse today in USA than when during the Civil War ?  No.</p>

<p>We have solutions, we just have to apply them.  Fairer taxation, reform campaign finance, regulate Wall Street and corporations, change to renewable energy, cut military budget, etc.</p>

<p>And with regard to your specifics:  dollar won&#39;t collapse because every other currency is worse.  Interest rates show that world&#39;s investors consider USA and US debt the safest place in the world.  Where else are they going to put their money, and trust the legal system and political systems ?  China ?  Russia ?  EU ?</p>

<p>War between East and West won&#39;t happen, because China and USA are tied by trade and debt.  If that trade stops, both economies crash.  Same with oil producers vs oil consumers.  Budget of every oil producer is based on continuing to sell that oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even just in USA, the aftermath of a successful violent revolt would be hideous. All sorts of groups would take the opportunity to carve out enclaves, steal stuff, kill opponents or perceived enemies. The country would fragment into pieces by religion, race, wealth, region, etc.</p>

<p>No one would agree on what the new government or political structure should be. Everyone would take the opportunity to try to write their favorite position into the Constitution or laws: anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-GMO, anti-immigrant, anti-fossil-fuel, pro-fossil-fuel, anti-gun, pro-gun, etc.</p>

<p>The economy would tank, the dollar would tank, the world economy would tank. The killing would go on for a long, long time. USA is the most heavily-armed country in the world, civilian, police and military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m not sure the Fed would go for the &quot;anonymous&quot; part of it.  But every other feature of crypto-currency would work for a crypto US dollar: digital, online, very low or zero transaction cost, easily convertible, guaranteed 1-1 exchange rate with US dollar, backed by US govt.  A crypto-dollar makes a lot of sense even if it isn&#39;t anonymous.</p>
