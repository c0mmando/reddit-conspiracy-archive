    <div class="md"><p>Been watching some stuff about Alaska, could go off grid there, seems relatively quite cheap and is still very much a wilderness.</p>

<p>But seriously, myself and my wife are working towards a sustainable life style, earning money now so we can essentially buy a house somewhere rural (I grew up on a livestock farm, loved it), just need the basics really, grow food, use solar, use ground heading systems, use own water catchment and plenty of other sustainable products can reduce your reliance on today materialistic and consumer centric culture.</p>

<p>Grow a little erb (if you know what I mean) raise some kids and teach them from an early age reading and writing and maths, set them up in life, teach them how to critically think for themselves as my dad did and complete the circle. You don&#39;t have to do the latter kids part if you don&#39;t want, but just find something that makes you happy, because you can&#39;t take money with you and a lot of the shit that&#39;s flashed on TV you don&#39;t need anyway.</p>

<p>All I&#39;d really need is a net connection, Civ V (plus later additions)  books (not e books, nothing against them I&#39;d just prefer tangible ones, as I want a library with shelving I want to make myself) a guitar, friends and that&#39;s about it, everything else I don&#39;t really care for.</p>

<p>As for the after this life, it&#39;s moot - as Sam Harris puts it, you don&#39;t remember the period before you&#39;re born, and after your life is going to be much like that; nothing.</p>

<p>So either way, there&#39;s an end.</p>

<p>Might not be all roses and sunshine as an answer, but that&#39;s unfortunately just life hey?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place is not fucked. You&#39;re buying into the illusion and they will always have the upper hand if you allow the system to dominate your life. If you have a tremendous amount of debt then file bankruptcy. Nowadays the numbers of folks doing it makes it seem no less than simply having bad credit. Do the imaginable and what seems almost crazy and impossible. Research areas of interest and their state and county laws. Buy a piece of land somewhere you researched ( they&#39;re many people financing land at fairly low interest and minimal monthly payments with no credit checks that are not loan sharks), get off the grid, learn how to organicaly grow food, save seeds, hunt and gather, fish, barter more, and learn to be self sufficient. The only way to learn to be free is to do it. Even one small step towards this goal is a step in the right direction. The less you play the game the more you take back self control and set real goals. People may judge you and criticize your aspirations. It is not an easy path to break free and live sustainably. But it is worth it in so many ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By halting compliance with the tribute system [Federal Income Tax] I feel like I&#39;m doing my own little part too. Nothing huge, but it&#39;s a start. The funny thing is I just decided one day that I wasn&#39;t going to comply with ObamaCare. Not more than a couple months later I stumbled on Marc Stevens. Who just happens to have a plan for how to deal with that very situation.</p>

<p>Those little steps are god. And universe notices. And universe responds. Way back in the late 80&#39;s there was a TMNT game for Nintendo. When you paused the game April O&#39;Neil would be at the bottom of the screen and there was a little text bubble with her saying, &quot;You have my support!&quot; I put out a thought about halting compliance with ObamaCare and I got a positive reply. I feel like universe really does offer support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cut my cable. I certainly feel free of a lot of propaganda bullshit and i have more money in my pocket.</p>

<p>I ride my motorcycle. I feel free, in the moment. Quality of life is made of quality of moments. The feeling reminds me of going sailing; I spent a lot of time sailing when I was growing up.</p>

<p>Income earned in international waters is tax free. There are lots of people who live on boats; if you have a satellite phone, you can work online if you&#39;re technology savvy. There&#39;s always a need for marine electricians, carpentry, engine mechanics, boat repair and so on. If you don&#39;t like your neighbour, you can just... sail away somewhere else. Nobody asks you if you have a degree before you buy a boat. There is nowhere on the planet more free than the ocean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you can do it. No you don´t have to pay taxes to the US. No they won´t come get you. No you don´t have to be a millionaire.</p>

<p>It won´t be a government approved process. You won´t find a handy guide on Conde Nast or Reddit. Start by looking for places where filing for taxes isn´t the norm,and where there are no property taxes. It´s a good start. You may need to learn a new language (at least functional). Spanish is really easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been watching some stuff about Alaska, could go off grid there, seems relatively quite cheap and is still very much a wilderness.</p>

<p>But seriously, myself and my wife are working towards a sustainable life style, earning money now so we can essentially buy a house somewhere rural (I grew up on a livestock farm, loved it), just need the basics really, grow food, use solar, use ground heading systems, use own water catchment and plenty of other sustainable products can reduce your reliance on today materialistic and consumer centric culture.</p>

<p>Grow a little erb (if you know what I mean) raise some kids and teach them from an early age reading and writing and maths, set them up in life, teach them how to critically think for themselves as my dad did and complete the circle. You don&#39;t have to do the latter kids part if you don&#39;t want, but just find something that makes you happy, because you can&#39;t take money with you and a lot of the shit that&#39;s flashed on TV you don&#39;t need anyway.</p>

<p>All I&#39;d really need is a net connection, Civ V (plus later additions)  books (not e books, nothing against them I&#39;d just prefer tangible ones, as I want a library with shelving I want to make myself) a guitar, friends and that&#39;s about it, everything else I don&#39;t really care for.</p>

<p>As for the after this life, it&#39;s moot - as Sam Harris puts it, you don&#39;t remember the period before you&#39;re born, and after your life is going to be much like that; nothing.</p>

<p>So either way, there&#39;s an end.</p>

<p>Might not be all roses and sunshine as an answer, but that&#39;s unfortunately just life hey?</p>
