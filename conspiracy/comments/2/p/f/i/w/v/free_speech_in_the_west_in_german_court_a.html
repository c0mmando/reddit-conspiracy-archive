       CORRECTION: Swiss court, not Germany court.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wolfgang Fröhlich
       </strong>
       , certified engineer, takes the stand as a defense witness in the 1998 trial of Holocaust researcher Jürgen Graf, author of numerous books such as 'The Giant with Feet of Clay', and 'Hoax or Holocaust'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fröhlich's field of speciality is the technique of procedure and handling of toxic gas. He had carried out gassings (of insects and disease organisms) on innumerable occasions.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Presiding Judge Andrea Staubli warned the witness that perjury was punishable by law with imprisonment. She then asked him whether Jürgen Graf’s books, in his opinion, were scientific in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fröhlich said that he was not a historian, so was unable to give an opinion as to the historical parts of the book.
       <strong>
        He then said that the technical aspects of the gassings, as alleged in the official narrative, were untenable, from a scientific point of view.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       State prosecutor Aufdenblatten requested the presiding judge to remind Fröhlich once again of his duty to testify truthfully; this was done. In substance, the following exchange then followed:
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In your opinion, were mass exterminations with Zyklon B technically possible?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fröhlich:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Prosecutor:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why not?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fröhlich:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The insecticide Zyklon B consists of hydrocyanic acid absorbed in a granulate carrier substance. The hydrocyanic acid is released through contact with the air.
       </p>
       <p>
        The boiling point of hydrocyanic acid is 25.7 degrees C. The higher the temperature, the faster the evaporation rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delousing chambers in which Zyklon B was used in National Socialist camps and elsewhere, were heated to 30 degrees C or more, so that the hydrocyanic acid left the carrier granulate rapidly.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, much lower temperatures are said to have prevailed in the half-subterranean morgues of the crematoria at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where, according to eyewitness accounts, mass murders are supposed to have taken place using Zyklon B.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if if one assumes that the rooms were warmed by the body temperature of the hypothetical occupants, the temperature should not have exceed 15 degrees, even in the warm season. The hydrocyanic acid in Zyklon B would therefore have taken many hours to evaporate.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the eyewitness accounts, the victims died very rapidly. The eyewitnesses speak of time periods ranging from "immediately" to "15 minutes".
       </p>
       <p>
        To kill the occupants of the gas chamber in such a short time, the Germans would have had to use absurdly large quantities of Zyklon; I assume from 40 to 50 kilos per gassing procedure. This would have made any work in the gas chamber radically impossible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The members of the Sonderkommando -- who, according to the eyewitnesses, were responsible for removing the bodies from the chamber -- would have collapsed immediately upon entering the chamber, even if they had worn gas masks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Immensely great quantities of hydrocyanic acid vapour would have streamed into the open air through the open doors, contaminating the entire camp.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fröhlich’s testimony was greeted with applause by members of the public attending the trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor Aufdenblatten then jumped up, and shouted:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         I hereby request the court to bring an indictment [against witness Fröhlich] for racial discrimination under article 261; otherwise I will do it myself!
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Jürgen Graf was sentenced to 15 months in prison for writing books.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       His 80-year old wheelchair-bound publisher, Gerhard Förster, was sentenced to 12 months, and died four weeks after the sentence was announced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witness, Wolfgang Fröhlich, would eventually be sentenced to a total of

       That is very disturbing. While it would certainly be understandable for a German prosecutor to invoke such a statute against a witness engaged in hate speech, to do so during the course of scientific discussion is abhorrent and an affront to the judicial system.

       From

       :

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It didn’t last long until I was contacted by a defense team that asked me to prepare an expert report on that issue. Here, to, the defendant was on trial for “Holocaust denial” (whatever that means).
        <strong>
         I eventually came up with results that were unwelcome—I basically confirmed and improved Leuchter’s thesis
        </strong>
        —and my results were published shortly before I was to have my final PhD exam scheduled.
       </p>
       <p>
        My expert report created a major earthquake in German society. It also led the directorate of the very institute where I had prepared my PhD thesis to issue a press release condemning as immoral that I had asked, and sought answers to, specific questions about the How and How Much of my research topic.
       </p>
       <p>
        What followed between June 1993 and early 1996 was a series of persecutorial measures by all members of the German society: my final PhD examination was first put on hold, then I was threatened that my thesis would be rejected if I did not withdraw it, using a Hitler law of 1939, still on the books in Germany today, that allows to withhold of withdraw academic degrees in case of lacking “academic dignity.”
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         My home was raided three times by the police and all computers, files, research papers, books I authored, and correspondence confiscated. Under massive pressure by media and Jewish lobby groups, my employer had to dismiss me. Two landlords kicked me out of my apartment without notice as a result of media smear campaigns.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I was put on trial, because my expert report allegedly libels and insults the witnesses and victims of the Holocaust.
        <strong>
         Since my report allegedly makes people assume that some Jews lied when they testified after the war, the German courts also considered my expert report to incite the masses to hate Jews.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I therefore was sentenced to
        <strong>
         14 months in prison
        </strong>
        in 1995 for inciting the masses to hate the Jews—although the court had to admit that Jews aren’t even mentioned in my expert report other then as objects of the historical events investigated, let alone that any judgment is made about them.

       It's funny because from the late 1800's to 1930's, jews were screaming at Russians, Poles and Ukrainians for the 6 million desperate souls and then they started to scream at the Germans for the 6 million desperate souls afterwards. How many jews died in WW2?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Let's face it, there were supposedly 3 million jews in Poland and there's no way the Germans killed every last one of them while fighting Russia)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's look at the oppressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       7,000,000 Ukrainians starved or killed
      </p>
      <p>
       6,600,000-8,800,000 Germans killed
      </p>
      <p>
       24,000,000 Russians starved or killed
      </p>
      <p>
       4,000,000 Poles killed
      </p>
      <p>
       So while the jews are screaming that their people are being massacred and need help, tens of millions of their oppressors are dying under things like the Bolshevik (jewish) revolution, WW2 which was orchestrated by the Zionist lobby in Britain and the US. And where do most of the jews go? To Palestine (mandated well before the war because of the Ottoman Empire's siding with Germany/Austria-WW1 and cutting off Britain from India so they needed Palestine as a land bridge), Britain and the United States among many places. Some went to camps. A lot of people were in camps during WW2. The Germans went to camps after the war and 800,000 died and were put in mass graves in Belgium. Those graves were Ally made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Germans were trying to wipe out the jews, they did a piss poor job of it because the jews wiped out more gentiles than anyone could dream. And they fulfilled Marx's dream of reducing the population to those who would accept the new world order of economics and politics.

       I think most people in the West have no idea that this sort of injustice is taking place. When you learn about it for the first time, it is shocking. It is completely against the concept we have that we live in free societies, where we can express our beliefs without fear of punishment from the state. The idea that a man asked to testify in a court case could be sent to prison for giving his honest testimony is so strange, so unnatural, it is difficult to even grasp.

       This kind of reminds me of what happened to Galileo.

       They threw Fröhlich in jail, not for denying the Holocaust, but for pointing out some technical facts. It's only when a rational mind realizes that because of these facts, there are problems with some parts of the story.

       That is not Frolich's fault and it should not have been reason for legal action against him.

       We're falling into a mini-Dark Age where science is concerned. Scientists are falsifying data, stealing data, concealing data, all to promote their own careers. Students in universities taking science degrees are massively cheating on their exams. The very peer review process itself has been compromised, with groups of scientists supporting each other to get their studies into journals, even when those studies are flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hysteria about man-made global warming was the major alarm bell that something is wrong with Western science. It never should have happened. It was a religious movement, driven at the top by self-interest, greed and  socio-political manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science can no longer be trusted to come to conclusions about the natural world that are impartial and accurate. We can no longer trust the findings of scientists. Look at vaccines. We all know something is wrong with the process. It weakens the immune response and screws it up. Yet science won't admit it. Or take genetically modified foods. There are good anecdotal signs that it can be harmful, but science it trying to railroad the world into these genetic Frankenfoods.

       That's actually the sign from Dachau, where the Americans built a fake gas chamber, and eventually had to admit that no gassings took place there. (But wouldn't admit the chamber is a fake, obviously!)

USA-222; IMT, XXXVII, p.621)). The ceiling today is 7.6 ft and the fake showerheads are made of sheet metal.

       Hey TTrns, do you think the holocaust never happened? Do you think whether Zyklon B was used at nazi camps has any relevant to life in the world today? Do you think whether 1,000,000 or 6,000,000 jews died in WWII is more relevant to today than the fact that linking this subject to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which you and your other friends with your days/months old account have been doing as much as you can recently, discredits all the other content here by association while accomplishing absolutely nothing else? Do you think changing anyone's opinion about whether Zyklon B or bullets and starvation were used in the mechanics of mass murder changes anything about anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you so desperate to make these points that have no productive value or influence on
       <em>
        anything other than
       </em>
       the opinion of 'conspiracy theorists' and 'conspiracy theories' in general in the minds of Jill and Joe Average in the world today? What are you trying to do here? You think everyone from every invading army lied and that all the videos of the camp liberations were just faked to make people believe the nazis were bad guys, but really hitler and the nazis were the good guys?
       <em>
        The reason they silence testimony(the reason for striking testimony is to have it effectively ignored by the courts as a symbol for the reason FOR the silencing) like this is because people, especially in Germany, know that whether toxic gasses or bullets were used, supporting or apologizing/trying to excuse or exonerate the Nazis and their behavior with technicalities and non-arguments
       </em>
       (
       <strong>
        like HOW they killed the victims who they had kidnapped from their homes and sent to concentration camps to be worked or starved to death
       </strong>
       )
       <em>
        is not acceptable behavior, and it is not something they are going to tolerate being defended in their presence - especially in the society comprised of the children of the men who were directly involved and responsible for those actions.
       </em>
       Maybe your supposition is right and they never used Zyklon B, maybe they used another gas but someone found all the Zyklon B in storage for delousing at the camps and assumed that's what was used and it became part of the mythology surrounding one of the worst things that has ever happened to humanity in the modern world, or maybe someone told the story and it was picked up to further demonize the enemy - that doesn't change what they did there, the nature of the camps, the fact that the concentration camps existed and were full of innocent victims kidnapped by the Nazis/German army and sent there, the fact that massive atrocities were committed within them, and it doesn't have any bearing on their crimes. This isn't difficult to understand, so I'm sure you are capable of grasping it, it isn't a conspiracy but you have a posting pattern full of desperate attempts to connect this subreddit with holocaust denial, which may itself be part of a 'conspiracy'(to discredit everyone here and all the credible/meaningful content this website could be a platform for by associating it with easy to ridicule, easily explained/simply understood bullshit and nazi apologists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back to stormfront, or log off from your DoD computer terminal - either or. I wish the mods would look into this, because it is something that is obviously happening. I'll be surprised if this post of mine doesn't have 5-10 responses over the next day(probably over the next few
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       ) from random nearly-brand-new accounts that will all disagree with me and downvote it, because someone is here vote-brigading and bringing nazi apologists to the top, holocaust denial to the frontpage, and stickying AMAs from random holocaust deniers who are themselves 'zionists' and who claim also to believe that 'the muslims' did 9/11, all with threads full of users who have nearly brand new reddit accounts. For the rest of the readers - ask yourself what's really going on here with this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the subject of this post, it's analogous your grandfather being a mass murderer and someone coming along trying to exonerate him and defend him with the argument that "he used a gun, not an axe, so you're all lying!" and "he only killed 400 people, not 1,000!!". His descendants wouldn't want it brought up in the first place, let alone tolerate someone trying to exonerate or defend him by making near-irrelevant arguments and distinctions which attempt to detract from the severity of the tragedy he imposed on so many others, which you've already accepted and tried to separate yourself from. There is no conspiracy or conspiracy theory here in this post, only attempts at discrediting all actual conspiracies and conspiracy theories and theorists.

       Well, no. It's analogous to an entire country being accused of being mass murderers, and lawyers and witnesses providing evidence which contradicts the charge, except that the court refuses to hear that evidence and then locks the lawyers and witnesses up.

       This is about prosecution of revisionists and historians trying to do their job. And the punishment for stating the conclusions different scientists came to after years and years of working in the field. I actually read your whole comment. You could've simply said:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Everyone who tries to debate the accusation laid upon the losing powers of WWII wants to canonise those atrocities and is a bat shit Nazi themselves.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Save others the time and keep this an open minded and constructive discussion please.

        Go back to stormfront, or log off from your DoD computer terminal - either or. I wish the mods would look into this, because it is something that is obviously happening. I'll be surprised if this post of mine doesn't have 5-10 responses over the next day(probably over the next few hours) from random nearly-brand-new accounts that will all disagree with me and downvote it, because someone is here vote-brigading and bringing nazi apologists to the top, holocaust denial to the frontpage, and stickying AMAs from random holocaust deniers who are themselves 'zionists' and who claim also to believe that 'the muslims' did 9/11, all with threads full of users who have nearly brand new reddit accounts. For the rest of the readers - ask yourself what's really going on here with this stuff.

       This is just downright black and white thinking ignorance for topics that obviously still play a role in people's understanding of history today. If you got anything on topic let us know.

       Your asking a lot of important questions but your bias of information is blocking you from seeing important points trying to be made by the op I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth I have no idea what his intentions are but I know that this post has meaning for me and in truth I do not claim to know the truth, but at least I know enough to question the history presented to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people miss the point. They see it I think as some sort of long con by rascist or prejudice men to fool people into hating all the Jews or something which I believe is what you are eluding to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything you were told about the holocaust is true. Which is the point he is trying to make. He's not saying nothing happened. Nor am I.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, it does matter because intent matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       From all accounts Zyklon B was a delousing agent. Therefore maybe they weren't gased to death as previously claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no way they could have cremated the bodies with such efficiency as they claim; it's simply math really. Look it up. Which eludes to them not burning as many bodies as they claim. Therefore, the numbers were fudged....something that even the official narrative has come to recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were they all emaciated? Well, it was a war. Supply lines get cut off and then people starve. German soldiers were fed better for obvious reasons but a lot of that emaciation can be blamed on the lack of supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm not saying that what the German's did was right but I don't believe their outright intent was to kill and destroy as many people as they could or they could have been doing so a lot more effectively. That sounds shitty, but it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not surprise me to find that their original intent was not too disimilar to when the US put the Japanese in concentration camps. Only, they lost so the hardships of the war directly effected their prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how the Japanese would have been treated in our concentration camps had we suddenly been invaded on a massive level and our supply lines were cut to shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take all that into consideration, and then think about OTHER conspiracies which interconnect to this one in ways that most people don't understand unless you have a greater understanding of conspiracies in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take into consideration the following links:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more information then what I have shared but reviewing all of that information will help you understanding greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also take into consideration that before World War II was in full swing the Germans were already moving Jews to Palastine to help create Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from my perspective, it seems like the Rothschilds helped get Israel created and as a result of their direct influence in our government we often speak protectively of Israel and consider them far more then other countries of greater influence. In addition to this, the traditional Holocaust narrative helped generate the sympathy needed from the public to help create Israel and helped destroy Germany’s competing economy which threatened to destabilize the firm grip that the Rothschilds and their cronies were already securing on the world economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all being said. You aren’t entirely wrong. The Germans made some serious mistakes in judgment and Hitler was probably an asshole. However, I doubt their mistakes are beyond the scope of human understanding and the more we know about the event the easier it will be to prevent. We as a country once had concentration camps, and now we have indefinite detention comps like Guantanamo and now we have all this shit about illegal torture that we as a country are guilty of. Is it really so hard to consider that we as a country could head in a similar direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       So learn more. Learn as much as you can and then see if you can piece together the truth. I don’t claim to know the truth, but I know it sure as fuck didn’t happen like we were told or at the very least there are a lot of inconsistencies that don’t add up.

       Why would someone involved with "black pride" have an axe to grind? Skepticism of the official "Holocaust" narrative has nothing to do with "blackness" or "whiteness".
