<p>The reaction of users to these top two posts on our sub is a disgrace.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you say this. It could easily apply to this subreddit, any of the racist subreddits, etc. It isn&#39;t just &quot;them.&quot; People in general tend to seek out like minded people, then follow the lead. It&#39;s just most of those same people (including you) tend to only see it in &quot;them&quot; and not themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Lately I&#39;ve been dismayed at how much glee these people seem to take in shooting other people&#39;s opinions and ideas down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the idea of having an open mind is completely dead. It&#39;s like they are scared of even entertaining these ideas, they have such a strong emotional reaction despite there being no vested interest at all. The interest comes from their perception of needing to fit in with the rest of the herd. It&#39;s sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a great post about this earlier. <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pbgki/look_at_who_the_admins_have_chosen_to_contribute/cmva5fe">Here it is:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have a &#39;adulthood wist&#39; complex, where being condescending and arrogant to us &quot;silly children&quot; reinforces their personal concept they might actually come across as a &quot;mature adult&quot;.</p>

<p>My guess is that most of them are late-teen early 20s with a strong desire to prove to themselves and the world that they really are adults who must be taken seriously.</p>

<p>It seems to manifest in many people in many ways. Strident atheism comes to mind. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, as with Christians, are a soft target because it&#39;s a fairly safe bet that there&#39;s enough people around to join in their derisive circlejerks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly pathetic, especially as someone slightly older who used to be a little bit that way at the same age, deluded essentially into thinking that the rapid spurt of intelligence and self-awareness that particularly guys experience in late adolescence has, in fact, enlightened them.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I quickly grew out of it once I realised I didn&#39;t know shit. These guys aren&#39;t so lucky.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the idea though?  If a population were to be rational, then they would examine the lies and insist on transparency.</p>

<p>If a population is emotional and irrational, then you can drive them through fear.</p>

<p>Maybe you blow up a building and blame it on terrorists.</p>

<p>Maybe every movie you make has good guys in military uniforms and bad guys wearing traditional muslim clothing.</p>

<p>Maybe you put up the shittiest woman candidate you can find in one election so that, in the next, your candidate looks competent.</p>

<p>Maybe you put things out there like &quot;If you don&#39;t vote for Obama, then you&#39;re racist.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe you radicalize a couple guys in Australia to distract from your agenda.</p>

<p>These are all things that we do not know the truth about and there is no verifiable facts that prove these things to be one way or another.  Yet, in the brainwashed and molded minds of most of the population, there is only one possibility:  Why would the government lie to me? We are the good guys!</p>

<p>Nobody likes to admit they were a sucker.  I used to be one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why rely on TV and corporate news when the people here create a good enough caricature of conspiracy theorists to make any reasonable person laugh in your face? No discretion is used when labeling the latest events as false flag operations or calling out playful posts as veiled attempts by our government to brainwash us into complacency. There&#39;s a reason that this community is looked at as a joke and it isn&#39;t the government&#39;s doing, it&#39;s the result of how desperate people are to apply some bullshit explanation to every possible thing under the sun. Everything is a conspiracy and everyone is a shill (keep beating that one into the ground, it really strengthens all of your arguments). There is so much nonsense here that the sub is turning into a zoo to house lunatics while everybody else stops by to see how the crazy people live and to be thankful that they get to leave and not suffer from such extreme paranoia.</p>

<p>Just to come back to something from before</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s how news works. A long-awaited and prepared report is never going to be a trend, as you call it. We had solid weeks of coverage on the Snowden/NSA stuff because in detail and scope it was quite surprising. Absolutely none of the torture news was very surprising at all. It was never going to be a long-running story with continuous updates.</p>

<p>Look at what the situation was before the report. Obama had signed actions banning the practices, he&#39;d done this years ago. Also the idea that anyone would be prosecuted was also long dead. All the moral arguments vis-a-vis torture were had long ago in the Bush years. We knew from first-hand accounts the kind of stuff that goes on. There was never gong to be a bombshell.</p>

<p>I admit the rectal feeding was a new one but overall this news story was always going to be a one-stop affair. That it hasn&#39;t taken over all of reddit isn&#39;t evidence of an admin/mod conspiracy, it&#39;s just the way a story that has become part of the public consciousness for years already looks like. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see anything like you&#39;re alleging.</p>

<p>Of course, but believing that at the same time when other evidence points to a downvote brigade is just naive.</p>

<p>Could be construed as a coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drastic vote swings from postives to negatives and negatives to positives, all that happened very quickly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could be a result of the thread receiving more visitors and thus a larger portion of the sub&#39;s population see&#39;s the thread and votes on it as they see fit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A string of commenters making jokes one after the other</p>

<p>So downvote them if you don&#39;t think they&#39;re adding to the discussion. But this point has nothing to do with vote brigading only that people want to share their thoughts.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider any points you just brought up as evidence. Merely observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, lets see, because people tend to analyze things based on patterns.</p>

<p>Take your account for example, I see a pattern emerge of a user who goes into <em>every</em> thread to argue against it. Almost as if you are going out of your way to disagree just because it was posted by someone in this subreddit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hang out in r/piano and enter 100&#39;s of threads to tell people that they chose a shitty instrument and should play guitar instead.</p>

<p><strong>I see other people arguing a lot in this subreddit, but I also see them contributing a lot.</strong> And so I don&#39;t draw any judgements about those accounts, because I don&#39;t want this place to be an echo-chamber and dissent should be normal and encouraged.</p>

<p>But when somebody ONLY post dissent, day in and day out....</p>

<p>And its not like we are &quot;crazy tin-foil hatters&quot; for believing that this subreddit is personally targeted by government agencies. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy">That has been PROVEN with hard facts already</a>, despite the uninformed circlejerk that &quot;hurr, nobody cares about you guys&quot;.</p>

<p>Ah here you&#39;re embarrassing yourself.</p>

<p>Every thread? Houston we have a fucking exaggeration. I&#39;ve no interest in vaccine/GMO/9-11/Police/FederalReserve/SandyHook stuff so I&#39;m not posting there. Might read a bit but not bothered posting. </p>

<p>I post when I feel like. For some reason this is noteworthy to you.  Whereas chaps like  <a href="/u/Indra-Varuna">/u/Indra-Varuna</a> post horrendous amounts of racist bigoted bullshit and nobody ever asks &quot;why are you here anyway?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a small community that very often has people asking for information. I think it&#39;s disgraceful the amount ofrubbish that gets posted in response, so if I see something that&#39;s garbage or racist or whatever, I&#39;ll most likely comment. </p>

<p>Good for you. I don&#39;t tell people what to believe or what to think. If a user has a problem with something I post then that&#39;s what the reply button is for. <a href="/u/jamescolespardon">/u/jamescolespardon</a> is a good example - we disagree almost all the time but maintain respect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most of the time it&#39;s stuff like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pbtn0/rconspiracy_is_literally_the_last_free_speech/cmviwt2?context=3">this</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p9e2x/rworldnews_in_action_sensationalist_headline/cmv4br5?context=3">this</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to need a working definition of what you consider &quot;dissent&quot; in a sub that claims to be for &quot;free-thinkers&quot;</p>

<p>Factual information isn&#39;t dissent. A reasonable argument isn&#39;t dissent. Calling out blatant racists isn&#39;t dissent.</p>

<p>Look at the last couple of threads we&#39;ve interacted on. </p>

<p>I took issue with your wording on a title, saying it was hyperbolic and doing the sub a disservice. Apparently that&#39;s dissent.</p>

<p>Corrected a user claiming something fishy was going on with Bundesbank gold transfers. Dissent, it seems.</p>

<p>Tried to explain to you how an aircraft investigation actually works in the real world. Dissent!</p>

<p>Explained airspace structure and how newspaper wording didn&#39;t actually change anything. DISSENT!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, you&#39;re not insane for thinking that. What you are is lazy for believing straight away that that is what&#39;s happening.</p>
