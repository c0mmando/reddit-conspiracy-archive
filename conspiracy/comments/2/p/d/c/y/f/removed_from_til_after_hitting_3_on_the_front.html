<p>No.  The 4th rule on the sidebar of <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a> is <a href="https://imgur.com/s46u0PN.png">&quot;Nothing related to recent politics.&quot;</a>  Posts about waterboarding directly violate that rule and are removed accordingly, not because the mods are part of some over reaching conspiracy to keep the &quot;pro-establishment narrative up.&quot;   </p>

<p>They just want to keep their subreddit full of light, interesting fare and not let it become the embroiled political shithole that some subreddits without such a rule turn into.  You can take off the tin foil hat, now.</p>

<p>It basically amounts to &quot;TIL that the US thought waterboarding was torture when it was <em>convenient</em> for them&quot;, making the post about the current politics (CIA torture report, including waterboarding)</p>

<p>The headline itself may have been misleading, as the hangable offense may not have been the waterboarding, it was just a charge they were accused of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the title worded as it is the OP is trying to draw a direct correlation between how waterboarding was handled in the 1940&#39;s and the differences between that and how it is being handled today, and that certainly falls under &quot;recent politics.&quot;</p>

<p>Waterboarding is a current political issue.  To say that the submission doesn&#39;t have political intent is a bit silly.</p>

<p>Difference is that that submission wouldn&#39;t be obviously pro-or-against the tea party.  You need to use a more comparable example.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t have the right to do that - it&#39;s their subreddit. I just equate that line of thinking with being a good Nazi. Like if it was the 1940&#39;s and someone posted in the Berlin Times an editorial that said &quot;OMG! They are burning Jews alive by the thousands in absolutely hellish camps full of disease and death!&quot;, and then everybody reading that paper said &quot;erase that editorial because it&#39;s not funny. We only want funny news in our newspaper.&quot; I mean, they can do that, it&#39;s their paper. Doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t contributing to the conspiracy of silence by willfully ignoring blatant wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Yep. On r/conspiracy, where the majority of folks here follow this stuff and are aware of it. But to a bigger, default sub? No way it would last and you know it.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s OK, because the inmates in Guantanamo aren&#39;t Prisoner&#39;s Of War, their enemy combatants. And they weren&#39;t Tortured, they were just subject to Enhanced Interrogation Techniques. See where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p><a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is a default subreddit with 7+ million subscribers. There are plenty of articles there critical of waterboarding:</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/search?q=waterboarding&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/search?q=waterboarding&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all</a></p>

<p>But even it didn&#39;t, so what? You still have an open forum with an interested audience here in this sub, where you are free to express your views. Freedom of speech does not equal a right to be promoted to the masses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THere&#39;s no cognitive dissonance. I&#39;m not censoring you if I don&#39;t allow your fantasy novel to be published on <a href="/r/cooking">/r/cooking</a>. Some content just doesn&#39;t belong in certain places. I&#39;m not just calling something by a different name to make it sound more palatable; I&#39;m describing a completely separate phenomenon.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t rules that are being forced on you. They&#39;re just rules for participating in certain subs. People have a right to say, &quot;hey, we want to have a subsection of the site where we only discuss certain things in a certain manner.&quot; And, again, there are plenty of subreddits that don&#39;t have rules against this type of story. </p>

<p>Yeah, you don&#39;t get to post politically charged articles about torture to <a href="/r/TIL">/r/TIL</a>. So what? You still have many, many venues through which to promote and discuss the article. My point clearly stands.</p>

Like, what if you learn some historical and just because of recent events it has become political or was involved in politics in the first place, like a war... say WWII and what you learned is that the US government executed people for something that they  themselves would participate in sometime later in history? 
  Who decides the context of your* post and why can&#39;t it just be an interesting fact, cause that&#39;s what it is, a very interesting fact I learned today...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMPORTANT: It is important to note that axolotl_peyotl edited the comment to remove the part falsely accusing others of needing to &quot;get their facts straight&quot; for not removing things they had no control over. He removed it to make it seem like my complaint was just that it was in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It wasn&#39;t. He also was throwing around false accusations, and has hidden that to make himself look better.</p>

<hr/>

<p>LOL. PSST, Check the subreddit of the one it was removed for &quot;unacceptable title&quot; on. Weird how R FUCKING POLITICS didn&#39;t remove it for being politics. And just plain stupid that you would blame TIL mods for it.</p>

<p>But lets not let facts get in the way of the conspiracy witch hunt. Shall we continue? </p>

<p>Maybe we should look at how they have rule 4 and it doesn&#39;t hide at all that they ban this shit. OMG CONTHPRATHY!!!!!!! They&#39;re in a super secret cabal to PUT THE RULE IN THE FUCKING SIDEBAR and remove shit under it.</p>

<p>Edit: LOL, that&#39;s what I thought, tards. His completely wrong post continues to get upvotes, and you downvote me to getting hidden. Gee, no one here finds facts inconvenient and will downvote anyone not on their side, regardless of the facts. Right? I can&#39;t imagine why people would accuse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of not being rational people. Thank you for illustrating just how uncomfortable you find the truth. Genuinely pathetic. </p>

<p>Edit2: Aaaand downvoted so much I have a post timer. Wow, what a surprise that pointing out the mod is full of shit would lead to move upvotes for the mod telling the bullshit story, and a post timer for someone calling it out. It&#39;s almost like you guys don&#39;t want facts here, and just want to circle jerk about the evil establishment coming to get you.</p>

<p>Edit 3/encore at request:</p>

<p>Thanks for the proof that the facts will be actively suppressed if they&#39;re inconvenient, and that lies will continue to be upvoted despite being proven to be lies (not that it was had to prove), as long as the lies support your side. Most pathetic community on reddit, and yes I include SRS, nofap, and foreveralone in that comparison. </p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been silenced from having conversation (what a surprise!) I&#39;m out. Enjoy ignoring the actual point to circle jerk about how I was mean, and upvoting his lie some more, you pathetic desperate fools.</p>

<p>Three cheers for the &quot;disable inbox replies&quot; button, huh? It&#39;s nice being able to silence all your retarded baiting responses you make once you know the guy can&#39;t actually respond.</p>

<p>GEE, was it politics or not? OH btw, teh evil mods screwed up, and didn&#39;t label this post for politics, when it was posted in R FUCKING POLITICS. Uh oh, someone pointed out the idiocy of someone on conspiracy. QUICK! Change the subject and ignroe all valid points. I know, lets use &quot;lol u mad?&quot; That seems to work on CoD, clearly it should work here! We&#39;re TOP MINDS after all!</p>

<p>So hard to figure out if idiots here are irrationally anti-establishment and ignore the facts to jump on whatever story they think will back up their &quot;omg mods r evil&quot; crap. I guess I&#39;ll just never know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This communities ridiculous insistence on silencing any opposition, all while spouting complete bullshit, and pretending everyone is out to get them, shit in my cereal.</p>

<p>That this community is so fucking pathetic they continued to upvote his lies (which he has since edited away, of course in a misleading manner), and the fact that anyone could be as ridiculously delusional as the complete fucking RETARDS you moderate is why I came to point out some of the idiocy. I just don&#39;t mince words, because if these people had an IQ higher than their limb count, I wouldn&#39;t have to explain to them how linking to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and blaming TIL mods for not removing it for being politics display blatant bias and, well to bring it back home, retardation.</p>

<p>Funny how I got so many comments so quickly when I poitned it out, but it took an outsider to do so. It&#39;s almost like the fuckwits here are either all so stupid, or so dishonest, that they either didn&#39;t notice or wouldn&#39;t point out the bullshit. All while accusing everyone else of being in on conspiracies. I can&#39;t imagine why dishonest assholes would assume the whole world was as dishonest and fucking stupid as they are.</p>

<p>TLDR: You moderate a community of fuckwits. Go ahead and ban, I&#39;ve got infinite more accounts if I ever feel inclined to point out how one of the leaders of this community has the retards following his <strong>just plain 100% incorrect</strong> allegations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like I could actually have a conversation here even if I wanted to cause the brain damage necessary to try. Your short bus crew made sure to give me a post timer right away. One of the common tactics of you halfwits, downvote someone until post timered, then post a million replies and act surprised they don&#39;t reply when they <strong>can&#39;t</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly. Just meant that relying on a foreign tribunal to solve our problems is basically delegating our sovereign authority over to other people in foreign lands. We need to be able to handle our own problems. </p>

<p>Also, the UN and other political bodies certainly are interested in dismantling the Bill of Rights, so if we are to rely on a foreign court to prosecute our villains - it may as well be entirely up to that court what our laws are made up of as well. </p>

<p>At this point, no one in the USA will be prosecuted for war crimes unless we lose a world war, or the people finally raise the gates with pitchforks. But I&#39;m not going to hold my breath waiting on that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, no problem, I think I missed the gist of what your saying initially.</p>

<p>Good point. I wasn&#39;t thinking the UN as some &quot;foreign Power&quot; as it is &quot;The United Nations&quot; and therefor has American representatives, but more like a Arbitrator, which is by nature temporary and case specific.</p>

<p>We created the UN kind of basically to handle these kinds of problems, like a collective round table of sorts.</p>

<p>If it is no longer functioning in that capacity, then I agree with you 100%</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After WW2 Nazis were tried and convicted of waging a war of Aggression, which was thought to be the worse offense of all the war crimes, because it encompassed all other crimes, because it started the war that make those crimes possible .  Now we have the Bush Doctrine, which makes wars of aggression legal(and they don&#39;t even need congress&#39;s approval).  No matter how you look at Iraq, it was a war of aggression, as we were not attacked by them.  Ever.  How far have we really advanced morally?  Also, allies were not able to be tried for war crimes, because by the laws they invented then charged the Nazis ex post facto, only the axis could be charged with war crimes.  This saved Stalin(and arguably a few other Allied leaders&#39; lives, not that we could have enforced a ruling on them if we did bring them to international court).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s just a coincidence that OP learned about the Japanese torture, and emphasized the most controversial method in the CIA report (everyone agrees that castrating retarded family members is just plain bad, but many thing waterboarding is okay), right after the CIA report made it into the headlines.</p>

<p>Just because the story is set in the 1940s doesn&#39;t mean the post isn&#39;t about today&#39;s politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that it is a recent political issue, and that is why it is being removed from TIL.</p>

<p>If it were being removed from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, then you would have a point about it being censored. But TIL has specific rules against recent news stories.</p>

<p>I thought it was a grey area and fishy, but then I opened the link.</p>

<p>It&#39;s from politifact.com. The title is &quot;History supports McCain&#39;s stance on waterboarding&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend maybe using a source that doesn&#39;t scream &quot;political agenda&quot; and see if it does better on TIL. Unless it&#39;s just for the karma, then keep at it! Clearly this sub takes things at face value as much as the rest of the sleeping sheep indoctrinated subclass</p>

<p>No recent politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index#wiki_rule_.234.3A_nothing_related_to_recent_politics.">their wiki</a> which goes into more detail on the rule:</p>

<p><em>It also means posts about things older than 8 years that relate to current or recent politics are also banned. For example, marijuana legalization is a current political topic, with legalization efforts ongoing in many states. As a result, legalization is a banned topic, even if the legalization point you want to reference is older than 8 years. It may be helpful to think of the 8 years as setting a time limit on how long before a banned topic becomes unbanned after no longer being political. It does not mean that political events over 8 years old are automatically okay.</em></p>

<p>Posts about torture are in <em>clear</em> violation of that. I don&#39;t even know how it&#39;s up for debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing: if it was just the TIL title, I would totally agree that it&#39;s an unfair removal. However, the OP posted in the thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s the UN Convention Against Torture that the US has signed &amp; ratified. It seems to me that if you follow Cheney&#39;s logic, then waterboarding ought to be permitted in domestic law enforcement matters. (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2pcqpm/til_after_wwii_japanese_were_tried_convicted_and/cmvgkqp">Link</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and if you actually follow the link (instead of just reading the title) it is from Poltifact and is an explicit comment on a recent (2007, TIL has an 8 year moratorium on politics) statement from John McCain about the US&#39;s use of waterboarding. Both of those facts combined makes it pretty dang obvious that the OP is intentionally trying to shoehorn in current politics into TIL. That&#39;s a blatant violation of the rules.</p>

<p>Does this invalidate the comparison between Japanese and American use of waterboarding? No it does not. What it does mean, however, is that before you cry &quot;censorship&quot; you should make sure that the OP isn&#39;t <em>willingly</em> and <em>knowingly</em> violating the rules. If you think that the rule doesn&#39;t make sense, then go talk to the mods (or the users of TIL) about the rule itself instead of dragging censorship into it or arguing that the topic is just so important that rules don&#39;t apply anymore when discussing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for the mods of TIL of course but I would suspect it&#39;s because (a) the comment is not the offense - it&#39;s proof that the OP knew that they were breaking the rules and making an explicitly political post - and (b) even without the comment, the post itself still breaks the rules. <a href="/r/TIL">/r/TIL</a> has a minimum 8 year moratorium on political topics. The post is from 2007, which is 7 years ago.</p>

<p>Once again, you can certainly say that the rule doesn&#39;t make sense or you can say that it is being applied unfairly. That&#39;s certainly fine. I might disagree with that but reasonable people are allowed to disagree. Saying that it&#39;s being &quot;censored&quot;, though, I feel is unreasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree that we can disagree. My view is that the people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are much more political in conversation than the rest of reddit, I guess. We just think that this is extremely important to give visibility to and to talk about.

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that. I guess you can say that it&#39;s a fundamental difference in belief in how subs should operate. I believe that subs should not function as the proverbial grease trap — catching every little thing — but should instead focus on a specific topic. Under that belief, removing the post makes sense since it&#39;s outside of TIL&#39;s stated purpose.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve seen with many people on this sub (not necessarily your belief, though) is that content should be decided &quot;democratically&quot;, which is to say that the only thing that should matter is the up/downvotes. Under that belief, removing the post was wrong because it had a significant amount of positive attention.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say about that. I&#39;d rather not set off a <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html">&quot;holy war&quot;</a>.</p>

It&#39;s amazing how many people on this website form their political opinions FROM reddit. Whatever reddit tells them is bad, they think is bad. I remember the whole NSA thing, literally everyone on reddit would go on about how horrible the NSA and how America is turning into a &quot;police state&quot; (so stupid), but then when you ask them how the NSA works and what exactly they are all about they just spout out buzz words that they saw on reddit headlines. Replace NSA with any other current event or institution and that</p>

<p>I know these comments are usually blasted for being too &quot;reactionary&quot;, but are there any reddit alternatives? Every time Reddit&#39;s corruption is exposed everyone bitches and moves on like nothig in the hour. If a reddit alternative became more well known then users could threaten reddit with a Digg like exodus and finally have a say in the administration. I mean you could just do a 8chan type thing and use a clone with maybe some new texturing (let&#39;s face it reddit isn&#39;t the most pretty out there. )</p>

<p>Yep. On r/conspiracy, where the majority of folks here follow this stuff and are aware of it. But to a bigger, default sub? No way it would last and you know it.</p>

<p>Nice cognitive dissonance there.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s OK, because the inmates in Guantanamo aren&#39;t Prisoner&#39;s Of War, their enemy combatants. And they weren&#39;t Tortured, they were just subject to Enhanced Interrogation Techniques. See where I&#39;m going with this?</p>
