        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is absolutely insane when you think about it. Hitler was THE most popular leader in Europe before World War 2. He lead Germany to an economic boom the likes of which had never before been seen in history. Germany experienced an explosion in the arts, sciences, literature, military, philosophy,and in a couple years went from bankrupt slum to World Superpower. Never has a nation improved so fast in the History of mankind.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s supposed negative actions are focused on way more than his counterparts. Stalin killed WAYYYY more people than anybody ever claimed Hitler did. The US was still hanging black people in the South(Harry Truman was a member of the KKK in 1920&#39;s, look it up), and had Japanese in Concentration Camps. The Japanese Raped the whole of China(e.g. Nanking). We firebombed Berlin, and Tokyo&#39;s civilians, killing 100,000 people in Tokyo alone , and then Nuked Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Why is Hitler so vilified?</p>

<p>It all started with events like the &quot;Katyn Massacre&quot;,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre</a> which was an event where 10,000&#39;s of people were murdered by the soviets. They blamed the Nazis. Everyone blamed the Nazis. Until 1990 when Russia revealed that the Soviets actually did it and then blamed the Nazis. FDR and Churchill had to pretend like the Nazis were the murderers from an early stage in the war, or else they had to admit their ally(Stalin) was a murdering psychopath(and that they entered WW2 for no moral reason). The myth compounded, and Jewish suffering became the &quot;focal point&quot;, and WW2 became known as the Holocaust. Most of the people who died were not Jewish(undisputed fact). Most of the atrocities were not committed by Nazis(undisputed fact). It gets lost in History that Hitler had respect for Britain, and did not engage in &quot;total warfare&quot; until after Germany&#39;s civilians had been target by the RAF many times.</p>

<p>The &quot;elite&quot; (or Jewish elite, or Zionists, or Rothschild) that rule the world now are the exact people that Hitler was against(he even specifically called out the Rothschilds, some of whom are German Jews). Hitler worked alongside many religions(including 30 countries that fought alongside the 3rd Reich). He wasn&#39;t racist, or against any religion, and applauded races improving themselves and taking pride in their own race&#39;s heritage(He even gave a Qu&#39;ran with swastika on it to an Islamic Leader in Africa as a sign of tolerance).  He did not want to conquer the world and make everyone Aryan.  He did not want to rid the world of Jews.  He wanted every race to be efficient, and improve themselves, and to treat each other fairly(not hold guns to countries heads with debts, like was done to Germany after WW1 at Treaty of Versailles, and to other nations by International Bankers). Many(but not all) people heralded the Nazis as liberators when their tanks rolled into their towns. Why did so many people willingly join Hitler&#39;s army(including Poles, Soviets, Japanese, Muslims etc.) if he was a racist murderer who hated everyone who was not Aryan? Why did Germans fight to the last bullet? Because they loved him, and he actually cared about the people, unlike the International Bankers.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>&quot;The struggle between the people and the hatred amongst them is being nurtured by very specific interested parties. It is a small rootless international clique that is turning against each other that does not want them to have peace. It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil which they have grown up who feel at home everywhere. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements, because they conduct their business everywhere the the people cannot follow them.&quot; - Adolf Hitler(translated from German)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this is that the Nazis were largely funded by western industrialists and bankers, specifically Wall Street.  How can it be that Hitler and the Nazis were truly opposed to these people when they were being funded by them?</p>

<p>This also ignores all of the evil things that Nazis <em>did</em> do, such as Josef Mengele&#39;s appalling experiments on live subjects, many of them children, which later formed the basis for MK-Ultra</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is important to address one of the first points made in the post: &quot;why is hitler the most vilified leader of the 20th century&quot;.</p>

<p>I heard a podcast discussing this topic and it did open my mind. As op said other leaders killed many more people and yet hitter is widely considered the most evil man in the 1900s.</p>

<p>Therefore I don&#39;t see your statement of hitler being funded by western forces to refute his.</p>

<p>The west was also full of people who were against oligarchy and supported Germany, the most popular person in America at the time Charles Lindbergh for example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you that Hitler being vilified as the most evil man in history while ignoring all of the atrocities committed by the allies during the war, along with the outright lies in the &quot;official story&quot; of the allies, are obvious bullshit.</p>

<p>But the OP seemed to be trying to make the point that not only was Hitler <em>not</em> the most evil man in history, but that he actually was good and the Nazis had legitimate and noble goals.  This conflicts with the reality that they were being funded by the very people OP claims Hitler was against and also with the many evil things that certain Nazis were responsible for (like Mengele and Dr. Greenbaum - though they weren&#39;t the only ones).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s a complicated topic.</p>

<p>Suggesting that the Nazis were a panacea certainly seems foolish. They were oppressive to any other political parties or opinions. They did in fact kill many people for no good reason.</p>

<p>However we have to look at why they are so vilified. I don&#39;t know that I have the answer but it is an intriguing question.</p>

<p>I would also caution you and everyone else to never assume you have the story figured out. Were the financiers really the same in both sides? What was their motivation? Consolidation of gold? Destruction of developed economies? Population reduction? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because today we only get the &quot;allied version&quot; of events which is pure, unadulterated propaganda through and through.  Hitler was literally Satan and the allies were literally God, waging a holy war against their (and the world&#39;s) ideological and moral enemies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Were the financiers really the same in both sides?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, a lot of them were yeah.  Wall Street and a lot of other industrialists were heavily funding both sides of the war.  For instance, GM &amp; Ford provided the majority of armored trucks for Nazi Germany, Standard Oil provided a lot (possibly the majority) of their oil, and IBM produced technology for them as well.</p>

<p>The BIS, the central banks&#39; central bank, was also <em>crawling</em> with Nazis all during the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.</p>

<p>The BIS had a clause in its original charter saying that it would be immune from seizure, closure, or censure, regardless of what happened and even if its members were at war. Some of its members were the First National Bank of New York, the Bank of England, the Reichsbank, the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France, etc.  So then when this same bank turns around and funnels money and gold to the Nazis, with the total consent of its other member banks (a few of which were their supposed &quot;mortal/moral enemies&quot;), red flags begin to be raised.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I hope you aren&#39;t referring to me as I by no means claim to &quot;know everything&quot;.  But I do know <em>some</em> things and I use this knowledge to speculate on what <em>may have</em> happened.</p>

<p>My opinion at this point is that Hitler was either a pawn who was in way over his head and didn&#39;t realize where his funding was coming from (Nazi Germany was very compartmentalized and Hitler had numerous powerful advisors and people in charge of various aspects of the country/government/war effort) <em>or</em> he was a willing agent of the international bankers whose main goals were (probably) to help bring about the creation of Israel and also to destroy German sovereignty (and he succeeded at both, even if he didn&#39;t mean to).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschilds got rich by playing country against country, selling both sides weapons, then loaning them both money to payback their debts(which were  to the Rothschilds).  It&#39;s the same scheme as Iraq and the Federal Reserve(also Rothschild), and why we(US) are currently in Debt.  Why would Hitler care where the money came from, so long as he got it?  And why would they care if Hitler was trying to destroy them if they could still profit off him(and the Allies, if war broke out), and didn&#39;t really perceive him as a threat.
I&#39;ve never seen a source for Hitler&#39;s funding, and would love a link. </p>

<p>Because the entire supposition of your OP is that Hitler was <em>against</em> these international banking interests and the powerful Jews in Germany.  Why would he then accept funding from these very sources?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seen a source for Hitler&#39;s funding, and would love a link.</p>

<p>Check out <em>Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler</em> by Anthony Sutton, it&#39;s probably the best book I&#39;ve read on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can agree with you here - there&#39;s no doubt that the US and others were and are doing similar things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the experiments were for the greater good of humanity, and science at least</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be said of literally every immoral and evil experiment in the history of the planet.  Eugenicists believe their ideology is for the good of humanity as well.  But the reality is that Mengele was a monster and there is no justification for some of the things he did to his (<strong>unwilling</strong>) subjects such as injecting chemicals into the eyes of children and attempting to sew twins together to create a pseudo-Siamese twin.</p>

<p>There is no justification whatsoever for experiments like these.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at a Wall Street connection, but it was probably an agent of the Rothschilds who lent the money, or minimally the Rothschilds knew all about it.  The Rothschilds had a deal with Germany(Hitler) from 1933 to 1940 where Jews could sell all possessions in Germany, immigrate to Palestine, then be reimburse in Palestine by the Rothschilds(who got money transferred from Germany for the value of the goods).  The Rothschild name was obviously hidden by corporations, and people who act for them.  This was the beginning of Israel.  I personally think they used Hitler(that&#39;s more their style), to get the Jews moved to Palestine so they could have their own &quot;Jewish&quot;(Rothschild) state.  The Rothschild name is all over Israel, and they funded much of it(along with the USA).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating human testing, but I can understand how somebody could think sacrificing one person&#39;s life to potentially cure glaucoma, or cancer for the whole of humanity for the rest of time is &quot;moral&quot;.  I don&#39;t agree with it, but it&#39;s not quite as bad a nuking or firebombing a civilian population IMO, or lying about WMDs in Iraq, and killing hundreds of thousands.  To each their own.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with almost all of that.</p>

<p>But I urge you to look into Mengele more, he was not doing anything for the good of humanity.  He was performing experiments for his own sadistic pleasure and to learn more about the human body in order to make it easier to dominate and control.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at a Wall Street connection, but it was probably an agent of the Rothschilds who lent the money, or minimally they knew all about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, a lot of the Wall Street financiers had ties to Europe and the Rothschilds and their many agents.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that Hitler was mostly a pawn who either was in way over his head and didn&#39;t know where the funding was coming from (he had a ton of powerful advisers and Nazi Germany was <em>highly</em> compartmentalized) <em>or</em> he was a willing agent of these bankers and simply helped provide the catalyst that led to both the creation of Israel and the destruction of German sovereignty.</p>

<p>It would then, perhaps, make sense for Hitler to have escaped to Argentina if those stories are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is arguable that the financiers played Hitler for a fool, their end game being the establishment of the Jewish state. </p>

<p>Most people do not realize that the Nazis had a huge hand in this, working with the Zionist Federation to form the Haavara Agreement, which basically paid for Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Thousands of them left before the war ever started, and it was the war which ultimately ended it.</p>

<p>The vilification of the Nazis after the war and the spreading of propaganda that Hitler tried to exterminate the Jews encouraged further Jewish emigration to Israel out of fear of future persecution.</p>

<p>It was also a financial boon, with the billions reaped from the Holocaust story in the form of forced reparations extorted from Germany, in addition to billions more in financial aid and sympathy from the international community. Plus now they&#39;ve got the Americans by the balls through the manipulation of media and their stranglehold on the US economy through the federal reserve bank, they essentially get a free military to pound their neighbors with and a shield against any international backlash for their blatant land grabbing and human rights violations.</p>

<p>There was a huge scandal involving Holocaust reparations that of course was never covered by the zionist media. Many of the families, genuine victims of the war, never received a cent of the reparation money, it was mostly embezzled and stolen.</p>

<p>Norman Finkelstein has written a thorough indictment of these practices in his book <em>The Holocaust Industry</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  One of the questions I still have though is was Hitler a willing pawn or an unwitting one?  I&#39;ve seen some evidence to support both ideas - I think I probably lean towards his being complicit in the globalists&#39; agenda to destabilize Germany and create Israel.  His possible &quot;escape to Argentina&quot; plays into this idea and would seem to support it.</p>

<p>Nobody talks or knows about the Haavara Agreement - it&#39;s such an essential piece of the puzzle.  I think the BIS is as well, as it was crawling with Nazis during the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s despite some of its member banks being the First National Bank of New York, the Bank of England and the Bank of France, among others, and it was a main source of funding for Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Hi. I used to think this, only being aware of Sutton&#39;s book, before I started researching. The thing is, it isn&#39;t remotely accurate to say &quot;largely&quot;. This is probably the best article exploring NSDAP funding:</p>

<p>Sure, but that funding pales in comparison to the money the NSDAP got from basically emptying the accounts of the trade unions in 1933...</p>

<p>There&#39;s also [&quot;Warburg&#39;s&quot;] allegation of secret Jewish funding, but that&#39;s based on an anonymous account which has been fairly comprehensively debunked by revisionist scholars.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Simply because not everyone was opposed to a strong Germany, as a counterbalance to Bolshevism, as a means to making money, and for moral reasons after Versailles. Some industrialists and bankers were pro-NS, it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Hitler was funded by the Jews&quot; -- that&#39;s kind-of pop-conspiracy nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No Warburgs. No Rothschilds. No Rockefellers. While the Rockefellers indirectly came into Hitler’s financial sphere by way of Standard Oil technical investments and the Warburgs via I. G. Farben and J. H. Stein later on, neither gave Hitler any financial support before 1933. And neither directly supported or paid Hitler at any point in time. The Sidney Warburg story is pure fabrication. Fritz Thyssen and some of Hugenberg’s heavy industrial connections, not James Warburg, gave Hitler substantial monetary gifts in 1929 (at least RM 1,250,000) and Deterding and several German coal companies took care of Hitler in the early 1930s. While Hitler spent a vast amount on campaigning, he was by no means rolling in untraceable money. All of his funding was carefully accounted for and most of it came from VB advertising; party dues, insurance, and speaking fees; Gregor Strasser’s left-wing faction, which received RM 10,000 per month in 1931; the good will of VB publisher Adolf Müller; and the financial frugality of party treasurer Franz Schwarz, whose meticulous party financial records were destroyed. The Americans interrogated him so brutally that he died in 1946 in British captivity. His records denoting even Hitler’s anonymous donors never turned up anywhere. The Pools suspect that the American occupiers destroyed them.</p>

<p>As for Goebbels’s remark on 17 January 1932 that the finances of the party “suddenly improved,” this was not exactly true. The truth is that the party’s credit line suddenly improved, and this was thanks to the maneuverings of Franz von Papen and Baron Kurt von Schröder with his syndicate of investors, including a number of prominent heavy industrialists, the Hamburg-America Steamship Line, the Stein Bank of Cologne, Commerz und Privat Bank, the Gelsenkirchen Mine Company, Deutsche Bank, Reichskredit-Gesellschaft Bank, Allianz Insurance, members of the potash industry, the Brabag Coal Company, Deutsches Erdöl, and a number of other brown-coal industrialists. While Hitler tolerated fifth-column banks like M. M. Warburg and the Temple Bank (a special account created for the Temple Society by the Reichsbank to fund Ha’avara emigration), he eventually restricted and regulated their business opportunities and forced them to assist with financing Jewish emigration. Hitler’s goal was to increasingly inhibit and thereby financially squeeze the foreign banks until they were unable to exist any longer and had to relocate outside Germany—the same policy he employed to encourage Jewish emigration and business closures. One such example was the Germanization (i.e. German takeover) of two Jewish ironworks plants in the Rhön region in 1937.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry - continued:</p>

<p>In general, I think the &quot;Hitler was a serious threat to western banking&quot; thing is slightly over-played. I don&#39;t consider it the primary reason even for Jewish opposition, compared to the overarching project just to re-cripple Germany&#39;s economy and steal its export markets, [depose the NSDAP] and then move back in and take over again - as somewhat happened between 1918 and 1930ish. But that&#39;s not to say that the foreign economic and geopolitical motivations weren&#39;t [also] &quot;Jewish&quot; to a certain extent, considering how intertwined Jewish aristocracy is with the English ruling-class, for example.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t deny that Germany&#39;s barter trade network, and the crack-down on speculative &quot;easy money&quot; weren&#39;t significant factors also.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Which was basically what the NSDAP policy always was, although of course by &#39;41 that changed to &quot;we&#39;ll use them for labor and then dump them in the east, and after the war, continue to exclude them so hopefully they&#39;ll all emigrate.&quot;</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, it was only really about 60,000 Jews who emigrated through that scheme between &#39;33 and &#39;39. So it didn&#39;t make the huge dent in the Jewish population that the NSDAP may have wanted. That said, without the war, presumably the NSDAP and the Zionists could&#39;ve worked together to eventually achieve their mutual goal.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in dealing with the Zionists, the NSDAP turned their back on supporters within the Jewish-German nationalist communities. In the Weimar period, these guys were like, &quot;hey, wtf, who are all these Eastern Jews flooding into Germany - they&#39;re Bolsheviks and Zionists and basically confirm all of the worst anti-semitic stereotypes!&quot; They considered themselves German nationalists first, [<em>then</em> Jews] - they spoke out against anti-German propaganda in the international press, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2013/volume_5/number_3/german_nationalist_jews.php">http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2013/volume_5/number_3/german_nationalist_jews.php</a></p>

<p>Compared to today, back then the Jewish diaspora was much more divided between assimilationists and Zionists. The Jewish WWI veterans groups basically supported the NSDAP. But the NSDAP didn&#39;t want Jews to assimilate, just leave.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Haavara. I assume you&#39;ve read these first two short books?</p>

<p>Weckert&#39;s &#39;Jewish Immigration and the Third Reich&#39;:</p>

<p><a href="http://vho.org/dl/ENG/jefttr.pdf">http://vho.org/dl/ENG/jefttr.pdf</a></p>

<p>And Udo Walendy&#39;s book on &#39;The Transfer Agreement and the Boycott Fever&#39;, which I&#39;ve uploaded for you here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1418440671">http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1418440671</a></p>

<p>If you want to go deeper, to get a really good sense of where the NSDAP were at with their Jewish policy, you could read Wiebe&#39;s &#39;The Jewish Problem in Germany&#39; from 1938:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.national-socialism.com/jewish-problem-germany/">http://www.national-socialism.com/jewish-problem-germany/</a></p>

<p>Also relevant, perhaps is Eckhart&#39;s &#39;Jewish Domination of Weimar Germany&#39;:</p>

<p><a href="http://ia601807.us.archive.org/12/items/JewishDominationOfWeimarGermany1919-1932/Jewish%20Domination%20of%20Weimar%20Germany%20-%201919-1932_text.pdf">http://ia601807.us.archive.org/12/items/JewishDominationOfWeimarGermany1919-1932/Jewish%20Domination%20of%20Weimar%20Germany%20-%201919-1932_text.pdf</a></p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m curious though, how do you explain Hitler&#39;s letting the British escape at Dunkirk, signing the treaty with the French saying he wouldn&#39;t use any of the French fleet for his own purposes (even after France was under control), canceling weapons research  ~1940 because he thought he could &quot;win with what he had&quot;, and his &quot;no retreat&quot; order?

<p>I wasn&#39;t.  I was using it to make the point that the Nazis aren&#39;t the harbingers of freedom and good fortune that this OP seems to paint them as.  Are you suggesting that Hitler was unaware of the work Mengele (and many others) were doing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people did Hitler kill himself? It pales in comparison to those who he persuaded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this as well but the point remains that the Nazis were responsible for many war crimes and atrocities.  I obviously agree that the western propaganda which has made Hitler out to be the most evil man in history and the sole cause of WWII is complete bullshit but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true to paint Hitler and the Nazis as noble crusaders for justice who&#39;ve been unjustly persecuted by history.</p>

<p>I mean, they <em>have</em> to some extent, but they were also involved in a lot of evil things and I believe that Hitler was aware of these things.</p>

<p>I agree with more things in the OP than not, I just think it wasn&#39;t wholly accurate or at least didn&#39;t tell the whole story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about it but I think it definitely requires more research and inquiry.  To my knowledge, there really isn&#39;t much out there about the idea except for the FBI files that have partially been released.</p>

<p>What I do think is that his escaping to Argentina (if he indeed did) would tend to suggest that he was working for the globalists and was let go after he&#39;d &quot;served his purpose&quot;.  I&#39;ve heard it suggested that Hitler himself was related to the Rothschilds and/or an &quot;elite&quot; bloodline which might play in here as well.</p>

<p>We also know that a lot of other Nazis <em>did</em> escape to Argentina (like Josef Mengele) so this sort of supports the idea too - or at least doesn&#39;t refute it.</p>

<p>(Interesting side note: There is a story about how a town in Brazil had an incredibly high rate of twin births, almost all of which were blonde haired and blue eyed.  Who visited this town during the 1960&#39;s posing as a vet and later &quot;treated&quot; pregnant women?  Josef Mengele.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure though - I don&#39;t think there is enough evidence to know either way and if there is I haven&#39;t come across it.</p>

<p>Hitler was THE most popular leader in Europe before World War 2. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was not the most popular, there were a lot of concerns from the over countries about his internal politics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany experienced an explosion in the arts, sciences, literature, military, philosophy,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes science and military evolved but a lot of cultural figures from Germany flew the country. There were complaints about the freedom of speech way before 1940. All this happened not because of the war but because of the censorship happening in the country in the 30s. Some choose to stay but they could not criticize publicly the regime.</p>

<p>The whole point is that Hitler is one of most despised man in History but that doesn&#39;t mean people like Staline were acclaimed. There is plenty of literature about the Staline and the Soviet era telling us about the horrors that have been committed.</p>

<p>How can you say Hitler wasn&#39;t against any religion when he cleary had something against the Jews. There are several reports coming from Hitler or his close entourage (notably Göring) about what was called &quot;the Jewish problem&quot;. If he wanted every race to be on the same level (this is him already admitting being racist if he considers that some races are weaker), calling the Jewish a problem, killing them, deporting them, banning everything related to them, is not the solution.</p>

<p>A lot happened before 1940 in Gemrany. There are several good reads about it, for example &quot;In the Garden of Beasts&quot; which uses as base the Memoires of the US Ambassador in Germany in 33-34 William Dodd which many relates as having been too weak regarding Hitler position and yet what he describes is truly horrifying.</p>

<p>People joined the opposing armies as much as people joined Germany&#39;s. There are always two sides to take into account. The WW2 has brought a lot of misery and horror stories from both sides but it is not an excuse to apologise one side because the other did it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is anybody else sick of this daily Nazi propaganda?</p>

<p>Hitler was better than Stalin? That&#39;s the best you can say?</p>

<p>People loved Ted Bundy, too, until they found out he was a serial killer. But at least he was better than John Wayne Gacy!</p>

<p>Sure, Hitler invaded a lot of countries, but they deserved it. They looked like his mother, <em>that lemon-stealing whore!</em></p>

<p>Everybody complains about the Jews but nobody did anything about them until Hitler! But he didn&#39;t kill them! No, I didn&#39;t mean that! He rounded up the international bankers and the media tycoons and shipped them all off to Poland. And all those Jews pretending to be shopkeepers or teachers or doctors or dentists or lawyers? Ship them off, too, just to be safe! And all those rich Jews pretending to be poor Jews? An all-expenses-paid vacation to the lovely Polish countryside. And those Illuminati Judeo-masons dressed up like women and children? There&#39;s a shortage of those in Poland.</p>

<p>But Hitler never killed them, oh no. They deserved it, but he didn&#39;t mean to kill them. Those thousands of eyewitness reports of people gassed, people rounded up and shot? They&#39;re all lies! The physical evidence? All fake. All of it. The testimony from Germans? Torture! Every last one was a liar!</p>

<p>What? You want your Jews back after the war? Sorry, we&#39;ve misplaced them. But we didn&#39;t kill them. Are you sure you gave them to us? Did you keep your receipt? We can&#39;t have lost more than 1 or 2 million Jews. Maybe 3 million. At most 5 million. But not 6 million! <em>That</em> would be terrible. If it&#39;s only 5 million and they died of disease and starvation, that&#39;s <em>okay</em>. What did you want us to do, leave them in their homes? Are you crazy?</p>

<p>And did I mention that everybody loved Hitler? The Czechs loved him. The Poles loved him. The Belgians and Greeks loved him. The Serbs and the Croats joined hands and danced when Germany invaded. The French and English loved him. The Dutch and the Danes loved him. The Ukrainians and Russians loved him. Everybody loved Hitler! No person in the history of the world was more loved than Hitler. It&#39;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler">undisputed fact.</a></p>

<p>And Hitler loved England! Oh, boy, let me tell you about how much Hitler loved England. He would go on and on about how cute England was, telling me stories about England and showing me baby pictures.</p>

<p>But most importantly, Hitler was better than Stalin!</p>

<p>Love Hitler! Hate the Jews! Love Hitler! Hate the Jews! Love Hitler! Hate the Jews! Love Hitler! Hate the Jews!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.5 million Germans died in camps controlled by the allies AFTER the war ended.  Unspeakable tragedies occurred by the dozen during WW2.  I&#39;m just saying, all sides had MILLIONS die in their camps.  Why is Hitler(who by all accounts is responsible for less death than Stalin) criticized solely?  &quot;Total Warfare&quot;, the killing of ALL enemy possessions and personnel(including civilians, and cities) was used by Britain before Germany.  By the end of the war, all parties were indiscriminately and purposefully killing civilians.  To say the Nazis were evil, and the allies were good is the biggest misconstruction in history.  I think Stalin was evil.  I think the Rothschilds are evil.  I think Germany, America, Britain, and France all took part in one of the ugliest chapters in human history, and all committed crimes against humanity(but according to the international laws created by the allies, crimes against humanity by definition could only be committed by Germans, in order to protect the Allies(mainly the Soviets) from some of the same charges they punished the Nazis with).  The international court was heavily criticized(even by American Judges), because the allies created the laws the Nazis were tried under AFTER WW2,(and after the supposed crimes took place) then charged the Nazis with these newly created laws.  In law, it is widely accepted that it is not fair to prosecute somebody for a crime that was not illegal at the time it occurred.  </p>

<p>EDIT: As a part of the post-war agreement with the Soviets, the other powers (America, France, and Britain) &quot;repatriated&quot;(sent back to their home country) hundreds of thousands of &quot;Soviet&quot; &quot;citizens&quot; against their will and to their certain death(or sentencing to hard labor camps).  Stalin enacted a policy during the war that made all Soviet POW&#39;s and &quot;refugees&quot; no longer citizens, and labeled them as traitors(because he thought they were cowards, or Nazi sympathizers for surrendering instead of dying for the Union).  The allies lied to the refugees, saying the trains went to refugee camps, then they shipped them to the Soviet Union.  Almost every single &quot;refugee&quot; was sent to hard labor or death.  I&#39;ve seen videos of British Officers describing it, and how they were told to lie, because otherwise there was no way the people would ride to their deaths or imprisonment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I particularly don&#39;t like &quot;The greatest truth never told&quot; because it does lean too &quot;pro-nazi&quot; for me but you are absolutely right when you point out that people demonize the Nazis while thinking the allies were the &quot;good guys&quot; when in reality they were all equally bad...with the exception of Stalin and the Japanese who were notoriously evil. Also worth mentioning is the Cambodian government in the 1960&#39;s-1980 where they killed off almost 2/3 of the entire country&#39;s population but hey, it&#39;s the Nazis that were the most evil on the 20th century...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American government rounded up and killed a bunch of Native Americans. More recently, the American government rounded up Japanese citizens and put them into camps, exactly like the Nazis did. The only reason the Japanese weren&#39;t dying off in those camps is because the American government wasn&#39;t getting its ass kicked in WW2 like the Nazi government. If the Nazi&#39;s goal was to simply kill their POW&#39;s, they wouldn&#39;t have wasted their time and resources to house, feed, and cloth them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What native Americans were rounded up and killed during the war?  I missed that one.</p>

<p>The U.S. did have internment camps, but it was never the intention to kill them all, or any.  From the very start of the war the nazis were killing Jews and other undesirables by the thousands.  They had special units whose job it was to round up and kill such people.  From the very start of the war.</p>

<p>He lead Germany to an economic boom the likes of which had never before been seen in history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a sub called r/historicalwhatif, where WWII and Hitler questions often come up. One question in particular, always seems to get the same answer.</p>

<p>The question: What if Hitler hadn&#39;t started WWII? Or What if he&#39;d waited another 4 or 5 years? The answer always seems to be that the German economy was unsustainable. That somehow, they had to go to war and plunder the gold and resources of neighboring countries in order to keep going.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always wondered about this. AFAIK, the Nazis came to power in 1933 and started turning things around after that. Of course this included a military buildup that required high levels of government spending. </p>

<p>This seems to be similar to what happened in the USA though. During the 1930&#39;s America was in a depression. Conventional history tells us that it was all the government spending for the war effort that got the country going again. </p>

<p>So in one case, we have the German government spending on a war effort that brings the country out of a depression and gets the economy going, but is supposed to be unsustainable. In the other case, we have the US government spending on a war effort that brings the country out of a depression and gets the economy going, and this is considered to be what led America to becoming a superpower.</p>

<p>So, when someone gives the answer that Germany would have run broke in another year or two, I&#39;m a bit skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I read the same thing in a Jim Marrs book. One the one hand, it makes sense. Launch a pre-emptive attack while your enemy is not deployed defensively, but for an attack of their own. You get the advantage of surprise and the enemy will need time to reconfigure for an effective defense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an invasion the size of Operation Barbarossa would take a significant period of time to put together and launch. I&#39;ve got the feeling that the Germans were going to invade sooner or later anyways.</p>

Compare it to what historians are saying, look at the actual evidence being presented by both sides.

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually your problem. Your bias is to assign some form of mental illness or irrational hate to any criticism of jews. Do you apply this criteria to jewish historians? Do they have a conflict of interest maybe. Unless you have some actual knowledge on the topic, what use is your opinion. There&#39;s no way you can know someone&#39;s motivations. If your too fucking lazy to look it up it&#39;s one thing, but that cheap tactic of whining &quot;racist&quot; or anti-semitic is irritating.

The shit that OP is spewing is not supported by actual historians who submit their work to be criticized and debated by people from all over the world. If some fringe zionist group was making up shit as monumentally stupid as this post, i&#39;d would approach it with the same degree of skepticism. </p>

<p>The notion that Hitler was some martyr trying to simply prevent the jews from taking over the world is one of the dumbest, clearly anti-semitic things I&#39;ve seen, and any actual historian would agree.</p>

<p>So before you call me lazy or a whiner, learn what standards evidence are, and what conditions historian&#39;s claims are examined under to in order to understand how things become accepted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... let me put my understanding of the situation this way:</p>

<p>1)  Hitler was a bad guy - no dispute</p>

<p>2)  Hitler is directly responsible for millions of Jewish deaths - no dispute.</p>

<p>3)  We should learn from and prevent things like this from happening again - no dispute.</p>

<p>Here are the questions that I think the history has become less clear about:</p>

<p>1)  The actual number of Jewish deaths.  How many and what was the benefit to lying, if, in fact, the numbers cited are inaccurate?</p>

<p>2)  The mode of death.  While I think there were certainly death camps, were all of them death camps?  Or were some &quot;internment&quot; and &quot;labor&quot; camps?  I honestly don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>3)  The population of Germany in 1940 was approximately 70 million.  Hitler had widespread support among the general population.  I have a hard time believing so many people can be written off as &quot;blind, hate-filled racists&quot; without asking the simple question of &quot;Were there actually any legitimate complaints that could be made towards the Jewish population in Germany in the years preceding WW2?&quot;  (even if there are legitimate complaints, this does not excuse the behavior of the nazi regime)</p>

<p>I think all three questions are very fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t the truth according to every actual historian who studied it. The holocaust isn&#39;t some barely researched event. It happened in the modern age.

<p>The claim that the jews somehow concocted this scheme using the evidence presented in the OP is laughable and points to an ulterior motive aside from the interest in discovering truth. If you believe it, I&#39;d wager you are extremely gullible a best, but more likely someone with racist motivations.</p>

<p>I&#39;d keep going, but upon wandering over to the conspiratard post that was linked by the bot here, I happened to see a user respond to a comment you made with a rather humorous point by point rebuttal of the points the op made as well as the scathing and (from my perspective) accurate appraisal he presented regarding your nazi defending motives.

    <div class="md"><p>Calling Racism isn&#39;t the first line against &quot;Holocaust Revisionism.&quot;</p>

<p>Holocaust Denial, the more accurate title for the fucked up little movement you appear to be a part of, is the most evidence deprived, pathetic attempt to rewrite history anyone has ever witnessed. Take the sources you linked to me for example... what journal were they published in? Who peered reviewed them? What primary sources have they presented and what do other scholars say about them? They are just bullshit filled articles, repeating the same bullshit filled claims that bullshit filled White Supremacists, Skinheads, and Neo-Nazis have spewed since the beginning of the movement. </p>

<p>How do you justify the fact that historians in the entire academic world, no matter the country, find no fucking credibility in these arguments? Wait, let me guess.... Make up a world-wide conspiracy! Thousands of actors, paying off thousands of academics. Not a single whistle-blower! Those dirty Jews won&#39;t stop until everyone blames those innocent Nazis! All so they can gain sympathy to take back Israel! or control the banks! or something...</p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that there is mountains of evidence to support the fact that people were captured, forced to board trains and sent to die at work and extermination camps. And that there is testimony from Nazis themselves regarding what took place at the camps. And that there were records of all the people who were taken into the camps and exterminated. And that there is photo evidence of masses of starving people. And piles of human remains. Fuck that shit, because some articles you found on Stormfront let you hate the Jews all you want!</p>

<p>So calling you a racist is the first line against &quot;holocaust revisionism&quot; not because your big scary Hate blogs are so hard to debunk, but because any rational, educated person knows that anyone who buys into this movement is a hateful, gullible idiot with more allegiance to the Swastika on their sleeve than the search for truth. </p>

<p>I intend to make this my last post in this abortion of a thread, I&#39;ve officially learned that arguing with Pro-Hitler folk is as pointless as it is depressing. For you and anyone else I&#39;ve spoken to over the course of this pointless exchange, I would like to leave you with the immortal words of one Jello Biafra <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxd8ml-n5NE">....</a></p>

<li>Just because something is the &quot;official story&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s automatically wrong. Truth exists in evidence. Your Nazi buddies have presented insanely laughable evidence to support their claims and there is a fuckload of evidence for the &quot;official story&quot;. I don&#39;t believe the Iraq had WMD&#39;s because the American government told me so... that &quot;official story&quot; was proved wrong. Evidence is what is important, and your evidence is real fucking bad.</li>
<li>I call you a neo-nazi racist because you are vehemently defending Nazis.</li>
</ol>

<p>But ya, if you want to believe my first paragraph, go for it. You&#39;ve already demonstrated that you prefer to believe things that confirm your own racist desires over actually looking for the truth, and taking my first paragraph as true lets you do that.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;d ask you to fuck off again, but I have a feeling you won&#39;t. If you say something especially dumb again, I may respond for the fun of it, or I may not. </p>

<p>From my previous post. See, I am not trying to convince you of shit. That fact that you can say something like &quot;Hitler was framed&quot; already demonstrates that you are far too ignorant of history to possibly comprehend a reality where your racist fantasies aren&#39;t true. I am calling you a racist because only someone with a clear motivation against specific races would twist their brain enough to think anything in the OP or in the links you posted has anything resembling credibility. </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t like the established history doesn&#39;t make it untrue. I could waste my time going back through all the actual historical sources I used to find the truth when I first heard of your retarded theories, then I could post them here. But that would be a waste of time, because just by your commitment to believe your Nazi crap, despite the massive tidal wave of evidence that exists to disprove it, you would find a way to discount everything as some Jewish conspiracy or some other shit.</p>

<p>You are a lost cause. Already too deep in your hate to actually have any interest in the truth. If you weren&#39;t, you would have read what actual historians had to say and we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation.</p>

<p>I said I wanted to be done this conversation, but honestly, people like you who bathe in your hate and ignorance and treat it like a virtue, make me sick. I have a compulsive need to at least leave some sort of rebuttal to your shit, just in case some poor fool stumbles upon your ramblings and mistakes it for a cohesive argument. God forbid more stumble down the horrid path you have.</p>

<p>Anyway, I already know it&#39;s your job to enforce the narrative that anyone who questions the zionist version of history is a racist. So, keep on keepin on, but your shit isn&#39;t going to fly forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how &quot;Investigate for myself&quot; always means &quot;believe what I believe&quot;. I have investigated, and I came to a far different conclusion. It just so happens that EVERY SINGLE HISTORIAN who has ever studied it has also come to the conclusion that I have. You make up your conspiracy theories to plug the thousands of holes in your terrible excuse for a theory and pretend like you know what Critical thought is like.</p>

<p>Like I said, lost cause. This shit is going nowhere. Sorry you hate so much, sorry you have been convinced of so many lies while thinking you are hunting truth. Sorry you are so blind to evidence and critical analysis. But most of all, Sorry I started this exhausting conversation. I never thought my opinion on Neo-Nazi&#39;s could get any lower, but you&#39;ve helped make that happen. Congrats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every single historian you say?</p>

<p>Except for people like Germar Rudolf, who was booted from his doctoral program and forced into exile from Germany to avoid a 14 month prison sentence.</p>

<p>Fred Leuchter, who has had to dodge various death threats, in addition from bogus charges against him for &quot;practicing engineering without a license&quot; </p>

<p>Ernst Zundel, who spent years fighting charges of &quot;hate speech&quot; in canada, rotted away in solitary confinement, and was extradited to Germany and sent to prison for his heinous crime of denying the holocaust.</p>

<p>Robert Faurisson, who was beaten nearly to death by a gang of Jews for daring to point out that part of the diary of Anne frank, a sacred cow of holocaust mythology, was written in with a ball point pen invented after 1945.</p>

<p>Henri Roques had his doctorate stripped.</p>

<p>Those are only the most prominent among a growing list of scholars who are targeted with death threats, smear campaigns, and &quot;hate speech&quot; legal charges.</p>

<p>Weird how the holocaust is the only historical event that the belief in which is enforced by rule of law, prison sentences being doled out to any who would dare to speak out in question of it.</p>

<p>Oh, but those of us who harbor doubts are just hate mongers.</p>

<p>And here we are, with sniveling anti-intellectual weasels like you reinforcing the footings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nazis were not out to specifically kill the people they put into camps. If they were, why would they waste their time and resources to build the camps? They would have just simply executed the POW&#39;s. The only reason the POW&#39;s were dying in the Nazi camps was because the Nazi government was getting its ass kicked. POW&#39;s are on the bottom of the food chain so if the government imprisoning the POW&#39;s can&#39;t even sustain itself, how can it be expected to properly house its POW&#39;s?    The point of all this is that there was no &quot;good&quot; government during WW2, they were all equally bad (arguably Stalin&#39;s government was the worst...) but the propaganda is all out against the Nazi&#39;s in order to make the other governments look like saints. </p>

The camps allowed an efficient way to sort people, strip and sort their belongings, and then kill them according to the quotos laid out in the Master Plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the term &quot;death camp&quot; gets tossed around a little more than it should. They weren&#39;t killing in the streets because while that maybe more efficient cleaning up the mess would have been more problematic with how many deaths were recorded.</p>

<p>The main reason they forced these people into camps was: </p>

<p>1) make the clean up easier<br/>
2) conduct biological experiments of all kinds on human subjects</p>

<p>These expirements were done as a co-op with Japan and their version of Mengele; Shiro Ishii</p>

<p>Ishii was responsible for, in Manchuria iirc (always mess up the provinces) performing experiments on the Chinese which involved dumping chemical and biological weapons into the local water supplies to see how long it would take to wipe out small towns.</p>

<p>This joint research is what saved a lot of these scientist from prosecution in the world courts in Geneva as it was traded to the US for leniency / immunity. </p>

<p>The depiction of Hitler and the Nazi&#39;s while deserved was mainly used to distract the general public of the leniency / immunity given to the scientist in exchange for their research.</p>

<p>Here is some info on Shiro Ishii and his unit 731:</p>

<p>Tl;DR - you&#39;re both correct on certain aspects</p>

<p>Camps weren&#39;t &quot;death camps&quot; they were giant biological research facilities that were used to make the selection and disposal of research subjects efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, a large percentage of the exterminated Jews were rounded up and killed in the streets by Einzatsgruppen, so the whole argument that 6 million Jews couldn&#39;t have been killed in the camps is already based on a flawed premise. Sometimes it was easier to kill them in the villages, other times it was more effective to round them up and murder on an industrial scale. In all instances, however, it is well documented that the Nazi regime pursued Jewish extermination to the point that it was severely harming their war efforts, proving beyond a doubt that this was a concerted pre planned effort and a Nazi priority, regardless of their methods in different cases.</p>

<p>This article is about people&#39;s perception of Israel and how the powers that be vilified Hitler. Apparently you missed that part. It wasn&#39;t even 100 years ago.</p>

<p>Lemme guess</p>

<p>Hitler, Gadaffi, Hussein, Kim Jong-un, and everyone else that opposes these regimes is evil, a bigot etc. But carpet bombing the people next door in Palestine relentlessly and being involved in holy wars for thousands of years is okay.</p>

<p>Haha you are, but knowledge is power my friend!</p>

<p>It&#39;s part of Sutton&#39;s &quot;Wall Street Trilogy&quot;, the other two deal with the Bolshevik Revolution and with FDR.  You can probably find the other two online as well if you feel so inclined.</p>

<p>Incredibly interesting stuff - Sutton was easily one of the most courageous historians of the last century and many attempts were made to discredit and marginalize his work because of it.  Most people today have never even heard of him which is by design.</p>

<p>He <em>also</em> has one about the Order of Skull and Bones which I would highly recommend too.</p>

<p>Edit:  And you should talk to your uncle.  I&#39;m sure it would be an interesting conversation. :)</p>

<p>But when one actually does the research and ignores the learned guilt and shame associated with thinking against the establishment narrative...many things start to came to light when you question &quot;Why are things the way they are today?&quot; </p>

<p>Personally, I still have a hard time when it comes to the Holocaust. I&#39;m not ready to come out and say it never happened yet. However, after learning the ways of Zionism, controlled media and the absolute destruction of people who try to go against it...I absolutely believe most of what I was taught in school was a lie.</p>

<p>Like 9/11, the Holocaust is religion. That is to say, if you don&#39;t believe the official story, you are a blasphemer. A sinner that is damned to hell. The brainwashed masses will treat you like a freak for believing in a hidden truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people have a good nature, so they would never believe that a group of people could collectively make up something as horrendous and fantastical as the Holocaust just for profit.</p>

<p>The truth is, the bits and pieces don&#39;t quite fit together. Actually, that&#39;s an understatement. The entire story falls to shambles. Like the goose that laid the golden egg, if the Jews were patient then they may have gotten away with all the riches in the world. But, that&#39;s not how the story of the Jew goes. Thanks to their greed, they&#39;ve given us a reason to peak behind the curtain. Lets just say once you see what goes on behind there, you can never again live in the Zionist fairy dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>According to Sir Arthur Bryant the British historian (Unfinished Victory (1940 pp. 136-144):</p>

<p>Every year it became harder and harder for a gentile to gain or keep a foothold in any privileged occupation.. At this time it was not the &#39;Aryans&#39; who exercised racial discrimination. It was a discrimination that operated without violence. It was exercised by a minority against a majority. There was no persecution, only elimination.. It was the contrast between the wealth enjoyed - and lavishly displayed - by aliens of cosmopolitan tastes, and the poverty and misery of native Germans, that has made anti-Semitism so dangerous and ugly a force in the new Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, this book is published out of Princeton University</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, in a book unexpectedly published by Princeton University Press in 1984, Sarah Gordon (Hitler, Germans and the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;) essentially confirms what Bryant says. According to her, &#39;Jews were never a large percentage of the total German population; at no time did they exceed 1% of the population during the years 1871-1933.&#39; But she adds &#39;Jews were overrepresented in business, commerce, and public and private service.. They were especially visible in private banking in Berlin, which in 1923 had 150 private Jewish banks, as opposed to only 11 private non-Jewish banks.. They owned 41% of iron and scrap iron firms and 57% of other metal businesses.. Jews were very active in the stock market, particularly in Berlin, where in 1928 they comprised 80% of the leading members of the stock exchange. By 1933, when the Nazis began eliminating Jews from prominent positions, 85% of the brokers on the Berlin Stock exchange were dismissed because of their &quot;race&quot;.. At least a quarter of full professors and instructors (at German universities) had Jewish origins.. In 1905-6 Jewish students comprised 25% of the law and medical students.. In 1931, 50% of the 234 theatre directors in Germany were Jewish, and in Berlin the number was 80%.. In 1929 it was estimated that the per capita income of Jews in Berlin was twice that of other Berlin residents..&#39; etc etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny how all of that sounds very familiar to what we are seeing today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you think Hitler was obsessed with the Destruction of England.  If anything he was averted to it.  He even let the British retreat back to their island by giving them two days without attack to leave France.  Britain had to embarrassingly use commercial boats to ferry its soldiers back, as almost all of their military transport ships were destroyed.  Rather than invade a vulnerable Britain(that had run out of ways to fight), Hitler invaded the Soviets, who he thought would invade the whole of Europe if he took out the only other remaining superpower(England).  Hitler revered the Brits, and thought of them as similar to the Germans.  Hitler was obsessed with the destruction of communism, not England.  Hitler tried to strike peace with England many times throughout the war, but their imperialist pride would not let them agree to surrender with conditions.  Instead England convinced America to enter the War(even though there was no reason for Isolationist America to fight, and their citizenry was firmly against joining WW2 which was seen as a European civil war).  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, from what I know - it doesn&#39;t seem like his motive/agenda was solely that of ridding the world of the pests that plague us today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for the poster above specifically but I believe the reason people think Hitler wanted England destroyed was because of exposure to old propaganda shown in school. You had the reels that were shown to potential soldier citizens after the fact falsely saying that everyone else in the US supported war and it would be unpatritoic if they didn&#39;t join, there were the videos showing a demonic hitler talking about his plans of world domination and expanding the motherland, and then there was the film showing London during the bombings showing how happy and strong they were while showing massive destruction in an attempt to guilt the US into helping. The cherry on top was Triumph of the Will which solidified peoples view on the crazy of Hitler. It&#39;s been quite awhile since watching them but I could probably drag up names if anyone is interested in the films if they haven&#39;t seen them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Hitler and Stalin were both equally brutal dictators yet the one who won the war is still treated with a degree of respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing about that. You can read up on Hitler&#39;s plans for after he won the war. The conquest would spread to Africa and Asia, and possibly to the Americas. Minority groups of all kinds would be put to genocide or work camps. All of the world would eventually come under the reign of the fuhrer.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: 100% hell on Earth.</p>

<p>What if Stalin won the war? Thing is...we know what happens when Stalin wins the war, because...well, it <em>did</em> happen. It was by no means pretty, by no means humane, absolutely...but it wasn&#39;t utter Hell on Earth for the entire globe, as Hitler planned. You can even blame some of the deaths under Stalin on incompetence, or political vendettas or pressuring. Moreover, the Marxist agenda for spreading Communism is primarily through education of working classes and encouraging them to foment their <em>own</em> revolutions, in theory. In practice, it was not so straightforward. However, for Hitler, global conquest by force was the explicit plan. Any revolutions within countries of their own making would be an obstacle for Hitler. </p>

<p>After Stalin, despite no huge ideological shift in the USSR, things got demonstrably better for many (not all, not even close) people, and a lot of the brutality was deliberately purged from the government. Still not pretty, but, compare that to Hitler, for whom racist genocide and world conquest by force was a <em>primary, central tenet of the governing ideology</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more than &quot;Winners write history.&quot; We saw who won, what they planned, and what they did. Much of it was worse as a direct result of incompetence. If Hitler won, incompetence could only <em>get in the way</em> of creating a Hell on Earth for every non-Aryan or non-Nazi. </p>

<p>It does not, in any way shape or form, suggest Stalin was <em>not</em> a monster to assert that Hitler was <em>a way worse monster</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to guess that most of these upvotes are coming from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, which loves blame the joos posts on this sub.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with OP&#39;s take, but I think it&#39;s an interesting topic.  What were the Jewish banking/Industrialist families roles in World War 2, whether as scapegoats or profiteers?  What were the relationships between the war machine and the german/austrian royalty and banking houses:  Particularly Hapsburgh, Sachs Coburg Goetha, Rothschild and Warburg.  What did the same industrialists contribute to the rise of Soviet Communism?  And what role might zionism have played in all of this?</p>

<p>To this day, Germany has an interesting relationship with Russia AND a united europe. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to study the tides of banking and industry capitals which tend to shift as people get fed up with profiteering.  Even follow the history of the Warburgs (who sat on the board of IG Farben leading up to WW2), back to 16th century Venice- which was at the time the banking capital of the world until anti-semitic legislation was passed as a reaction to usery.  But remember that the &quot;court jew&quot; was used by both christian and islamic royalty to manage their finances in both the austro hungarian and ottoman empires.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a great book called &#39;Hitler&#39;s Revolution&#39; by Richard Tedor, which draws mostly from German sources, and which I would recommend, as it talks a lot about NS reforms and their actual economic and social policies -- but you&#39;d need to buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nazi economy was completely unsustainable. Hitler did turn Germany around, but his improvements would not have lasted for more than a couple of decades. He used government money to put people to work, nearly bankrupting the country and replenishing his coffers by nationalizing businesses, stealing from wealthy jews and invading other countries. He demonized, exploited and stole from jews because they weren&#39;t popular at the time and robbing them provided an easy source of capital to fuel his hyper-keynesian economic policies. You can build an economy around stealing resources from rich people and giving them to poor people. But it never lasts.</p>

<p>Obama could do the same thing in America today and experience the same level of economic growth and personal popularity. Just nationalize several unpopular companies (Halliburton, Exxon, Monsanto, etc) and use the money to give people make-work jobs, fixing up roads and bridges and what not. Declare himself king so that he can re-orient that entire national budget toward productive welfare programs and then start invading smaller countries when the money finally starts to run out. It would probably work as well and be as popular here as it was in post-Weimar Germany. For a while at least. </p>

<p>The reality is that Hitler&#39;s economic and military plans were stupid and short sighted. He was popular in the same way that any idiot who stands on a corner and hands out $20 bills would be popular. His bad economic policies forced him into a situation where territorial aggression was his only hope, a plan that was never realistic in the face of the industrial might of the properly planned US economy. It seems like everything would have worked out for him if only it weren&#39;t for that pesky Eisenhower, but the whole endeavor was doomed from the start. Germany was lost from the moment Hitler adopted short sighted quick fixes as an attempt to save a national economy. It was only a matter of time. Taking short cuts is always tempting, but it&#39;s always better to do things the right way. You have to work your way out of a bad situation, you can&#39;t just steal and spend to buy friends. That story always ends badly.</p>

<p>Sic semper tyrannis.</p>

<p>tl;dr - Hitler&#39;s plan was to steal from rich people and give money to poor people, then to start stealing from other countries. Eventually the rest of the world ganged up on him and he ruined his own people. He wasn&#39;t standing up to jewish bankers, he was just trying to maintain a ponzi scheme based on old fashioned theft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not going to get into a flaming war, but &quot;The Final Solution&quot; was a western fabrication.  Hitler was not sadistic.  He didn&#39;t go out of his way to kill Jews for fun.  He viewed them as political opponents(the same way we viewed the Japanese who were American citizens  that we locked up in concentration camps).  Many countries in WW2 had concentration camps.  All of them had deaths from starvation, the elements, and disease.  Germany&#39;s couldn&#39;t save its own CIVILIANS and SOLDIERS from starvation, the elements and disease, let alone its POWs and prisoners.  As the war went on, they lost supply lines, and ran short on resources, not to mention the overcrowding.  This caused many deaths at German concentration camps(but not as much as Russian ones).  The numbers are very debatable(6 and 12 million), as well as the fact that I have never seen evidence that the Nazis killed Jews with gas(either in video, picture, audio, or writing).  Blaming the whole race of Jews was wrong, but the Idea that he wanted to kill them all is hogwash, and frankly doesn&#39;t make sense if you study Hitler(who even had a Jewish friend who he made an honorary Aryan).</p>

<p>gas room = de lousing chambers (for killing pests in your clothing) also the ones they say were used for people have no forensic evidence of ever having the suposed gas inside them, the ones that were used for delousing with the same gas are stained blue and the concrete is partially eaten by the reaction. the ones they supposed murdererd everyone in have no signs of gas at all</p>

<p>incinerators - go visit a hospital they have a bunch of them there too. theyve done the math on these as well and with the time it takes to creamate some one there simply were not enough space in those ovens to cremate any thing near the numbers they claim even if they ran 24/7 and they even use present day machines as the basis for the calculations, the actual ovens they had would have been even slower.</p>

<p>mass graves - where? i thought they cremated them all what mass graves would there of been?</p>

<p>almost all the stuff they have evidence of can be explained as a prison camp that had an out break of common illnesses</p>

<p>this is the problem a lot of the &quot;evidence&quot; that was used to create the story doesnt hold water now with the developments in forensics since then, things like zero trace of the gas ever having been used in the &quot;gas chambers&quot; or that the ovens couldn&#39;t possibly have burned the # of bodies they claimed.</p>

<p>its like thread unraveling on a tshirt, the more you tug at the loose bits the more the whole things slowly falls apart.</p>

<p>the holocaust hits us in the feels, and describes things that make you want to cringe and recoil from them but think back what evidence have you ever really been shown?</p>

<p>in the end all the concentration camps were work camps to build bombs, ammo etc.  what sense would it make to systematically murder your captive work force?</p>

<p>also some of the largest camps were bombed by the allies intentionally.
WWII was so full of bullshit and propoganda you really can&#39;t trust one side to tell the truth</p>

<p>If you want an example check out Rudolph Hoss&#39;s confession. This was considered key to proving that the Holocaust happened but it turns out that he was tortured for three days before &quot;confessing&quot;, as stated in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Legions-Death-Enslavement-Military-Classics/dp/1844150429">Rupert Butler&#39;s Legions of Death</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Gas rooms&quot; were de-lousing chambers(everybody had lice in WW2) and showering areas.  Incinerators are to burn the clothes(and sometimes bodies) of those infected with typhoid fever(the disease of war) to prevent the spread of disease.  If these camps were used to kill all of these people, you think one video, one picture or one letter would have turned up.  But nothing has yet.  Seems fishy to me.  Fishy enough to keep the jury out.  Plus there was no benefit in killing Jews.  It would have been a very costly and risky undertaking with zero benefits.</p>

<p>pictures of &quot;gas rooms&quot;, and incinerators? What the hell is that? We had an incinerator at my grade school. How do you know what you saw was a &quot;gas room&quot;, and that it was used to kill jews?</p>

<p>I have seen pictures of mass graves from many countries. Did you see anything that looked like it contained 500,000 bodies? Did you see 12 mass graves that looked like this? How did you discern that they were all jews?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a six and a half hour documentary on Adolf Hitler.  It has tons of information about what really happened and why.  It doesn&#39;t go too far into the conspiracy theory(which is kind of good, because the facts are insane enough).

<p>i can&#39;t disprove Santa exists because no one has been able to prove he ever did in the first place</p>

<p>i mean really for a group so organized they tattoo numbers on people arms you think they might have a record some where that they could slap on a table and tell you where every single person was from and where they ended up right?  </p>

<p>maybe even some documents about or even related to this supposed final solution. i mean for such a strictly organized group you think they&#39;d have a few  copies of the grand scheme or that some of the 100&#39;s of defectors(sorry make that 1,500  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">source</a> )
might have been able to confess or lead them to like a cache or something. </p>

<p>but nope those just don&#39;t exsist, instead we have testimony from the people who were there, i mean those people would never possibly consider holding a grudge, and im sure not 1 or 2 of the millions could possibly ever even consider making shit up to make sure the higher ups got what was coming to them at tribunals.</p>

<p>i mean its hilarious how quickly we dehumanize the germans, like they were all sociopaths and lusted for Jew blood. while we Canadian and Americans were doing the same shit to the japanese north americans (don&#39;t get me started on the treatment of the natives or blacks) </p>

<p>there is a lot we do not know about what happened which is why it is fucked up that even discussing it is taboo. the story we got predates 80% of the science in human history, there are actual things we can test that simply were not possible in the 1950&#39;s there was no DNA testing or ability to examine the walls of a &quot;gas chamber&quot; under an electron microscope. the story we have has a lot of holes, and its not a great sign when some one tries to fill in the bits they get shouted down by a mob as anti-Semitic, or marked with some snappy nick name like a denier. </p>

<p>I wanted you to post <em>something</em> that would back up a claim.  It&#39;s not that hard.  And you&#39;re already exaggerating...100&#39;s of articles every day?  <em>IF</em> you read articles for even eight hours a day, you&#39;d have to read almost 2.5 articles a minute to reach 200 articles in 8 hours.  Don&#39;t exaggerate, it doesn&#39;t help your poor excuses for <em>having no sources whatsoever</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and if i did post a bunch of sources that made you look like an asshole you would just &quot;humph&quot; crinkle your face, disappear and stop replying or launch in to some rant about how i must be some neo-nazi or my grandfather was a nazi guard or some other nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, more assumptions.  Typical conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>Enjoy making stuff up and calling it fact!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do.</p>

<p>But again, when someone makes a claim <em>they should be able to back it up</em>.  Why is that so hard to understand.</p>

<p>You guys are making the claims --&gt; hence, you guys should have the sources <em>already</em> from which you have taken these claims.  </p>

<p>Why would you make a claim, not provide a source, then tell everyone else to find the source <em>THAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE</em>?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s asinine and very, very typical of this sub.</p>

<p>I think it stems from the fact that you guys don&#39;t actually rely on true sources.  You just see something in a YouTube video and say &#39;well it must be true...it&#39;s on the internet&#39;.  That, or you just make up stuff and hope no one calls you on it.</p>

<p>Having said that how can you honestly say that they were no more or less targeted than other Europeans? Hitler wrote and spoke many times about his hatred of Jews. Laws were put in place that specifically forbade Jews from many professions. They were forced to register themselves and wear armbands that marked themselves as Jews. </p>

No, no Jewish cities were firebombed but I don&#39;t recall hearing of any Japanese cities where the allies rolled in, lined people up at the edge of mass graves and shot them. The skin color argument is also pretty weak because it ignores not only the differences between the European and Pacific theaters but also the fact that German cities did get firebombed (albeit not to the same extent). </p>

<p>Your overall position is also pretty immature from a more standpoint. We should ignore or refuse to acknowledge the suffering of one group because another group may have suffered worse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d venture to say, in the US if you asked people who killed more Hitler or Stalin, they&#39;d say Hitler. I&#39;m not saying Hitler was a saint, the dude was far from it. Despicable and his regime killed many. I&#39;m saying that there is a clear bias from the &quot;victors&quot;. Hitler is regarded as a monster, yet Stalin is brushed over in history class. Everyone knows of Hitler and the Jews, but what about the Slavs, the Russians, Ukrainians, hungarians, bulgarians,etc etc, and all other Eastern Europeans under Stalin? Do you hear us crying &quot;Never again&quot;, &quot;remember the 20 million&quot;, where is the Slavic version of ADL, there is none. But the Jews have one! Ask anyone who Stalin is, I bet 20% will know and that&#39;s a liberal guess. They may say he was the dictator of the Soviet Union, but probably do not know of the genocide he committed, which far out weighs Hitler&#39;s.  Especially in the younger generation. </p>

I still find it very hard to believe that your assumptions about ignorance about Stalin are correct, especially given the cold war and its impact on American education. What I do know is that both Stalin and Hitler are basically synonyms for evil where I&#39;m from (Western Europe). In high school we spent a whole semester on the USSR, covering everything from Lenin to Gorbachev, with a lot of emphasis on Stalin &#39;s reign of terror, the purges, the personality cult, the paranoia, the holodomor, gulags, Katyn and other massacres, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s quote is quoting a man of his time, who felt certain people or ideas were damning the country he loved. Hitler was idealistic and delusional at times. He killed many, but there is a  truth in what he said, which was that the west corruption of banking and debts is a hinder on Germany and the world. He did work with the Muslims, far from Aryans.  He was right, the banking cartel controlled then as they do now, don&#39;t dismiss this, just because Hitler said it. He spoke a lot of truth, was he deranged in some aspects? Yes, but there is truth in it. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t tote the line, research history and the man. You&#39;ll find he was less insane and more idealistic.</p>

<p>All the people talking about the FED and the banking cartels today? Well, he was there and spoke before them, he was a man who tried to fight back. He fought back, and was led astray because his passion led to insanity (which I think he was at the end). This is wrong and is not justifiable, but he was also betrayed by many of the people who funded him. You should research that. Who was his backroom financiers?</p>

<p>BTW, That&#39;s the point, most of us are from the US. And if you ask the US this question it will be as I said. You have a different view, being from western Europe. Good! I&#39;m so glad you know both sides. But, it&#39;s simply not taught here. I think we agree more than we disagree, a text forum isn&#39;t the best way to converse. Cheers mate!</p>

<p>edit: 2 words</p>

<p>Edit 2: To give you some contexts, I have ancestors from the era who were from Poland, they welcomed the Nazi&#39;s. They welcomed them because the Soviets literally were raping, killing, and exterminating the Poles. The soviets tried to erase Polish history, the Nazi&#39;s didn&#39;t. Did they capture Polish Jews? Yes, they did, but did they try to exterminate us ethnic Poles? No, they didn&#39;t. Ask any old-timer Pole and ask them who was worse, Nazi or Soviets, they will tell you, the Soviets. Just context. I hope you find truth, love and happiness. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are really giving Hitler way too much credit. He was an uneducated narcissist with a knack for public speaking. From his early days as a rabble rousing beer hall thug he was obsessed with ideas of purity and nationalism. The last three sentences of OP&#39;s Hitler quote demonstrate what that mindset led to: The idea that all Jews, as &#39;a rootless people&#39; were a parasitic force of corruption within the German society. It is a profoundly disturbing and dangerous philosophy that almost led to the extermination of an entire group of people, simply based on their ethnicity. No conspiracy talk of international bankers or the FED can change the fact that Hitler, from the very beginning of his political career until the inevitable violent end to his hate filled life, was nothing but a crudely effective psychopath with simplistic, dangerous ideas. He was so determined to carry out the final solution that he was willing to hurt the war effort and the German economy in order to further the murder of millions of innocent men, women and children. Outside of a very small fringe group of people led by either a severe case of second opinion bias or racist intentions, he will forever and rightfully go down in history as one of the worst leaders of human history, right alongside Stalin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His ideology, if you look into it was purging the world of debt slaves and the western monarchy of banks. You claim you are blue eyed and Germanic. Where does your history lay? Within the Germanic people, because they &quot;publicly&quot; denounce him? But inside you know the truth, it&#39;s not about him, but about his words. His ideology, what he actually said. Never would I, being a Pole side with Putin, but listen to what he says, listen to what he does. He doesn&#39;t feed his public with bullshit, he tells them the truth, as did Hitler. Putin !== Hitler, but he knows what is best for his country. This is strength. I hate the Soviets, but Putin is not one, he doesn&#39;t want to exterminate us. As Hitler did to others, you can see it in history, if you would only look. Yes, he hated &quot;certain&quot; Jews, but not all. He persecuted Sephardi not Zionist. Those in power. It&#39;s a power struggle.</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely missing the point, it&#39;s a bigger picture and I&#39;m afraid your being mislead. Idk...</p>

<p>This is bullshit (sorry, not picking on you personally).  I&#39;m tired of &quot;respecting everyone&#39;s&quot; clearly inaccurate and wrong opinion that does not coincide with facts and reality.</p>

<p>Things cease to be an opinion and become a lie when the facts fail to support it.  That goes for both the denial aspect (something bad clearly happened) and the hoax aspect (but not like we were told).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading this subreddit for the past 5 years, and just this past year, or since the end of 2012, it has been going downhill further and further - it used to be full of really interesting and insightful stuff, now it&#39;s either a bunch of retards from stormfront posting their irrelevant nonsense(guess what guys, whether hitler killed a million jews of six million jews is irrelevant, death camps are not an acceptable way to solve your problems, and there are pictures &amp; videos of their existence as well as massive amounts of eye-witness testimony from soldiers of every country that invaded Germany), or it&#39;s full of people who are <em>intentionally</em> trying to create this exact reaction from people who happen to stumble across &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; on one of the most major social forums on the internet.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s exactly what the modern counter-intelligence program would be doing with their online action projects today, making sure nothing of social import or relevance is conveyed or popularized on any major social forums while at the same time branding as or connecting any &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; with, as you put it, &#39;fucking fascist holocaust-denying neo-nazi pieces of shit&quot;. Infiltrating communities like these is nothing new for these people who are paid to maintain the established social order, though they typically don&#39;t understand what they are doing and are just normal people doing their jobs. I would guess that one goal would be to gain a position of power here, like becoming a moderator, while also using a bunch of other accounts to direct discussion in certain directions. Look over at Egypt - online communities are used by protesters / resistors to organize themselves and post inflammatory ideas, it&#39;s something they are scared of. It makes sense that they(the establishment and the agents they pay) would do what they can to dilute the discussions here and divert attention to other less meaningful things while slipping in things that repel and repulse the normal, every day people who mistakenly end up here from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>This has been happening consistently for the past year/2 years, and it was a sudden change that has been persistent for the recent history of this subreddit/forum. Personally I&#39;m inclined to think it&#39;s option B, of the two, as there can&#39;t really be <em>that</em> many people who think this shit is relevant to the world today, or who are stupid enough to think that a single racial group is in control of the whole world - but it&#39;s a great way to write off anything posted here and keep the <em>actually</em> relevant content from gaining a foothold in the online zeitgeist. Just associate it with neo-nazi retards, job well done <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods. Reddit has been picking up in popularity and something needed to be done to prevent it from starting a fire against the establishment in the minds of young people. &quot;They&quot; can&#39;t control all the content here like they can on mainstream TV and radio, so they bog it down/flood it with bullshit and neo-nazi bullshit while making it <em>just</em> tame enough to where the normal, every day &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; might get roped in and think &#39;well that&#39;s a rational idea I guess&#39;, whereas the normal every day John Doe will just dismiss it immediately out of contempt and never come here again while also having their view of the subject matter(alternative views of history/&#39;conspiracy theories&#39;/anything outside of the official social narrative) colored this way as well. There was a time in this website&#39;s history when the overwhelming majority of people posting here knew that there were outrageous lies associated with 9/11 and that it needed to be investigated further - now though, you mention 9/11, you&#39;re immediately painted as a neo-nazi conspiracy theorist lunatic. I wonder why that is? Could it have anything to do with the sustained attack on this subreddit I&#39;m talking about here?</p>

<p>I wonder who is involved and where this is coming from, because this isn&#39;t organic. There have been consistent posts about how the nazis weren&#39;t that bad and how hitler was lied about and how blah blah blah almost every time I check this subreddit over the past year, and it all started and came out of nowhere. Stuff that is totally irrelevant and unhelpful to the people of today which does absolutely nothing meaningful or productive except to act AGAINST the cause of the subreddit in general.</p>

<p>mods please take some action to stop this place from turning into a complete garbage dump, take your jobs seriously and stop pretending stuff that harms us all and is irrelevant should be covered under freedom of speech, thanks! Maybe offer a new subreddit about jews and hitler, and transfer all those posts there - you could even add a link in the sidebar, just keep it out of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because it has completely clogged up the works here for years now and there has never been a single instance of anything productive coming from it(except for the establishment, it&#39;s productive for them to have any &#39;alternative views&#39; community be branded as neo-nazi idiots).</p>

<p>Immediately after making this post, within minutes, I was contacted by a user named &quot;User_name13&quot; about not &quot;attacking this subreddit or the mods&quot; and told not to do it again, when in reality what I&#39;m posting about is <em>about</em> an attack on this subreddit which has been ongoing for the past year and turning this place into stormfront-esque hole that people will take one look at and view as totally irrelevant/full of neo-nazis. It really has become that, I haven&#39;t found a single worthwhile or interesting thing here in years because it&#39;s been so full of petty jew-bashing and Hitler posts, and documentaries, and AMAs. Stuff that has no value except to make us all look like morons and give the rest of this website reason to write off anything that comes out of this sub. Do your jobs instead of harassing users who talk about what&#39;s going on here - unless your job is to silence them and keep all of that going. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are pictures and videos of 9/11...but the story that goes along with those pictures and videos is a lie (official story). </p>

<p>The thing is they show us pictures and video all the time and tell us lies about what is actually going on in those pictures...and that kind of controlled media/ government lie BullShit story tactic started way before WWII. So how can someone prove the Holocaust pictures and videos are actually what &quot;they&quot; say it is? </p>

<p>One of the most important things people can do is research history. I&#39;m not talking about established stamp of approval history, but well researched and sources provided alternative history that proves the official story is debatable at the very least.</p>

<p>I have been here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for 7+ years. This is a very fluid sub. It changes with who the members and the mods of this community are...sometimes it&#39;s really good for a while and sometimes it isn&#39;t worth a shit for a while. </p>

<p>One thing I have learned...CONTROVERSY like this is the sign of a real and profound conspiracy. </p>

<p>Your comment shows you are still holding on to the learned guilt and shame to anyone who dares speak against the official story. It&#39;s bullshit and an affront to free speech and thought...why is questioning this particular subject so <em>wrong</em> to the point where it is illegal to debate it? What&#39;s going on when that happens?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The opposite of having this subreddit clogged with jew-bashing and nazi apologists is not &#39;the opposite effect I wish to see&#39;, it dilutes the real content here and keeps discussion away from anything that actually influences our lives while painting us all with a neo-nazi brush. It has been happening consistently and filling the front page for years now, and it is really apparent to people who have been browsing reddit since before 2012.</p>

<p>The greatest effect this subreddit is having now is discrediting anyone who goes outside the boundaries of the official social narrative in discussions on the rest of reddit, and that should really change, unless you want to keep opening <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and seeing the frontpage full of how Israeli soldiers killed some random guy or how Hitler wasn&#39;t really that bad, or how the holocaust only killed a million, not 6 million, and how we should spend our time re-evaluating the numbers of deaths in the holocaust, or how that one christian fundamentalist preacher who wears that weird hat + robe get-up thinks the jews are the devil and stealing the whole world from the gentiles for satan. Keeping it all firmly centered in irrelevant conflict and views that help no one/contribute to nothing(except discrediting us all) is the opposite of &#39;the effect I wish to see&#39;.</p>

<p>None of those are conspiracies, other than the conspiracy to discredit information/views outside the officially authorized social narrative by connecting them all to hating jews or supporting hitler, or other than the fact this subreddit is under attack and being used as a tool AGAINST it&#39;s own stated purpose. If you want to post about jewish soldiers killing a palestinian, there are other subreddits for that, it isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

Also worth mentioning is the Cambodian government in the 1960&#39;s-1980 where they killed off almost 2/3 of the entire country&#39;s population but hey, it&#39;s the Nazis that were the most evil on the 20th century...</p>

<p>You disputed a statement (using no sources) <em>then made one of your own</em>.  That&#39;s what we were asking for sources on.  And the burden of proof is not on the OP because he stated something is common knowledge, to which you are the one directly refuting it.</p>

<p>I wanted you to post <em>something</em> that would back up a claim.  It&#39;s not that hard.

I think all we can do as individuals is trust our intuition and critical thinking and try to stay open to all viewpoints.  And, above all (as you mentioned), don&#39;t ever make the mistake of thinking, &quot;This is it - I&#39;ve found the truth.  My search is over.&quot;</p>

<p>Cheers my friend.</p>

<p>1.5 million Germans died in camps controlled by the allies AFTER the war ended.</p>

<p>And then there were the millions of German civilian deaths, due to violence and starvation.</p>

<p>The Western powers dhe same in WWI, and continued after they forced them to sign the Treaty of Versailles - blockaded Germany and starved them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Kind of a way to get Jews out of the country in a &quot;civil&quot; way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Which was basically what the NSDAP policy always was, although of course by &#39;41 that changed to &quot;we&#39;ll use them for labor and then dump them in the east, and after the war, continue to exclude them so hopefully they&#39;ll all emigrate.&quot;</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, it was only really about 60,000 Jews who emigrated through that scheme between &#39;33 and &#39;39. So it didn&#39;t make the huge dent in the Jewish population that the NSDAP may have wanted. That said, without the war, presumably the NSDAP and the Zionists could&#39;ve worked together to eventually achieve their mutual goal.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in dealing with the Zionists, the NSDAP turned their back on supporters within the Jewish-German nationalist communities. In the Weimar period, these guys were like, &quot;hey, wtf, who are all these Eastern Jews flooding into Germany - they&#39;re Bolsheviks and Zionists and basically confirm all of the worst anti-semitic stereotypes!&quot; They considered themselves German nationalists first, [<em>then</em> Jews] - they spoke out against anti-German propaganda in the international press, for example.</p>

<p>Compared to today, back then the Jewish diaspora was much more divided between assimilationists and Zionists. The Jewish WWI veterans groups basically supported the NSDAP. But the NSDAP didn&#39;t want Jews to assimilate, just leave.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Haavara. I assume you&#39;ve read these first two short books?</p>

<p>Weckert&#39;s &#39;Jewish Immigration and the Third Reich&#39;:</p>

<p><a href="http://vho.org/dl/ENG/jefttr.pdf">http://vho.org/dl/ENG/jefttr.pdf</a></p>

<p>And Udo Walendy&#39;s book on &#39;The Transfer Agreement and the Boycott Fever&#39;, which I&#39;ve uploaded for you here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1418440671">http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1418440671</a></p>

<p>If you want to go deeper, to get a really good sense of where the NSDAP were at with their Jewish policy, you could read Wiebe&#39;s &#39;The Jewish Problem in Germany&#39; from 1938:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.national-socialism.com/jewish-problem-germany/">http://www.national-socialism.com/jewish-problem-germany/</a></p>

<p>Also relevant, perhaps is Eckhart&#39;s &#39;Jewish Domination of Weimar Germany&#39;:</p>

<p><a href="http://ia601807.us.archive.org/12/items/JewishDominationOfWeimarGermany1919-1932/Jewish%20Domination%20of%20Weimar%20Germany%20-%201919-1932_text.pdf">http://ia601807.us.archive.org/12/items/JewishDominationOfWeimarGermany1919-1932/Jewish%20Domination%20of%20Weimar%20Germany%20-%201919-1932_text.pdf</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to suggest or upload other books or documents if there are other sub-topics you&#39;re interested in.</p>

<p>So calling you a racist is the first line against &quot;holocaust revisionism&quot; not because your big scary Hate blogs are so hard to debunk, but because any rational, educated person knows that anyone who buys into this movement is a hateful, gullible idiot with more allegiance to the Swastika on their sleeve than the search for truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my previous post. See, I am not trying to convince you of shit. That fact that you can say something like &quot;Hitler was framed&quot; already demonstrates that you are far too ignorant of history to possibly comprehend a reality where your racist fantasies aren&#39;t true. I am calling you a racist because only someone with a clear motivation against specific races would twist their brain enough to think anything in the OP or in the links you posted has anything resembling credibility. </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t like the established history doesn&#39;t make it untrue. I could waste my time going back through all the actual historical sources I used to find the truth when I first heard of your retarded theories, then I could post them here. But that would be a waste of time, because just by your commitment to believe your Nazi crap, despite the massive tidal wave of evidence that exists to disprove it, you would find a way to discount everything as some Jewish conspiracy or some other shit.</p>

<p>You are a lost cause. Already too deep in your hate to actually have any interest in the truth. If you weren&#39;t, you would have read what actual historians had to say and we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation.</p>

<p>I said I wanted to be done this conversation, but honestly, people like you who bathe in your hate and ignorance and treat it like a virtue, make me sick. I have a compulsive need to at least leave some sort of rebuttal to your shit, just in case some poor fool stumbles upon your ramblings and mistakes it for a cohesive argument. God forbid more stumble down the horrid path you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American government rounded up and killed a bunch of Native Americans. More recently, the American government rounded up Japanese citizens and put them into camps, exactly like the Nazis did. The only reason the Japanese weren&#39;t dying off in those camps is because the American government wasn&#39;t getting its ass kicked in WW2 like the Nazi government. If the Nazi&#39;s goal was to simply kill their POW&#39;s, they wouldn&#39;t have wasted their time and resources to house, feed, and cloth them. </p>
