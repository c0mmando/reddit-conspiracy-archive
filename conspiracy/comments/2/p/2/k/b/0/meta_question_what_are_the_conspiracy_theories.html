       edit: wow, 89 comments and counting. Just want to say thanks for the response. I got the idea for this yesterday after I posted a clip by David Icke. One commentor expressed some doubts about the whole reptillian thing and that's what gave me the idea for this.

       The FBI had been following the two brothers for 5 years and knew who they were.

       I believe pyrotechnics were used (I have a photo of the bald guy who launched the first firework). I have a photo of the guy who placed the pre-blown up backpack on the scene. We see stumpy pulling on his fake leg. We see Krystara Brassard running alongside a gurney yet later we are told she almost needed her leg amputated due to injury. WTF?

       I would suggest you watch video of the "bomb" blasts and see for your own eyes if there were 200 people close enough to the pyrotechnics to get injured.

       In all, there was one injury: the bald guy who launched the pyrotechnic burned his big head.

       There were two bombs. Three people died. Dozens had amputations of varying degrees. There's no way thousands of people (spectators, emergency personnel, hospital staff, law enforcement, insurance agents) would be in on this without someone coming forward. Use common sense.

       Hello Psynnn --
      </p>
      <p>
       I would invite you to use common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Boston Marathon Bombing was really a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a farce of grotesque proportions and highly treasonous.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the amputations were fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crisis actors were used.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would not expect your typical American to be onto such corruption. Go ahead and keep trusting your leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll be fine.

       I represent only myself, but I can not believe in any theory at all. It is not about believe systems when you have a scientific approach. And theories are a scientific approach, some steps ahead of collecting scientific knowledge on a certain matter. With other words believes and knowledge do not mix together well. Believes are subjective and do not help in objective reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some theories have higher probability and you may say that those with higher probability, less contradicting evidence and the ones that have been tested after years of research are considered more useful to understand the world we are living in than others. But which ones somebody considers useful may be different from individual to individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       For sure there are some absurd theories that have no real value to be repeated and are considered to be unreliable. For instance the flat world theory and the official 9/11 conspiracy theory about Osama and his 19 hijackers.

       Erm just think about it for a second, you are in his place standing in a doorway to a classroom with a gun pointed at a bunch of children. Do they stand still while you shoot each one? No they would be scrambling around over each other, hiding etc it would be very difficult to finish them with the clinical precision that is claimed.

       you don't need clinical precision at close range with a handgun on children. it's fairly point and shoot like a camera. this isn't a long range shooting scenario where you evaluate time to target, elevation and windage. "erm" I think you have no clue about shooting.

       little children aren't NFL linebackers with 400 years of slavery breeding in them. when a little kid gets shot they don't hulk up and start fighting back. go shoot a handgun and see how easy it is. if this was a fake school and fake deaths then how can this many people be in on it? it isn't 911 and a case of government privilege.

       When I say "kill shot" I literally mean a shot that led to death.  Nothing more, nothing less.  In no other shooting I can remember was the assassin so accurate.  Try to find me another example of someone with a kill shot % that's even close to 96%.

       There can be at the very least no argument that Adam Lanza, if he was the killer, was very skilled.

       You are literally calling this a conspiracy based on the shots fired. You aren't credible. What is credible is that actual children existed and died, and now state courts are verifying such things in wrongful death suits.

       Can you point out to me where I did that?  All I'm doing here is disputing your earlier claim that "you don't need clinical precision" to do what supposedly happened at Sandy Hook because it's just false, period.  Stop putting words in my mouth.

       It's not clinical precision to hit a child above the waist and they die from the injury. if he felled the entire san diego chargers lineup with one shot each, fine.

       He apparently fired 27 bullets while achieving 26 kills.  K/W ratio of 26:1.  That's over 96% accuracy and is almost unheard of.

       Edit: Everything I'm reading says he fired 155 shots in 5 minutes.  That's a 16.77% accuracy.  Not really the crack shot you all want to make him out to be.

        CBS News correspondent John Miller, a veteran of the LAPD, NYPD and the FBI, offered an analysis of the sophisticated weaponry. "What struck me was the number of rounds fired and the number of rounds not fired," he said. "You had six magazines -- 30-round magazines -- a possibility of 180 rounds. You've got 154 shell casings recovered, indicating those got fired.

       There are literally hundreds of sources that 10 seconds of searching would have turned up.  The number of killed and wounded is publicly available information - it's pretty obvious that you know very little about Sandy Hook.

       I'm not incapable, and had you read my post you would have realized that I did google it and found different results than you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole point, which you obviously missed either out of ignorance or arrogance was that if you make a claim
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       should be the one to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And did you even read your link?  It says nothing about how many shots were fired...which is what the original claim was.  What your link does show is that while Sandy Hook was an outlier, it is still possible to kill that many and only wounding a few.  You can't dismiss an outlier
       <em>
        simply because it is an outlier

       26:1 KW ratio is almost unheard of and suggests an extremely high level of firearm skill.  That's the inescapable and important thing to realize.

       And if this were the only strange fact about SH, instead of one of hundreds of anomalies, you may have a point about this being an outlier.  We'll agree to disagree.

       I don't know what you mean by "more fakery".  How much do you know about the Process Church, for instance?  My guess is not very much at all.  You really should look into it - that book I cited is a great resource to get started.  The existence of Satanic cults is not in dispute, regardless of whether their beliefs themselves are legitimate or "real" or not.

       If people were committing murder in the name of unicorns and/or based on their belief in unicorns, then it would be important to look into this belief system, would it not?  Are you suggesting that it's better to continue pretending like Satanic cults don't exist and that, for instance, Son of Sam was a lone killer rather than part of a group of people working together (i.e. a conspiracy)?
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like the mainstream media who've done nothing but downplay and deny the existence of Satanism for the last 30 years.
       <em>
        Your personal belief
       </em>
       in Satan/God/religion is wholly irrelevant here.  I don't believe in a literal "Satan" either but that doesn't mean I deny the reality of Satanic cult activity.

       Well Son of Sam was a member of a Satanic cult so there are some murders for you to look into.

       I don't believe that there are large lizard humanoids living beneath the earth, eating our children and controlling our entire species by shape shifting into our skin and placing themselves in high government positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory I don't believe is the Hollow Earth, the theory states there is no core and there is infact an entire unexplored "world" within our earth. Where aliens and humans co-exist (also mammoths apparently). There are said to be many entrances to this inner earth, the ones I remember are located at the Poles. It is a very fascinating theory though and if you have time to kill, give it a google.

       Some people are 100% sure these things are real, I believe reptilians are covered massively by David Icke. I'm pretty new to the whole conspiracy game really. Just dropped in after 9/11, it just seemed to coincidental that the US gained the perfect excuse to invade yet enough country full of resources. Anyways, not to stray from my point. Some people feel so strongly about these theories that they have dedicated their lives to getting the word out. Yes, they are absurd. However I don't think people like David spread the word because they think that they're a neat "story to tell".

       I like the hollow earth one.  I am not big on many ideas but this one sparks my curiosity.  I like to imagine that life in the hollow world would actually show people upside down from us.  If the core itself is like a sun then the people, lakes, mountains etc are the under skin of ourselfs above.  Its an interesting idea which makes me think that gravity has some kind of line where those above and those below utilize and that gravity does not become stronger closer at the core.  Fun stuff. :)

       When I was 15, I read some books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Besides Tarzan and John Carter of Mars, he wrote about an inner Earth realm called Pellucidar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brave adventurer finds his way in by accident, meets up with primitive people and has all kinds of adventures. Classic Burroughs stuff. I'm pretty sure that his books and the theories about this are based on a book from the 1800's called The Coming Race. It predates the other stories and refers to some sort of underground/inner Earth realm.

       Same here. I find it hard to believe that 50,000 people involved from the bottom of the ladder to the very top at NASA were somehow in on the conspiracy. Clinton can't even get his dick sucked in The Oval Office without  the world finding out for god sake!

       I don't believe Sandy Hook or the Boston Bombing were faked in any way. Also, I don't think any of the buildings that collapsed on 9/11 were done through explosives.

       Personally? HAARP, contrails, parts of 9/11, vaccination hysteria, Sandy Hook, the wildly overblown child satanic Euro royalty thing, Russia, ISIS, global warming, Jewish takeover conspiracy.

       The real conspiracy is that the global movers and shakers and bankers are stealing world blind and will blow all of us up in the process. The rest of it is a sideshow.

       They were created by low information gossipers as distractions from the real shitshow, which is most of the wealth from all the planet and all of its inhabitants is held by less less than 100 people. These are the people pulling the strings, and these are the psychopaths who are leading us us into self immolation.

       I pretty much agree with this. I don't believe in an omnipotent government like most conspiracy theorists do. The conspiracy is greed and agenda setting for more gain and more greed. Not crazy false flag operations that could blow up in their faces. There are bad and incompetent people in the world as well (I mean people who DON't work for the government), simple as that. The answer the every question is not: "That's what they want you to believe."

       UFOS, anything to do with extraterrestrials at Area 51, I think those "conspiracy theories" are planted by disinfo agents to make us, conspiracy theorists (though I'm not a big fan of that phrase) look bad.

       There are certain topics about which I feel strongly (9/11, Boston Bombing, Osama Bin Laden, Federal Reserve, CIA Drug Dealing). There are certain topics about which I am on the fence, or have serious questions (crisis actors, Sandy Hook, vaccines, chemtrails, Moon Landing), and others which I find patently silly (Reptilians, 9/11 laser beams, holocaust didn't happen). And on that note, fuck all the, "Hitler wasn't such a bad guy, I'd let him babysit my kids," bullshit on this sub lately.

       Sandy Hook, Boston Bombings, Aurora, chemtrails, 9/11 (MIHOP), moon landing hoax, the Reptilian shapeshifting elite, Illuminati related conspiracy theories including the NWO, the conspiracy that the Rothschild banking dynasty own every central bank in the world, short of North Korea and Iran.
