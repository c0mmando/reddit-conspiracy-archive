    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s standard operating procedure for police to infiltrate and escalate. </p>

<p>The last time I marched, me and my friends beat the shit out of some &quot;black bloc&quot; posers (obvious provocateurs). Hours later a couple of us were arrested, picked out of a crowd,  for assault and battery on an LEO. Funny thing was I wore sap gloves and really fucked one of the guys up...at the very least I fractured his jaw..maybe broke his arm... When I was arrested, never charged, I had the biggest grin on my face. I got to beat the shit out of a cop...with no recourse. I don&#39;t protest anymore...<em>not until heavily armed peaceful protest become a thing</em>...until then, I&#39;m retired.</p>

<p>Great post, btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Familiar with Kent State?</p>

<p>&#39;The other major piece of Kent State evidence identified in Allen’s analysis was the “sound of sniper fire” recorded on the tape. These sounds point to Terry Norman, FBI informant and provocateur, who was believed to have fired his low-caliber pistol four times, just seventy seconds before the command-to-fire.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the history is useful. One great advantage it has is that the facts are no longer controversial.</p>

<p>If people learned, for example, that 20% of KKK members were FBI in the 60s, they might be less shocked at what goes on today.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly, I feel like facts like these have mostly been lost in the common person&#39;s (specifically young peoples&#39;) understanding these days - and very much by design.</p>
