       I know that's a
       <em>
        super
       </em>
       vague as all hell title, and I'm sorry, but I just wanted to put this up and show this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to what this man
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FbOiIdgbl0#t=154m58s">
        <strong>
         says right here
        </strong>
       </a>
       .  He
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed correct.  What he's saying
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed true and valid.  If you impersonate an officer of the military, you are committing a serious, prosecutable crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, listen to what he says
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvRVkwtSW0Q#t=30m30s">
        <strong>
         <em>
          here
         </em>
        </strong>
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This man talks about doing and being involved in some shit that is
       <em>
        soooo
       </em>
       deep down the rabbit hole that it means he is either certifiably crazy, or he in fact knows quite a lot of shit that you and I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, before anyone writes
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of this information off, they should give a critically-minded listen to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4LJLrRaGCE">
        this right here
       </a>
       as well.  It's a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       long lecture, so I would recommend that one listen to it in parts, but it corroborates a lot of what is said in the above links.

       What do you mean exactly?  Like what?  To my knowledge, the "Mars Defense Force" (or whatever it's called) has been the main force he says he's been involved with from the beginning, and I haven't heard him diverge from that too much if at all.

       I was reading that he had been abducted by aliens, worked with mind control programs, been to several different planets serving as a Marine special forces on those planets, time travel or anti-aging.

       Really?  That he was
       <em>
        abducted by aliens?
       </em>
       Could you point me specifically to where you read that?  I've listened to three of his talks and counting (7+ hours of lectures so far beginning from just a day or two ago) and haven't heard once about him mentioning anything about being "abducted by aliens".  Would be very interested to see what you read.

      <blockquote>

       Didn't really hear him talk much about that either.  Another reference it'd be great if you point me toward if you could.

      <blockquote>

       That I heard.  Didn't hear so much about "several different planets", however, as much as about Mars only.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        time travel

      <p>
       Didn't hear him talk directly about this either.  I heard that he reference Andrew Basiago, and Basiago definitely talks about it, but I don't recall Cramer making great mention of it himself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Yeah.  You have Randy Cramer, Andrew Basiago, Bret Stillings, and Bernard Mendez all corroborating and supporting one anothers' stories.  Very interesting, to say that least.

       Who is this that's being interviewed?  You're saying it's Randy Cramer?  Where exactly are you getting that information that it's Randy Cramer that's being interviewed?  Where does it say that in the interview?

       Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the 2006 interview you spoke about above actually
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       with Randy Cramer then.  He came out and started speaking actually in 2013/2014.  It
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       happened.  Not in 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding his abductions, they were actually MILABS.  They were all military abductions done on him by members of THIS planet.  In other words, they weren't extraterrestrial abductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I didn't read any mention of his visiting any other planets aside from Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, very interesting stuff.  Thanks for linking it.

       Do you know any physicians personally? Ask them how likely this is or how or why all the medical research that goes into developing these capabilities has been hushed up. Bear in mind that if you happen to know a surgeon who specializes in re-attacing or re-vascularizing limbs or digits after an accident, they very likely know every single luminary in their profession from the conferences that they attend. If they have never heard of such a capability it's bullshit.

       In other words, he's dealing with things that you simply can't wrap your mind around.  Makes sense.  It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed pretty "out there" stuff compared to what the average shmuck like you or me have been indoctrinated to think is possible.  However, there are other people with impressive credentials that not only independently corroborate his story, but make mention of even more technology that is just as "out there".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is basically "This shit is too crazy and out there, so it

       to be bullshit."

       Not at all. My argument is that the people who advance the research in these fields comprise a very small group. They all know each other, publish in a small handful of professional journals, and even know the people who control the grants to do research in these fields. If they say they have never heard of this, then its unlikely that its been done and that the technology and the people developing it remain a complete secret.

       This would be a bigger breakthrough than penecillin. It would mean a guaranteed Nobel Prize, and an array of cushy lucrative sinecures on the boards of directors of all the major medical device and pharmaceutical companies. Who would prefer to toil in complete anonymity when he could be THE luminary in the entire medical profession by publicizing his achievements.

       Who would prefer it?  Try the individuals who would get killed before being able to divulge any of that information to the public by those secretive forces working behind the scenes - forces that are
       <em>
        significantly

       more powerful than any scientific or medical board we "lowly citizens" know anything about.  When there are covert powers on this planet powerful enough to make mince meat out of any individual attempting to divulge to the public the practically magical capabilities of some of these technologies, people who know about them tend to stfu and not say a thing quick, fast, and in a hurry.

       My logic is that the guy gives absolutely no evidence, nothing that he's said even sounds plausible (the closest you could get is time dilation, except you need to be near light speed to do this), and frankly, until I actually see evidence, I'm going to stick with my original assumption that it is utter bullshit.

       Of course people are sometimes willing to ignore the consequences.  However, one has to realistically assess just how likely an explanation that actually is when the person in question themselves has said that they have absolutely no desire to go to jail, and, on top of all of that, there are actually various other individuals with credentials greater than you or I that corroborate the story itself.

       I really hope you never try to become a scientist, or you'll be in for a rude awakening. Fact is, to make a claim, you need evidence. Your claim does not actually have evidence. Until there is evidence, good luck actually getting people to believe you. Hell, I could claim that the earth is flat, and make up some random claim. Would that then mean that I would have to be telling the truth?

       There is no opinion here. It's a yes or no question "is there actually evidence for these extremely outrageous claims?". If the answer is no, then your argument never had any basis to begin with, and was just you being duped by a guy who claims to be a space soldier.

       Absolutely I did.  I even linked it.  But you know what?  You don't know anything about it.  And you know why?  Because you showed yourself over and over again to be too ignorant to actually understand that there is quite a bit of valid information in the videos I linked.

       It's really wearisome having to correct the constant fallacious thinking in almost every single sentence you make.  I will probably stop responding soon, as it's more than abundantly clear that you're not really making any really strong arguments, and you just simply want to continue believing that this "can't possibly be true!".  Look, if that's how you think and that's what you want to believe, then okay.  Go right ahead.  However, you're not really convincing anyone but yourself that you have any argument whatsoever in saying this.  I think you're trying to look like you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have an argument to others possibly reading this...
      </p>
      <p>
       But you don't.  And it's taking longer than I have patience for to continue battling with you back and forth when you want to continue believing in whatever it is you want to believe.  It's okay if you do.  Meh.
      </p>
      <p>
       This being said, I'll make a few final attempts to continue as long as I can before just saying "fuck it" lol.

       You say he "hardly proves he's telling the truth", yet the fact of the matter is that he gives very strong indication on various fronts that he indeed is.  That you simply refuse to understand the validity of what's presented is just plainly on you.  Somebody can say "nuh uh!" all they want.  It doesn't make something the case any less than it is.

       You're free to do whatever the heel you want, but that doesn't make your argument any less idiotic. I'll say the same thing I've said before, your entire argument hinges on one guy who claims he was in the space military, and another guy with equally useless credentials. It's very clearly bullshit, no matter how many mental gymnastics you go through to legitimize it. It's not a question of "thinking critically", it's an issue of not being duped by clearly retarded theories like this one.

       So, the 2006 interview you spoke about above actually
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       with Randy Cramer then.  He came out and started speaking actually in 2013/2014.  It
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       happened.  Not in 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding his abductions, they were actually MILABS.  They were all military abductions done on him by members of THIS planet.  In other words, they weren't extraterrestrial abductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I didn't read any mention of his visiting any other planets aside from Mars.
