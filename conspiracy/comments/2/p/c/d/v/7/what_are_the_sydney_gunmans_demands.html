<p>He[the gunman] has in the past hour and a half listed three demands. The police has only allowed media to carry two of those demands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit 2: It was to give a message to his brothers asking them not to detonate bombs that apparently exist elsewhere in the city. <a href="http://siliconangle.com/files/2014/12/sydney-hostage.jpg">http://siliconangle.com/files/2014/12/sydney-hostage.jpg</a> I guess the police wanted to avoid a panic but fingers crossed they got the instructions anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is looking for a platform to spread his message. He chose to take hostages in a café close to a news channel studio so guarantees he gets media coverage before the cops can set up a cordone. There would even be a great chance that some of the hostages would be staff from the news room and thus give the organisation an incentive to help him out despite the authorities wanting to push the &quot;do not negotiate with terrorists&quot; line. He&#39;s even using his hostages&#39; social media accounts to send out going messages to help reduce how much the cops can block him from contacting the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A terrorist who was possibly attempting to access the American consulate or the channel 7 news room which are both around the corner from the cafe. Earlier reports suggested he hastily moved onto the cafe after he was spotted by someone. Even if the cafe was the target it&#39;s still a pretty good option as it&#39;s in the heart of Sydney and is usually packed by wealthy office workers stopping for a bite.</p>

<p>It is up to the person making the claim to provide the evidence. Along with that there is no reason why the government would need to launch a false flag. I see posts on here saying it&#39;s because of the budget announcement which is so ridiculous it&#39;s unbelievable. </p>

<p>Every news channel I can find has also reported on the budget while keeping up to date with the hostage citation. If the governments plan was to get everyone watching the news while they report in the budget in between updates of the crisis then they did a DANM fine job.</p>

<p>More people know about the budget now then they ever would have if this hadn&#39;t occurred. </p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy, think rationally it helps.</p>
