        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am sure this has been said before, but has anyone else noticed the very obvious shift in &quot;morality&quot; especially on our &#39;favourite&#39; TV shows imported from the US? </p>

<p>More and more shows like the NCIS franchise, 24, The Mentalist, Hawaii 5O, CSI etc run episodes where the &quot;good guys&quot; (US authorities in some form CIA, DEA, FBI etc) bend or break &quot;the rules&quot; (by torturing, using excessive force etc) in order to capture or kill their &quot;suspect&quot; or to get that vital bit of info needed to solve/win the case. And the storytelling is so weighted towards the audience reacting positively towards the &quot;rogue agent&quot; and accepting their transgressions (almost no matter how extreme), because &quot;they were just doing what needed to be done to save the day&quot;.</p>

<p>Seems to me to be a not so subtle shift by Hollywood and the TV media towards softening up the sheeple so that we become more accepting of these practices by our govt officials. Have you ever caught yourself thinking &quot;that Jack Bauer is sure one bad ass. But you know Jack wouldn&#39;t have beaten/tortured/shot etc the &quot;bad guy&quot; unless he REALLY had to because we know deep down despite his flaws that Jack is a good guy who loves his President and America too and only ever did any of that black budget stuff because he had to damnit to save the world.&quot;</p>

<p>An obvious attempt at mass manipulation thru the media of TV...Or maybe I have just been up too long without sleep...</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had TV service or a hooked up TV for like 8 years now. Every once in a while I catch some TV at a friend&#39;s house, it&#39;s so fucking bizarre. All the commercials, the weird situations in TV shows where the script is almost saying to you, &quot;Yeah, you know what we mean, how things are always this way or that way.&quot; The local news too, now that&#39;s a fucking trip. Almost everything on TV makes my stomach turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t had cable/satellite since 2005. But I do torrent a lot of shows and read a lot of books. I don&#39;t like ads, and most of the shows I watch are like Game of Thrones and the like.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve seen one episode of 24. I remember when Revolution came out, thinking &quot;This is all pro-US, libertarian, pro-gun bullshit!&quot; Seriously, why would anyone want to restore America after such a collapse? Why not...make something better. The entire series reeked of nationalism. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t seem to find it now, but Gore Vidal had a quote about the very close relation between Hollywood and the US Government. Examples of this include shitty movies like <em>Olympus has Fallen</em></p>

<p>Fuck yes it&#39;s too late.  That&#39;s the Golden Horde you&#39;re talking about.  100+ years of energy and resource abundance purposefully designed to create the perfect consumer.  You don&#39;t save them.  You don&#39;t speak to them.  You don&#39;t allow them within a kilometer of the wall.  You don&#39;t let them walk on your roads or sleep in your fields.  Keep them away from your water.  Keep them away from your animals and machines.  And if you allow one to see you and they come back with friends, you&#39;ll answer to me.</p>

<p>JK!  Of course we can save them!! With peace and Love and Understanding!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always tell people this. The first step to curtailing the police state is to stop watching shows like Law &amp; Order, 24 and NCIS. We have to lower the prestige of the police state in America. </p>

<p>Literally the biggest hit comedy film this past summer was 22 Jump Street. That&#39;s not some mistake. Its not an accident that &#39;cop shows&#39; are a genre in and of themselves in American television and film. We are programmed to always give the police the benefit of the doubt in any situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about that new movie coming out where Seth Rogan is going to North Korea and they want him to off KJI? That is the most obvious propaganda film I&#39;ve heard of in a while. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not endorsing NK or anything, but it&#39;s disturbing how many people will never recognize it for what it is - blatant propaganda wrapped in a joke. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll go and watch the movie, they&#39;ll laugh and giggle at all the silly happenings that you get when Jews write a script about a fuck-up goober of an American visiting NK, and their brains will be skewed that much more against that zany part of the world where they do everything backwards and might as well be a separate species of animal than Americans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hollywood Zionists are alive and well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in this article, written by a self-admitted Zionist, she quotes Seth Rogen&#39;s twitter, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people are using their disdain for Israel&#39;s army&#39;s tactics as an excuse to get some truly remarkable anti-Semitism off their chests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next thing you know, people will be claiming that Spielberg is a zionist propagandist... oh... wait.</p>

<p>And by the way, this article was written by the same girl who was &quot;friends&quot; with the &quot;journalist&quot; Stephen Sotloff and played a part in that blatant and awful beheading hoax.</p>

<p>This is exactly the mind-fuck that is part of being a critical thinker. The Powers That Be have sculpted society into pushing that idea onto people who don&#39;t think like the masses. They want us to doubt ourselves. They want us to think &quot;or maybe I am crazy&quot; when we use our brains to come to conclusions based on the evidence we refuse to ignore like everyone else.</p>

Now just a couple more changes....&quot;</p>

<p>Its not like somebody dropping that kind of money is going to be ignored. Especially when the changes seem so subtle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now look at the recent news: <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/12/15/about-half-see-cia-interrogation-methods-as-justified/">http://www.people-press.org/2014/12/15/about-half-see-cia-interrogation-methods-as-justified/</a></p>

<p>The manipulation already works like a charm. Most people don&#39;t care about CIA interrogation methods anymore (well, since most of them won&#39;t happen to US civilians). I think everyone who voted with the 51% of people saying &quot;yes&quot; should be treated with the same methods he has voted for if needed.
It would be the same system like in the Soviet Union. Claim someone of doing something illegal and immortal (&quot;he has raped and killed children!!&quot;), torture as long as needed to get a confession, then execute. Torture will never get the truth. People will do all to stop the torture. They will lie about it. But if terrorists are going to kill themselves, why would they not resist torture? It makes no sense.</p>

<p>Oh, and look at the US TV. You see crime all day, cruelty all day, danger all day. And now think about why the people are carrying guns. Is it because they are endangered? Or is most of this danger just fictive and always a good reason to bring up some new totally blown up law to legalize what NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA and even many police authorities do all day? Does a policeman carrying an assault rifle in a shopping mall make the civilians safer?</p>

<p>We are not allowed to carry a gun where I live (except for a few reasons and with strict limitations). If a policeman here shoots, he has to return his gun to the police station and do a few hours of paperwork. Every time. We had less than 10 people getting shot by the police in 2013 and less than 50 shots in total. My country is much smaller than the US, but even than - (there&#39;s no official statistic I&#39;ve found, so I have to go with around 450 people shot by policemen and more than 10.000 murders) numbers are much too high. I think that bringing weapons into a country won&#39;t make the people safer.</p>

<p>So why do I even care if I&#39;m not living in the US? Well, my country is stepping towards the US weapon laws and US police system more and more. There&#39;s a law pending saying that policemen should be allowed to carry their gun in hand - not in holster - on a police operation of any kind (even if it&#39;s just light violence or an accusation). So this law would definitely raise the number of civilians shot per year. This is definitely not what makes a healthy society.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since I don&#39;t live in the US, the last paragraph is only about what I believe, not what I can&#39;t prove. I know that a correlation of deathly weapon usage and weapon owners in the US hasn&#39;t been proved yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is data to suggest that areas with the highest per capita gun ownership have the lowest crime in the country.</p>

<p>Conversely, areas like Chicago, IL have some of the strictest gun laws in the country, very much like your home country, and it has the highest murder and crime rates. I mean, just look at Jew York, those poor folks are fucked from every angle - the criminals can freely take your shit and kill you, the cops can freely take your shit and kill you, and if you ever decide to defend yourself without first making every effort to get away from the threat (putting your life in serious danger in the process), the criminal&#39;s family with the help of the courts will take your shit in a civil suit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that this would apply to my country too.. There are statistics for both sides of the discussion - I did some research. :)</p>

<p>Besides that don&#39;t forget that the rate of criminals carrying guns is higher in the US than in more restricted countries. But it&#39;s not a big deal to buy a gun in a state where guns are literally not restricted, then drive just a few hundred miles and do a crime where civilians can&#39;t fight back. But it would be much different in a country where guns are restricted.</p>

<p>But the real question we should ask is what causes that much crime in the US. There&#39;s much more crime than in any country I&#39;ve been until now (and I travelled around half of the world, but wasn&#39;t in the US). I seriously have to do some research on that because I honestly don&#39;t know. I assume that the media and the manipulation has to do something with that, because every time I watch US tv online, I see crime, hate, cruelty. All the time. If I now imagine what would happen if I had watched that my whole life - but I think that it&#39;s only one factor.
Since I guess that you are from the US, maybe you can help me with that question. ;)</p>

<p>In many cases certain entertainment is geared towards specific groups of people, and I do think that has a significant influence on those groups&#39; cultures. Poor and middle class folks mostly, often targeted based on race, region, etc.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t considered that poison TV could account for the crime rate differences between different countries, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting at. Do you think that the differences have more to do with genetics or culture? It&#39;s probably a mix of both, but sometimes genetics is not weighed as heavily or acknowledged as often as it should be.</p>

<p>America has quite a bit of diversity in this regard, so please consider the crime rates of countries in Africa, Europe, and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>We have many people from different ethnics here, and the crime rates are mostly the same. I think it&#39;s much about the culture and the media. Comparing the US and Canada it looks pretty much like that. I have friends living in Canada so I get to watch Canadian TV sometimes. The difference between Canadian TV and US TV is huge.</p>

<p>Comparison here: <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Canada/United-States/Crime">http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Canada/United-States/Crime</a></p>

<p>The Canadian people are allowed to carry guns and it&#39;s just as easy as getting a gun in the US, but the crime rate (Violent Crime, Gun Crime) is much lower.</p>

<p>My biggest fear in that regard is police will cross the line with the citizenry so many times (and of course not be held accountable), that conditions deteriorate to the point where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_rKA6ROAVk">training police receive</a>, which is to say, seeing citizens as enemy combatants, becomes valid.

    <div class="md"><p>Go back further; there was a translation of American morality to &quot;New York&quot; morality.</p>

<p>Specifically, people used to be proud of their contribution to society. For example when my father served on the coast guard, he said &quot;that&#39;s just what you did, everyone served&quot;. People were proud, not of how much they got, but what they gave.</p>

<p>Around the time of the 1990s there started a marked change, with the glorification of John Gotti Jr. on documentaries. &quot;the Dapper Don&quot; was given celebrity status for &quot;what he got away with&quot; or almost got away with.  So insead of being despised for his failing morality, he was rewarded for a lack of morality. The Sopranos were given respect.</p>

<p>New York morality is a spirit and admiration of corruption. It is low mentality, &quot;more is better&quot; thinking. It was forced on our society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to play devils advocate I think a lot of it is just lazy corporate behaviour. The &quot;renegade cop&quot; who fights both criminals and the system is a very old cliche in fiction. In most cases it&#39;s probably just tv executives looking at NCIS saying &quot;we want to do that&quot;. They&#39;re easy to write, relatively cheap to produce, have a big audience, and go on for 30 seasons. Why take a risk doing something new when you can repackage the same old shit that works.</p>

<p>On another note, I think you missed the most blatant example which is the search warrant. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a single cop show where the warrant was viewed as anything else than a bureaucratic hurdle. Every main protagonist is either a lock picker or a door breaker. The legal process of applying for a warrant is always shown as something that only makes the work of the good guys difficult, an obstacle that only protects the criminals.    </p>

<p>Writers submit the script.

I think this is 100% intentional propaganda. Also common in these shows is to use of contractors for dirty work, thus not making the good guys culpable for torture and killing. All these new shows trying to paint the CIA, the state and the Intel community in a positive light is pure propaganda that is now legal in the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great subject, I was thinking about writing a post like this about the TV Show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3489236/">State of Affairs</a> coming off as somewhat of a PSYOP meant to justify and normalize torture and to portray the CIA as just a group of patriotic good guys who are all about protecting us from terrorists and keeping us safe.</p>

<p>It also feels like some of the older TV shows and movies that used to be on that stereotypically portrayed Native Americans (i.e. &quot;Indians&quot;)  as warpaint donning, feather wearing, limited savages who scalped the good guys and innocent settlers. They were warlike savages who fought against our altruistic, honorable American Cowboys who were, of course, always the &quot;Good Guys&quot;. </p>

<p>The whole narrative seems now to be shifted towards the <em>new</em> Indians, the &quot;<em>Middle East Arab Jihadists</em>&quot;. Except they seem to all wear turbans with scarves hiding their faces instead of feathers and warpaint now. These &quot;jihadists&quot; typically make videos killing Americans while carrying machine guns and are constantly plotting attacks on American Soil. But of course all our electronic surveillance in communication monitoring works to reveal their plans so our heroic CIA, NSA, FBI and DHS patriots can work together to foil their nefarious plots (although sometimes there is a little frictional turf-war fighting between our patriotic agencies, but they are all uber-patriots who are just trying to keep us safe and get a little over zealous sometimes...but that&#39;s ok, it&#39;s to be expected you know..patriots are all about keeping the people safe from terrorists.)</p>

<p>There is a lot of this propaganda &quot;programming&quot; on TV now. Especially seems to be a lot of torture acceptance and normalization in these kinds of shows. </p>

<p>I most definitely noticed this when I was watching the Batman movies.  The entire subtext of the second Batman movie was that you can&#39;t just use normal methods to battle the bad guys.  There was even something in there about why you have to spy on <em>everyone</em> via their phones.</p>

<p>In my opinion the director, Chris Nolan, has got to be some kind of paid propagandist.  The latest movie Interstellar to me seemed like nothing more than a two hour advertisement on the need for GMOs and increasing NASAs budget - those were the two main subtexts of that movie.  Two weeks later what do you know?  NASA is launching Orion in another round of space travel - I know, just a coincidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was when all those Hollywood action stars did an assault weapons ban commercial right after Sandy Hook.  They didn&#39;t do that for free lol or because they had a choice.  Hollywood is the largest crock of government sponsored bullshit.  Another favorite of mine and maybe a better example was the show 24 during the invasion of Iraq.  I remember listening to ESPN radio and they were talking about how the last episode was some of the best film making ever...it didn&#39;t cross my mind back then but now...holy fuck it&#39;s obvious what they were doing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tell people all the time to stop watching TV and after a month or so turn the god forsaken thing on and watch it for an evening. Now that they have a fresh perspective, they will see a grotesque mirror image of current events translated in a way that sugar coats corporate and government evil doings. As OP said, the programming now has the &quot;good guys&quot; doing the torturing and portrays anti-war and anti-torture people as weak and pathetic.</p>

<p>One of the most bizarre is the ABC network world news...they  behave as if they are acting. Their concerns, fears come across as if they are on the verge of panic. It is so obvious they are trying to instill fear into the viewing public. It is difficult to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed exactly the same thing.  It&#39;s almost as if the show writers had been directed to create scenarios to justify torture.  I&#39;ve noticed it in Law &amp; Order, Blue Bloods and NCIS.  </p>

<p>It really screams that our entertainment is a tool to manipulate us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good call. You have seen thru the large-scale long-term subtle shift in the propaganda. They are trying to create a new &quot;culture&quot; for the country, so that it can more effectively act as the military arm for those countries that do not want to have their name sullied by the actions that they want carried out. I refer to the UK, EU, and Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well TV IS used as a cultural medium to express the morality of those in positions of power. We absorb it and then shape our identities and behavior around media content to conform to a wider society. This also applies to; radio, social media, movies, interactions we have with people. music and so forth. I don&#39;t remember the exact terms but I learnt in Cultural Studies the difference between what we learn and develop from people and media.</p>

<p>So of course higher powers will influence the masses to accept torture and the like on the lesser of two evils principle. Everything is fine because its for _______ is current mantra.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy enough to see the parallels here even in &quot;news&quot;. The station I work at has an undeniable tendency to plump up shows near the end with &quot;feel good&quot; cop stories if there&#39;s even one mention of aggressive policing or any coverage of the Garner/Brown incidents. It&#39;s sickening how far back local news will bend to keep police out of bad light.  </p>
