<p>Today is the second night in a row that I wake up and hear a high-pitched sound coming from outside. I don&#39;t have tinnitus, and I live in Los Angeles. I&#39;m used to city sounds, but the sound that&#39;s waking me up is like that high-frequency mosquito noise. I practice meditation, so I&#39;m familiar with noises coming from within (my own ears); this sound is from outside and seems to be coming from a high structure that moves focus.</p>

<p>It lasts about 15-20 minutes (I can hear it moving from south to north in intervals during that span), and it happens between 3am-4am. I&#39;m looking for serious responses. I&#39;m surprised people can sleep through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been lurking this sub forever waiting for this to come up.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, for the past two nights (counting this morning) I have woken up at 3-4am, and for the life of me couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  It felt like something was lightly rattling my skull and teeth, this morning it seemed to flare up a toothache, and I could hear a sort of humming sound I don&#39;t really know how to describe.  I suppose a low-pitched noise you&#39;d expect to hear from a big rig idling, and some nights the same style of hum but incredibly high pitched.  It pierces through most of what I have tried to cover it up with; music with headphones, turning on the hypno box, even going on a night cruise with the windows up and music playing it feels like my ears are being bothered even if I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s bothering them.</p>

<p>My wife and kids seem to not notice or wake up, I have asked her and she definitely notices it bothers me and makes me very irritable, but says that maybe it is insomnia.  I can guarantee it isn&#39;t as normally I sleep like a rock, until this damn noise comes along.</p>

<p>It is one of the most bothersome things I have had to deal with in life, it is impossible for me to go back to bed, I&#39;ve tried chugging a pint of whiskey, smoking weed (which seems to make it more noticable), earplugs, but nothing seems to get rid of it until it subtly fades away, usually around 4am.</p>

<p>This has happened multiple times in the past two years, I&#39;d say on average 5 days a month, and usually close together.  I&#39;ve wanted to ask my neighbors about it but they aren&#39;t on the same page or even reading the same book as me.  I feel like I would just reinforce their thoughts of me being a tinfoiler.</p>

<p>By the way, I live in southeastern Nebraska.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard about something like this before. Apparently only certain people can here it, but most can&#39;t. You should google some keywords, particularly relating to the area of LA that you are in. If it is happening, someone else out there has also asked about it.</p>

<p>I wish I could provide you with links to where I heard about this phenomenon, but I don&#39;t even know where to start. I think I heard about it on this sub actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the sound is audible to a human ear then almost any microphone can pick it up. I don&#39;t want to sound presumptuous but I assume you own or have access to a smart phone or a tablet. I&#39;m actually one of the few people who does not, so I do understand if you are the same. But if you do, then it should to the job.</p>

<p>An iPhone 4 for example can easily handle 20kHz, so I can confidently say that it exceeds your own ear&#39;s ability in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Spirits-And-What-They/dp/086315462X">http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Spirits-And-What-They/dp/086315462X</a>) or possibly in one of the other two books by the same authors the &quot;nature&quot; spirits claim that they are making this noise as a means of reaching out to humanity. We human beings, with our thinky thinking thinkiness, have broken the bridge to the spiritual world and this causes great sadness and pain in the spirit world, which include the world of the elementals. The elementals do not want it to be this way but everyone thinks too materialistically or way to ungrounded (new age movement) to actually be able to connect or contact with the beings of other worlds...in this case the world of the elementals. Only certain people can hear it and that is because those are the people who are having enough spiritual thoughts to be able to &quot;go beyond&quot; for lack of a better term...this is not anti-science this is science with value added...with the consideration that this is not the only dimension that has sentient beings in it. I wouldn&#39;t comment on this (especially on reddit!) if I didn&#39;s stand firmly behind this way of thinking...if you have the means I highly recommend one or all of those books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t but I am aware of them. Although I encourage reading anything that is not saturated with the &quot;materialistic deception&quot;, investigating the world of the spirit is always wrought with confusion...the chance for error and the chance to be led by a malevolent force is great. One needs to prepare oneself to be able to see the truth, especially if that truth is found on a spiritual plane. Books like the Celestine Prophecies are at least pointing to the answer to the big questions being found in the spiritual world but one must then ask a rather essential question...&quot;just because I am being contacted by a being from the other side does that mean what that being is saying is true?&quot; I believe that Verena Holstein is telling the truth and that these are genuine recollections of communication with the world of the elementals but I also know that there are a lot of mischievous spirits that are leading mankind down the wrong path...it is very tricky!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this is related since I do not hear a high pitched sound (except in my inner ear from time to time) but I frequent  a site Tom Kenyon he does sound mediations based on contacts from ET&#39;s called the Hathor&#39;s. The Hathor archives goes into a lot of detail on what they think is happening to humans and the planet as we the eath and humans are entering a higher vibratory level, extreme changes are happening on the planet and sound/visual meditation is supposed to help us make the transition. There might be some related information from the Hathor&#39;s about auditory changes people might be going through Hope it helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was surprised as well when I read this &quot;answer&quot; provided by one of the elementals. But it makes sense...not everyone can hear it, no one seems to be able to find the origin of the sound, it is happening all around the world, and usually (not always) it comes from a remote area. I wish I had a PDF link to those books for you to read.. I have found them fascinating and apparently they (the author and the clairvoyant) are working on more. And I think a lot of stuff here at r/conspiracy could benefit from taking a spiritual perspective on things so I always bring the more challenging answers when required. </p>

<p>Stoney Point is the site of a Tongva Indian rancheria until the 1790s, with Spanish invasion. It is believed that the Village of Momonga was located at Stoney Point. It is culturally significant because Momonga was multilingual and multiracial, allowing intermarriage of Chumash, Fernandeno and Gabrieleno peoples. A sulphur spring, believed to possess spiritual properties runs adjacent to Stoney Point Park on the Eastern side. It is said that shamans would visit Stoney Point in preparation for the Winter Solstice celebration that drew native people from as far away as Temecula.</p>

<p>This park is located north of me, and that&#39;s why that answer surprised me. I just didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving so many details of where I live before. Lol </p>

<p>Whoa. Thats a great thought. I mean, of course we are just running with our imaginations here, but what do we know about what is possible.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. From a completely logical standpoint. If the people who were literally running the world found solid proof of any number of things, then it would be imperative to keep that information from coming out. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>any kind of afterlife</p></li>
<li><p>aliens</p></li>
<li><p>time travel</p></li>
<li><p>other dimensions</p></li>
<li><p>unlimited energy systems</p></li>
<li><p>etc...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping that information private and concealed would be goal #1, and far as anyone is concerned, any amount of funding would be worth concealing it.</p>

<p>I have often thought, just for fun, what if NASA was an elaborate ruse. What if the billions of dollars going there are actually going to something else entirely. What if the entire concept of what we call space is just like a Hollywood production and all of those genius at NASA are either, in on it, or the program has been designed and compartmentalized so well that even they don&#39;t really know what they are working on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is a regular occurrence, get a frequency detector app for your phone and see if what you are hearing falls within it&#39;s capable analytic/detection ranges. Modern day smart phones are more than capable of detecting any sonic frequency ranges that can be perceived with the human ear.</p>

<p>This will at least give you a means to verify and hopefully record a sample of what you are hearing so it can be analysed in greater detail.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one app I found just doing a couple quick searches. They also have ones for detecting bat and whale sonic communication.

    <div class="md"><p>Odds are, if you can hear it, your mic can pick it up.  Check the manufacturer specs.</p>
