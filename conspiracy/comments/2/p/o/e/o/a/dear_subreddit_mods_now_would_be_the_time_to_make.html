    <div class="md"><p>We have an AMA tonight which will probably be the sticky priority.  I also don&#39;t think the NK thing is really a big deal at all personally, it&#39;s only a big deal because the MSM is making it one which should tell us something about the validity to the story.</p>

<p>I highly doubt NK is involved in any way, the only question I have is what&#39;s the purpose of the entire thing.  Is it a pretext for invasion?  Planting seeds in our mind for a larger scale terrorist or cyber attack?  Or just a bullshit distraction to keep people from reading about the new Intelligence Act that was just signed into law and the details of the torture reports?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone needs to find out if Sony has insurance on these kinds of leaks. This could be a huge insurance fraud scam in the making. What if some legal/business/financial group within Sony turned over on Pascal and Rudin, throwing them under the bus to insure they made their money back on a shitty movie (or series of shitty movies) that was sure to flop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just said this same thing in another thread but I guarantee this movie will be released in the coming months and it will make a shit ton of money as people flock to see the &quot;controversial&quot; movie.

    <div class="md"><p>You think Sony released all that data and private information as a marketing stunt? Lol. Don&#39;t fool yourself. Maybe if there was no hack and just the theater threat, but no way they did all this as marketing. </p>

<p>You can definitely say how this back is giving them free publicity, or even that they&#39;re taking advantage of it for publicity, but no way they did all this just for publicity. You genuinely believe that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I genuinely believe companies sometimes make shit up in order to advertise their products. Some people in Sony&#39;s marketing department could have made this whole thing up, or purposely leaked shit, in order to create this controversy. Obviously I can&#39;t prove that, but to think that couldn&#39;t or doesn&#39;t happen is being naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how has any of that data harmed them? But really, I am genuinely asking. I don&#39;t know so much about what was actually hacked.</p>

<p>From the little I read about it, the &quot;data&quot; that was pulled was about as telling as your average tabloid. George Clooney said this in an email. This producer thinks Angelina Jolie is a brat. Etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it sounds like the problem is that you are uninformed then.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna hold your hand through all of the data and the ramifications but one easy example I&#39;m sure you can comprehend is this: typically companies avoid marketing plans which result in you getting sued in a class action. Typically you don&#39;t release all of your employees personal and sensitive data such as social security numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless it was someone within the company who only cares about their paycheck, or a bonus they might get if the movie makes a ton of money (I realize as of now they&#39;re not releasing the movie but I guarantee it will be released, and all the idiots who are buying into this shit will flock to throw their money at the movie), could have created this &quot;controversy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>They also might just not release it whatsoever and try to get insurance money. It might not be released, but even if it is that doesn&#39;t prove anything. And capitalizing on the attack is a lot different from doing the attack.</p>
