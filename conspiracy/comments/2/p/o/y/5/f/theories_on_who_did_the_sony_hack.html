        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The media is now pushing North Korea. My first instinct to that was, I see the motive, but they don&#39;t seem like they&#39;d have the technical expertise. But NK could have hired someone else to do it for them, like China. China&#39;s not a fan of Japan or America, and they&#39;re allies of NK.</p>

<p>After thinking on it a bit longer, I realized that NK has developed nuclear weapons, which is crazy technical, and crazy expensive. So NK doing it themselves seemed plausible again. </p>

<p>But then I always circle back around to the nagging feeling that it all just seems a little too much like a Hollywood movie to be real. Things in real life just aren&#39;t usually so clean cut. So I think it&#39;s equally plausible that someone else entirely is orchestrating the whole thing and framing NK, and for what purposes, I&#39;m not smart enough to know.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>UPDATE: There have been a lot of interesting ideas shared here, some substantive and some more esoteric, but it&#39;s all been fascinating reading. A couple highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sony, as part of the MPAA, has been funding legal efforts to actually censor internet DNS: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/16/7401769/the-mpaa-wants-to-strike-at-dns-records-piracy-sopa-leaked-documents">http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/16/7401769/the-mpaa-wants-to-strike-at-dns-records-piracy-sopa-leaked-documents</a> . So those who stand to lose from DNS censoring have a motive, and NK could be a scapegoat they&#39;re using to misdirect investigators. Those broken English warnings certainly do have a lulzy quality to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Though NK does seem to have the means, if defectors can be believed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_121">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_121</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>My own personal parting thought: Before taking any official proclamations at face value about who did this, always remember the Iraqi WMD debacle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are similarities between the malware they used and the malware used in South Korean banking systems (DarkSeoul) which was believed to be North Korea or a group inside of North Korea. </p>

<p>Also, North Korea does have a viable cyber warfare unit. IIRC it&#39;s Unit 121, and they study math and computer science intensively for most of their lives, including visiting universities in other countries for further training.</p>

<p>There are also similarities with other hacking tools used, I believe their wiping tool was also used in Saudi Arabia in what was likely a Russian attack, so I see some degree of cooperation between separate hacking groups here. </p>

<p>Personally I think a computer security false flag would involve alot more people, possibly an attack on power grids or cellphone networks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely.  What would the US government really have to gain from this?  Even if there were definitive &quot;proof&quot; available that it was NK responsible for the hack, and it was at the orders of Kim Jong-il&#39;s ghost itself, the public response wouldn&#39;t be to go to war over Sony&#39;s lost profits and shelving of a crappy comedy flick.</p>

<p>Now, if people lost power, lost their cell signal, lost their money from the banks, and it was &quot;proven&quot; to be NK, that might be different.</p>

<p>I think this was a hack done by North Korea for exactly the reason you would think, they didn&#39;t want the film to be released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say NK has the technical ability to hack at a nation state level, those types of hacks we don&#39;t hear about.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything that says NK did it and find this whole thing fishy.  I think some group that is likely sympathetic to NK did it and wanted to make a splash which is what nation states don&#39;t want to do.  Unsure if they had been paid to do so or they just wanted to do it.  Could be mercs paid by NK, china, japan, US to create this event perhaps?</p>

<p>I think the US government is taking advantage of this hack to push an agenda of there own.  Sony says, NK didn&#39;t do it (no evidence), a source in the government says they have linked to NK and or they have proof that NK did it.  News are flooding the internet that NK did it but yet still no proof just assumptions and flimsy evidence at best.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we see a bill that pushes for government control of the internet as this could&#39;ve been a terrorist attack on our infrastructure!!!  But the government couldn&#39;t stop this as this was a private company.  The hack likely was started awhile ago and they had the network under their control for months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so incredibly far-fetched I hardly believe you believe it yourself.  So, what you&#39;re saying is that Sony released a bunch of info about their executives, released a number of their own movies to the internet, and has opened themselves up to who knows how many lawsuits and lost revenue...  And the reason they did that is to increase the popularity of Seth Rogen and James Franco.</p>

<p>Even the guys a little further up acting like hacking is impossible and every hack is a conspiracy to further some agenda sound less crazy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Sony has been so effective with their guerrilla marketing campaign that they have convinced the US government that their campaign is actually real.</p>

<p>Sony also released their own emails, which disparage people they employee. Seems like a great strategy.</p>

<p>Sony also released thousands of social security numbers, and personal information of people such as grips, camera men, food staff, again , you know &quot;for marketing&quot;</p>

<p>Sony is forfeiting hundreds of millions of theater ticket money, again , to sell more tickets.</p>

The whole Sony-hack-terrorism-DPRK debacle covers a lot of bases: communist nation with nukes rekindles Cold War fears, and the out-of-nowhere hacking aspects scares everybody else. Couple that with this outrage us entertainment junkies are feeling, that Sony would pull it cause of empty threats. But then, it brings back very recent memories of the Aurora shooting.

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking Sony paid hackers to do it or perhaps NK to do it because their stock was doing bad or something but after looking into Sony&#39;s Stock this morning that could not be the case. If NK hired hackers from the outside this would mean to me that these hackers would have visited NK either to propose hacking sony  for money or to be solicited by NK to hack sony, either way IMO i truly believe if this is the case the hackers flew to NK from Seol. Now if NK truly has a cyberwarefare dept there is no way the hack could have taken place on NK soil. I dont think they even have AOL dialup there. The only other thing that makes sense is possibly NK has a sleeper agent employed at Sony to get this data out. I really think this was an inside job only because of the sheer magnitude of data that was stolen.  </p>

<p>I posted this on reddit a few weeks ago. speaking as a network engineer the engineers at Sony would be just plain stupid if they didnt notice 1 TB of data leaving their datacenter. this data was transported using usb thumb drives or something portable.
To break it down to perspective I listed out how long it would take to download 100TB of data not including overhead if the hacker had a 10Mb / 25Mb / 51Mb and 100Mb internet connection. Take note the lowercase &quot;b&quot; and uppercase &quot;B&quot; below.
(hh:mm:ss)
10Mb 22222:13:20 2.53 years to download 100TB with 10Mb internet connection
25Mb 8680:33:20 .99 years to download 100TB with 25Mb internet connection
51Mb 4357:17:54 .49 years to download 100TB with 51Mb internet connection
100Mb 2222:13:20 .25 years to download 100TB with 100Mb internet connection</p>

<p>Certainly a possibility worth exploring. Especially if we&#39;re going to make a film about this, right or wrong, there&#39;ll be a lot more depth to it if we consider who else might have a motive.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/16/7401769/the-mpaa-wants-to-strike-at-dns-records-piracy-sopa-leaked-documents">if Sony&#39;s out to destroy the internet</a>, then basically anyone with any computer knowledge and skills whatsoever could be pissed at them.</p>

<p>However, it seems more like Sony has awakened a bear than stumbled into a hornet&#39;s nest. A bored hacker would put a movie on a torrent, not try to get it canceled so that no one could see it. It looks like there&#39;s a depth of purpose to what the hackers have been doing, and it&#39;s not someone or a group of people simply lashing out because they&#39;re angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sony is covered by insurance against theft, and has a string of 6-7 movies receiving horrible reviews lined up for release. USA needs a reason to attack North Korea. CIA sets up a &quot;hack&quot; for Sony, releasing files to the public. Sony claims it on insurance. USA attacks North Korea as a cyber terrorist.</p>

<p>Basically, what &quot;Loose Change&quot; was claiming happened on 9/11.</p>

<p>It cost Sony a fortune,even if guilty it will cost N.Korea nothing so what would be the point in framing them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha this isn&#39;t a &quot;terror act&quot; it&#39;s just NK being dicks to Sony.</p>

<p>It is definitely not NK why?Because the TV said it was?</p>

<p>This submission is daft and your surmising even dafter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link.</p>

<p>I am not looking to prove N.Korea did it.You said they &quot;definitely&quot; did not.The burden of proof is yours I&#39;m afraid.</p>

<p>The media attention this is getting is annoying me and your post annoyed me probably for that reason,so sorry.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less if N.Korea did it or if they do it again and again to other movie studios,if they made those companies fall they would be doing the world a favour lol.</p>

<p>Somebody else mentions it will be used to get us receptive to another more serious attack on banking etc.That might be true but that&#39;s just taking advantage of a situation,it doesn&#39;t mean the west orchestrated it.</p>

<p>These types of attacks will become more and more common,future wars of a sort and will probably trigger a real war some day but not much is going to come out of some shitty hollywood movies being leaked and another doubtless equally shitty one being shelved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it&#39;s smelled like #2 since the beginning. But finding out Putin invited Un to Moscow (most likely to secure a pipeline into SK) the day before the US State Department officially blamed NK for the hack really made up my mind.</p>
