    <div class="md"><p>Also, the cold war is being re-established and they don&#39;t want to see any Russian nukes at their border. 
Another theory is that they want to prevent a joint venture between one cuban oil company and a russian one that was planned.</p>

<p>I think this will not hold on for too long though, sooner or later the people there will realize again that they are being fucked over, that their land is being sold out (like it was the case before the cuban revolution) and they will incite a second revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US doesn&#39;t need to destroy the revolution. So many Cubans have become disillusioned with it already that now only the regime still believes in it (and even that is kinda iffy). Cuba might be a time capsule but it&#39;s people are not. I spent  over a week there last year. I spoke with everyone that I could about how they feel about the revolution and the future of their country. The idea of making more than $30 a month was more than enough convincing for almost everyone. It&#39;s pretty bad when a private taxi driver in Cuba makes more than a hundred times as much as a doctor or a lawyer. New policies have allowed certain jobs to be privatized, and let me tell you, the entrepreneurs are seriously capitalizing on that. Cuba is about to experience their biggest economic boom in recent history.</p>

<p>How about a CEO making thousands of times more than their employees? Or hedge fund managers destroying companies and putting thousands of people out of jobs and then coming in to privatize city infrastructures? How about making it a crime to feed the homeless? ... oh wait, I forgot, there are no homeless people in Cuba... and yes I&#39;ve been there 5 times and talked to many people as well. </p>

<p>The Cuban revolution is one of the greatest success stories of the last 100 years and it will remain so. </p>

<p>All three of those counties have a central bank.</p>

<p>The myth (which was created around 2007) is that all but 3 or 5 or 7 countries have a &quot;Rothschild-controlled&quot; central bank or a &quot;Rothschild-owned&quot; central bank.</p>

<p>That&#39;s certainly not true, many of the world&#39;s biggest economies--the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, China, Canada--have central banks that are owned by the national government. Japan&#39;s central bank has stock that is traded on the stock exchange, but the owners of the shares don&#39;t have any control, Japan&#39;s government appoints the leaders. The U.S., of course, has its hybrid system, controlled partly by the federal government and partly by the member banks.</p>

<p>Occasionally, people who know that this isn&#39;t true will say &quot;Rothschild-style&quot; central bank. What is that even supposed to mean? As far as I&#39;ve been able to find out, the Rothschilds have had very little to do with central banks over the centuries. They did have something to do with the Bank of England, including having a Rothschild on the board of directors in the 19th century, but they don&#39;t seem to have controlled it. </p>

<p>I also challenge you to explain what the lines on the chart mean. <a href="http://www.save-a-patriot.org/files/view/whofed.html">Here is a more complete version of it.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not as far as I know and it would be shock if it were, since the chart is ... hard to decode.</p>

<p>The very top line is &quot; N.M. Rothschild , London - Bank of England&quot;. What does that mean? N. M. Rothschild is a private bank. The Bank of England is owned by the British government--and had been since it was nationalized in 1946, 30 years before this report.</p>

<p>There lines link businesses to business, businesses to people, people to people, but without labels we don&#39;t know that they&#39;re supposed to mean. There are people on there who died in 1920, businesses that hadn&#39;t existed for decades, either.</p>
