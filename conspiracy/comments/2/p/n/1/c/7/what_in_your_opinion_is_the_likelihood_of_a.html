       I thought I’d try and start a discussion on this, given the current international political climate. I’m also eager to hear views from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as this sub tends to have an alternative world viewpoint to much of the mainstream political commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one think it is very unlikely unless certain conditions are met. Namely, the survival of either the Russian state or the US is under threat. 
So unless the US wants to raise the American flag on the Kremlin, or the Russians raising the flag on the White House, I don't think we'll see anything more than a rehashing of the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the US and Russia were to engage militarily with each other somewhere around the planet, I still couldn’t imagine either nations resorting to nuclear weapons unless, as I said above, the survival of either state was threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logic I’m thinking is that obviously the US would defeat Russia (at least for the foreseeable future), but if Russia can retreat and go home, then they can rebuild (it would take them a long time of course). But if they go nuclear, then it’s game over for everyone including them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just see nuclear weapons as the ultimate last option, when a nation’s very existence is directly under threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that users here and elsewhere tend to view the elite as literally insane from time to time, but Putin and Obama or any future US president, or if you are of that persuasion the shadow elite pulling the strings, they are not idiots. They know what they are doing and both sides must recognize the utter strategic pointlessness of launching a nuclear attack at each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agree? Disagree? All views and opinions welcome.

       Are you basically saying that governments understand that nuclear war would ultimately end war, and of course the last thing that the global elite  want is the chance that war could end, whether it be because of self annihilation or world peace?

       What I'm interpreting it as is the
       <em>
        financiers
       </em>
       of the governments have no incentive in a thermonuclear holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have far more invested in
       <em>
        the perpetual fear
       </em>
       that the threat implies. Because they make money off of the
       <em>
        fear

       , for planes, missiles, defense systems, etc.

       I am as close to voting 0% as possible here, but respect all of your opinions.

       I am not old enough to have experiences the last Cold War drama, and am sorry for those here who have. Just trying to offer a level headed response here (something I wish our media would do for once, and considering I usually take the opposite stance of them, I feel alright so far as far as my position goes).

       It sure as hell fits their fearporn Problem/Reaction/Solution paradigm though, which is why I'm not buying any of this bullshit.
      </p>

       Just gotta keep your eyes on the prize, BM, and do what you think is right. A little stockpile never hurt anyone, even if it's more for peace-of-mind than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep learning, keep searching for Truth, and try and convince your friends and family to turn off that fucking TV and go live their lives. Hit a baseball, climb a mountain, restore and old car, brew some goddamn beer (and don't forget about Jim, he's always thirsty).
      </p>
      <p>
       We've lost sight of that with all our electronic gadgets, and I think it's a shame. And full disclosure, I'm typing this from my Nexus 5, so of course I'm a bit guilty. But you gotta pay attention to the
       <em>
        real world
       </em>
       far more than all the fearporn out there.

       Bought the same as I grew up with. The "atomic clock" was stuck at five minutes till midnight for most of my life. With every successive generation here in the US seeming to suffer from regressive education policies I just keep on keeping on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a bug out bag for "regular" emergencies, and when I was younger I worried enough I settled in a place likely to miss the majority of the fall out. As projections predicted then. But as I grew older I realized it was just a crapshoot and if I get lucky, I get lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess I don't fret on it, but it's not something that would take me horribly surprised. And then I would be either dead or dealing.

       Two things going on here: an exchange of nuclear warheads, and all-out nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likelihood of a nuclear exchange involving one or two warheads on each side is about 40%. The Likelihood of all-out nuclear war is around 15%.

       Not sure why you got down voted. I was waiting for someone to make this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smaller tactical nuclear strikes leads us to a different conversion. Where would they be used? By whom? And why would a nation feel compelled to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purely on the battlefield? That would still have to be a pretty large and crowded battle field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once tactical nuclear weapons are deployed, I can only see that escalating really. It'll open the floodgates so to speak. Particularly if the two countries in question are the US and Russia

       As someone who grew up during the last one and genuinely thought it was going to happen I hope nobody has to go through this horrific dehumanising process again. It made me profoundly nihilistic in my late teens.

       If you were convinced though, regardless of the propaganda, that the two countries would not launch nuclear weapons at each other, you would have experienced it differently and come out of it differently as well maybe?

       Yes, definitely, I was young and impressionable at the time though. Once I later realised the whole thing was a theater of control it turned the nihilistic edge I gained into a healthy hatred of false party politics and an awareness of the bullshit we are fed by the corporate classes. Like the glasses in They Live I saw their subtle cues to
       <strong>
        obey
       </strong>
       for what they were. I became an Anarchist and have never looked back. Thankfully I also discovered the healing power of psychedelics and chilled out a bit too.

       No, I see it now as macho posturing to appear powerful for an increasingly jaded electorate, they can see they're paying for the destruction of this beautiful planet by psychopathic power junkies. This awareness was less apparent during the last cold war. Time to say enough I think.

       Well I suspect that tensions between Russia and the US are going to get a lot worse. Now, they may get better in the near future, but eventually they are going to see days as bad as the height of the Cold War, I'd assume so anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm really interested in the though, is the likelihood of firstly, a military conflict between the two nations (as the US and Russia never actually confronted each other during the Cold War), and secondly, the likelihood of a nuclear confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rehashing of the Cold War wouldn't concern me greatly, I wouldn't live in fear because of it as I don't believe that either side would launch a nuclear attack against one another. Again, unless certain conditions are met, as I have written above.

       As evidenced by the latest round of international politics and economic maneuvering, it's hard to believe the Cold War ever ended, I think it just got colder. The Doomsday Clock's still at 5minutes til, after all.

       The Cold War ended, but the nuclear stalemate never did. So in a sense I suppose it never truly ended. The ideological element to the Cold War ended, of which the US won.

       A) I don't really have enough time, nor can I be bothered to watch that right now. And B) I'm not entirely certain that I really want to waste my time on a video that has an opening gambit that states "Nuclear Weapons Do Not Exist".

       Perhaps I'll keep my head buried in the sand and pass on this one.

       Or maybe I'll watch it tomorrow, it's unlikely though. Sorry.

       Unless It's on about how nuclear weapons are in existence purely for propaganda purposes to keep nations in fear? In which case, I understand and probably watch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it's literally going to make the argument that nuclear weapons don't exist and have never gone off (Hiroshima and testing etc), then I refer you back to my first two points.

       No one benefits from an actual nuclear exchange. Ruins your human resources when you do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        existence of nukes
       </em>
       is enough to keep the slaves in line, and that's been proven for over 60 years now. Sadly, this will not prevent either side from asserting that a nuke can/will/has been used. They may even go as far as to let a 'dirty' nuke irradiate an area to prove they are being 'used'.

       So you honestly think that the US and Russia would be okay with quite literally wiping each other off the map? Along with most of the rest of the world if it was a full scale nuclear war, which it would be if the aforementioned nations launched WMD's at each other?

       I have to ask to make sure we know where we stand, is your viewpoint here coming from some Jewish related new world order world view? You know, Protocols of the Elders of Zion and all that jazz?

       100%.  U.S. oligarchs are pushing for either Putin to initiate a nuclear war to reduce world population, or relinquish control of what the Nazis called the "Earth Island" (Eurasia, Central Asia, Asia).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a win/win (for the U.S. oligarchs) to have a nuclear war, and it's a win/win to say "Putin did it."

       Okay, so if an exchange of nuclear weapons occurs, as you believe will happen in this century between the US and Russia, then It'll be all out nuclear annihilation. You can guarantee that Russia will use all of its second strike capabilities once Moscow is no more, which will mean much of North America and Europe will be wiped out, if not all of it in its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the very few privileged elite will be hiding away in their nuclear bunkers/command centres whilst quite literally the rest of America burns and turns into a fiery living hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does the very few remaining elite do after it's all over and there is
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       left. Build a bonfire and start rebuilding America with their bare hands?

       Clearly, they will become subterranean troglodytes, or even drow, inbreeding further and further while developing strange and horrible gods. If there's any survivors on the surface, the 'elite' descendents will no doubt attempt to conduct raids on them and discover that the horrible burning day star is too much for them.
