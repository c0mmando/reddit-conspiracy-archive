       So I lurk this subreddit because it's sometimes thought provoking. Usually retarded, but sometimes thought provoking. I have been reading about the Sony cyberattacks and junk today though, and was thinking ... what if this is a false flag type deal? The only way the U.S. government could protect companies like Sony is to set up a national firewall (great firewall of China sound familiar?). That would protect corporate sites, but would lay the groundwork for cutting us off from the rest of the world. Or at least making sure we only see what we're supposed to see from the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, never attribute to malice what can be easily explained by stupidity, sure. Maybe the attack is NK just being dicks. But either way, if there is a response from our government that wants to implement network filters 'for our security', in an era where net neutrality is being hotly debated ... well, I hope we are all willing to ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And shit I'm probably now on a list.

       I think this post highlights a very valuable aspect of this sub; thinking outside the box, approaching ideas with an open mind, but remaining skeptical, challenging the "official story". Don't blindly believe anything, but don't close your mind completely.

       By all means post away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens all the time. And some of the theories I see here are pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you mentioned about NK and the Sony hack. Here's my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of a sophisticated CIA-Hollywood operation against North Korea. They deliberatley made this movie knowing beforehand that the NK's would make loud protests against the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then comes the false flag hack. It makes a lot of publicity for Sony, who then make a tax claim for whatever made up losses incurred when the film gets pulled from theaters
       <em>
        as planned
       </em>
       . Sony makes more benefit to their bottom line this way than they would have if the film ever got released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a whole generation of young movie goers is exposed to the fear conditioning technique. eg. North Korean threat directly affects what they can see at the movie theater + Peer group actors Rogen and Franco go into hiding.
      </p>
      <p>
       US government experts discover "evidence" (which is classified so we never see it or know exactly what it is) that North Korea is behind the hack. Now we've got something to accuse the North Koreans of, instead of the usual thing about human rights violations. Pretty convenient timing because, since the CIA torture report came out... the US isn't going to be able to point the finger like they used to.

       Hmm, would this possibly be setting up cause for invasion (or any other type of conflict, be it abstract like cyber warfare or concrete like conventional warfare)? Or do you feel it is mostly for Sony's profit?

       This part is open to speculation. The first question is always "Who benefits?" Obviously Sony does if they get a ton of free publicity. The movie itself may yet go into release and if it does, it is now almost guaranteed to be a hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the diplomatic end of things, the US gets a few different things. One, they get to make yet another accusation against North Korea. Two, the hack itself might be used to justify even more funding for cyber-security. Three, if this is a false flag, it might be used to justify more direct government surveillance/control over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, it can be used to condition the general public via fear conditioning. The North Koreans serve as a convenient boogeyman. Once again, it's big brother to the rescue.

       This is story #1 on all MSM stations for the entier week. I don't even subscribe to
       <a href="/r/movies">
        /r/movies
       </a>
       and this story has about 25 of the top 100 posts from my front page. I find it very hard to believe that a international political story like this is driven by a movie studio trying to make profits from a bad movie. Not to say I know what is going on yet, I don;t like to jump to conclusions when something this big and new comes up, you usually have to wait a bit to understand it. That being said, I am reminded of the anti-Islam video that came out in USA right before the Benghazi attacks which were blamed on it (and which turned out to be a falsified causation).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this video does get released (as all the reddit kids are dying for it to be) and NK gets real, real mad and does something stupid, then that would explain all the effort going into the de-release of this film, which I am going to guess is horrible.

       To address your title, I think that's the point of this reddit. As "retarded" as it can get here it should be a place where we can post our ideas and invite constructive discussion on it. But, I'm a lurker as well. I only made my account recently because a post got under my skin enough that I had to reply. Haha :p
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like you're making a good point here and employing a thought process that many seem to lack.
I won't lie, I was kind of tempted to stop reading when I saw the words "false flag". Because literally everything these days seems to be a false flag around here but keeping a realistic, logical approach is important.
 no matter the cause of this event, this will likely be a "solution". And one that would severely limit our freedom to information.
I mean, having the internet censored in one way or another is HUGE right now (even in the average American's mind) and no doubt this attack on such a large corporate entity will be and is playing part in the game the world's governments are playing against our freedom.

       Don't be negative man. A lot of things seem "retarded" at first glance because they follow a line of logic so removed from the mainstream narrative. And a lot of those things that seemed retarded actually end up being true.

       I belive its all a scam.  They made this movie with all this planned. Killing two birds with one stone not only is it taking shots at NK and getting the American people to dislike NK even more but its also going to spark up some fire wall bullshit where "we need to be better protected against these attacks" just like every " terrorist attack" this generation. Its propaganda at its finest .

       So you want to post your own theory, but most similar posts are "retarded"? You have much to learn on the art of persuasion. Also your theory sucks balls - Sony is not a US company, and this attack has nothing whatsoever to do with North Korea.

       It's almost become the de facto self introduction here to state that x (high) % of posts on this sub are 'batshit' but there is some y (low) % that have validity. You know, "I'm not crazy but..."
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, I think most of the posts here have at least some validity. I'd actually like it if we had a bit more zany stuff. I feel like there's a stupid underdog mentality here that causes people to shy away from far-out speculation and tone things down in the hope that things will get dry enough that no one can point and laugh or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the free thinkers among us can enjoy all topics; and, since there's practically no other good place to discuss the "crazier" stuff, why not? Considering that actually no human really has any idea about the true nature and rules of reality, nothing should be off topic for this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely a conspiracy among numerous parts of society to suppress humanity at large getting any foothold that might unravel the false paradigms foisted upon us, the range of available topics should span all aspects of the unknown.

       Well said. All of us know that feeling when friends or family respond with incredulity to ideas/information about events that they haven't heard on the mainstream media. A lot of the things we discuss here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are not issues I would broach with the "unititiated".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I react negatively to closed-minded, derogatory posts on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . We should be able discuss all issues frankly and openly without uninformed mainstreamers taking the conversation down to their level.

       Sony US is American for the point of OPs contention. Being that megacorps owe allegiance to the same international global military industrial complex or at least Sony is definitely within the sphere of US hegemonic power.

       He has no source, it's a theory, and it's a theory which makes sense, as the whole "selfie" thing didn't start to become popular until the time when they started enacting these facial recognition databases in conjunction with "services" like facebook, instagram, snapchat, and other "services".

       I tend to view TPTB as opportunists rather than planners. Sure, they may have plans, but i dont think they set shit up (false flags) just to conduct their cronyisms. Rather, i feel they wait for the opportune time, when something happenz, and they can draw from their deck of cards the next installment of bullshit. Perhaps sometimes they are aware of an attack or something, and decide to help facilitate it with minimal effort to insure plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       But thats just me...
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the firewall idea, i can see them foaming at the mouths with that idea. If nothing else, it would be an easy way for a targetted killswitch, shutting down only areas they want to be shut down. That, and the filtering/censoring potential you brought up, would be more than enough bait for them to bite down on this one...

       I personally am very interested in members self posts. There is certainly more time and thought put into it than just posting an article. Once in a while I will just post what I am thinking about an event and ask for thoughts and opinions as well. It could be a real eye opener or you could get laughed out of the sub...which I admit has happened to me on occasion but at least it's putting
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       on the table here.

       People used to put together some actual reports of their own after researching the web. It was like we had quite a group of investigative reporters here. I really liked it.

       The funny thing about this hack is there are potential political motivations for pretty much any actor I can think of.  Russia, China, USA themselves, hell even south America could see it as an opportunity to give the Americans some comeuppance for their antics.  Safe money is on Russia and/or the Koreans themselves, but the states will capitalize on it in the way you surmise regardless of who is responsible.
