       One of the greatest misconceptions is that the government is printing money. It's not what backs the money that's important. It's who controls the quantity.

       Hey Bill, your documentaries opened my eyes to the shady side of central banking and I really want to thank you for your work.  Have you noticed, in the last few years, an increase in peoples perception or do you think it's falling behind?  Secondly, what sorts of recoil have you experienced in terms of ...uh, "agents" protecting the system?  Have you had lots of threats, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks once again for staying the course for so many years, you are an inspiration!

       I'm absolutely convinced that human freedom is loose on the face of this planet and it's very difficult to drown a dream. In the last 3 years, I have seen more progress in monetary reform than the previous 25, and the past year more then the previous 3. The bad thing about the Saudis' Christmas present to the West is it disguises the collapse of the debt money system and will delay reform.

       Although Bill has been kind enough to provide a pre-verification picture and video for our community, I have asked him to provide verification that the account being used for today's ama belongs to him. Once I have received that information I will sticky this thread.

I'm not expecting perfect coordination by any means but when one moderator says it will not be stickied until further verification and then it's stickied before the verification has been presented, I wonder.

       Cool thanks Bill.  I meant no disrespect but, like I said, we've had issues with AMA verification and imposters in the past in an effort to discredit the guest.  Didn't want a repeat of that.

       I think it would be easiest to simply make a twitter/facebook post saying "I am "billstill3" on reddit.

       No, no; by all means your twitter status confirming that you're using this handle is more than fine.

       Typically on reddit AMA's, the user takes a picture of themselves with a time stamp, the date, and their username and posts it to the AMA from their username.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because obviously anyone can create a reddit account and claim to be someone - and we've had problems with this in the past on this subreddit.

       If the government is controlled by plutocrats, then would a National Currency be controlled by plutocrats? (

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=K8tD2gdvs_4#t=2114
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary argument is No, because a National Currency would be simplified and transparent to everyone. Unlike the Federal Reserve Bank, the balance sheet would be allowed to be audited by Congress and the American people; the government would simply print all the money it needs for itself instead of having to pay it all back with compounding interest to the private owners of the Federal Reserve Bank.  Also, rather than let the private owners of the Federal Reserve Bank purposely cause depressions for their own gain, the government itself would control the volume of money in circulation, and this would end inflation and depressions.

       Bill, your movie must be watched over about 5 times to get it fully, and doing that with the streamed version ($4.99) within in 48 hours is not practical. Owning it for $13.99 is too much, especially with all the trolls on this forum and in other places trying to convince people not to watch it. Will you allow your movie to be distributed for free, such as by peer-to-peer torrent file, so that all the World can see it immediately? This clearly would be the best way to get the whole world involved before it’s too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       The privately owned Federal Reserve Bank is the biggest threat the World has ever known, because the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank start wars to force other Countries to borrow and use its own counterfeit currency i.e. Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran, and now Russia.

       I don't think so. Sure, for some Hollywood flick, that's too much. But when I go to buy that from Bill, I'm not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       getting his documentary, I'm helping him and his work, so I can look forward to more news and analysis from him.

       But, I have some very different ideas about "value" and in how I spend my money.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. I don't buy any Coca-cola or Pepsi products. Ever. Even if they're cheaper. I'd rather buy from a local or small business. It's a minor annoyance at some restaurants as I sometimes can only get water, which is fine by me.

       Conversely, the free publicity could well work to your advantage, and you might generate even more income from web traffic, speaking fees, book sales, plus a bonus of free dinners and drinks at parties and conferences for life. Just sayin'...maybe some old skool blinders in play here?

       Speaking as a former member of the Ethics and Transparency team for Quark, I think I speak for many former community members when I question whether the considerable donation of Quarks you received from Kolin Evans before your endorsement influenced your decision. Care to set the record straight for us? Were you complicit in what (in hindsight) looks like a pump and dump scheme?

       Are you referring to your previous statement in this AMA that the downfall of Quark was that the creators are selling too many Quarks?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the initial claims that Quark was the "best distributed crypto ever", the creators would not have all those millions upon millions of Quarks to sell. Hence my initial question about due diligence.
A cursory look at the blockchain and it was obvious that the vast majority of coins were held by 100 or so wallets..

       I'm sure the big "they" have all sorts of nefarious plans about everything. That's why a robust self-governance is absolutely critical. As far as RFID goes, your cell phone is a waaayyy more effective tracking device. We just attack these assaults on freedom as they come -- one by one. Probably the most important thing is NOT to make people feel hopeless. Without hope, the people will not fight it.

       If Congress could or would take back the printing press from the private Federal Reserve, do you think Congress paying off China or other big bondholders with say, some new "billion dollar bills" or even a trillion dollar coin, or something, basically inflating to pay off the debt, would be a good idea?

       Hi Bill!
I have a few questions regarding debt-free money:(1)How would you stop the government from creating too much of it, causing inflation?(2)Would there even be a need for an income tax?(3)Would banks still be profitable without fractional-reserve lending?

       Waaaayyyy too much is made of inflation. Do you know how many hyper-inflations there have been? Believe it or not, it is a knowable number. According to my friend, Prof. Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins -- the top expert on hyperinflation, there have been around only 50 examples of it in all world history. Far more frequent and far more damaging than having too much money in the system is having too little. Ask yourself which one you would like to deal with. 
If we actually took back the power to create our own money, you would have to be insane to go hyper inflationary. I mean a lone madman dictator might, but not something where the power was spread out to the maximum extent politically practical. There are literally dozens of ways of maximizing democratic control. Any one of them would be a couple orders of magnitude better than what we have.
Yes, banks would be profitable. First of all, the have considerable assets in the largest buildings in every city on the planet -- for starters.

       The federal reserve dilutes the dollar every year by printing money without much of the market's knowledge.  This devalues every individual dollar every year.  The reason it has not reached the level of "hyper inflation" is because the Gold market is severely manipulated, propping up the dollar.  Once gold's real value is revealed(most likely by China, Russia's who created their own gold market to rival the Globalists), the dollar will drop significantly, making way for a new(international) currency(like the Euro), and huge profits for international bankers who have a monopoly on the gold market.  There is no democracy while a private central bank exists in a country, no matter how many ways you try to "maximize it".  And about 99% of countries have a private central bank.  The myth that you can fix it from the inside(which you seem to believe) is propagated by the elite to keep people from trying to overthrow them violently/forcefully.  They made the system.  They control it.  There is no "fixing" it unless they want it "fixed", but to them, it is working just fine(as a means of sucking the wealth out of the global population).

       inflation is not totally bad; there is a vital purpose and function to it. in an economy with a fixed money supply, anytime there's a financial scare, people would pull their money out and hoard it, keeping it out of circulation. with inflation, the hoarders lose out. this keeps money in circulation during troubled times.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem with inflation is that workers wages have not kept pace. and this has a lot to do with lack of political will, and a widespread mentality that min-wagers don't deserve any more that they're getting.

       Whether it is through taxes, inflation, or wage stagnation, the "real wage" is kept down.  The federal reserve has enough power by itself, without the US gov't to control the real wage via controlling the interest rates/money supply.  It matters little what the public gov't does when a private business is printing the currency, and setting the interest rates, and self-regulating themselves, and the other banks(who make up the Federal Reserve).  In the end, the Fed is a self-regulating banking cartel, run by the same people it was created to regulate.  Whereas gov't agencies regulate almost all other industries, the banking industry is regulated by a private bank, whose "board of directors" are commonly made up of CEOs of the biggest banks in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation is caused by banks creating, and giving out money.  This dilutes the money supply, and value of each dollar.  If you are the bank/person/company receiving the free money, Inflation is good.  For everybody else, it devalues your money every time they "print" or "create" money(99% is never printed, just appears in bank account).

       There are many good paths. I like the Israeli approach best -- probably because it's easy to explain. I go into that in detail in the new film, "Jekyll Island". I have presented this to THE top economics guy inside the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. In year #1, banks can only create 90% of the money and the govt gets to create 10%. Then we look at the metrics and if the economy responds well, then in year 2, we increase it -- banks only create 80% and the gov gets to create 20% debt free. And so on.

       Bill, you seem to have a great grasp of some pretty complex economic principals, and you are also able to explain them in a way that is easy to understand. Did you receive any formal training or experience to help you develop these skills?

       Greetings, gentlemen!
Dear Bill Still, Thanks for your awesome documentaries! I'm russian and it would be great to hear your  view about what's going on in Russia these days? Ruble has fallen 200% already, seems like a typical managed crisis like the US'es great depression, but the thing is that heads of RF's Central Bank are put by dictator Putin himself.

       Well Putin in his news conference yesterday chastised the Russian Central Bank for trying to support the Ruble, so there is some tension there. That's interesting all by itself. Russia needs to divest itself once and for all from the communist dictatorship. I support Russian freedom, Chinese freedom, American freedom, etc.

       We've had national debt every year since the 1830's. That's a long time. It isn't inherently bad, and it is not synonymous to personal debt. What do you think of Alexander Hamilton's quote(this is a real quote, btw) ...

        A national debt will be to us a national blessing. ... It will be a powerful cement of our Union.

       I think this quote is the most important single point of failure of the period of the founding of this nation. Hamilton worked for the Bank. The debt "indents" the Congress to the lenders.

       Cannot possibly exist forever because of the structure. Price will go up and up until some point, where it will plunge. Could take a while though. Other cryptos, like Quark, have solved that. But Quark came under attack and was crippled by some of the original creators who just kept selling and selling it.

       No. Commercial banking is the same, they just have the Bank of North Dakota to backstop them as well as the Fed. The difference is the BND. It's the only state-chartered, state-owned bank in America. It truly uses the state's assets in the public interest.

       Financial interests have apparently been behind many major events throughout world history possibly including the attempted assassination of Andrew Jackson, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Do you think private financial interests could have played a role behind the attacks of 9/11 and subsequent foreign policy changes?

       Nooooooo. JFK was NOT assassinated by central bankers. He was an internationalist to the core. I have done YouTubes on this at least a couple of times. See my book. I go into it in detail. "No More National Debt". I'm not a fan of the 911 conspiracy take. Sorry, but if I had had 1% of the money spent on the 911 conspiracy, I could have pushed thru the solution to the real problem -- government borrowing.

       That it's power is an illusion -- literally the curtain hiding the wizard. The wizard are the biggest banks. The Fed is just there to provide the image that the government is in control of the banks, when just the reverse is true. That's why I was never a fan of Ron Paul's "audit the Fed". For what? Do you think they were going to put Bernanke in jail? Nonsense. It's just a sleight diversion to keep us working on something that really didn't matter. What does matter is spreading the knowledge that governments DO NOT have to borrow, and that banks create all the money literally out of nothing whenever they make a loan. When you take out a mortgage, at closing, does the banker go back into his vault and bring out a giant bag of hundred dollar bills? No. He creates an "account" for you, and deposits number -- not money. Credits.

       Bill, you do realize the dollar has been collapsing since 1971, right? The price of gold and other commodities reflect this perfectly, its gotten stronger over the past few years (lower gold prices) but overall its been collapsing for a while now and it will eventually implode - just like the ruble has been. I think its unrealistic to not suggest the possibly that its unlikely the dollar could fall as hard as the ruble, it is completely possible all the fundamentals are in in place at this point.

       There is nothing fast that can be done. I've kept the ball rolling but if you believe it, you just keep on. This human freedom thing is a big corporate "we" exercise. I'm lucky that somehow I fell into an undeserved role of standing out on the issue. So, I'll do the best I can with this calling for the few years that may be left and hopefully identify right-thinking people as they gain traction.

       Overjoyed you responded! I still have my voice, and will more frequently use it to help open eyes to the situation. I just wish there was a more radical approach to this...it's seemingly the only thing that draws the attention of the masses. More specifically, this nearly brainwashed youth that is  quickly approaching. Maybe I'll get shirts made or something..Just wish I could do something more to help fight the banks. Thank you so much for the knowledge Bill. Please, keep fighting!

       Oh, forgot about Ellen. I love Ellen, but she's just a little bit too left for my take. By that I mean a little too much towards giving the federal govt too much power. Other than that, she is the best.

       Hi Bill,
      </p>
      <p>
       If the world is in debt many trillions of dollars, who do we owe it to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we simply settle accounts, declare a jubilee or offload the debt onto Jupiter?
      </p>
      <p>
       What would it take to implement a global jubilee?  I refer you to the recent numberology speech of the head of IMF that might have alluded to it.

       Not into numerology, however. The debt load is soooo weighing down every economy on the planet that only $50bbl oil could have saved it. But just renouncing it is probably too harsh. Not sure there. In any case, it's so bad that simply declaring no more national debt would be a fine start. Then follow up with a phased approach to reducing bank created debt money and I think you'd see the world economy explode as we gradually paid off the bonds upon which the debt is based.

       That was a fantastic vid, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the killer; we are seeing a convergence of the transportation issues and the oil issues;
      </p>
      <p>
       We will see fully electric cars asap as the primary consumer choice (tesla, et al.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We will see a flood of cheap oil (as the military got their bulging payouts for the last 15 years, as well as it has solidified what the intel group wanted forever)
      </p>
      <p>
       lockheed will release their fusion power to essentially take over the oil foundation for transport (aside from shipping, but assuming all the cars no longer need fuel then boats have decades to live on fossil)
      </p>
      <p>
       there will be a concerted effort to re-educate generations on the balance of oil/power/electricity etc such that we accept these new norms...
      </p>
      <p>
       The terror/fear engine will continue as expected and will be used to solidify the oligarchy as we move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that really needs to happen, WRT revolutions, to change anything is the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       A global tax-holiday. EVERY single human on the earth should refuse to pay any tax to any government. This is the only true leverage we have with respect to freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't pay taxes based on "no taxation without representation" and define representation as a chosen allocation for where your taxes are consumed. This should be public data which is reviewed and debated and weighed as to determine the true sentiment of an entire populous where an accepted service has a funding minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example we all agree that we nee water and roads; they have a set budget - so you don't need to vote for that budget. What you do is you say "I want my money to go to space research and education" and you pay 10,000 per year in taxes, so out of your 10K, there is an auto-allocation of X% that goes to the roads and water, but from what is left you are saying that you want to have a weighted preference to space and education....
      </p>
      <p>
       it might be a complex concept - but it is actually very easy to model, financially.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end - the only thing this country needs to change the direction is to have a tax-sit-in.

       I have been hearing a lot lately about a group, family, or dynasty called "The Dragon Family" in China.  It is said they have an enormous amount of gold (the most in the world) These claims have no proof and it seems the whole subject is muddied with disinfo from people like Benjamin Fulford and Foster Gamble (Thrive creator).  Have you heard anything about this family that supposedly has trillions in gold that is against the Fed and Rothschilds, etc?

       Bill, long time fan. Well only a year or so but Money Masters was the stepping stone to where I am now. Question. Do you find it hard to keep going/reporting knowing that central banks are the norm and have been for quite some time, and do you think interest-free government backed currencies will ever happen?

       Good question. Glad I hung around to catch it. 
It doesn't matter how ineffective my life may have been. All that matters is I stood for the truth as best as I could and provided watchman-on-the-wall services to others interested in human freedom.

       Ineffective is not the word at all, Bill. Your work has provided thousands of people the truth about a corrupt system that has slowly been implemented over centuries. I ask only because I find it hard myself to keep a level head. I look forward to your Still Reports, so keep them coming! Thanks for all you do, we all appreciate it.

       How would you deal with the crony capitalist element your system brings? After all, we have evidence of this happening during feudal times in England where the monarchs of the day would issue money to it's cronies and deny others based on their politics.

       Thanks Bill ... It was your documentaries that finally taught me what money really is.  I can't imagine your frustration over the years trying to convince people that their long held concepts are simply wrong; I've never accomplished that. Your simplifications and historical analysis are second to none on the subject in the genre and your L. Frank Baum analysis is eye-opening and fun. Thanks for doing your part to educate the rest of us.

       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wondering what logic you base your support for crypto-currencies on in relation to your support for nationalized banking. Do you believe that tax payers should have their own currency through the government since they already pay taxes or do you think they should have to spend more money investing in money that they are not in control of?

       It seems that currently the trouble in the economy is the lack of money in circulation, since the Federal Reserve Bank is printing tons of money for themselves only, and spending it all on risky dervatives trades, and now have a quadrillion dollars in exposure to those trades, but the common entrepreneur is not getting any of this money at all because the banks wont lend it to the common entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is clearly a plot by the Federal Reserve Bank to intentionally crash the economy using derivatives to do it this time around, just like they did in 2008 using toxic mortgage trades.
      </p>
      <p>
       By intentionally crashing the economy, as they have intentionally done repeatedly in the past, the Federal Reserve Bank is continually given even more power by Congress. Further, another bill was just snuck through Congress that makes the taxpayers responsible for the quadrillion dollars of exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't Congress understand the Federal Reserve Bank is creating these crashes intentionally to gain more power?

       It's not a total cure. If there was only one thing I could do, it would be to eliminate the Constitutional right of the Federal Govt. to borrow. That's the key. If they couldn't borrow, they would have to cut spending -- OR -- raise taxes immediately and immediately be thrown out of office.

       With a Government controlled National Currency they could print more, but it wouldn't have to be paid back and would be debt free, this would make borrowing completely unecessary.

       Just finished watching Jekyll Island  I enjoyed the documentary immensely. It is a thorough explanation of the entire lead up to the Fed. It explains in a simple way what the issue is and how to fix it.

       It may be long but I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to know why the financial situation is the way it is. This will be nice to be able to reference.

       My husband and I watched Jekyll Island last night and I just wanted to say thank you for providing such a thorough explanation of the history of money and debt. It was two hours well spent to truly understand how we have come to be so debt-ridden and what we can do to change. The problem and solution are simple, but HOW do we get our government to change? I'm doing my part by spreading the word, but I feel like not enough people take the time to do the research. And what will it take for this change to happen? I know you don't know the answer, but I'm afraid that I don't know what else to do.

       Your ideas seem to revolve around the fed taking profits for itself, but in fact the fed's stated objectives don't involve making a profit, and any incidental profits made from its actions are returned to the U.S. Treasury each year. This is well publicised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you see US government debt as an issue when a significant proportion is owed to the fed, which means it will end up in the governments coffers anyway? What am I missing here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if the U.S. Government can issue new debt at record low levels of 1-2% at the moment, then why on earth should it be trying to pay it back?

       have the anti federal reserve people..i.e. your followers been the targets of a CIA bribe, in buying quark?. make us all potentially wealthy in order to shut us up. just asking since this is conspiracy thread. Is this how it can be done without a war or revolution. a simple yes or no is good enough. I didn't come up with this theory out of thin air. thank you for your valuable time here.

       Whoaaaa...you're talking to Reddit here, ie, mostly age 30-and-under, of which only 12% voted in 2014. They're happy to upvote/downvote everything Reddit all day every day, but don't be naive enough to expect them to actually show up at their balloting place for the real deal in November...especially r/conspiracy, where participation in elections is considered akin to gifting an alcoholic a bottle of booze.

       that is right.  their backs are spineless, and there bellies are yellow, they are the American non voters.  there needs to be a blockchain voting platform where people can  easily vote from their homes or mobile devices.  Secure and anonymous.  Hack proof voting.  the candidate with the most "votecoins"  in their wallet wins.

       I know of no one who made a ton of money an Quark. Look, cryptos are a good complimentary currency in the finest traditions of America. There were over 3,000 complimentary currencies in the US during the great depression of the 1930s. That's why the govt can't crack down on cryptos too hard. They are merely human's attempt to circumvent the lack of money brought on by a giant monopoly.

       I think BTC is too flawed to be an effective anything longterm. Quark has a much better structure if we could just get whoever created it to quit selling, selling, selling. But hey, this is why I said it's not what backs the money, it's who controls the quantity.

       Quark is a SCAM. Bitcoin has dropped in price but is fairly stable in comparison to Quark.

       Thanks for taking the time, Bill. I like thinking about weird things in this forum, and just wanted to take things to their logical conclusions sometimes once or twice, and see if we can make sense of things and I invite you to take a walk.
      </p>
      <p>
       When do you think people will realize that bitcoin/crypto/non-Federal Reserve Note that is the best chance to peacefully take down the worst thing in this society - the Federal Reserve and all of it's rotten branches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it - since it's inception and in turn, the Council on Foreign Relations, they have effectively ran this country through the manipulation of currency, information, and government since wrestling the reigns of the nation's money in 1913. And this is all you need to know to realize that any alternative to Federal Reserve Notes is something worth checking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, imagine a world where small, local communities had hobbies that they could use to barter with, and just used bitcoin as a medium for exchange. I brew beer. Make soap. I do these things because when you realize that most shit peddled as news and entertainment are merely distractions by how enslaved we are to these Federal Reserve Notes, and once you realize this, and unplug that, you have so much free time to learn and do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still with me? Were almost there. I'm from Massachusetts, which is the most I've ever shared on this website. I'm hinted at FEMA region 1, even New England a few times, but have scrubbed my profile pretty clean of anything that could identify me.  Anyways, Massachusetts was a special place in it's colonial history, and I'm not talking about the fairy tale that most are taught about the Revolutionary War, but how we were being docked around by the King for all his legislative uppercuts aimed at controlling monetary policy (The Stamp Acts are a good example), and the colonists in Massachusetts created the Massachusetts Bay Note, which was commodities backed, but the commodities were things that you used to keep on keepin' on (fur, meat, eggs, whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why can't we do that again? Isn't this the way to do it? Small pockets of communities, having hobbies that work with each other and sustain themselves to a degree (I like to make homemade stock for soup at work, and you get a ton of really food fat from rendering bones the right way). What if I could trade my butcher a couple bars of soap for soup bones every month? Fuck man, my soap is good. Maybe another dude will come along and make better soap for my butcher, but now we got
       <em>
        competition
       </em>
       , and you know that just screams free markets from the top of a mountain.  And you know what? Maybe instead of trading for the commodities all the time, we can just use bitcoin instead. Let's leave those dirty Federal Reserve Notes out of this, and slowly pay down our debts and get our money out of that corrupt system. And instead of watching the next episode of State of Affairs, I'm making things, am re-engaged in my community (because I got a butcher, a farmer, and a few mechanics who agreed to participate in the experiment and we're thinking about doing a biodiesel experiment and see if that bears anything (imagine being free of both the petro and the dollar? Told you we'd be going for a walk).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck - we can even have guys who don't think they have any real skills donate their time to deconstructing the American media system and reporting what's actually happening in the world, with no limits on speech, corporate interests, or offending advertisers. Because there are no ads - you're paid either in tips (btc, of course) or on a value-for-value subscription an, where developing trust with your audience is preferred, and now you have that lovely
       <strong>
        competition
       </strong>
       buzzword again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now that we have people who are well-informed (remember, our citizen journalists, who are paid by their local subscribers for the truth in a medium of exchange to buy local garden vegetables, meats, beer, bread, soap, and a generally stronger community. I bet we're healthier too, and we're less dependent on the ridiculous amount of prescription drugs this country takes in annually. So we're stronger, healthier, far more informed, and united. What's left? The final piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       A truly representative government. But maybe that's enough for thus walk. Hope you had as good a time as I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, my question - has anyone ever asked you why that hadn't started happening yet? Or does it start tomorrow? I mean, the stamp on the Massachusetts Bay Notes had this engrossed on it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Having been pressed down it rises up again"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Isn't that... Perfect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours,
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim.

       I haven't watched the new 83 minute-long version of
       <em>
        Jekyll Island
       </em>
       , but I have looked at an earlier, longer version. I have some questions about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start off by saying that the movie is about "the basic cause of all our economic problems today", which seems like extreme hyperbole. I don't know of an economist who thinks that all of our economic problems could be solved by changes to the banking and monetary system. I also don't think you could find more than a handful of economists in the world that would agree with you contention that "depressions are not normal. They are contrived." All the most successful countries have central banks. The United States grew more quickly (in real GDP/capita) in the hundred years after the Federal Reserve was created than in the hundred years before. Why are you so sure that they are the evil you make them out to be?

       It grew at that great rate because of the massive raw land and raw materials in the USA, despite the Fed. Back then, the Fed was nowhere near as powerful a force either. But if you think permanent indebtedness on the part of every human on earth to the big banks is the answer to humankind's quest for freedom, you are dreaming.

       There are very few people out there that ever admit mistakes, but everyone makes them. That Bill has the integrity to do so speaks volumes for his character.

       Whoaaaa...you're talking to Reddit here, ie, mostly age 30-and-under, of which only 12% voted in 2014. They're happy to upvote/downvote everything Reddit all day every day, but don't be naive enough to expect them to actually show up at their balloting place for the real deal in November...especially r/conspiracy, where participation in elections is considered akin to gifting an alcoholic a bottle of booze.

        that is right.  their backs are spineless, and there bellies are yellow, they are the American non voters.  there needs to be a blockchain voting platform where people can  easily vote from their homes or mobile devices.  Secure and anonymous.  Hack proof voting.  the candidate with the most "votecoins"  in their wallet wins.

       Whether it is through taxes, inflation, or wage stagnation, the "real wage" is kept down.  The federal reserve has enough power by itself, without the US gov't to control the real wage via controlling the interest rates/money supply.  It matters little what the public gov't does when a private business is printing the currency, and setting the interest rates, and self-regulating themselves, and the other banks(who make up the Federal Reserve).  In the end, the Fed is a self-regulating banking cartel, run by the same people it was created to regulate.  Whereas gov't agencies regulate almost all other industries, the banking industry is regulated by a private bank, whose "board of directors" are commonly made up of CEOs of the biggest banks in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation is caused by banks creating, and giving out money.  This dilutes the money supply, and value of each dollar.  If you are the bank/person/company receiving the free money, Inflation is good.  For everybody else, it devalues your money every time they "print" or "create" money(99% is never printed, just appears in bank account).
