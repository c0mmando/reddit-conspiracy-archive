        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a Ukrainian, and I never thought I would live to see the day when I say this- but the American government just passed a <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1677329/ukraine-lethal-aid-and-350-million-in-weapons-included-in-ukraine-freedom-support-act-russia-claims-blackmail/">law</a> authorizing it to give lethal aid to the government it itself installed in Ukraine in February to commit ethnic cleansing in Donbass and mass murder of internal dissidents opposed to its policies throughout Ukraine.</p>

<p>Primary source videos showing bloodthirsty brutality of the far-right US-installed Ukrainian regime:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlKacrqOmIw">[NSFL] Ukrainian army committing war crimes against civilians</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ozdz7fMdXI">[NSFL] Ethnic cleansing by Ukrainian army</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmkogdQAMvo">[NSFL] Peaceful left-wing protesters demonstrating against ethnic cleansin burned alive along with their families by Ukrainian government</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s kind of strange, because in the last five days of the bombing and shelling, we haven’t seen a single militia compound that has actually been hit. <strong>Every building that we’ve seen been hit by the Ukrainian mortars have been civilian buildings. We personally seen at least over 40 different civilian buildings bombed, that includes a school, an orphanage – we were in an orphanage the day before yesterday that was hit – and the very many large apartment buildings, like the very big apartment buildings have been hit</strong> . Some of the apartment buildings – it’s not like the Ukrainian army miss-aimed or something like this – the same buildings when they are bombed, they hit them very hard. We spoke to one woman who said that in the night a few days ago her apartment building was hit with ten different mortars.</p>

<p>V: Do you think they are targeting civilian buildings on purpose?</p>

<p>P: Well, if they are not targeting the civilian buildings, then I can’t see how incompetent someone can be as a military force or battalion. If they are not actually targeting the civilians…They are only hitting the civilians! Then it would be children playing with the mortars. I mean, children could possibly aim better than this, because they are not hitting any military buildings, <strong>they are just hitting the civilians.</strong></p>

<p>Even towns and cities that have no rebels in them whatsoever are hit by Ukrainian artillery, killing men, women, children, and the elderly indiscriminately- in a deliberate campaign of violent depopulation. In other words- ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk: &quot;<a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=fb1_1402843212">We must clean our lands from subhumans</a>&quot;</p>

<p>President Poroshenko: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHWHqj8g7Bk">&quot;Our children will go to school, their children will sit in basements. They are inferior- because of this we will win the war&quot;</a></p>

<p>Andrey Biletsky, founder of the People&#39;s Front (winner of 2014 parliamentary elections) and commander of the far-right Azov battallion:</p>

<p><strong>The historic mission of our Nation in this watershed century is to lead the White Races of the world in the final crusade for their survival: a crusade against semite-led subhumanity... The task of the present generation is to create a Third Empire -- Great Ukraine... If we are strong, we take what is ours by right and even more; we will build a Superpower-Empire...&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Right now in Ukraine, openly espousing leftist political views is literally a death sentence. Not just a death sentence, but a sentence to be brutally tortured before being murdered.</p>

<p>And this government is supplied with billions of dollars and heavy weaponry- including tanks, RPGs, and attack helicopters- by the United States!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve checked this quickly. Looks like a manipulation with partial pieces of videos/phrases/translations. I don&#39;t have time to review every link in here. But there are 2 I&#39;ve seen in UkrainianConflict sub</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the video with Poroshenko is a 20+ seconds cut from a 2-hours long speech. It&#39;s a part of the phrase that sounds warmongering while the full phrase is peaceful .
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2mdlk1/poroshenko_their_children_will_hole_up_in_the/cm385dx">https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2mdlk1/poroshenko_their_children_will_hole_up_in_the/cm385dx</a></p></li>
<li><p>The post about Yatsenuck mentioning &quot;subhumans&quot; is another manipulation. There is a Ukrainian word &quot;нелюд&quot; he used. The meaning might be easy to confuse, especially for a Russian-speaker. This word means literally &quot;person lacking any human compassion, very cruel person&quot;. There is absolutely no racist meaning in it. Opposite word for it is an adjective &quot;людяный&quot; (humane).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both &quot;proofs&quot; are clearly manipulations, most likely for propaganda purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no fucking context where saying &quot;our kids will go to school, their kids will sit in basements&quot; is &quot;peaceful&quot;. He is openly admitting that he is waging a tyrannical war of oppression against fucking civilians, asshole. Fuck you for defending a piece of shit who kills children and forces them to sit in fucking basements instead of going to school, you inhuman cunt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how semantics are you only counter-argument. Let&#39;s say the Yatsenyuk quote was indeed a mistranslation. What about the other videos, in which you can plainly see Ukrainian troops murdering innocent people in cold blood? I guess it&#39;s all an elaborate hoax- with the help of special KGB photoshop software- concocted by the diabolical Vladimir Putin himself. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kolomyski has used Privat&#39;s &quot;quasi-military forces&quot; to enforce hostile takeovers of companies, sending a team of &quot;hired rowdies armed with baseball bats, iron bars, gas and rubber bullet pistols and chainsaws&quot; to forcibly take over a Kremenchuk steel plant in 2006,[24] and has used &quot;a mix of phony court orders (often involving corrupt judges and/or registrars) and strong-arm tactics&quot; to replace directors on the boards of companies he purchases stakes in.[25] Kolomyski was criticized by Mr Justice Mann in a court case in London involving an attempted hostile takeover of an oil company, with the judge stating that Kolomyski had &quot;a reputation of having sought to take control of a company at gunpoint in Ukraine&quot; and that there were &quot;strong grounds for doubting the honesty of Mr Kolomoisky&quot;.[26]</p>
