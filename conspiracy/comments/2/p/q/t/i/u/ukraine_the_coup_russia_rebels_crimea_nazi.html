        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been collecting news for months now and decided to lay it out in chronological order for people who would like to know what&#39;s going on in Ukraine. 
I&#39;ve bolded the most interesting and important documentaries and news pieces.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The west and many opposition parties did not like Yanukovich since he was very pro-Russian. </p></li>
<li><p>These anti-Yanukovych people started &quot;maidan&quot; (a big demonstration on &quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot; - a large square in downtown Kiev). No matter that there was an election coming up soon...</p></li>
<li><p>Maidan was sponsored by the west since they wanted to put a pro-western person in power. First, a bunch of articles/videos on the reasons for it and the behind the scenes workings:</p></li>

<li><p>While Yanukovich was elected on a pro-Russia platform he was a flip-flopper and set Ukraine for the EU Association Agreement (even with the IMF strings attached). When he couldn&#39;t get what he wanted from the agreement (official position was &quot;maintain gas subsidies&quot;) he called Putin and asked for a bailout.</p></li>

<li><p>Maidan is composed of a lot of neo nazis and fascist types. Not that regular Ukrainian people weren&#39;t involved, they were at a later stage, but most of the violence and early groundwork was done by these western sponsored groups. </p></li>

<li><p>Jan 25 - Ukraine protesters attack building with police inside in Kyiv <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-protesters-attack-building-with-police-inside-in-kyiv-1.2510868">http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-protesters-attack-building-with-police-inside-in-kyiv-1.2510868</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 2 - Government building occupied by right sector. Police talk about how they were shot at, stabbed, molotovs thrown on them: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGosi48kD38">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGosi48kD38</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 19 - Maidan spreads all over Ukraine. Lviv: Maidaners burn down police station and get the police to give up their gear and leave. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8SeD2xHupA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8SeD2xHupA</a></p></li>
<li><p>The people in charge of maidan need things to go forward with the regime change. They need more ordinary Ukrainians by their side so they begin to agitate the riot police so that the riot police would get violent and start attacking protesters. </p></li>
<li><p>The Secret Agenda of Ashton and Nuland Revealed <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182601.html">http://www.voltairenet.org/article182601.html</a> It has become a ritual that works every time: whenever Washington engages in regime change, mysterious snipers turn out to kill both government forces and opposition protesters. Then they disappear and are in principle never found. That is the case today in Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela.</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 20 -  <strong>Maidan Massacre:</strong> <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bbc_1412640053">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bbc_1412640053</a></p></li>
<li><p>After maidaners start killing police, the police start shooting at the ones who have weapons. The bought and paid for media then portrays this as the Yanukovych government killing innocent civilians.</p></li>
<li><p>Provocateurs hired by the opposition attack maidaners to make it seem like the police is doing so in order to rile up the crowds and get people angry against the police.</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 20 - The shooters from Maidan are most likely a provocation: <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/05/busted-leaked-phone-tape-eus-ashton-reveals-kiev-snipers-hired-maidan-leaders/">http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/05/busted-leaked-phone-tape-eus-ashton-reveals-kiev-snipers-hired-maidan-leaders/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 20 - at 7 minutes 25 seconds, the reporters are being shot from a maidan controlled hotel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3R_BSz0Cc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3R_BSz0Cc</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 20 - Maidan what really happened: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tXYY23A_ZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tXYY23A_ZI</a></p></li>
<li><p>More Ukrainians get riled up and angry at the police and the Yanukovych government and more of them begin to support Maidan.</p></li>
<li><p>Maidaners start occupying government buildings, attacking police, throwing molotovs, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Feb 20ish - Kiev in chaos, more clashes, the center of the city burns, police are being shot by firearms and other weapons and are brutally beaten. Berkut tells of how they don&#39;t agree with this western sponsored coup. The police is there to protect their country, and refuse to put down their weapons (Note this small fact, because in Donetsk, the police and berkut DO put down their weapons and DO join the civilians). The perpetrators who shoot at police will not be tried, as the new government has given every one on maidan amnesty. So basically if you destroy the city and kill police, you are a patriot: <a href="http://youtu.be/BzlvPuBYDyM">http://youtu.be/BzlvPuBYDyM</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 21: Even though Yanukovich agreed with all the demands of the opposition, they didn&#39;t back down. Obviously their plan wasn&#39;t just to get what they want, but to create chaos, turmoil, and put in their own puppet: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26289318">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26289318</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The coup was unconstitutional:</strong> <a href="https://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/ukraines-just-coup/">https://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/ukraines-just-coup/</a> the vote to remove Yanukovych doesn’t seem to have followed constitutional procedures. Under Articles 108-112 of Ukraine’s constitution, there are four ways a sitting president may leave office between elections: resignation, incapacitation, death, and impeachment. None of the first three happened</p></li>
<li><p>Yanukovych gets scared and runs away to Russia. President has now been toppled.</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 21: Armed thugs take over government buildings in Chernygiv and Poltava. Attack police buildings in Vinnitsa trying to get weapons. Crimean self defence forces say that &quot;all you maidaners don&#39;t bother coming to ukraine as you will be detsroyed&quot; : <a href="http://youtu.be/12BqmEbuCLQ">http://youtu.be/12BqmEbuCLQ</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 24: Kharkov main government building blocked and blockaded by armed maidaners. thousands of civilians show up in Sevastopol in Crimea to defend their country against the coup and instability. Thousands march in Odessa chanting &quot;we won&#39;t give up Odessa&quot;: <a href="http://youtu.be/tLKEEumse1M">http://youtu.be/tLKEEumse1M</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 23: Berkut finds safety in Crimea. Crimea begins to form self defence forces against any right sector invaders so that it doesn&#39;t turn into another destruction filled Maidan like in Kiev. People are saying they don&#39;t agree with the coup. They don&#39;t like that masked armed men are causing destruction all over the country. <a href="http://youtu.be/pdHvRcPirnk">http://youtu.be/pdHvRcPirnk</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb 25: Ukraine minister disbands berkut police. They now go to Crimea because there they are wanted and welcomed. The berkut now comprise a civil defence force there. They now man checkpoints to prevent right sector and other provocateurs from getting into Crimea and causing the same damage they did in Kiev. Crimea is holding huge pro-Russian demonstrations. The Tatars are for the new Ukrainian government, the people in Crimea are against Ukraine and for Russia: <a href="http://youtu.be/AlM5k-Gw-XE">http://youtu.be/AlM5k-Gw-XE</a></p></li>
<li><p>Crimea: many people will say that Putin invaded Ukraine and &quot;took&quot; crimea. What they forget to mention is that Crimea was taken from Russia and given to Ukraine unlawfully during the Soviet Union in 1954: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea</a> Why is it that the illegal transfer in 1954 is seen by the world as legal, and this current one - voted on by the people is seen as illegal and an invasion?</p></li>
<li><p>Another thing people miss is that Crimea wanted to become autonomous in 1991:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991</a> In this 1991 Referendum, 94% of voters wanted to become independent from Ukraine. In 1992 Crimea wanted more independence. They wanted to hold a referendum about this, but Ukraine denied them this right. </p></li>
<li><p>Crimea again tried to hold an independence referendum in 1994, Ukraine declared it illegal, but they went ahead anyway. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_presidential_election,_1994">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_presidential_election,_1994</a> The results: The Crimea holds the referendum 1.3 million voted, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from Ukraine, 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship, and 77.9% favored giving Crimean presidential decrees the force of law. tl;dr; They wanted Ukraine to have as little effect on their lives as possible. They wanted to get out.  The first round of both Crimean and Ukrainian elections also take place. In the Crimea, the Rossiya bloc gets 67% of the vote. This means that 67% of the people voted for a very pro-Russian party. But in 1995, the Ukrainian government again denied them democracy by removing this very pro-Russian president of Crimea. Russia then said &quot;...the use of direct military force might be necessary to protect our compatriots abroad.&quot; : <a href="http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=36904">http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=36904</a> </p></li>
<li><p>So basically during those referendums Ukraine didn&#39;t let Crimea separate. So what Putin did was literally bring democracy to Crimea and let them vote to get the hell out of Ukraine. </p></li>
<li><p>People say that Putin invaded, the green men, but what they forget was that there already were already 16,000 Russian soldiers in Crimea. Who&#39;ve been there for 15 years. Many of them live there. How can they invade where they live? <a href="http://rt.com/news/russian-troops-crimea-ukraine-816/">http://rt.com/news/russian-troops-crimea-ukraine-816/</a> Obviously this doesn&#39;t justify an invasion or war, but they didn&#39;t invade anyone. They just walked out from their bases to help the Crimeans hold a referendum without any intrusions or provocations. They were a peacekeeping force. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overwhelming majorities of Crimeans say the March 16th referendum was free and fair</strong> (91%) and that the government in Kyiv ought to recognize the results of the vote (88%). <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/">http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/</a> and <a href="http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/05/12/pew-poll-crimeans-happy-with-annexation-by-russia-believe-referendum-was-free-and-fair/">http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/05/12/pew-poll-crimeans-happy-with-annexation-by-russia-believe-referendum-was-free-and-fair/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feb/March: The &quot;terrifying&quot; invasion by Russian soldiers in pictures: <a href="http://youtu.be/FVSBGXAbh3s">http://youtu.be/FVSBGXAbh3s</a></p></li>
<li><p>More invasion by Russia. Notice the civilians friendly reaction to Russian soldiers compared to what happens in Donetsk when Ukrainian soldiers invade. There is no blood shed, no shooting, the civilians don&#39;t put up barricades or tell them to get out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCfEWvih7ic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCfEWvih7ic</a> </p></li>
<li><p>This gives fuel to the Ukrainians and the Western propaganda machine starts:  PUTIN HAS INVADED!!!  &quot;Russia is at war with Ukraine!&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The east of the country: Donetsk and Luhansk regions just like Crimea are very pro-russia. Many people there consider themselves Russians. They obviously don&#39;t agree with this toppling of a democratically elected president, They themselves started their own demonstrations against the Kiev maidan and then against this new pro-western anti-russian leader who toppled a president they voted for. What the people in the east want is a referendum, they want to be heard. They want democracy. They didn&#39;t vote for this new government.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Ukrainian, it&#39;s a huge relief to see people from the West who remember Iraq, who don&#39;t trust their media, and who know the truth about what&#39;s going on in Ukraine. I urge you to expose the truth to people in real life as well as the Internet. Because this isn&#39;t just about Ukraine- as horrible as it is, I really believe that this is a precursor to an actual WW3 against Russia.</p>

<p>Here are some more videos about the subject:</p>

<li><p>The new people in power in Ukraines government send in fascist &quot;right sector&quot; thugs to do their bidding,  to try  disrupt these new pro-Russian movements and demonstrations starting up in the east of the country.

<li><p>Feb - Kharkov: right sector Maidaners bussed in from Kiev came to terrorize city. Destroyed oplot building (local fight club) and stole their cash. Police stood around and did nothing: <a href="http://youtu.be/BkmjN6SRfyc">http://youtu.be/BkmjN6SRfyc</a></p></li>

Notice how the civilians don&#39;t attack police. They then fly the Russian flag. <a href="http://youtu.be/VVJD6HMzNDM">http://youtu.be/VVJD6HMzNDM</a> Again ask yourself, who are the terrorists? The right sector thugs or the civilians? The Western media currently calls the civilians the terrorists. Another video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa63IjsaWIk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa63IjsaWIk</a> This could be a provocation by the new Ukrainian government.

Kiev sends in Spetsnaz (SWAT) to free the city, but even they refuse to lift a finger against their own people. I guess all these people are terrorists for refusing to follow an unelected president.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Part 3:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>April 24 - Where do the rebels get all their weapons? The west says Russia. The truth is that Donetsk has &quot;the largest weapons cache in Eastern Europe&quot; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/protesters-ukraine-weapons-cache-mine">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/protesters-ukraine-weapons-cache-mine</a></p></li>
<li><p>April 27 - Kharkov Pro Ukrainian football thugs terrorize the the city, attack people who have Russian flags, Georgiev ribbons and who dare stand up to Ukraine. Attack police: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfA0S93Gh6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfA0S93Gh6U</a></p></li>
<li><p>May 2 - The skinheads and fascist anti-Russian people then  burn people alive in Odessa. The whole Odessa massacre was basically a false flag provocation. The right sector/new Ukrainian government made it look like pro-Russian people caused violence, when it was the pro-Ukrainian neo nazis and fascists that did so:</p></li>
<li><p>Odessa Massacre was caused by a provocation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRxdF3xp-U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRxdF3xp-U</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Odessa Massacre - What REALLY Happened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dJRnI-X8Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dJRnI-X8Q</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent report on massacre in Odessa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yflMScowPfk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yflMScowPfk</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>New Ukrainian government agent committing atrocities against pro-Russians in Odessa: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAGcV6_o1w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAGcV6_o1w</a></p></li>
<li><p>The neo nazis even beat up firefighters so they couldn&#39;t go and put out the fire: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMGPt2YMtU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMGPt2YMtU</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Lets recap the story up until now. The people in the east, very pro-Russian people see their elected president get toppled by armed right sector fascist thugs and the capital of their country destroyed. These fascist thugs then begin terrorizing the rest of the country. The Russian people are obviously upset and refuse to accept their new unelected government, so they begin to take the law into their own hands. They ask for a referendum since they want to vote on removing themselves from this new government that does not represent them. They arm themselves and begin defending their cities from rogue right sector maidaners who roam around destroying everything. The new ukrainian government obviously upset that people dare question them sends in the army to go kill these civilians. </p></li>
<li><p>So who is the terrorist? Everyone so far on the pro-Ukrainian side has been violent and destructive. The pro-Russian people have been peacefully protesting. Even the police have joined them. Who are the bad guys? The people who removed from power an elected president, storm government buildings, attack anyone who disagrees with them, burn people alive, perform attacks in other cities against government officials, government buildings and police, or the civilians who don&#39;t want this destruction?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the beginning of the official Ukrainian army attack on the east of the country:</p>

There definitely are soldiers terrorizing the population, but it&#39;s not Russian ones. It&#39;s the Ukrainian ones sent in to &quot;protect&quot; them.)</p></li>
<li><p>May  <strong>Large compilation of videos of the new Ukraine government killing civillians:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3MOEC5wL7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3MOEC5wL7U</a></p></li>
<li><p>May 9 long video of ukraine soldiers storming and burning police station then arresting people.

<blockquote>
<p>The shelling of Donetsk continued. The SMM visited two high-rise residential buildings and a local hospital in the city centre, showing damage consistent with the use of artillery projectiles; and saw traumatised and crying civilians and medical staff (see SMM Report evening of 7 August). The scene was photographed by SMM. The team later saw the corpse of a middle-aged man in the city’s morgue, with trauma injuries to the upper chest consistent with those earlier described by a doctor at the scene.</p>

<li><p><strong>Where do the rebels get their weapons?</strong> The west says it all comes from Russia. But the truth is that after the collapse of the USSR millions of guns, mines, artillery shells were left all over the country. The east of the country has the biggest weapons cache in all of Eastern Europe! (Regarding weapons caches:) Soviet style was to have something much more discreet in an out-of-the-way place and rely more on silence to secure it (an old mine, of which there are many in the Donbass, would be ideal). Given that the USSR military headquarters was in Moscow, it is quite possible that the Kiev government doesn’t even know where many of these dumps are. One service that Moscow could be providing is to tell the rebels where to look. : <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/protesters-ukraine-weapons-cache-mine">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/24/protesters-ukraine-weapons-cache-mine</a> and <a href="http://russia-insider.com/en/military_politics_ukraine/2014/11/07/01-17-22pm/where_rebels_find_their_weaponry">http://russia-insider.com/en/military_politics_ukraine/2014/11/07/01-17-22pm/where_rebels_find_their_weaponry</a> </p></li>

<p>While Yanukovich was elected on a pro-Russia platform he was a <strong>flip-flopper</strong> and set Ukraine for the EU Association Agreement (even with the IMF strings attached). When he couldn&#39;t get what he wanted from the agreement (official position was &quot;maintain gas subsidies&quot;) he called Putin and asked for a bailout. </p>

<p>And this set escalated the crisis immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Future EU integration was a political platform for all Ukrainian politicians. Everyone was pro-EU by words. But in reality everyone (politicians) understand that there was no any prerequisites. So Yanukovich was actually one who was forced to sign agreements he didn&#39;t want to sign. Whatever with him or without him it&#39;s not a deal for next 5-10-20 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine, that you live in eastern (much wealthier with better economy than the western one) Ukraine. One day, bunch of hooligans out of nowhere overthrow the <strong>democraticely chosen</strong> government and claim, that they&#39;re in power now.

<p>At the same time, one of the most powerful countries with very stable government and economy offers you their protection, if you join them.</p>

<p>What do you choose? Who&#39;s the real invader?</p>

<p>Also remember, that Ukraine is pretty new country, in history they always were part of the other countries. So those people might not have that strong the sense of patriotism and connections to the &quot;Ukraine&quot;. But I might be wrong about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, this theory is very possible. The funniest part is that today people act, like Russia invaded Ukraine out of nowhere. They already forgot, what happened before it. Russia didn&#39;t make the first move, they <strong>reacted</strong>. </p>

<p>People blame Putin for putting Russia in terrible economic situation. But the western bankers (bankers, corporation or Idk who), wanted to gain the power right under Russia nose. At that point Putin had a choice:<br/>
1) Do nothing, show that the west can do whatever they want and Russia is too weak to say a word about it.<br/>
2) React, show that Russia is still a force to be reckon with.</p>

<p>He chose 2), it&#39;s really bad for Russian economy right now, but may be very beneficial in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. It really opened up my mind because I never paid attention to worldly matters and I should have! </p>

<p>After I saw the video of the fucked up things Ukrainian army is doing to the civilians, I couldn&#39;t stomach it - I&#39;ve been ignorant all this time(thanks to the tampered media). Something needs to be done here in the west, not by the government, but by the people. They need to stop supporting the US government if they really are behind this shit that&#39;s happening in Ukraine. </p>

<p>So many people are dying and if nothing is done, Ukraine will be ruined. It would be just like the Middle East - we haven&#39;t learned anything.</p>
