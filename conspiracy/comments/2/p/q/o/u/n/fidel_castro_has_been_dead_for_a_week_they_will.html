       Why do I say this? Because we are opening up relations with Cuba, and one of the first things that is going to happen is they are getting a shiny new bank run by everybody's favorite banking family. As soon as the ink is dry on the illegal charter for their new central bank, they will tell us that Fidel passed away in his sleep from a heart attack or some other natural cause.

       This site keeps a tally of who doesn't have a Rothschild Central Bank... The only two left on the list are North Korea and Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current fiasco with "The Interview" is signaling that we will soon be returning to North Korea to install another bank. 
North Korean hackers didn't hack Sony... It was the NSA. This is a big false flag to go back to war with them. When we do go to war with North Korea, Iran will be marked as one of their allies and we'll fight a war on two fronts.

       There is not one single country with a central bank run by the Rothschilds. Not one. If you disagree, post some evidence instead of downvoting. I've been asking for years now and nobody has ever given any evidence for even one country.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, there are some people who believe that not only are some central banks controlled by the Rothschild, but that almost all of them are. How do you get from zero to 170 or so, without any evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does
       <em>
        anybody
       </em>
       believe this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some reasons people have given:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I've read it lots of times on the Internet, so it must be true.
       </li>
       <li>
        It sounds like something the Rothschilds would do.
       </li>
       <li>
        Because you can't find evidence about it, they must be so powerful to suppress it. Therefore, anything that's said about them must be true.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Bank for International Settlements.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The last one might be a reason if (1) the Rothschilds controlled the BIS, (2) the BIS controlled the member central banks, and (3) most central banks were members of the BIS. But (1) no, (2) no, and (3) no, only 1/3 of central banks are members.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what am I missing? Can somebody who believes this explain why?

       " J. W. McCallister, an oil industry insider with House of Saud connections, wrote in The Grim Reaper that information he acquired from Saudi bankers cited 80% ownership of the New York Federal Reserve Bank- by far the most powerful Fed branch- by just eight families, four of which reside in the US. They are the Goldman Sachs, Rockefellers, Lehmans and Kuhn Loebs of New York; the Rothschilds of Paris and London; the Warburgs of Hamburg; the Lazards of Paris; and the Israel Moses Seifs of Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       CPA Thomas D. Schauf corroborates McCallisterâ€™s claims, adding that ten banks control all twelve Federal Reserve Bank branches. He names N.M. Rothschild of London, Rothschild Bank of Berlin, Warburg Bank of Hamburg, Warburg Bank of Amsterdam, Lehman Brothers of New York, Lazard Brothers of Paris, Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York, Israel Moses Seif Bank of Italy, Goldman Sachs of New York and JP Morgan Chase Bank of New York. Schauf lists William Rockefeller, Paul Warburg, Jacob Schiff and James Stillman as individuals who own large shares of the Fed. [3] The Schiffs are insiders at Kuhn Loeb. The Stillmans are Citigroup insiders, who married into the Rockefeller clan at the turn of the century."

       You have prompted me to search for the source of this. It turns out that Schauf is just citing the same source, so he isn't corroborating it, just repeating it. And, it turns out the name is R.E. McMaster, not J. W. McCallister.

       In testimony to an Idaho Senate committee in 1983, author Archibald
Roberts says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now to identify the real owners of the Federal Reserve which is your question sir, . . . Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote from sources from Switzerland and Saudi Arabia who were queried on the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman and sir, we do not mean the managers of the twelve Federal Reserve banks who merely run the banks for the owners, the real owners. Nor do we mean the members of the Federal Reserve Board who merely make decisions in line and in consonance with the directions they receive from the real owners of the Federal Reserve. We certainly don't mean those who sit on the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve which we mentioned earlier in this presentation. We mean the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman, this has been the best kept secret of this century. And it is the best kept secret because of a proviso on passage of the Federal Reserve Act. It was agreed that no information would be released on the Class A stockholders of the Federal Reserve. But, a Mr. R.E. McMaster, publisher of a newsletter, The Reaper, asked his Swiss and Saudi Arabian contacts which banks hold controlling interest in the Federal Reserve System. This was the answer received, and I quote, "Owner number one, Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin; Owner number two, Lazard Brothers Banks of Paris; Owner number three, Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy; Owner number four, Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam; Owner number five, Lehman Brothers Bank of New York; Owner number six, Kuhn, Loeb Bank of New York; Owner number seven. Chase Manhattan Bank of New York." Mr. Chairman, it is the Chase Manhattan Bank which controls all of the other eleven Federal Reserve Banks. Finally, "Owner number eight, Goldman, Sachs Bank of New York."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, it's from anonymous foreign sources and we're given no information on who they are and how they know this and why we should assume they're telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't matter because this information is
       <em>
        provably wrong
       </em>
       .
And provably wrong in
       <em>
        two different ways
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock is not secret at all.
There are no individuals or families who own stock. The stock of each of
the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks is owned by all the member banks
in that district. (There are more than 1,900 Federal Reserve member
banks in the country.) There's a formula that tells each member bank how
much stock it must own based on the bank's balance sheet. The stock
cannot be traded. No matter how many shares it owns, each member bank
gets two votes for directors of the regional FRB. The small banks in
each region pick two directors, the medium-size banks pick two and the
large banks pick two. Three directors are chosen by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board of Governors is a
federal agency). So, even if all the big banks in a district colluded,
they could pick only 2 out of 9 directors. And that would be in just one
out of the twelve districts.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) The list is bogus. The Rothschild Bank of
       <em>
        Berlin
       </em>
       ?
       <em>
        Berlin
       </em>
       ? The Rothschilds
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/25/business/company-news-german-return-for-rothschilds.html">
        left Germany in 1901
       </a>
       ,
before the Federal Reserve was founded, and didn't open a new office in
Germany until 1988, after this testimony. And, when they were in
Germany, they were based in Frankfurt. There never was a Rothschild Bank
of Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy"? Who? Nobody has heard
of him. There was an
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sieff,_Baron_Sieff">
        Israel Moses
Sieff
       </a>
       who was
a British businessman (Marks &amp; Spencer department store), but no one
knows about an Italian banker named Israel Moses Seif.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever put this list together did not have special knowledge of banks.
They didn't even know that the Rothschilds hadn't been in Germany for
decades and they didn't know how the Federal Reserve is really
organized.

       oh you think they only own the banks. what about the media that suppresses information?
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, did you know (according to an ex IDF solider) that no information leaves the country without first being approved by federal officials?

       "There is no future" Strange..ive had that feeling for a long time. I feel like theres a big difference between lets say..1998 and 1983 in regards to culture and technology..now a days, I feel like 2014 was not much different than 2003.

       what?

       First of all the quote above makes a reference to the bible, already there should you consider the post a troll.

      <p>
       And as far as the statement you make about 2003-2014. Technology has grown exponentially and continues to accelerate. Culture as well is drastically changing to a more multicultural and atheistic one, generally speaking. Partially due to the technological advances allowing more people access to information. Hence, u see an uprising of extremists trying to hold on to the past and regain control of people/countries
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "world order conspiracies", it makes zero sense, bc people still die. What would be the point of "grabbing" power against the worlds best interest when those who supposedly are doing it are dead within 20-40years at best.. The day it becomes a real threat is when medical science has evolved enough to sustain very long lifespan/immortality.

       and we aren't already really close to that? We can discovered aging on DNA and how to reverse it in animals. Its not hard to believe that we have more medicine and techniques out there that will never see the light of day because of the loss of profit.

       it can not be done today, guaranteed. Look at the state of the art research on it, its at the beginning level. to "cure" all organs from aging basically requires technology that is today sci-fiction and before we are able to there are thousands of other incredible achievements that will happen on that road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit, no one has been able to reverse aging in animals. and even so, its not the same as "curing" death.

       And there are obv thousands of incredible meds that will never see the day bc of profit. "Why give people a cure when you can treat them for a fortune"

       Are you high, the world in the past decade has changed FAR MORE than the previous decades combined. Here in the UK in 2003 it was only just becoming common for most households to have satellite tv and low quality broadband. Every house now has superfast internet, PVR's with thousand channels, mobile phones that are faster than gaming computers in 2003, watches that can track information about you. The internet is the new shopping centre, all businesses have been drastically changed to the point that alot of shops which in 2003 had barely changed sinceits inception to now where you have ipads in stores to buy items, self service checkouts, ways to buy your shopping online and pick it up within an hour or get it delivered to you at any chosen time slot. The ability to fundraise millions in a day online, kickstart companies. The healthcare industry has changed rapidly and with increasing computer power we are able to solve complex problems/disease increasingly faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be a recluse if you think the world hasnt changed in the past 10 years because its the most drastic shift since the introduction of electricity to the masses. The last 10 years of technological change has been fucking mindblowing and to think otherwise shows that you must be an archetypal conspiracy nut who lets anything fit into what they want to believe.

       Ask yourself why Fidel Castro even matters alive or dead if a banking coup is in the offing. Fidel is 88 years old and has been in failing health and out of the public eye since 2006-2008. Whether he exists somewhere in a semi-vegetative state or has finally quit breathing would not seem terribly relevant to current foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly, there are lots of capital interests that see Cuba as a basket of ripe fruit for plundering, but Fidel Castro hasn't really stood in the way of that for a couple decades. Perhaps more to the point is that the Cuban economy has been so completely wrecked for so long that there simply won't be a lot of buying power there for generations.

       Fidel isn't even in office. He's been out of office since 2006. When you come here to post your theories can you at least do basic research it really makes the rest of us look bad when you post crap that a five second google search or just reading the news can debunk.

          Passed House
DEC 11, 2014

       Edit: check out the speed of with which it made it to the POTUS's desk.... 6 days.  It toom 6 days to get it through the senate &amp; congress, with little to no coverage until 3days ago.

       It was pretty widely reported when Raul took over as president that he was more democratic than his brother. And it was only a matter of time for the gubmnt over here to decide that this Cuba beef was a ridiculous waste of time and energy. So as far as this US/Cuba beef squashing goes it's pretty simple; the US doesn't really care and Raul Castro likes money. Fidel's not dead, he's on a ventilator somewhere not giving a fuck, mostly because he's incoherent.

       Maybe you are right about Castro, haven't heard about him in a long time. As for "central banking", firstly Cuba still needs to undergo massive economic and social changes, Raul has been implementing them, but at a very slow pace. The embargo's end will obviously lift Cuba from its moribund stage, and even be welcomed by Venezuela, on the border of an economic crisis and unable to sustain anymore its BFF.
      </p>

       As for The Interview, this has nothing to do with geopolitics. Its just some hacker group that tried to blackmail Sony, failed, and now decided to "strike back" while diverting attention to N.Korea. I wouldn't be surprised if ex/current Sony employees were also involved..

       Hacking a private corporation is hardly a good excuse for a war. If they wanted a cyber attack to justify war, then surely an attack on government or military or infrastructure would work.

       ITM, it has been suggested that Sony was an inside job. Thousands were laid off from Sony's digital department in the last year, maybe some of those people has a bad taste in their mouth for their former employer. No Agenda Show has more on this.

       After the twitter and social engineering attempted coup by the US in Cuba I think this is just putting more pressure on Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government in Cuba refuses to allow the US to sink their claws into Cuba they people will get out raged because their rights are being taken away/social liberties and economic prosperity guys!
      </p>
      <p>
       While Russia has tried to increase relations with Cuba over the last couple of years and recently got rid of Cuba's old debt to the soviet union. Then suddenly America tries to get friendly with Cuba for no good reason. Why now? Why not 6 years ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all in attempt to get to Iran and NK as they are the only 2 places left who have the balls to stand up to the US government.

       First of all the quote above makes a reference to the bible, already there should you consider the post a troll.

       And as far as the statement you make about 2003-2014. Technology has grown exponentially and continues to accelerate. Culture as well is drastically changing to a more multicultural and atheistic one, generally speaking. Partially due to the technological advances allowing more people access to information. Hence, u see an uprising of extremists trying to hold on to the past and regain control of people/countries

       As for the "world order conspiracies", it makes zero sense, bc people still die. What would be the point of "grabbing" power against the worlds best interest when those who supposedly are doing it are dead within 20-40years at best.. The day it becomes a real threat is when medical science has evolved enough to sustain very long lifespan/immortality.

       it can not be done today, guaranteed. Look at the state of the art research on it, its at the beginning level. to "cure" all organs from aging basically requires technology that is today sci-fiction and before we are able to there are thousands of other incredible achievements that will happen on that road.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit, no one has been able to reverse aging in animals. and even so, its not the same as "curing" death.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are obv thousands of incredible meds that will never see the day bc of profit. "Why give people a cure when you can treat them for a fortune"
