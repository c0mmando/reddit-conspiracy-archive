       My point was that a lot of people take their opinions from the TV.  If CNN told them to be outraged and take to the streets, they would likely do it.

       People probably think you were trolling or trying to disrupt.  It's hard to tell intent from 3 words, but some probably saw it as a "u mad bro?"
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, I am mad.  The more important question is are you mad enough to risk your home, family, job, or your life?  I cannot say that I am there yet.  I think most people who can read the writing in the wall are stuck in a difficult place.  We are told that half the country doesn't care about torture, and judging by the attitudes expressed in reddit, it's probably true.  We watch the encroaching police state while most people respond with "hurrdurr tin foil hattery".  Eventually the reality of the situation will be obvious, right about the time you can't get a pizza delivered.....

       It's hard to say.  If you believe the media then those who don't support torture are in the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you combine the people who don't care with the people who support it, they're certainly the majority.  Then again, it could all just be a media campaign to sway public opinion.  It's hard to believe anything these days....

       While I don't participate in Facebook, I'm also not worried about voicing my opinion online.  I was probably already on a list for buying subversive literature online.  I figure, if the government is going to round up dissidents, then I'm getting rounded up regardless, so why censor myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I can certainly appreciate your financial woes, the real issue goes much deeper than that.

       Might be a case against majority rule, but this is what you get in a democracy.  Gang rape is democracy in action.  9 out of 10 voted for it.

       Oh, it works. What's been done to us was done in secrecy. We are currently in the process of correction. What other country would admit it's mistakes and have it's leaders lampooned by TV pundits? The American people will forgive the treachery as all good Christians do. At the same time we will point to the second amendment. It's a beautiful thing to see.

       United States are not a democracy - and have not been designed to be one by the founding fathers, either. Democracy is mob rule with old money sitting behind. The Republic designed for USA was with best intentions to never, ever have a democracy (mob rule).

       Funny thing is that citizens have known for a long time that America was broken. However, they'd never admit it publicly because America is all about competition. Everything is a competition, and to announce that America is broken would be akin to career- and social-suicide.

       Dude, I listened from 10 to 14, but I'm not listening to an hour of that.  I wouldn't be surprised if some MSM outlets and journalists let officials off the hook with easy soft ball questions, but I haven't heard any journalists actually defend the torture and you've failed to provide any examples of that.

       Don't give me that bs, man.  Provide proof to your claim!  Asking me to listen to an hour long podcast is not providing proof.  Earlier you said listen from 10 minutes to 14 minutes, but nowhere in that time period did Tapper defend torture.  Give me a quote, a name, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I know the media works to propagate a pro government narrative most of the time, but journalists framing the debate on whether torture worked or not isn't the same thing as
       <em>
        defending
       </em>
       it.  I haven't seen or hear or read any journalists outright defend torture as you so claim.

       PBS: Shields and Brooks on CIA interrogation:  Brooks says the whole country was involved in torture and is now rediscovering its moral center and no-one should be prosecuted as they were in difficult jobs and the decisions were political ones.

       Thank you.  This is what I'm taking about.  I still don't think it proves Shields, Brooks, Woodruff or PBS are defending torture though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Shields and Brooks acknowledge that "torture" is the word for it, not Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (ETI) and condemn the act as deplorable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brooks even points out how complicit congress and the White House were in signing off on those torture practices, and even mentioned how often the US kills people with drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with Shields that "this is not who we are" when history would clearly prove otherwise and I certainly don't agree with Brooks' caveat at the end that "those moral calculus should not be legalized except for in extreme cases."  However, I do not think this example proves journalists are defending the act of torture.
