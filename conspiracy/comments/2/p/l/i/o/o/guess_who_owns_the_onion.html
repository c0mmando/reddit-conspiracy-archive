       I've generally enjoyed The Onion over the years but recently it's become a bit crass even for my own taste.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did some searching around this morning after I saw this abhorrent excuse for satire posted in our fanclub. The article is essentially an outright hit piece on the 9/11 truth movement. Yes, I realize it's a "joke" and some people are easy targets for laughs. However, this particular piece doesn't even bother with comedic niceties, it goes straight for the throat. People are welcome to their satire, but denying the truth about 9/11 is plain and simple status quo mentality. It isn't edgy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/911-truther-vows-not-to-rest-until-everyone-knows,35319/?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=LinkPreview:N">
        Here is the article in question
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick search of
       <a href="http://www.theonion.com/search/?q=9%2F11">
        9/11 on The Onion
       </a>
       revealed that there have been dozens of 9/11 related "jokes" on the site. The jokes are becoming more and more brazen every year and many of them seem to disparage the conspiracy crowd outright and reinforce, albeit through comedy, that the official narrative stands as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A little bit of sleuthing lead me to discover that The Onion was in fact
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0131/071.html">
        sold by it's original Madison, Wisconsin owners to new owners in New York back in...wait for it... 2001.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The new owner of The Onion is New York money manager David Schafer and his cohorts.

       This article is pretty spot on. Those that begin to go "down the rabbit hole" seem panicked that no one else understands these things. With the new-found "truth" (new conspiracy-interested people are the most gullible), they go around to their friends and spouses trying to convince them on the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, by this point most theorists are so wound up and expecting imminent doom (since you see, none of this 'doom' was around when I was 'asleep'), that they don't have the patience or tact necessary to convince people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The onion, seeing this trend, simply lampoons it like the Onion does. This does not support the status quo (at least not in a rothschild top-down kind of way) and the Onion has taken conspiracy-minded articles from the other side many many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "we" are getting butthurt, its because we are acting like ass holes to others when sharing information. Turns out, challenging people's perspectives is a skill, just like debating and convincing others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out most theorists spend their time on the internet researching theories instead of learning how to interact meaningfully with others. I was once one of these people as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I keep my fucking mouth shut until I'm fairly comfortable and have enough evidence to begin saying things, and then ask questions to my peers challenging their assumptions. When they run out of info, I simply provide more info from my side of the table. Keep doing this tactfully long enough, and you begin to shift their perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, theorists do what is said in the article all the time, and I myself am guilty of it. Nothing to see here, move along, stop getting butt hurt and find more effective ways of spreading questions/knowledge/perspectives.

       Kind of reminds me about what Penn from P&amp;T says about christians who prostheletize.
      </p>
      <p>
       They honestly believe that you are going to spend an eternity in hell, do you really blame them for trying to help you? They'd do the same if they saw you walking down the train tracks and a train was coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same with conspiracy theory. If you really believe that a criminal entity controls vital parts of your government, isn't it your duty to spread the word and try to make people aware?

       yeah , but i get the point that a lot of conspiracy enthusiasts have the same lack of understanding of conversational context i.e linking every conversation to conspiracies because they have some inside knowledge or think they do.  Also they can be just as annoying as the vitriolic christian. I know , Ive been the guy who talks about consiracies too much at parties haha

       If you're a 9/11 truther, and this article offends you enough to post it on /conspiracy, you're gonna have a bad time. Shit like this doesn't bother me, because I know one day all those who look down on truthers with smug condescension are going to have to eat crow, and my god it's going to be satisfying.

       It is satisfying to an extent.  My friends and family used to think I was fucking nuts many years ago when I used to tell them about the digital all-seeing eye, spying programs, etc..  I say it's "satisfying to an extent" because I kind of wish I was wrong but it is what it is.

       I'm fine with ribbing on opinions and generally feel like the onion is good at attacking things from both sides.  What pissed me off was when it seemed like they were making a concerted effort to goad war in syria.

       I thought it was pretty funny, actually.  It was absolutely hyperbolic in it's visceral and vicious attack on the guy.  It doesn't say that he's wrong or that his opinion is bad, it just personally attacks him.

       I thought this was more a comment on how come people react to conspiracy theorists than a put down on conspiracy theorists.  Look at the anger represented in the angry subs when it comes to conspiracy theories.  I've experienced that in real life when bringing up a basic question about an event.

       Sometimes its relevant though.  I'm in Odessa and yesterday I was speaking to an old man who is pushing astrology while showing me his Internet wife prospects and the subject came up about politics of Russia and Ukraine.  In this moment it was relevant to mention that a group of atheistic Jews seized control of Russia back in the Bolshevik days and that Russia was a major victim of this as well as Ukraine.  It does come up but in the meantime its best not to be just working that non-stop.  Especially when it comes to women that I want to sleep with it is best to really not say too much.  Usually speaking about intellectual topics will end up alienating them and what they really want is relationship oriented talk.

       Conflating Jewish people with Israelis with Mossad with a particular speculation about a particular group in in Mossad is anti semitic bullshit.

       I believe in shadowy jewish banking families trying to control events. I know at least to some extent how bad Mossad and IDF can be.

       I don't talk about the Jews as a euphemism for those powerful institutions though. It's lame it's like substituting white people or americans for the CIA or the Koch Brothers.

       I disagree. It's not irrelevant that they are jewish. In the same way I wouldn't take the religious moniker out of christian fundamentalists or islamic extremists. What I didnt do is talk about Jewish people as though they are the Borg. Jewish people do not have a hive mind.
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       do not do anything,
       <em>
        they

       are not behind anything and when people talk about "The jews not doing themselves any favours". It is either consciously or unconsciously racist. Yes I know Jews/Muslims/"Other
       <em>
        They

       outgroup" are not a race. It's still fucking racist.

       It isn't funny unless you lower your standard for comedy to blatant insults. It doesn't even have a Onion-esque twist. It's just a laundry list of derogatory remarks hurled at a particular group of people.

       Nah it's a way of making fun of radicals. I know radicals of all type, some are 9/11 truthers, some are atheists, some are crossfit or paleo nuts. The one thing that they have in common is that in the quest to spread their shit like evangelists, they just make everyone think that they are annoying as fuck.

       There's a difference between being annoying and being an asshole. The former occurs through a lack of awareness and social skills, the latter is deliberate malicious intent. The article is suggesting 9/11 Truthers are so in love with promoting their theories that they don't care who they hurt in the process of evangelizing it. To question 9/11 makes you an "asshole" and an "absolute prick" because, you know, 3,000 innocent people died that day so

       Yeah and I'm saying that I've had some coworkers who were absolutely obsessed with their paleo diets and crossfit exercise and it made them annoying as fuck and intolerable to be around. Some people on this forum act in similar ways about 9/11 or Jews or feminism or black people, just nonstop finding ways to butt that shit into every conversation to the point where they aren't helping their cause.

       I don't have anything nefarious to report, except to say that there is probably a reason the monied elite of New York would seek to marginalize a new investigation into the events of 9/11.

       This is also true of popular comedy website Cracked, one that I've been reading for years. I've noticed over the past 12 months or so a major increase in joke material regarding the Truth movement and making fun of conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I think it's becoming a "thing" now to make fun of conspiracies. It's a modern punch line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only hoping that at least it gets people curious and puts the ideas in their heads, even though they are exposed to it through satire.

       You do know that it is satire? Cheney didn't actually say any of this.

       But that fact that someone thinks it's funny to allude to the idea that Cheney treats the tragedy of 9/11 like celebrating Christmas, speaks volumes about the political motivations of The Onion.

       There's a difference between being annoying and being an asshole. The former occurs through a lack of awareness and social skills, the latter is deliberate malicious intent. The article is suggesting 9/11 Truthers are so in love with promoting their theories that they don't care who they hurt in the process of evangelizing it. To question 9/11 makes you an "asshole" and an "absolute prick" because, you know, 3,000 innocent people died that day so

       That article's fucked and if that's the level of "humor" of The Onion these days they can fuck right off for starters.

       I'm intrigued at what a walking contradiction you appear to be. No one in here seems more "offended" by this post than you.
