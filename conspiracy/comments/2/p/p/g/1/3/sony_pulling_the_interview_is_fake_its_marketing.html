       Do people not understand how tied together Hollywood and the government are? Are people this fucking big of goons that they actually think a movie about killing the North Korean dictator wasn't a movie funded by our government.

      <p>
       I'm in shock on how little people know how Hollywood and our government operates.

       CIA tortures....Movie Leak...pull movie. Oh no one gives a fuck about the tortures anymore. News covers the big story, everyone forgets our government is doing super shady shit.

       Nonsense - the CIA isn't worried at all about the torture report.  These are people who drugged and raped men for decades, engaged in torture experiments in conjunction with dozens of major academic institutions in the United States, have abandoned uprisings they instigated, and experimented on and tortured people for decades without any consequence.  The CIA has nothing to worry about at all.

       The CIA has been getting away with atrocities for decades - except now its more front and center than they like. In the past it was only 'conspiracy nuts' that believed the CIA tortured and conducted human experiments, now it's out in the open and they need a distraction from their friends in Hollywood... I think OP is right on the money.

       Get real. Ask your neighbor/parent/buddy if he/she ever heard of MKULTRA - most people don't have a clue. Plus most of MKULTRA will never be known as much of the evidence was destroyed. It was never publicized like the 9/11 torture and Abu Grab fiascos.

       Well, yes, I suppose it was more buried than the internet allows.  But, then again, the government was torturing and experimenting on U.S. citizens which is less likely to annoy the left wing than torturing Salafists.

       This is one of the biggest misunderstandings about how information control works.  People think it works like 1984 where the government deletes events/movies/info from history.  It doesn't.  People would notice, and get angry(since we supposedly live in a free society).  It is a lot more effective to simply limit the audience that views the "material", and to discredit the information(or person providing the information).  If only 1 million people know about MK ultra for instance, and 200,000 of those people think it's not that important because of disinformation, it is a controllable problem.  If you try to hide MK ultra from the people, and they find out, they immediately know it is important, and that the Gov't is blatantly lying(even the sheep would see it).  That's why it is obvious this is not really motivated by N.K.'s desires(which we could give two shits about).  Do you know how many movies with Russian Presidents getting killed(or portraying the Russians as bad) there were from the start of the cold war to the present?  If we were not threatened by a nuclear armed soviet union, I don't see how we could be threatened by a poor, non-nuclear N.K. that can barley launch a successful missile.  There are obviously exceptions to the rule, with information that would be so volatile even in the hands of few, that it cannot be afforded to be released(JFK, 911, UFOS).  But 95% of information is out there, somewhere, although repressed, and hidden from plain sight(can't have every bumbling idiot  accidentally discovering the secrets of the elite) .

       As a 7th grader in the 90s, I wrote my first research paper on MKULTRA and COINTELPRO after learning about them from books at the local library.

       agree, you'll find books about this stuff. but all that was before social media. disseminating information has never been faster/more effective. that's why distraction/disinformation is the name of the game these days.

       I think since they keep saying "hackers did this" it isnt mentioned as much that north Korean hackers did it. This is where the push will be.

       They are setting up for the future. And next will be "hackers stole your money and shut down wall street" its all just a script. Sony is just helping the powers that be to get what they want.

       Dont agree that easily. I could be wrong and the whole marketing campaign idea could be true. Either way the thread of "9-11" style attacks is complete bullshit. We have to agree on that. I see no way that anyone can take that seriously.

       I've been saying the same thing in other threads. It's far too coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the major sub's (including this one). Whenever a particular story becomes The Story, I am always skeptical of the details. Anonymous US officials confirm NK's involvement? North Korean hacker code? A bunch of bullshit to get us thinking a specific way for some reason. I'm not buying any of it.

       Well with Russia's money being devalued, lifting the embargo with Cuba,  and all the sudden no one is talking about the torture thing. All of it is just to easy. It really shows how short our attention span is supposed to last.

       Makes you wonder what we dont know about. Programs that never were given a name. It just boggles the mind how thruout all of mankind we always have those that are scheming.

       We have one planet.  Why do you want to control it? What's to gain? If you have unlimited resources why wouldn't you just enjoy life?

      <p>
       The amount of time to control world events must be nerve wracking. I couldn't do it. I would end up saying fuck it just have fun and lets see how good we can do as a species.  Not trying to control every aspect of shit. The only thing I can think is they are only important to themself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a kid raise a child and be a parent. Hell have sex all the time and spend money like it dont matter. No need for all this control.

       The only way that it makes sense is that it really does take a different kind of person to invest themselves in such actions. Sociopaths most likely. I see it as greed in relation to control.

       Yep. And they jumped at the chance to grab all those crazy, NAZI scientists, because goddamn would that be useful. Ever wonder when MK Ultra started? It was those crazy fuckers.  One of them was so good at building missiles to blow shit up he ran our goddamn space program. And remember that story of how all those NASA plans got destroyed and accidently thrown out of a dumpster? What the fuck are they hiding there? Who knows what crazy shit Von Braun was doing. Dude was a nut. A Nazi nut.

       It doesn't even have to have been NK, really. The American public will believe anything the media tells them. It's proven time and time again, week after week.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask anyone if television is real and they'll tell you "of course not". But they believe it like it's gospel anyway. It's all they ever talk about. They repeat it verbatim like they came up with those thoughts and words themselves.

       The level of vulnerability is astounding. And whether it be some governmental conspiracy to instill more fear in us or there are actual hackers that have such capabilities... I see the outcome as the same in most aspects. We are screwed to the point that a discussion should happening about this issue.

       I've read that the reason they're pulling the movie is because it's not very good, and if they blame having to pull it for terror threats made by North Korean hackers (as opposed to individuals who could be found or held responsible), they can file for insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes more sense than anything else I've heard.

       When a movie isn't good, they dump tons of money into marketing to make everyone go see it opening weekend before word gets out. Godzilla 2000 is basically the study for this. Movie was terrible and they  knew it. They promote it for 2 full years, did the whole Taco Bell thing,  pumped money into the soundtrack etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interview has had so much publicity it is insane.   Guessing that Sony is planning to release it online.  They've either invested heavily in an existing online distro like netflix, Hulu, amazon, or my personal favorite theory: Sony will be launching a new online marketplace.  I don't have a play station, but I assume there is a playstation marketplace; maybe they are looking to expand this market place beyond the gaming console.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sony may have had a deal where they were going to take little of the theatrical release profits, and take a larger share of the online or other profits, etc.

       That's pretty far fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't expensive enough or niche enough to expect, even if it was mediocre, that it wouldn't recoup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not convinced they would have insurance that would sufficiently cover this very odd eventuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sony is taking a bath on this, but the potential loss (movie's budget and some legal settlements for lost revenue from cast and crew) well be much less than the potential loss of the threats of physical violence were plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally, from Sony's perspective, the halt of the film's release may also bring an end to the release of their stolen data (but that's yet to be seen).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fairly simple business decision, although a terrible precedent.

       I highly doubt Sony committed felonies and opened themselves to massive lawsuits to promote a silly movie. Shady business is one thing, burning down your company for the equivalent of milk money is just lunacy.

       I also highly doubt America is going to use such an insignificant event to do anything more than wag their finger at North Korea. There is about a 0% chance this will be used to justify a war.

       It is more likely that this event (false flag or not) will be used to ramp up support for Net "Neutrality" and making the Internet a public utility. Using events like this will encourage Gov't to mandate all network and computer security be a function of the Gov't - using "hacks" like Sony and Target as justification.

       likewise, you can't say 59% of people agree with the program when they aren't aware of the details.   If the same people were shown videos of people we sent to be boiled alive in Uzbekistan, they might change their tune.    many of those people have been conditioned to accept torture as an effective means of extracting information, which is plainly isn't.

       The movie shouldn't matter to anyone with brain the rectal feed and other horrific torture methods we used over and over again should be the main focus any patriot. How hard would it be for them to label anyone of you as an enemy combatant? Welcome to recetal feeding with a chance of being boiled or frozen to death. Sick fucks are so much worse than the nazi's

       And the whole leaks a large marketing ploy. Sony PR firm fabricated 300 GB of information including medical records of its employees, sensitive communications, financial budget and movies (Annie which was even released and Fury still on cinemas) on torrent sites ?!
      </p>
      <p>
       While implausible (and quite frankly stupid), maybe you are right OP. The whole thing was *not to show" the Interview, or maybe since the movie was actually released this is all a giant marketing scheme !!
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe, just a hacker group tried to blackmail Sony (as seen in their emails) failed and diverted attention to N.Korea.

       I really don't think the torture thing is that big of an issue, or they wouldn't have released it.  If they can say "fuck off" to the public about the surveillance debate(and 9/11 and JFK), they could easily do the same with the torture report, but it's not that big of an issue.  If you're worried about international law violations with torture, don't worry.  We violated the GREATEST war crime created at Nuremberg by conducting a war of aggression(Iraq), and even made it a law, called the bush doctrine, which allows wars of aggression(without congressional approval).  I think the "pulling" of The Interview this is just another distraction(like the torture report), added to the list, along with Ebola(which magically disappeared once elections were over).  Instead of arguing about whether it is ok that they just passed a law making interception
       <strong>
        OF ANY COMMUNICATION GLOBALLY WITHOUT A WARRANT
       </strong>
       legal a few days ago, we are arguing about whether torture is OK(it's not, and there is no real argument to be made in favor, it's just a distraction), whether Ebola is a threat(its not, and there is no real argument in favor), and whether we should give into terrorist demands(we shouldn't, and once again, there is no real argument in favor).  We already had these debates as a society decades ago, and they are being brought up again to distract us from the real problems(the elite, and the wealth/power gap).

       Yep. And they jumped at the chance to grab all those crazy, NAZI scientists, because goddamn would that be useful. Ever wonder when MK Ultra started? It was those crazy fuckers.  One of them was so good at building missiles to blow shit up he ran our goddamn space program. And remember that story of how all those NASA plans got destroyed and accidently thrown out of a dumpster? What the fuck are they hiding there? Who knows what crazy shit Von Braun was doing. Dude was a nut. A Nazi nut.
