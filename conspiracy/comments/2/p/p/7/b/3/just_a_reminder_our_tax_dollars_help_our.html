       And that's probably one of the tamer things the CIA and others do in our name and with the money they've extorted from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this and what it means not just with respect to our "civilized" and "modern" government but also with respect to us and our collective complicity in these literal atrocities - really think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many people today, on this very site,
       <strong>
        defending the torture
       </strong>
       .  Think about what this means and the extent of the brainwashing/cognitive dissonance/ignorance that
       <em>
        must be
       </em>
       in place for this to ever occur.

       Every time  "WE" plan to launch an attack against some far-off land, the media goes into a frenzy, "demonizing" the target country, its leaders, its culture, its beliefs and behaviors in order to "justify" what usually amounts to naked aggression on our part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, "we" just demonized ourselves - Americans as a collective" - in the eyes of the world, and we stand to be judged - AS A PEOPLE - for what was done and
       <em>
        is being done
       </em>
       in our names.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when we launched our assault on Iraq - the public hoodwinked by lies and false pretenses - we killed scores of thousands of innocent Iraqis and destroyed the lives of countless more - what was our "justification"?

        - What Bush said as the Iraq prison scandal unfolded
       </strong>
       Salon, 2004:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Iraqi people are now free. And they do not have to worry about the secret police coming after them in the middle of the night, and they don't have to worry about their husbands and brothers being taken off and shot, or their wives being taken to rape rooms. Those days are over."—

        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        "There was an announcement by the Iraqi Governing Council earlier this week about the tribunal that they have set up to hold accountable members of the former regime who were responsible for three decades of brutality and atrocities. … We know about the mass graves and the rape rooms and the torture chambers of Saddam Hussein's regime. … We welcome their decision to move forward on a tribunal to hold people accountable for those atrocities."—
        <em>
         Bush Press Secretary Scott McClellan, White House press briefing, Dec. 10, 2003

        "
        <strong>
         One thing is for certain: There won't be any more mass graves and torture rooms and rape rooms
        </strong>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But there
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       more torture rooms and "rape rooms", weren't there, Mr. President?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference is, that "we" were the ones doing the torturing, the murdering and the raping, weren't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       So that makes "us" better than Saddam and Uday Hussein... HOW?
      </p>
      <p>
       If America EVER had a pretense, an illusion of holding the "Moral High Ground", it's gone, and if the crimes of Saddam and the Boys justified the COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT of the entire nation of Iraq, where do we, the nation of the United States stand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we guilty as a collective? I suppose that rather depends on how we respond to these ugly revelations AS A PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will we hold our "leaders" accountable for what was done and no doubt CONTINUES to be done in our name?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, then it would seem that we stand guilty as charged, no?

       And if you actually pay attention to the words our "dear leaders" use when they declare war or talk about "foreign intervention", they constantly use the phrase "the American people" and refer to themselves as "we".

       Exactly.  The easy thing to do is to say, "Well,
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       didn't ask for it to happen.  The government doesn't represent
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       . I didn't ask for my taxes to be used for that."  Etc., etc., we can all make excuses for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the point is that it
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       happen and our taxes
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       used to fund their war crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you give a man 50 bucks without knowing what he'll use it for and you find out later that he used it to rent a hotel room and rape a little girl, are you going to give him 50 bucks the next time he comes asking?

       No, unfortunately not.
and as long as people all collectively say "Support the troops" nothing about our direction in this world will change.

       Many people disagree with me, and I've gotten plenty of downvotes for saying these things.

      <p>
       But politicians send our troops there, our soldiers, our tanks, and jets and missiles. 
It it our troops, the individual, that is the one that pulls the trigger, or pushes the button.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to stop thinking in the ways of the collective and think in terms of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, we're doomed. the public is too brainwashed to question or care about the injustices that we are committing around the world.
People i have shown articles and evidence to about the atrocities we commit turn away, and say shit like "Well, it was just one soldier who did that right? it wasn't everyone, we need to support the troops."

       I don't think people have a realistic understanding of what torture is.  If we substituted the word  "torture" for "rape" people might react a bit different and feel horrified.   It is just a word but it triggers people to the reality of what it is rather than viewing it as an enhanced interrogation technique.

       I think the bigger problem is that people read the five second headline, "CIA Torture Report released", think to themselves, "Hmm... that's messed up", and then go about their lives like nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody reads the report itself or about the absolutely disgusting and
       <em>
        evil shit
       </em>
       that was done to these prisoners.  Nobody bothers to consider that this is our government committing crimes against humanity.  Nobody cares that it's our tax dollars funding atrocities like this.  Nobody stops to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       .  Nobody gives a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting hung up on semantics is exactly what we do
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       need to be doing.  Instead of worrying about what to call it, how about we think about what it means for me and you to be helping to pay for the hummus that was stuffed up the ass of someone in order to garner a false confession out of someone who was probably (or at least possibly) innocent.  Call it rape if you want, call it torture, what difference does it make?  It's a fucking travesty and an abomination and
       <em>
        nobody gives a fuck
       </em>
       .

       Not trying to add salt to the wound but very few people give a shit because they know that if the system goes through significant changes the stock market might tank (it's going to tank anyways but that's a different topic...) so they don't want to risk their 401ks and/or pensions taking a hit. Bought and paid for to remain complacent about this shit. On top of all that, people really think voting is going to change anything...a corrupt government will not stop being corrupt just because the citizens vote.

       I think, on a conspiratory level, that pressuring the quality of life of the average person is a great way to control the average person. If you're too caught up fearing for your own life and livelihood and having a house (especially just renting) and paying your ever increasing bills, you're less likely to participate in actually changing anything.

       I agree with you, but since it has happened throughout recorded human history in every culture, I'm not optimistic that such behavior is going to stop any time in the foreseeable future. All we see now is more propaganda trying to spin such acts as being either justified or less brutal.

       Your idiocy is in assuming that these blatant stereotypes are true of every person.  For example, you're an atheist, and you're an uninformed yet arrogant idiot (the worst kind), but that doesn't mean that I assume

       Did you know that opium production in Afghanistan under the Taliban fell to almost 0 in 2001?  Fast forward a year later, 9/11 happens and we invade their country, and suddenly opium production in Afghanistan again accounts for over 90% of the world supply.

       That isn't what I was saying at all and you are clearly aware of that (assuming you have two brain cells to rub together).  The point I was making (and again this, I'm sure, was obvious to you) is that

       I agree. I know people who might describe "torture" as waiting in a long line for the bathroom, or "torture" as having to eat dollar ramen noodles for a week straight. I think Americans have become desensitized to the word "torture" and I don't think that is simply a coincidence.

       You're not allowed to joke about rape. Not even tangentially. Well except prison rape, that's very funy har har har. Anyway, torture is just fine. Nevermind it's just as traumatizing as rape, but I guess since it's males who are privileged since they're males, it's ok.

       <em>
        already

       pay 30-40% of their wages in (illegal) taxes, the rich frequently pay far more, and most of this confiscated wealth goes toward lining the pockets of bureaucrats or their corporate cronies, most of whom are concentrated in a few industries like "defense".

       The only real difference between people today and 1000 years ago is that we've embraced science instead of religion. The elites still use it the same way and we think we are holier than thou because we have embraced the common, popular belief. People are still just eking out meager existences and remaining wholly uneducated. The upper class is still in tune with our weaknesses and our willingness as a serf majority to follow and support the noble minority. The government/industrialist relationship is still the exact same. They balance each other out in terms of greed/control ensuring that only they will be masters and that is a compromise they are willing to make. People think their voices are heard but really they aren't as far as society and business is concerned. Their voices are only heard when they align with higher agendas. All these revolutions are nothing more than elites struggling for more of the pie. The average person isn't capable of organizing together. They aren't educated or funded enough to be taken seriously by their simple peers. There have been participations in revolt, but the people have never led a successful revolt and never will. People will pay taxes because they don't want to be harmed by the elites. They accept their slavery. And they accept the sacrifice of their children's future for the present and for instant happiness. Most simply see things as a quick fix and an end to their immediate suffering. Forethought and vision are not among our skills. Those with the birthright and establishment have the time and patience for such things and thus can use them to direct the herd.

       In a way I guess you could make this argument. But in a practical sense it really isn't true; "divine right" of nobility 1000 years ago was very different from what most modern nations experience today. Still, I agree with you that the distribution of wealth and power in these nations isn't hugely different.

       The US, French, Chinese, and Russian revolutions (along with others I'm sure) were pretty significant in a lot of ways. The problem is that revolutions turn into a new Establishment within a very short period of time.

If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. … What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.

       They were also all carried out by elites and minorities that held their interests above all others. The US revolution was carried out by slave owners, lawyers and opportunists who didn't want to follow the establishment but wanted to make their own. The Russian revolution was carried out by jews who were furious over the nationalism in Russia, Poland and Germany among other places where they were the minority pushing their will onto the majority. The Chinese revolution was only to turn the nation over to a murderous power. One closely tied to the communism under the jewish (Russian) revolution of Russia.

       The fact is that the people at the bottom are led by hand by these revolutionary powers into a new tyranny. They are not decision makers. They can't be.

       American citizens have the right to be molested by the TSA on their way to one of the many chosen destinations where they are sheltered from reality. They do not have wealth. I'm not sure what your definition of wealth is.

       That's not wealth. Some of that is basic necessity in the West while the rest is almost minor luxury. Personal wealth is when you have a system of income that provides more than enough to keep one's savings intact and growing while accommodating luxury and necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for eduction, most people in the US do not have that LUXURY.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're confusing national wealth with personal wealth. I'm not talking about national wealth, most of which is squandered and doesn't do anything but keep the status quo operating just within reasonable levels to keep people from rioting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trying compare luxury and basic needs in the past to today? Seems pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, my statement stands. The circumstances have changed but the theme remains intact.

       The US has essentially universal literacy in reading, basic math, and a number of other areas. Again, billions of people on the planet don't possess these things. Are you referring only to university-level education?

       what do you suggest people can do about it?  the only thing we can do, collectively, is nothing.  absolutely nothing.  no work, no exceptions, until we get what we want.    which is honesty, truth, and justice. - for equality, fraternity, and liberty.

       Think globally, act locally is probably the best suggestion I can give.  Participate in "the machine" as little as possible and discuss the big picture with friends and family.  My hope is that these old, archaic, corrupt power structures that plague us today will sort of just "fall away" once we all wake up from our amnesia and realize it's all bullshit.  It really would be as simple as that - the hard part is getting to that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it starts by using the minds we've all been given and realizing the depth to which this world is controlled by relatively few people.  One way of doing this, in my opinion (which is why I made this post), is to actually give some thought to how it's possible that there are many people literally
       <em>
        defending torture
       </em>
       as if it's a necessary and justified thing for our government to be doing with our tax dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be - needs to be - a wake up call for people to say, "Holy shit, how far must we have fallen if we're trying to justify shoving hummus up the asses of innocent people?"

       When you say "shoe in the machine", what are you talking about?  I work a job for a company that's at least partially "part of the machine" and in that way I'm supporting the machine.  To me, "shoe in the machine" implies that you're working against it from within rather than just working for it while being ideologically opposed (as I do).

       I think more good is accomplished by giving positive energy to something that deserves it rather than wasting negative energy on something that deserves it.

       I know and I agree, but this is a major (possibly the biggest) part of the problem.  As long as people are apathetic to their enslavement or
       <em>
        willfully ignoring
       </em>
       their enslavement, they will continue to be slaves.  We all will.  Ignoring that fact won't make it go away, despite how much we want it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring that our tax dollars help support the murder and rape and torture of thousands of people per year will not make any of those things stop.  In fact, ignoring them will only make them happen with more frequency and with less discretion.

       If we all stopped going to work and paying our bills, we would get a response. The problem is that everyone is way way way too selfish to allow something that too happen.

       we've become isolated from depending on eachother for survival.  it's now an individual or family competition.  there are others way ahead of the game with no morals that collude to keep it that way.   it's extremely profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are other options besides working - paying bills can be reduced, but you need water and sewage, fire dept, police, garbage and other essentials.   all it would take would be for those people to stop working about a week or two.

       I believe there are personal changes that can occur in individuals that will efect more change and much faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, there were times when populations were kept in far greater ignorance, but great social changed happened due to some change in awareness.  The change can rapid, and an attempt to stop it may only speed up the change.  IMO so long as people remain wilfully unaware there's too much inertia to overcome
      </p>
      <p>
       The key is to induce them to become unwillfully aware.

       Who are the rat dicks that are defending torture on this sub?

       I've read a little of the report, about twenty or so pages, but I had to stop. 
I can only reach a point before I get so depressed and bummed out by what I read.

      <p>
       I've talked to my friends about this and they all feel it was justified. One of them even stated that people were making it out to be larger than it should be. To him, it wasn't a problem or a big deal.

       I wasn't talking about this specific sub so much as reddit in general - if you check some of the larger political subs and the discussions they've been having about the torture report, you'll find many people defending the torture on the grounds of "national security" and "Well but the terrorists do worse" and any other number of pitiful excuses.

       You should tell your friends to actually read the report and see if they're still singing the same tune.  This is really what this OP is about - getting people to actually
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       about what they think, if that makes sense.  To actually take five minutes and
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       about what it means that they're defending our government literally shoving a massive tube up someone's ass and filling him with pureed hummus and nuts in order to extract a (probably false) confession.  It's fucking
       <strong>
        absurd
       </strong>
       that anyone would defend this.

       Torture's bad - but isn't indiscriminate murder worse? At most several thousand people were tortured, but tens or hundreds of thousands were murdered by guns, indirect fire, and invasion-imposed starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We paid for all of that. For all the controversy surrounding torture, there's comparatively almost none surrounding the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place.

       Of course.  But I was trying to highlight that our inhumanity has gotten so excessive, so out of hand, that we're to the point that we're doing absurd shit like forcing pureed hummus and pine nuts up peoples' asses to extract what are in all likelihood false confessions.

       Actually, someone(s) came in and downvoted all of your comments. Regular day in the subreddit I suppose. I countered them though.

       And before anyone says "maybe they just disagreed", if every comment someone makes in a thread is at 0, even the random mundane comments, then they are being unfairly targeted.

       It is a well documented fact that the US government and other superpowers have described information on the internet in web forums/social media as "the modern battleground".
      </p>
      <p>
       In various slides that were hacked from their database, a direct order was to target "conspiracy" websites. And here we are on the largest and most active web forum in history, in the conspiracy section.

       Now I am not saying

       Original- :) It all reminds me a of a few years ago when I become increasingly paranoid about electronic communications and people tried to chalk me up as "insane", then granted the revelations of Snowden and mass NSA spying, I was suddenly no longer "insane" however I do not recall any apologies. . .

       I have to be honest, the way I see things going now, the world seems like it is heading towards one more final, cataclysmic war. The kind of things you see on the news nowadays is eerily similar to the build up to the first and second world wars, and I fear it may end the same way. Those that would seek to benefit most are those that would want to establish their order out of the chaos. Think of how radically the world changed after the previous great wars, perhaps a third one was intended from the start? In regards to the torture report, I believe our nation will eventually have to answer for the insurmountable crimes and atrocities committed in our name. Think Germany post-second world war.

       If there is a third World War, and there very well may be, I think it will be mostly contrived and planned by the "elite" at the top who have always worked together by controlling both sides.  Order out of chaos, like you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I think the "third World War" started a few decades ago and has really intensified since 9/11 and it's a silent war between the people and the ruling elite.  An information war, a spiritual war - I could see the mythological "WWIII" being used to bring about the desired outcome of this war.

       It is kind of shocking when you remember we've been at war for almost 15 years now. It's very much a live war, it's just that we in the states have the luxury of being detached from it physically. They want the wars to be perpetual because it means big money, but I don't think the rest of the world is too fond of the idea.

       Is this that "rectal rehydration" that I've been reading about? They used hummus to what I'm imagining hydrate the person while keeping him feeling thirsty and simultaneously creating a burning sensation in his anus. Is that it?

       It was mainly used for torturing and dehumanizing, with the side "benefit" of keeping the victim alive without having to feed them.  It's about as fucked up a thing as one human being can do to another, and the CIA and others have done and are doing even worse.

       South Park treats serious subjects like this way too flippantly and are a big part of the reason why we have a nation of young people who can't focus on anything for longer than five minutes and think that

       Its easier to feel apathy than empathy. It's not just Comedy Central shows, social media nowadays means everyone can go and find their own opinion rebroadcast at them and young people seem to be the most apathetic although I've become very cynical in my middle age.  And prone to run ons apparently.

       You're right though, everyone just wants to feel validated and accepted in this day and age.  Everyone wants to be told that what they're doing is fashionable and that they're "part of something".

       I've quoted part of it in another comment in this thread.  The paper itself is also linked by the guy I was responding to, you can open it up and just do a "ctrl+f" for "rectal" or "rectum" or "hummus" and have yourself some fun.  There are about 15-20 parts of the report that talk specifically about this "interrogation technique".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, FYI, you're demonstrating exactly what I'm talking about in this OP by asking to be spoon fed rather than educate yourself on your own terms.

       Sure. But you gotta realise how it's not just me you're dealing with. There's gotta be someone to spoonfeed the CORRECT information to people. Otherwise you end up with the Obamacare death panels myth spreading around.

       These people aren't even holding interesting information. They are just being tortued because the sociopaths who run the country (Dick Chen.ey and friends) just enjoy hurting people. It's similar to the Nazi's abusing people in concentration camps: They had a reason that the public accepted at the time. But it turned out just to be a bunch of sociopaths who enjoyed watching families get tortured and finally put into a gas chamber.

       As far as the hummus up the bum. If the guy was on a hunger strike, even if you force fed him orally, he can still vomit it up. You feed him rectally this solves the problem. As far as torture goes it is mostly ineffective. The detainee will tell you anything he thinks you want to hear, regardless if the truthfulness of it. Sleep deprivation to cloud the mind and wear down defences does work. People get tired, they get sloppy, confused, more easily led. Plus no one really suffers long term.

       No, I'm not joking. There are things that the enemy knows. Saying pretty please won't get them talking. Traditional pain based torture is ineffective. however deprive someone of sleep long enough you can have a greater chance of getting some good info out of them.

       I would like to state that I am not in any way defending torture or the actions of certain agencies that are now coming to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I believe it is inaccurate and and wrong to lump all Americans into a guilty designation just because they pay taxes.  Does ANY citizen truly know how their tax money is spent?  We certainly shouldn't assume this is the only thing the US government has done without the knowledge or consent of the people that is/was morally dubious.  So why lump us all under a "guilty" category?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time a single race or nationality is lumped together for the immoral actions of individuals, we see the rise of bigotry, intolerance, hatred, and violence.  These usually harm the innocent more than the guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying we shouldn't be morally outraged by the conduct of the CIA.  Torture is neither justified nor effective and those who engage in it should be held accountable.  But let us not lump them in with people whose only crime is trying to survive in a country they were born into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who doesn't pay
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       taxes in America?  We are one of the most heavily taxed people in history!  And as if we have a choice to say "I choose not pay taxes this year because I don't agree with my government".
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of focusing on
       <strong>
        what

       was done, why don't we focus on
       <strong>
        who

       approved, ordered, and actually did this and then post their name all over the net and see them arrested.  How about that?

       Sure, that's important too and I agree with you.  But what's equally important is our consent in all of it - consent by inaction - and to think about where some of our tax dollars are actually going.

       The funny thing is, though, if every American collectively chose to not pay taxes, there isn't much that the .0001% could do about it.  It really is (or at least
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be) that simple.  The hard part is getting to that point.

       But that is my point; we are not consulted when our government passes a budget.  We are not told what all our tax dollars are spent on, so how can we be complicit in what we are not privy to?  I agree that we should have a say.  I have been advocating a tax system where, either quarterly or bi-annually, the tax payers are given an option to choose where their taxes go.  If a person wants to support war they can allocate it to the war machine.  If they think health-care is an issue then they choose for it to be spent there and so on.  It is a lovely idea but I have no illusions on it ever being implemented.

       I toy with this idea as well, though we must acknowledge that many of the taxes we pay are hidden or factored into everyday costs (sales tax, vehicle tax, etc.).  If it were only a matter of income tax I think this route would have been tried already.  Employees and employers aren't given a whole lot of choice on whether or not to pay that income tax.  Hard to choose not to pay it when it is taken out of your pay check before it is given to you.

       There is some truth here; I agree that it is time to take a hard look at ourselves as a nation and make some tough decisions.  I don't agree that we as citizens should hold ourselves accountable.  This, and many other problems we as a nation are addressing, should spur us to action not make us feel responsible.  Those responsible never asked for our consent, never informed us as to their intent, and in fact kept the truth from us as long as they possibly could.  If anything, this should confirm that we can no longer trust our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please don't think I'm offended by your post.  I do not take it personally and I hope I haven't offended you as this was not my intent.  I appreciate your respectful tone and polite, insightful reply.  Thank you for that.

       That sounds awesome and, unfortunately, far too sensible to ever come to pass under the current power structure.  I would definitely support something like that too, I think we'd all be amazed at how quickly wa-

       I don't know, I think it would be pretty significant.  Not just in the nominal dollar amount but in the message it would send and, more importantly, the solidarity it would require.  I think it hasn't happened yet, primarily, because the people have never stopped bickering long enough to realize their/our own power.

       I'm with you here.  I think what I'm trying to highlight isn't so much how we've indirectly helped these things happen as I am with how we can
       <em>
        directly

       stop them from happening now.  I think we ultimately are on the same page.
