        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vladimir Putin has blamed the west for the current crisis, and he’s not alone. While locals have likened it to an “economic war”, some western commentators agree.
Earlier this year, back when oil was still at around $88 a barrel, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman pointed the finger squarely at the US for the collapse.
Widely accepted in Russia, is that the US and Saudi Arabia are colluding to keep production artificially high in a bid to drive the price down.
“The net result has been to make life difficult for Russia and Iran, at a time when Saudi Arabia and America are confronting both of them in a proxy war in Syria,” he wrote. “This is business, but it also has the feel of war by other means: oil.”</p>

<p><strong>Just as they did to the last leaders of the Soviet Union, the Americans and Saudis are trying to “pump them to  death</strong></p>

<p>And if it comes down to it, just about any other kind of war - should they decide to team-up.</p>

<p>Russia is a land with vast natural resources, while China has massive manufacturing capability that could quickly be re-tooled from making Wal-Mart trinkets for American Consumers to making weapons of war targeting whomever they wish.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a strong partnership between the two would bode well for anyone they would consider an enemy.</p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t orchestrate, foment and force a coup in Ukraine - the &quot;West&quot; did.</p>

<p>America thrives in conventional warfare. If we&#39;re fighting a country, we&#39;ll have them on their stomachs defenseless in record time. If we&#39;re fighting an idea and a group of people that are easily hidden in the general population of a country, we have a hard time.</p>

<p>Also, did you ever stop to consider that maybe America wants to have war fighting units in Afghanistan and Iraq? To the North of Afghanistan, Russian. To the East, China. Who&#39;s nearby Iraq that America might want to keep tabs on? I&#39;ll give you a hint, they&#39;re Persian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong. We can only take out governments and standing armies in a conventional war. It&#39;s what comes after that, the insurgency, that we have no fucking clue how to handle. Russia&#39;s uniformed military would surely lose a face to face fight with a Western military force. But they won&#39;t fight that way, they have units trained to fight the long drawn out guerilla war (the kind we always lose). Remember Vietnam? The standing army we faced (N.V.A.) was nothing compared to the Viet Cong. Guerilla warfare is specifically designed for use against a more efficient conventional army. Napoleon&#39;s troops were hard to beat in the field, fighting line against line, but a bunch of angry and motivated Spaniards with hunting weapons fought them a different way... and bled Napoleon dry through attrition. Don&#39;t expect the Russians to be dumb to that fact. They read military history too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you&#39;re saying is, we could destroy every means of counterattack Russia currently has and set their military back decades, but we couldn&#39;t occupy their territory without a few guerilla fighters still resisting? But we&#39;d still destroy every means Russia had to pose a threat the the US right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very simplistic understanding of military strategy, and seemingly no knowledge of military history. At least you understand geography though! They would only be crushed if they spread their military out to go on the offensive. But they won&#39;t. They will use all their conventional military power to defend Mother Russia and use special ops, terrorism, and the threat of nuclear attacks for offense. They will hunker down as they have EVERY TIME they were invaded throughout history and survive as they always have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in Afghanistan last year, so I&#39;d hope I understood geography, at least in regards to where I was at. My job in the military is Electronic Warfare. I don&#39;t know what Russia&#39;s strategy would be, but I do know that we would immediately cripple their aerial defenses very quickly and rule the skies, just like we did to Iraq. Part of my job is intelligence gathering of our opponent&#39;s defenses, we locate and develop countermeasures for these defenses and when war breaks out, we establish air superiority. It is next to impossible to perform any sort of offensive when you have the enemy controlling the skies. Russia would definitely survive, no doubt about that, but there would certainly be a regime change. Something I doubt Putin is willing to have happen.</p>

<p>Regardless, Putin would not like a regime change being that he&#39;s the leader of Russia.</p>

<p>Their bombers won&#39;t even leave the ground. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re stuck in the 70s where Russia was some kind of superpower that rivaled us. Those days are over.

    <div class="md"><p>The modern US only fights economic warfare, it&#39;s goals are not to win by overcoming an enemy, but to win money for their owners. This is different to what Russians will consider important, they would consider spending billions on what troops in the field should do, and subcontractors now do, little strategic importance . While the fat cats make themselves rich, the Ruskies have developed new technologies that are well capable of delivering them strategic advantage. There will be no conventional war, if it goes hot. Russians play chess, while barely literate fat pricks running the US stuff the pieces up their butts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is one of the reasons. Putin is also responsible as he and his corrupt financial partners made huge sums of money off corrupt over-inflated construction contracts. Such as pipelines, increase in defense spending, invasions in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine and Georgia, and the Winter Olympic Village that undermine the finances of their country resulting in unstable banking system. He spent money they do not have just like the USA. Except due to his wanting of establishing his own Banking System with Brazil, Venezuela, Iran and China. instead of using the current IMF. He has no support to his debts as the current IMF supports the USA. He took a big gamble and the dice roll did not pay off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the hell is production kept artificially high? There&#39;s a severe misunderstanding in how markets work. Physical assets cannot do this. Overproduction is simply called supply. It is what it is. It cannot be over produced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you&#39;re saying is, we could destroy every means of counterattack Russia currently has and set their military back decades, but we couldn&#39;t occupy their territory without a few guerilla fighters still resisting? But we&#39;d still destroy every means Russia had to pose a threat the the US right?</p>
