<p>Here&#39;s a good explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Lec9giab90I#t=4153">here</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with everything Dimitri says, but all he really knows is the WHAT and HOW it went down, not who or why. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start a discussion since this theory is really put under the rug since most people don&#39;t understand how underground nuclear demolitions happen.</p>

<p>USGS data as quoted by that dimitri idiot says there are trace levels of strontium and cesium. There are no traces of cesium, but plenty of asbestos.

<p>There was NO radiation or radiation sickness in any of the first responders or the clean up crews. Here&#39;s a pic of them doing DEEP excavation right down the the bottom of the WTC&#39;s footings. Note there is no radiation killing the crews working for MONTHS down there <a href="http://i.imgur.com/noYtMuM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/noYtMuM.jpg</a></p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the stupid claims that the radiation caused the cancers. Look re the massive amounts of asbestos in the dust samples. </p>

<p>Anything else?</p>

<p>That is what concrete looks like after being exposed to high rads. And quote: 300 seconds will produce a relatively quick death, which is better than many alternatives. </p>

That&#39;s better than I expected adding a 75 meter wall of pure bedrock protecting you along with a melted tower to cap it off. A lead wall can protect against gamma, this is much more protective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying the bottom part probably melted to an extent since the last part of the tower was in one of the last zones of the explosion hence some metal was melted along with the bedrock. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a lot of it was turned to dust but the top part remained normal due to the weakness of the bomb(According to Dimitri&#39;s theory, and it does look like it if you look at the videos), and the bottom part was melted.

    <div class="md"><p>That is contradictory, because the same energy that you say brought the building down (using heat) was also not present with the compulsory radiation that comes with it. And the &#39;protective cap&#39; also not only stops radiation, but all damaging energy.  And if your also saying that an earthquake-esqu shock brought them down, then it would&#39;ve swallowed up the surrounding buildings as well. Either way, it doesn&#39;t even come close to adding up. </p>

<p>And let&#39;s hear about how &#39;they&#39; tunneled one hundred meters below wtc&#39;s and planted a bomb, buried the bomb with enough earth the cause back pressure so as not to blow the dirt out the excavation hole (which is looser than the surrounding compacted earth) and all this was done without any person noticing. Not one person. Yeah, sounds legit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not say the building was brought down by heat. Only a small amount was, most of it was done because it turned it into crushed rock. I&#39;ll stop quoting Dimitri and take a look at the wikipedia article: </p>

<p>The rock closest to the location of the test is vaporised, forming a cavity. Farther away, there are zones of crushed, cracked, and irreversibly strained rock. Following the explosion, the rock above the cavity may collapse, forming a rubble chimney. If this chimney reaches the surface, a bowl-shaped subsidence crater may form.</p>

<p>That second phase is were it crushes, mind you bedrock is more dense then the building so this crushing phase traveled up through most of the building causing it to collapse.</p>

<p>When it made this crater, the building collapsed with the existing bedrock and rubble covering it turning it into a melting pot.</p>

<p>Hence, no buildings nearby would be hurt since it traveled up. Also there was some damage; most people said they felt a &#39;shake&#39; a few seconds before the collapse. hence, the explosion was traveling upwards. You can even see the camera shake in some of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>buried the bomb with enough earth the cause back pressure so as not to blow the dirt out the excavation hole</p>

<p>I think an umph-ton building would override a miniscule crater with sheer weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was apparently built during construction due to a new york law stating that skyscrapers must have a way of demolition.

<p>I have not done research into this law, but every single other thing I have mentions seems to fit. Also, even if this IS false, it is very easy to drill a 1x100 meter hole and fill it up. the WTC has a few stories that go underground. about 22 meters.</p>

<p>Also, that leak, there was so much smoke and rubble it would be pretty hard to see, and not all nuclear explosions are of the same power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a load of crap, but yeah I&#39;ll wait for your reply. If you think it&#39;s easy to drill a 1m x 100m, in the space of a1 story carpark/basement, you have no idea what you are talking about. I on the other hand, worked in commercial building for 20 years, I have drilled hundreds of piers for buildings. You need a drilling rig, at least 4 backup rigid trucks with auger extensions in order to make a 100m hole, that requires you to go through solid rock. That takes years, and at least 50 dump trucks carrying 20 cu3 of spoil. 
That&#39;s not including the back fill, which needs to be compacted down as you are backfilling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just theory, but something they probably did.</p>

Sure, some will leak but not to an insane extent. In fact, even nuclear bunker busters release a sizable amount of radiation into the area,  and they are also made to explode at around 100 metres underground. And this would be even more powerful then them, since we&#39;ed be dealing with something that not only could explode that far down, but explode that far down and create a pretty serious hole.</p>

<ul>
<li>This in turn could lead to a reduced amount of radioactive fallout. However, it is unlikely that the explosion would be completely contained underground. As a result, significant amounts of rock and soil would be rendered radioactive and lofted as dust or vapor into the atmosphere, generating significant fallout.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gamma radiation needs more than just a thin lead foil sheet to protect against it, especially if we&#39;re dealing with high energy gamma radiation, which is what nukes often create. For this reason, it does not seem like  25 metres would be enough.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is not a small nuke. To do this, you&#39;d need a fairly powerful nuke, and because of this, would get even more radiation, inevitably irradiating the surrounding area (and the micro dust, which would in turn mildly irradiate a large area)</p>

<p>This is the same nuke that would create tons of micro dust, which would more than likely be irradiated considering the yield. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, when I meant a lead wall I meant like a meter thick.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, he estimated it would be a 50 meter radius of melted rock and an outer ring of crushed rock. But yeah, I guess the nuke is bigger than I said. I guess it isn&#39;t a hiroshima but it packs a punch.</p>

<p>One thing that you should keep in mind is that this building is falling into this crater. I don&#39;t have enough info to stand by this argument but it seems that the building falling into the explosion would &#39;contain&#39; it to some sort.</p>

<p>But thank you for your analysis on this theory. It helps a lot to put it in retrospect with this constructive conversation.</p>

<p>Well actually, this would make it even worse, since it would send radioactive dust everywhere. Again, I&#39;m not trying to insult you, I&#39;m just pointing out the issues with the nuke theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s a big line between criticism and insulting. But I agree, the tower could help or leave a gaping hole in the theory. But, I didn&#39;t come here to perfect this theory, just see how fine tuned it is in the criticism of other conspirators. Thanks truly.</p>
