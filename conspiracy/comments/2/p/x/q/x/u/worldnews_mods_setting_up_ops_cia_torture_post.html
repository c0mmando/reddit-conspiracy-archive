<blockquote>
<p>Referred The Nation article on this issue; <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/193185/cia-didnt-just-torture-it-experimented-human-beings">The CIA Didn’t Just Torture, It Experimented on Human Beings | Reframing the CIA’s interrogation techniques as a violation of scientific and medical ethics may be the best way to achieve accountability.</a></p>

<p>Why I didn&#39;t stick with the original article, because somebody else had posted it and it has removed by the mods due to the submission rules. I also had submitted another article about this issue but it had get removed as well - this is the best article option left for submitting to this subreddit.</p>

<p>A more skeptical person may even draw the conclusion that the worldnews mods intentionally ONLY let the Iran article through, just to give their readers an excuse to dismiss it or call for it to be deleted.</p>

<p>Well aren&#39;t they just <em>so</em> crafty! I wonder why users don&#39;t just exodus that sub? Stories like this are why I don&#39;t even bother wasting my time there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually surprised people on this subreddit approve of opinion pieces, they are the mainstream media&#39;s way of putting out straight propaganda after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I&#39;ve seen shit articles that were entirely opinion (and speculative opinions at that) all over the place on r/worldnews. Of course these were articles demonizing Putin and whipping up fear about what Russia &quot;might do next&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess opinion pieces are OK when they fit in with someone&#39;s agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very least, Reddit has a clear groupthink problem when it comes to Putin and Russia. At the worst it&#39;s fairly obvious propaganda. Everything Putin&#39;s done as simply been a reaction to what we did first, which was to &quot;help&quot; over through a sitting government and get our guy elected....and if that meant having to support a neo-nazi...so be it, because that&#39;s what we did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one of the conspiracy mods is also a mod of worldnews. he really believes presstv is a legit source, and probably other mods and a whole lot of their users also believe it, you have your outrage meter calibrated incorrectly. You should be mad that people on reddit, especially in news, worldnews, and conspiracy (and other smaller subs) take presstv and rt seriously, and as proof it is legit they point to how biased some American media can be.</p>
