       Here is the permalink to the post, but I recomend reading the thread for context:

       And here is the quote for the lazy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Something mysterious and I hope some other people saw it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was one of the early people that saw his instagram page before it went down and I was going thru his stuff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saw the two posts that reference shooting cops. So I was going through it again to send the instagram link to a friend, and as I went back, there was a new post showing a picure of Tupac and others from the movie Juice. THIS WAS NEW, after he was already dead. Upon clicking on the post to see it, it said the post was gone, and then his entire instagram was gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I REALLY hope someone else saw that Juice post and got a screen grab of it, because it definitely went up AFTER, then it disappeared.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was confirmed by the "citizen journalist" in that thread reporting all of the news as well, so at least two people saw this and probably many more.

       Some are saying that he sent the message in the subway, while there was no service,  and it sat on his phone until the guy was carried out, dead, above ground. At that point the phone was again connected and so sent the message.

       Indeed. It is, however, important to consider the 'conspiracy angle' before dismissing it outright.  And to reopen it if new evidence comes to light.
      </p>

       Of course, this applies to any theory, not just that of 'conspiracy'.

       So I'm really expected to believe that amidst a protest about racial conflict, this 'gunman' posted on twitter that he's going to kill two cops, then takes pictures of his gun, his clothes that he will wear for the shoting, all three hours before it happens, and the cops he kills just happen to be participating in a terrorist DRILL? Also he supposedly killed his girlfriend last Saturday in Baltimore. Do people actually buy this bull shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The tragic heroes were working overtime as part of an anti-terrorism drill in Bedford-Stuyvesant" - blatant upstaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A suspect was found shot at the scene and rushed to a nearby hospital." - 'a' suspect? Or /the/ suspect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the 'sources' for his tweets, if found in the three hour period before the incident, just went unnoticed? When people are being jailed over what they say on Facebook? Right. .
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m Putting Wings on Pigs Today,” a person 'believed' to be the gunman wrote on Instagram in a message posted just three hours before the officers were shot.

      <p>
       Edit: even though the NY post says 'Brinsley was a fugitive who had just murdered his girlfriend in Baltimore Saturday morning, sources told The Post., the updates for the link op lists says
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT #3. Last I heard, the girl he shot this morning is alive &amp; stable. Here is a press release regarding that from Baltimore County PD.

       I apologize for not trusting everything I see on the news after events like Sandy Hook and Boston. I would also like to know what 'terrorist drill' involved sitting in a parked car. All I know is the last 2 times a terrorist drill was going ok 911 happened as well as the England bombings.

       The NY post article says murdered, not shot. I don't suppose you were reacting this way when aN innocent man died for selling cigarettes?  What exactly makes another's life more valuable?  I don't see anyone up in arms in the countless innocent men, women, and children killed by the multiple drone strikes we've done.  I'm all for compassion but if you're going to be a humanitarian don't side one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the blatant upstaging I was referring to is trying to turn victims into hero's, just because  you died wearing a badge or soldier uniform does not automatically make you a hero.
