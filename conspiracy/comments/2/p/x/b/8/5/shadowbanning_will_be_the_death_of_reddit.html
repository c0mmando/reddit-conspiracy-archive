I have been shadowbanned in large subreddits before, and now I&#39;ve noticed that even innocent, small submissions are shadowbanned by mods of small subreddits as well. If mods do not like your post, or what you say, you are shadowbanned. I do not think they do it centrally based on your IP, but for every account individually. So what we see right now on reddit is a heavy moderated content, which basically negates the entire purpose of reddit. </p>

<p>No you have not, you may of been banned from a sub but you can&#39;t get shadow banned from a sub.  It seems like a lot of people here don&#39;t understand that mods ( the people that create and run subs)  are not the admins of Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mods can issue a shadowban of sorts by placing the users account in an automod filter which silently censored their comments and submissions.</p>

<p>I am currently in the automod filter for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for criticizing the mods.</p>

<p>That said, what is quite disheartening is that at one point in reddits history if a mod removed a comment there would be a [deleted] tag left in its place. Now, thr only time a deleted tag appears is if a deleted comment already had a reply at the time it was removed. In essence, allowing every mod comment removal to be &quot;silent&quot;.</p>

<p>Not to mention, some subs to this very day do not inform users with a flair or an mod comment when a submission is removed.</p>

<p>That said, the OP is right the current level of moderation and manipulation of content across multiple s ubreddits is abhorrent and a direct affront to the free flow of information.</p>

<p>I was having a good debate just the other day with another mod, he was arguing that because reddit has shifted its prime directive away from free flowing information to entertainment, there is little that can be done to redress the current trend towards hyper moderation.</p>

<p>Im not sure I agree with his position, as, much like was proved in the digging v4 situation, if users become aware that an aggregate is being manipulated behind the scenes it will fall very fast.</p>

<p>While this is true it is not a shadowban and would need another word to describe it. Open is talking about shadowbans in a way that shadowbans do not work. I think he&#39;s been banned and he&#39;s confused about what that means. Allowing the use of shadowban, a sidewide censoring that only administrators (read Reddit administrations, not mods) can use, to be used as OP does will only add to the confusion for people who do not understand the difference.</p>
