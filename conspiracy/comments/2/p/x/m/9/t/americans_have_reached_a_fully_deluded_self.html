       Preface: This new account of mine was an experiment. I tried to find out how people on reddit respond to dissenting views that do not support the perceived status quo US propaganda has established.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, of course, is not a scientific study at all, this is about making my own experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am looking for genuine discussion about my experiences. I would be glad to be proven wrong.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       It has become evident to me that American apologists have created a self-perpetuating skewed reality for themselves that they are violently defensive about. Their delusions about their own superiority drove them to hate all dissent. They desperately try and censor all dissent and try to enforce conformity without compromise. They offer zero rational argumentation for that but instead respond with sarcasm, deliberate misrepresentation of other people's positions, extreme and completely irrational attacks on people's characters, and deluded views such as everyone disagreeing with them being a Russian/Chinese nationalist, a paid shill or terrorist (i.e. "not us", "them" or "the enemy").
      </p>
      <p>
       What I fear has happened: Americans have become fully subverted through fear and a false sense of historical superiority and they began to support tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw it in Nazi German, we see it again today in the US. Not only have Americans a surprisingly bad grasp on history and current events around the world, they officially support US hegemony and its crimes. Either directly through positive support or indirectly through perpetuating the perceived "fact" of the futility of opposing the US. Their behaviour is nothing short of insane at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I think this? Because US-supporters on this site are apologetic about even the worst of US crimes. Because they continue to believe that the nations they were indoctrinated to hate (e.g. China, Russia, etc.) are actually worse than the US (which, quite frankly, isn't the case... at least not any longer). Because they say that we must tolerate the crimes of the US because opposing the US would lead to suffering due to the US having a stranglehold on everyone due to the way it is tied into global economics (defeatist).
      </p>
      <p>
       Every US-critical comment is violently attacked and censored by them. Everything not supporting their views is blindly dismissed without arguments. The people of this site are deeply indoctrinated into a radical and ignorant anti-Chinese, anti-Russian mindset while even the worst of the worst crimes committed by the US are desperately excused by them. Usually with nothing but fingerpointing and whataboutism.
      </p>
      <p>
       My views are hard to digest but nothing I ever say on this site is unsubstantiated and I'm always willing and able to debate everything I say in a constructive and thorough manner. Not a single statement I made was ever made in a dishonest manner and I always gladly answer questions, but my statements are - without exception - met with foaming hostility, with personal attacks, with totally blind dismissal, without a single attempt to be understood by these people, with deliberate misrepresentations, with undue sarcasm, with actual lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way: It is extremely hard to defend oneself against the onslaught of negative comments because of the way reddit censors content. If you get downvoted often, you will automatically have your posting privileges reduced. I can only write one comment every 10 minutes. This contributes to a self-perpetuating situation where dissenting opinions can be quickly drowned. (Not saying this is deliberate but it's still a sad fact of how reddit works and how it plays directly into the hands of those who want to create a pro-US echo chamber.)
      </p>
      <p>
       US nationalism is rife on this site and the people seem to have officially bought into the notion of US exceptionalism. I don't know what to do. Americans seem to be fundentally unreasonable and intellectually incapable of having a rational conversation at this point. They actually still think of their country as better than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a list of comments of mine that are critical of the US. Look at the comments I received in return:

      <p>
       Look at my comment history for more examples. Pretty much every comment of mine receives the same response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. I admit that my comments are provocative and aggressive (not without reason, in my opinion), but I am always reasonable and always able and willing to substantiate my views. I am met with nothing but blind hate and irrational non-arguments amounting to dismissal and personal attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: I don't know what to do any longer. Americans don't respond to reason at all. They are indoctrinated to the point of anti-intellectualism and thought terminating babbling. They seem to want conflict and war and are completely indifferent towards the destruction their nation causes. Their desperation and ignorance and irrational attitude will eventually lead to major international conflict. In fact, it already does. How can we stop this? I genuinely don't know what to do and how to respond. The attitude of American apologists is nothing short of dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: My title should read "blissfully ignorant". I guess that's what I get for using too many of what the American apologists I am talking about would call "buzzwords" which they would blindly dismiss as "edgy" (this "edgy, and "euphoria" stuff, by the way, is entirely anti-intellectual - regardless how "pseudo intellectual" people attacked with such words may be - and another huge part of the problem worthy of yet another discussion in itself).

       As a veteran and American born citizen I can honestly tell you that I agree with pretty much everything you posted. Americans are to the point where, as you indicated, they simply do not want to even hear the truth anymore. The Big Lie is more comforting for them. All of us are born into this lie, the illusion of American virtue, and very few choose to admit that they see through it.

       This post is so spot on! I spend plenty of my time trying to inform my fellow Americans about the lies that surround every facet of our lives. Whether it be the utter domination of our nation's finances due to central banking, or the fact that VIP pedophilia rings might have members in high places of the US government. I am always met with regurgitated responses that the media has spoon fed to them. I'm seen as the irrational one for not trusting a government that tries to get away with raping little boys in front of their mothers "in the name of national security."

       It's not delusional, in my opinion.  It's ignorance of important facts and events that were deliberately obscured.  It's manipulation and propaganda from a very intelligent, well funded government that has its hands in nearly every aspect of American life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think people think the "Big Lie" is more comforting, as
       <a href="/u/sudo-tleilaxu">
        /u/sudo-tleilaxu
       </a>
       suggests.  I don't think it's that purposeful of a delusion.  I think people are mislead.  You can't blame the North Koreans for believing Kim Jong Il was divine.  They've been hearing one narrative since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Hero story begins in first grade textbooks, and continues through adulthood by means of government funded blockbusters, legal televised propaganda, various manipulation tactics outlined in some of the Snowden leaks, and bullshit phrases like "The American Dream" and "The Land of Opportunity."
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is an empire, pure and simple. The goal of an empire is control over resources, land, and people.  The ironic beauty of US propaganda is that its goal is to empower citizens to agree with the goals of the government, to believe that the rich are rich because of hard work and that the poor are poor because of laziness.  The powers that be have been very successful in getting people to believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not true, and in our nation's history, it has never been true.  Looking at even the most rudimentary history of the country will show that "All men are created equal" really means "All rich, preferably white, preferably Christian, American men are created equal."
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two kinds of people, those who take the world they find themselves in at face value, and those who examine the facts and evidence before forming an opinion or belief.  For a very, very long time, most people in the country were in the first camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion is that, thanks to the internet mostly, people are moving to that second camp.  When the summation of human knowledge is available on every smartphone, computer, tablet, whatever, it is easy to fact check and call bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rise in corruption that appears evident in the US is really a rise in public availability of the truth versus the official story.  It's harder for the CIA to claim they don't torture, when the torture report exists in PDF form and can be accessed by any internet capable device in the country.  It's harder for the NSA to keep the scope of their activities a secret when massive amounts of files can be taken and leaked by anyone with a small amount of computer knowledge and the proper opportunity.  It's harder for Dick Cheney to appear genuine, when we can pull up a video of him contradicting himself on a chat show seconds after he delivers a half truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fear.  There will always be two camps of people.  As technology develops, and information is more and more readily available to every human in the country, the individual accountability for beliefs and facts rises.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the "Big Lie" is simply too big to hit someone with if they're fully indoctrinated into believing the government is Of, By, and For the People.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to turn the uninitiated into a skeptic, start by slowly letting them realize the US isn't perfect. Don't start with current examples.  Use well known historical examples like the Native American genocide, slavery, voting  inequalities, etc. to illustrate that US law does not equate with morality, and that US law does not always have the interests of the public in mind, but sometimes works to benefit the existing structure.
      </p>

       Then delve deeper with credible evidence of government manipulation in exposed conspiracies.  I like to use the declassified MKUltra files, the well documented case of the CIA pumping crack into black neighborhoods, and the current torture case (which, lest we forget, is proof of the government lying to it's citizens and a government conspiracy, as well as a war crime).

       Explain the concept of following the money to the tippity top, and show how the banks once seized control during the 20th century with the "robber barons." Show how Wall Street manipulated US law in the 80's, and then the Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren speeches that eloquently illustrate (from a member of Congress, no less) the control that the banks have over the government during the present administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start with the person who believes America is the image they pretend to be, and you hopefully end with a person who can see that there is a ruling class who are virtually exempt from Law, and an underclass that is purposefully manipulated and exploited by the ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the while, you have not said one thing you cannot back up with credible evidence and primary sources.  Be careful not to move through the topics too fast, and never insinuate that the person is dumb or uneducated for not already knowing what you're showing them.  Use the socratic method, and be patient.

       It's every citizen's personal responsibility to educate him/herself and be an informed, rational person. They are adults so they can be held responsible for their behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that these people aren't pulled out of the Matrix on their own is the whole point. The system has become self-perpetuating. People indoctrinate and censor each other because the nelievers in the lies of their government have become the majority. It has become an organized system of faith, with followers of the faith behaving exactly like followers of other organized religions. Talking to these people about these topics is like talking about biology with creationists.

       There is no time for patience. The US is murdering and torturing people
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       . We don't have time for acquiring the billions of dollar and generations of education it will take to make Americans abandon their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people will continue their rampage and their behaviour. The same way creationists do. They are unreasonable. Why do you think Richard Dawkins stopped debating creationists? He tried for years of his life to reason with them... they just don't listen. They are religious zealots. You know what debating with them instead of calling them out for being idiots does? It gives them credibility. It makes it look as if there is any merit to their position. It also gives them publicity. But they
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       admit to be wrong. They
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       change their minds. They don't adhere to basic standards of rationality and intellectual honesty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your solution to that problem? What do you believe explaining things to them will do? How long will it take? There is a reason the US threw two nuclear bombs on Japan, you know?

       Not everyone has been fortunate enough to have the experiences that allow them to realize they should investigate claims or seek intellectual honesty.  It is not a problem of willful ignorance, it is an environment that indoctrinates people from childhood.

       I am not suggesting we should spend years and billions of dollars on educating people in seminars about the nature of American government in present affairs. I am just suggesting that the method with which you present this information be diplomatic, understanding, clear, and fully supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the truth on your side, you have evidence of your arguments.  Take the time to present them in a manner someone of opposing beliefs will follow and agree with, and you have a much higher chance of leading them to an understanding than just attacking their beliefs and substituting your own.

       You are aware of things like the wars the US led over the last decades? Iraq? Afghanistan? US black sites? The US just released a report on US torture programs just a few days ago?

       Yes we are being divided. I had hoped that with the use of the Internet we would be able to overcome this but what I have found is more of the same. My hope is, in time we will start to work together but I believe it will take many, many more deaths. It seems to me that we are incapable of learning our lessons without tragedy. How many more need to die? Probably millions. Meanwhile I will try to open a dialog with as many divided groups as possible. There are three main pillars of power for the state and this is where we attack. 
1. Monopoly of information 
2. Monopoly of money
3. Monopoly of violence 
Right now the state's monopoly of information is dwindling. It's progress is slow but picking up pace. Using alternatives like Bitcoin is also on the rise. Decentralization can bring a state to its knees. The last one is the hardest and probably the most important. As a state weakens it becomes more violent in an attempt to control it's people. We have to win the hearts and minds of our military through reason. They are our countrymen, our families etc.. While doing these things it is also important to strengthen your community. Solidarity is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       This plan is not perfect and it may not work. Getting people to work together on a common idea is not an easy task. This is why I believe it will take a great tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more on these ideas you should read Gustav Lebon's Psychology of the Revolution. Also for mass movements, Gene Sharp's From Dictatorship to Democracy.

You get more flys with honey and all that. Personally I hoped that this sub would be a great place to talk to people with an open mind but it's not.

       Get a new name? Stop identifying with states or ideologies and start working on a new common ground. Nothing good will come from a polarizing, exclusive, us-vs-them worldview.

       This is hard and I'm not good at it either, but let's wake up to the necessity of building a truly inclusive world-wide identity. What does "we" mean? And what is it about "them" that makes them different from "us"?

       I'm angree too. All this crap I'm paying for. The world I'm going to leave for my children. Things are way out of hand and I can't seem to get through to anyone. This game of chess our governments are playing is dangerous for us and we stand divided as a world. I have more in common with you than I do my own leaders. If we could only agree on not killing each other for some other asshole that would kill us just the same. We need some kind of world wide movement.

       I have to admit sadly, you're right on.  I have been observing that very thing -- and I'm coming to believe, as you do, that it's the fault of the Americans, not anybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been saying, for example, how 9/11 is so obviously prepared to get us into Afghanistan and Iraq -- a false flag, that literally a child could see...
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe 100% that Bldg 7 on 9/11 (no planes at all, just minor office fires, actually brought down the skyscraper) was controlled demolition. Absolutely no question in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And essentially the same with the Pentagon -- having NO ONE in all of Washington looking at the Pentagon with a video (or 100 people) AFTER the second plane hit the Twin Towers is the height of incompetence, and I can't believe that anyone was that stupid. It's because a truck hit it instead, or a light plane possibly. A CHILD should believe that -- anyone would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you disagree?  A lot of other things too -- and it's much more than a feeling now that the common thread is that Americans are "blissfully deluded", whereas other countries are starting to wake up.

       OP can write!  Nice use of simile throughout.  I can tell you that I'm from the USA and have reached the same breaking point as you.  I'm astounded at how obvious the lies are and how oblivious nearly everyone is to them.  I honestly think the resistance to the truth is more apathy than anything else.  People here feel so ignorant that they don't think the truth is worth seeking.  Smart people think they have the whole truth and argue with you.  These are a lot of the people who get straight A's and a job that pays after college.    Im beginning to think the only thing for me to do is something super altruistic with an investigate 9/11 shirt on.  I'm just gonna go start picking up trash in the street.  Fuck.

       Most people think that a report going "CNN Reports that the President shits gold based on a state department briefing."  means that it is actually true.

       OK I just looked at your first post about putting sanctions on the US. I'm going to attempt to start a conversation with you about this idea. Keep in mind that I am an American and I have all the extra luggage that comes with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you want to sanction America. I assume you are in Europe, correct? How do you think this would effect you personally? Or innocent Americans? Did you consider the ramifications of an act of war on a super power? How will this in your opinion, create your desired goals?

       Yes, I'm from Germany.

      <ol>

        <p>
         It doesn't matter how it affects me personally. It will most likely suck for me, but it's a necessary sacrifice to protect global peace and freedoms and human rights. The US must be sanctioned and weakened at all cost due to the threat to humanity that it is. The same way negative consequences had to be suffered for fighting Nazi Germany (which was a smaller threat to the planet than the modern US).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are not many innocent Americans. Those protesting and working against the US government are a very small minority. They should be supported. The rest of the US population is guilty by association and carries a collective guilt. The same way the citizens of Nazi Germany did.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The US is the one committing acts of war. Including extremely hypocritical sanctions against Russia. The US is the aggressor. Any act of war against the US is a defensive action at this point. The ramifications of it? Well, the longer we wait to take action against the US, the more powerful it will become.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         My desired goal is to live free of the tyranny of the US and to destroy the standing of the US as the leading superpower as it is obviously not deserving of such a position considering iy constant and ongoing crimes against humanity, its self-righteous and destructive behaviour, and its unsustainable economics and politics creating growing inequality and hampering humanity's progress. Like all supporters of revolution throughout history, I would rather die free than live oppressed, so if the US wants to push for another world war, so be it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I personally believe that sanctioning and isolating the US economically and politically will lead to a slow degradation of US society to the point of revolution. It's just necessary that China, Europe, and South America stand together and forge closer ties. The US will turn more authoritarian, will censor even more, will spread more obvious propaganda. That will radicalize the population. Even at this point you have got to be quite a nationalistic radical to buy into the ridiculous narrative propagated by the US government and media. However, at that point, people will get even radical from an American perspective. Every halfway sane person will not buy into that crap any longer and form a resistance. A polarized population will lead to social and political unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor is that the only reason the people of the US aren't rioting against their undeniably terrible government is because they are rich and have a lot of personal freedom compared to the citizens of other countries. If they see that wealth degrading they will realize that they live in a nation that neglected everything that matters while their power dependa entirely on the economic and militaristic oppression and exploitation of others. People usually don't like to realize that they are the bad guys... and they like even less to be treated as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Americans realize that the whole world hates them and their government feeds them nothing but bullshit, they will eventually replace their leaders by force.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few decades we can resume closer ties with the US again after demanding is demilitarization so Europe and East Asia can take over the role of global leaders (both regions being more deserving of the power and control currently resting with the US, although I personally think Europe currently is better equipped due to its level of development and experience, while China has the superior political system).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe non of that is necessary, though. Maybe the world taking a united stand against the US will lead to the US government giving in to demands and actually changing for the better.

       Wow you can write a book! OK here is my response. I feel like your idea is coming from anger. I'm angry as well and can understand your plight. So I assume that your target audience is not Americans, right? Obviously we will not want sanctions as this will hurt our families and such. As open minded as I am I can't get behind this idea because I have a family and so on. So let me persuade you otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my own research I have found that my own government doesn't represent me. Nor does it represent any form of free humanity. There has been a coup of sorts that has taken over. In your assessment, I believe that you think America is a sovereign state. This is where we disagree. In my opinion  (based on research and observations) the problem is global in nature. This power, as it were, is an empire of economic interests. That is, it is not confined to any one state boarder. I believe our problems are the new boss, same as the old boss. We should stand together as a race against this force. Your cries for sanctions will not take root because there is no longer any sovereignty to any state. Germany, along with the rest of the EU have combined efforts along with the US and the UK 
to complete a world empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe our military is being used as mercenaries for a global cabal of free enterprise. In summary, your idea will never take and I feel that you could spend you time and energy on a different strategy. What we are doing right now, talking to each other, is probably the best thing to start a global revolution. We don't even need to be violent.

       Do you know why you get that?  Because Americans are breaking their backs paying for the military defense of Europe.  Germany gets their protection from the US military and now you only have to spend a very small amount on your own military.

       Really? How am I guilty? I protest my government and write my representatives to get the US out of Europe, to forge closer ties with our direct neighbours as well as Russia, EA, SA, and Africa, and I advocate the creation of an EU army and our exit from NATO. Tell me more about my guilt.

       Yeah, as much as I would like sanctions against the US (as an American, without dependents though) to get Americans to realize how most of the world sees us, I don't see it happening, or at least not soon. The actual power lies not within states but among global interests, though I do believe there are competing factions. The EU is too intertwined at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see BRICS making a play, though I'd expect them to wait for the US to decline a bit more.  They aren't entirely sovereign either, and I imagine their oligarchs feel more solidarity with western oligarchs than with their respective populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I think it comes down us acting together as a race.  There used to be an actual labor movement in this country, elsewhere too, though its nearly nonexistent now.  The American middle class (or myth thereof) believed they could become well off without looking out for those "beneath themselves." They took their higher paying jobs, and assumed their college degrees would keep them comfortable. They didn't realize or didn't care that the system functioned only because of resources and labor extracted from without and within their borders.  They believed themselves superior to other cultures, and their wealth was their proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our ignorance of how global economics have operated, we sold out our future making money for the capitalists.  We were becoming richer, so we didn't care or notice if the capitalists took most of the profit.  We thought
       <em>
        we were
       </em>
       the capitalists.  If other countries were poor, it was because we worked harder and smarter than them; it was their fault they were poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The substructure which held up this illusion fell out convincingly in 2008, but resources were marshalled to hold up the façade. Americans act as if they are Wile E Coyote; if we don't look down to see there's no ground beneath us, we don't think we'll fall. Many have families, and prefer they the illusion they know to be false to the uncertainty they can't predict, but pretending we're still on ground won't help.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is we need to leap.  I won't tell you we'll all make it across the chasm, and we certainly won't be unscathed, but if we stand still I guarantee we plummet.   We cannot count on the leaders who led us off the cliff, or the system they used to do it.  We must organize locally, regionally, and gloabally, yet not hierarchically.  We must focus on making life possible and rewarding for the least of us.  We must all leap together, holding hands.  If we let go to protect us and ours, we will fall.  If we try to push ourselves up by pushing others down, we fall.  We need to trust each other as a human family to persevere, though there be wolves among us. We are connected and cannot be kept apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing we need to do is understand this. Nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us do, yet most do not.  We need a critical mass, and once we have it, we will not be stopped.  We will refuse to participate in their game which we cannot win, nor barely survive. We will not need violence, yet it will be used against us. They will call us names and beat us and lock us up and kill us, and we will persevere.  This is what they fear, for our resilience will shame them and attract others.  Their weapons will only make us stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not following leaders, we will follow each other, and we will win.

       As a European who's been in discussions with Americans for years now I completely understand you. I personally have a bias towards Russia and China, I read Putin's speech transcripts whenever I can and everything he says makes complete sense to me. But if you try to look at the world from any other point of view than the western/American one you will be demonized and everyone will attack you no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because of the constant discussions with these people that I have become cold and can be extremely abusive in my comments nowadays, I simply can no longer tolerate ignorance and stupidity. I used to try to make my case but it doesn't matter at all how well you do your best. So the answer is not to do your best anymore and just call them a bunch of sticks. It saves energy and it even makes you feel better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in control of the US have completely and utterly fucked up the American mind, its a total mess in there.

       , of course.  Some of us are dedicated antiwar activists, some of us are Nazi-like jingoists, and most of us are oblivious.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I have to ask What is the root of the difference?  The difference, I believe is love.  The activist or revolutionist loves humanity -- including the human being in the mirror.  The fascist fears and hates the person in the mirror, and takes refuge in an artificial identity based on tribe, ethnicity or ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       This false precarious identity leaves the fascist alienated and inclined towards misanthropy and suicidal aggression.  To defend this identity, he clings to a delusion of Superiority, a delusion he maintains by denigrating and demeaning others.  As the delusion wears thin, he disdain for others becomes more vicious and sadistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here in America, many of us have been absorbed into the war machine. The machine is our identity.  I explore this thought further in

       There is nothing wrong with US Nationalism or Exceptionalism when those two attributes are placed in the proper context and deserving. Neither of these attributes should be boulsterous or prideful and I would refrain from calling any of the many jingoistic people on reddit that you described as representative of true American principles.

       If it's not blind ignorance from the uneducated, then I think it's just a simple coping mechanism against cognitive dissonance.  It's human nature; not claiming to have mind-blowing philosophy here or anything, but I've made a point of seeing this type of thing at the individual level.  It's not "American apologists", or "Religious nutjobs", it's a person who has found a method that works for them, however maladaptive it may be.  Unfortunately, our current US government seems to force a public wanting to be part of a great nation into bizarre ways of thinking, which is unsettling since it affects even very smart, level-headed people.

       American born..... I'm not blind to or avoiding what I see as America going from an admired and respected country to something less than desirable. We've allowed the corporate mentality of "profit above all else" to invade our politics. Now we seem to be about owning the world and controling everything in it. Not the America I want.

       Willful ignorance is hard to combat. Though, discourse is the only valid way of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Divide et Impera. We are conquered through divide and so to combat this you must put forth positive rhetoric that builds up and bridges to those stuck in the back of the cave.

       uber_satan and holocauster-ride. Did either of you think that the responses to you would be skewed with just inflammatory names? Especially accounts that didn't bother writing non-confrontational remarks. The only comments would be things that were obviously meant to push buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is, people would mark you as a troll account pretty easily and respond as such or just ignore you altogether. So you wouldn't actually get any positive remarks to begin with, since people would probably just assume you were a troll.

       For me that was part of the point
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to be as "in your face" as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people acted rationally and had informed and reasonable opinions and arguments, they should be able to easily respond to my opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people were confident about their position, they could stay calm and respond to me. Even if they think I'm some deranged lunatic, reasonable people would read my comments and respond calmly and explain why I'm wrong providing falsifiable arguments. Usually I do that myself, the same way I'm doing here. I will respond thoroughly and honestly, explaining myself and stating falsifiably why I believe someone else is wrong. Regardless how aggressive the person is, regardless how dumb and misguided that person is. However, Not a single person did that in response to my comments. Not a single one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people actually were informed and had arguments, they would provide them. They would be able to understand my position and respond to it. It's obvious that they don't. They act out of impulse and preconceived notions. They stopped questioning. They regurgitate positions that were created by others. They repeat empty clichés like mantras and pretend they are arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing behind their behaviour except for their delusions. They have become indoctrinated useful idiots that believe what they are told to believe. They have become aggressive zealots who don't even try to understand other people's position and can't provide arguments for either their nor against other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I wrote comments with this account I made my case very explicitly. There is nothing that could be misunderstood. I wasn't obtuse, I wasn't vague. I was straight to the point and left lots of room for disagreement, giving everyone the chance to prove that I'm wrong. They couldn't. Yet still they attacked me and dismissed me and were extremely aggressive about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I also think holocauster_ride is fucking with you down there in those comments, haha.

       I am trying to see what people really think. People tend to hide the truth when they are feeling calm. This is the same strategy the CIA was using by torturing people (but they went a bit too far...) - make people uncomfortable and they reveal the truth.

       I could be wrong about the causes (and there could be lots), but the point is that nearly 2/3 Americans have objectively been brainwashed into believing that torture is justified, in contravention of their obligations to the international community.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has lost legitimacy, and foreign countries are now justified in taking the necessary steps to protect themselves from a rogue state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons WHY America is a criminal state matter less than the fact THAT America is routinely violating basic human rights on a global scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything deserves an International response it is this blatant disregard for humanity.

       I'm not really worried about your experiment... You're the one that did it and posted about it here. I was just stating why the reactions you got might not have actually been a good representation of people. I didn't want to talk about America at all with you. I was just making a point about the experiment you brought up. Since you seem to want to have another discussion, and do not care that your experiment was flawed, I'll go.

       I've heard of the report. Unfortunately it seems like the specifics on how it was conducted or how many people were polled weren't released. So unlike you seem to be taking it, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. I wouldn't be shocked either way though. I'm not here to argue politics with you. I wanted to talk about your experiment. Your responses further show you seemed to have set out on the experiment actively looking to confirm your hypothesis instead of doing it neutrally. I have no care to talk politics.

       Don't tell me what to come here for. You have absolutely no fucking authority over me or this sub. Also you know nothing of my opinions to call me brainwashed. It's easier to insult than debate, and in your case you've shown that you try to be a jackass to get responses out of people (AKA trolling).

       And that link you gave to prove your point, it says nothing of the number of people polled or the polling technics. So maybe, maybe, you should read your own links before looking like an illiterate.

       It's their responsibility to stay informed and fight their government. Who else is supposed to do it? They don't. A majority keeps supporting the US government, the rest is complacent and apathetic.

       Literally none of the examples you posted are substantiated. You provide no sources, make "bold" claims mixed with ad hominem and tu quoque attacks, with the occasional red herring and then turn around and accuse everyone else as being intellectually dishonest.

       Israel's criminal treatment of Palestinian's has nothing to do with efforts against Ebola. You classify the US as the worst human rights without providing any evidence. How do you rank it anyways? Is having a feeding tube shoved up your ass worse than being executed for your religious beliefs or sexual orientation inherently worse? Or vice versa? You call it a rogue nation when it's backed by a legion of major powers and smaller countries -- including your own, your country is an accomplice. This does not make it right in any way shape or form, but is by definition not rogue. And you make flimsy excuses and justifications for the ones that don't back it.

       The number of people wronged in relation to how severely they are harmed/how many human rights are being violated. Its NSA spying alone already violates pretty much everyone using the internet, so that should be easy to comprehend, although I never based my position on that because Americans usually start whining that the right to privacy isn't a human right (which is wrong, but Americans apologists usually seem to believe that if people aren't directly and physically harmed it's not abuse of people's rights).

       It is a rogue nation because it is violating international law and refuses to stop although even its allies tell them to. It is the biggest threat to global peace and freedoms and human rights.

       You complain about people responding to your posts with anger and sarcasm, but did you even stop to read your own writing? Those posts you linked are constructed with the sole intent to rile people up, and then you add in edits insulting anyone who disagrees with you.
      </p>

       If anyone looked at your post history, they'd see you posting the exact same anti-US garbage in numerous other threads. The logical conclusion is that you're a troll or a shill, so i really can't blame anyone for calling you out. Your comments add nothing of value to the threads, and they just make you look extremely naive to think the US is the only guilty party.

       You make a whole lot of assertions about how people should act in the face of what in that comment. I'm not sure any of them or true or have any basis. But I get your point, I just don't agree with it. Thanks for sharing.

       Yes we are being divided. I had hoped that with the use of the Internet we would be able to overcome this but what I have found is more of the same. My hope is, in time we will start to work together but I believe it will take many, many more deaths. It seems to me that we are incapable of learning our lessons without tragedy. How many more need to die? Probably millions. Meanwhile I will try to open a dialog with as many divided groups as possible. There are three main pillars of power for the state and this is where we attack. 
1. Monopoly of information 
2. Monopoly of money
3. Monopoly of violence 
Right now the state's monopoly of information is dwindling. It's progress is slow but picking up pace. Using alternatives like Bitcoin is also on the rise. Decentralization can bring a state to its knees. The last one is the hardest and probably the most important. As a state weakens it becomes more violent in an attempt to control it's people. We have to win the hearts and minds of our military through reason. They are our countrymen, our families etc.. While doing these things it is also important to strengthen your community. Solidarity is key.

       This plan is not perfect and it may not work. Getting people to work together on a common idea is not an easy task. This is why I believe it will take a great tragedy.

       For more on these ideas you should read Gustav Lebon's Psychology of the Revolution. Also for mass movements, Gene Sharp's From Dictatorship to Democracy.

       More meaningless clichés. Don't you get sick of always being wrong and never having arguments to offer?
