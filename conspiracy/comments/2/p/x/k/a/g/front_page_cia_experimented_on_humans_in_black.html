    <div class="md"><p>I fucking knew it. A few days ago I even made a comment speculating about this very possibility. Now I&#39;m going to go a bit further.</p>

<p>This is why we&#39;re seeing a limited hangout torture report. This might even be part of what&#39;s contained in those other 5400 pages of the report. It shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise either. I&#39;m sure the CIA and their buddies have been itching to continue what they started with MKUltra. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if the research ever stopped?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. How to stop public outrage? Just stop telling people about it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;d be silly to believe the cia actually thought &quot;Oh shit, y&#39;all don&#39;t want us to do this? We&#39;ll stop right now&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly, the program was ended in the late 1970&#39;s. When the torture report came out, some suggested it was a limited hangout. So I started wondering what else they might still be trying to conceal. I mean, you&#39;re admitting torture... what could possibly be left to conceal?</p>

<p>That&#39;s when it occurred to me. Experimentation. Like what the Nazis were accused of in WWII. Like what the CIA got caught doing before with MKUltra.</p>

<p>So now here it is on the front page of reddit. You&#39;d think that a story about the CIA engaging in human experiments, or even the possibility of it, should be the biggest news story of the decade. Let&#39;s turn to CNN/FOX/BBC and see if they have any coverage of this.</p>

<p>I predict one of two possible reactions. A) no coverage at all. B) Coverage that portrays such accusations as unreliable, accompanied by flat out denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That second comment string was going strong for a very long time, then somebody had to add a hit piece on the end of it. That comment skyrocketed out of nowhere. Just compare it to the rest of the comments it&#39;s competing with. +1, +2, etc. It&#39;s at 36 right now. Where the hell did those votes come from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the vote variations are insane in some of those comment trees. Basically it boils down to 2 scenarios, either people are mass-upvoting any comment that allows them to &quot;shut-off&quot; and dismiss the story, or a large team of people is going through as an organized campaign to pump up those posts and create the illusion of social proof.</p>

<p>I would actually guess that it is somewhere in between. Both are happening, but as one feeds the other, it is hard to tell the extent of the manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it seems like there is already a coordinated movement to classify the piece as an opinion piece and to get it booted from the sub as &quot;Iranian propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>Its freaking nuts. Even though The Nation and a couple other outlets are running the same story.</p>

<p>Actually, the OP was saying that he tried submitting those but the mods wouldn&#39;t allow it, and the only one they allowed through was the one from Iran media. </p>

<p>SKETCHHHYYYYYYY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what the OP wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Referred The Nation article on this issue; <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/193185/cia-didnt-just-torture-it-experimented-human-beings">The CIA Didn’t Just Torture, It Experimented on Human Beings | Reframing the CIA’s interrogation techniques as a violation of scientific and medical ethics may be the best way to achieve accountability.</a></p>

<p>Why I didn&#39;t stick with the original article, because somebody else had posted it and it has removed by the mods due to the submission rules. I also had submitted another article about this issue but it had get removed as well - this is the best article option left for submitting to this subreddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2pwetc/cia_experimented_on_humans_in_black_sites_report/cn0l50f">Original</a></p>

<p>A more skeptical person may even draw the conclusion that the worldnews mods intentionally ONLY let the Iran article through, just to give their readers an excuse to dismiss it or call for it to be deleted.</p>
