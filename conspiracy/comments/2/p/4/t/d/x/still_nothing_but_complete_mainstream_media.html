    <div class="md"><p>As soon as it happened I told my buddies that this was a Ukrainian 9/11 to a degree. It was fantastic Problem, Reaction, Solution which was multifaceted and brilliant.</p>

<p>Look what has happened since. The country&#39;s currency has been in the toilet, the government is a US puppet, and it&#39;s been reported that the government has unleashed its air force and serious firepower against the &quot;Russian-backed&quot; rebels who voted to leave months before the crash.</p>

<p>It also affected the supply of natural gas to Europe (and something the Russians game planned for with Nord Stream in 2011), where they can simply cut off those pipelines if Ukraine won&#39;t agree to pay back the billions owed (that they can just take for their own people due to how pipelines work).</p>

<p>If we could get Assad out of the way for the South Pars pipeline, the US would be in fucking business, but our efforts to frame Assad with chemical weapons failed last summer, and we had to manufacture this ISIS beheading thing to get the &#39;muricans to be OK with airstrikes.</p>

<p>Our boys are trying to get the job done, and the losers are the usual: the proles of Ukraine (obviously), Russia (sanctions have to be hurting them), all of those being brutalized in the Middle East by the ISIS Team (who surprisingly don&#39;t even try and attack Israel), and possibly EU citizenry if there&#39;s issues with natural gas availability.</p>

<p>But us &#39;muricans can&#39;t get enough of The Voice, the Sons Of Anarchy finale and gasoline creeping towards $2.00/gal (thanks King Saud) and don&#39;t care or are far to distracted. It really is a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &quot;they&quot; were trying to shoot down the plane so it crashed in territory held by Russian freedom fighters, but for what I heard the plane took a sharp left after being hit and moved away before being finished off. If the plane crashed in the area intended, NATO forces could have moved in (&quot;invaded&quot;) under pretext of securing the crash site, but with the real purpose of assisting Ukraine troops. But when it crashed outside of that zone there was no context to launch plan B.</p>

<p>Ukraine is losing that war. NH17 shoot down was an attempt to reverse Ukraine/NATO/Zionist fortunes.</p>

<p>So we haven&#39;t heard anything more about the crash because it no longer serves the intended purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one cares unless it&#39;s on the news.  If it&#39;s on the news then it sets off a chain of reasoning that implies that it&#39;s worth knowing about because professional news authorities vetted it for its significance.  The viewer will also remember the news presented to him in order to keep up with conversations in the office and to avoid appearing ignorant in front of his peers.  </p>

<p>Edit: Maybe downvoters misunderstood.  It&#39;s <em>because</em> of the implication that &#39;if it&#39;s on the news, then it&#39;s important to know&#39; that the media is able to tell people what they should know or think.  In other words, it&#39;s not news because it&#39;s important, it&#39;s important because it&#39;s news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ukrainian president was in Australia last week for a two day state visit. The PM Tony Abbott said the MH17 tragedy had brought their two countries together blah blah blah. So now it seems we are going to sell them our coal and uranium because according to Abbott Australia is an energy superpower, and Ukraine has been suffering, in his own words, energy shocks.
Australia, Netherlands and Ukraine have signed a secrecy pact on information regarding the crash and Malaysia has been left out of the investigation altogether. Curious considering they owned the plane. 
A joint bid by Australian relatives of those that were killed to have an independent investigation by the UN has been rejected. 
Tony Abbott threatened to shirt-front Putin at the G20 over MH17, that was a diplomatic gaffe but we&#39;d expect nothing less from our PM, he&#39;s not very popular with the voters. If it comes out that Ukraine was responsible, he&#39;ll be well and truly up shit creek in a barbed wire canoe without a paddle, even though he&#39;s pretty much up there already.<br/>
Where is the black box info.....the tapes from Ukraine ATC...? The silence is deafening.</p>

<p>If you think there&#39;s &quot;mainstream media silence&quot; on the crash then please, look again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need to look. I have ears and live in the world. When the flight went down, it was literally impossible to escape the media circus screaming from the ends of the Earth about how this was all Putin&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>Then we were told the investigation was going to be led by the Dutch, and it was implied by Western media that this was only a formality because of the mountains of evidence against the Russian-backed rebels.</p>

<p>Since then....crickets.</p>

<p>The silence is deafening.</p>

<p>Unless you can post some mainstream media links that show the mountains of evidence we were assured the Dutch would release, since the case was so &quot;cut and dry&quot; and it was so &quot;obviously the rebels&quot;.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t insult my intelligence by posting some random blurbs by mainstream sources. You know that there is a difference between small web articles and the typical media full-frontal assault on all channels.</p>

<p>Anyways, reddit is mainstream media at this point and judging by the ridiculous bias for upvoting anything that demonizes Russia, it is blatantly obvious that if anything were found, we would have heard it by now. This site would have beaten that story like a dead horse. I check this site every single day, both on peak European and peak North American time.</p>

<p>The Dutch accident board investigation is ongoing. The final report isn&#39;t slated to be ready until late 2015. These things take time. You don&#39;t release everything you&#39;re doing as you&#39;re doing it in an aviation accident investigation. That&#39;s not how anyone does it and it&#39;s not going to happen here.</p>

<p>(source - Live in the Netherlands and work in aviation)</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the aviation side of it. The criminal investigation is by around 200 staff of the Dutch Ministry of Justice, and you certainly don&#39;t run around releasing everything you&#39;ve got as soon as you get it, especially when there are many nations cooperating and providing intelligence. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Why would you imagine this would be released while a complicated investigation is still going on? Where did you get that idea that we were &quot;assured&quot; of this?</p>

<p>It took weeks/months for the area around the crash site to become secure enough for materiel to be taken, that&#39;s where your metallurgy and fragment identification comes in. If you think the Dutch aren&#39;t being scrupulous in this you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>This is why the media coverage isn&#39;t what it used to be. Becuase the work that&#39;s happening now is slow, painstaking and not public. </p>

<p>There was plenty of coverage of the memorial out at Eindhoven airport last month, there is constant coverage in Dutch (and I imagine Malaysian) media.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t insult the intelligence of everyone reading this by stating that the difference between the Russian state and pro-Russian Ukrainian rebels is nonexistent. </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing like &quot;blatantly obvious&quot; for reasons already stated - these investigations don&#39;t go public on everything they get all at once. Like anything else, you build a case. The conclusion you are drawing is that since we haven&#39;t heard anything there&#39;s nothing to hear, which is ridiculous to the point of parody.</p>

<p>Especially on an investigation that isn&#39;t slated to conclude until August 2015. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that, however, the Western media has done a bang-up job convincing millions of people that these two entities are one and the same.

<p>Yes, as usual, a perfectly convenient timeline so that those <em>actually</em> responsible get the benefit of the public no longer caring since they will have moved on to the next flavor of the month. And isn&#39;t it amazing how that always happens to benefit the government story?</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny because I distinctly remember hundreds of articles blaming the Russian-backed &quot;rebels&quot; during the initial aviation accident investigation. </p>

<p>The weak point you are trying to make is based completely on backing up the current deafening silence. You have decided that this silence is normal and you are building an argument around that conclusion. If we were not experiencing this silence right now and getting &quot;leaks&quot; from the investigation that justified the initial &quot;It was Adolf Putler fault!&quot; reaction of Western media, then you would be sitting here claiming that &quot;leaks like this happen all the time, it is normal during an aviation accident investigation&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, here you are arguing (for the 1000th time) that we should all stop actually looking deeper than top layer. No thanks.  </p>

<p>I have heard the official story and the official explanations a million times. They are being shouted at me in every aspect of my life from co-workers, to the car radio, to the TV, internet, Facebook, reddit, etc...</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy subreddit, if you think that you can repeat these things and I am just going to say &quot;OMG, I never thought about that! I have literally heard it a million times but it took one million and one for me to finally get it! I guess I should just turn my brain off and let the TV do the thinking for me. Wow, it so easy now!!!&quot; then you are wrong.</p>

<p>No, back then you had top US government figures making exactly that stated case - that Saddam was in league with Al-Qaeda. Nobody reasonable is going around saying &quot;Russia shot down this plane&quot;. Don&#39;t throw &quot;semantics&quot; at a complex issue.</p>

<p>You cannot actually be this stupid.</p>

<p>Air accident investigations are complex things. It takes time. If you don&#39;t understand this I&#39;d be happy to explain more. </p>

<p>Look at two high-profile ones from the last couple of years. Similar aircraft types (one the exact same type, both hull-losses from well-regarded carriers).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_38#Final_report.2C_9_February_2010">Speedbird 38</a> - 2 years from accident to final report</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447#Final_report">Air France 447</a> - Over <em>three</em> years between accident and final report.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to make the argument that we haven&#39;t solved MH17 due to the Dutch government waiting for the public to forget that a couple of hundred of their citizens died in suspicious circumstances, and fabricating a convincing cover story <em>you will have to do an awful lot better</em>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a convenient timeline, it&#39;s the actual timeline of these kind of accidents. Of course we have interim brief reports in such cases, the&#39;re&#39;s already been one on MH17.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. I know it&#39;s normal because this is my field and I know what to expect. </p>

<p>You appear to have decided it&#39;s because &quot;those responsible&quot; (whoever they are) have decided to delay until the public have forgotten about the crash, without checking up to see how long a modern wide-body hull-loss investigation can take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were not experiencing this silence right now and getting &quot;leaks&quot; from the investigation that justified the initial &quot;It was Adolf Putler fault!&quot; reaction of Western media, then you would be sitting here claiming that &quot;leaks like this happen all the time, it is normal during an aviation accident investigation&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright if we could have <em>one</em> conversation where you don&#39;t put words in my mouth or getting onto whatever my m,otivations might be that would be lovely. You&#39;re making things personal when they really shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m commenting on this because it happens to be in my line of work and I thought your title was entirely misleading. If that&#39;s somehow unacceptable to you that isn&#39;t my problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, here you are arguing (for the 1000th time) that we should all stop actually looking deeper than top layer. No thanks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started off by correcting the title. Then to correcting ideas about accident investigation. Nothing to do with layers. If something is wrong, it&#39;s <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#39;t give two shits about what you&#39;re going to say or what you&#39;ve heard or how many times you&#39;ve heard it. It&#39;s the poor bastards who read this and think that no news during an accident investigation is evidence of foul play I feel sorry for.</p>

<p>of course it&#39;s a conspiracy subreddit, that doesn&#39;t mean it has to be a total bullshit subreddit at the same time.</p>
