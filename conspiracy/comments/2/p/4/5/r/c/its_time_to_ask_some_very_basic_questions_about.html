       I'll point out that I don't deny evolution. evolution is an observable phenomenon that can not be denied.
that being said the current theory that we humans descended from apes simply cannot be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       evolution is a very slow process that occurs over hundreds of thousands of years, even millions of years.
Here I'm talking about species to species evolution. Not evolution of specific attributes within a species, but evolution from one species into another.
fro example, evolving from a chimp into a human. This process would occur over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. I'll add that I don't believe that inter-species evolution does or even can occur naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, its safe to say that humans in their current form, have existed this way for hundreds of thousands of years, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the case, where is our history?
we can only trace human history back through archaeology maybe 20,000 or 30,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       what were we doing for the last 100,000 years before that, or the hundred thousand years before that?
modern society developed rapidly from a few thousand years ago.
if we can build and develop a technological global civilization over the course of 10,000 years.
what were the humans of the past who were identical to us in intellect and physical characteristics doing for all that time?
The only answer can be that they weren't here at all. otherwise advanced civilizations would have arisen in that time frame. If we can do it now, then they surely would have done it way back then.
Only they didn't.
I propose that our species has not been here on earth for very long.

       Humans didn't evolve from chimps, humans and chimps evolved simultaneously but separately from a common, proto-, ape-like ancestor.

       If you want to dig further into history and its alternative interpretations, Graham Hancock is really the leader in that field. Brian Foerster and Randall Carlson also have interesting and compelling theories as well.

       just go on following the herd.
just keep taking other people's word for how nature and the universe operate.
this is what education has become in U.S. after all. an indoctrination.
people who are unable to think for themselves just ingest other people's ideas. even if the ideas make no sense.

       More insults. Following the herd, indoctrinated, blah blah blah.

      <p>
       No. Evidence. Reproducible experiments. That's how science works. That's how we find truth. Figure out reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following the herd is your nose to the next lemming's ass, never asking where you're going or why. Never asking how things work. Never asking the questions that demand real, honest answers, which requires evidence. Never seeking proof. Following fantasy. Following superstition. Following what you were indoctrinated into from birth.

      <p>
       Science questions. Everything. Including itself. Over and over and over again. It is the MOST critical thinking approach.

       So if you have proof of something different, write that shit down, get it peer reviewed, and go collect your Nobel Prize and million dollars.

       Otherwise, all you have is fabrication and fantasy, and I haven't bought into that bullshit since I told religion to take a flying leap 4 decades ago.

       Be honest. You started with that thesis then filled in the narrative to match it, instead of the other way around?

       I do understand evolution. it is not a complex concept. 
I may have been generalizing in my post about the details though for simplicity 
sake.

       "Creating the building blocks on which their descendants built...." 
that's my point.
we know the rate of progress for our species.
if humans have been around for so long creating the building blocks, then explain the gigantic gap in time where we have no human progress for hundreds of thousands of years.

       Take a look at the growth curve. It's not linear. It's faster than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early steps are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       More current steps are much faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus don't forget about those 1,000 years of no / reverse progress during the Christianity-led Dark Ages. That was incredibly damning and damaging to our forward progress.

       Where we will be in 1,000 years, that is where we COULD be now. Conquered aging, disease, cancer, and interstellar travel.

       Yay testtube babies. There would still be disease if they're trying to farm us as livestock. They wouldn't give up on the whole medical fundraiser. Now, in a perfect world, sure, there'd be no disease ' cause they'd have their species of identical children based off one (or few) bloodline(s) that's reproduced. Why create imperfect DNA to spread around the galaxy? But then we'd all look like Rothschild or whoever overlooks the test tube baby sector. But i guess that's some people's dream is to not be unique and just conform to be one of the perfect crowd. Imperfections deserve to be deleted at that point, am i right? Man, i can't wait till we all are just a manufactured product and not a natural miracle

       I've had some thoughts along these lines. There is some evidence that
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       suggest we've had advanced civilizations in the past. These obviously didn't survive or leave much behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right off the bat, those who conform to historical orthodoxy will say "There's no proof of any of this".
      </p>
      <p>
       But how do you find proff of something if you aren't looking for it and don't believe it exists in the first place. Another comment mentions Graham Hancock and rightly so. If an ancient advanced civilization existed, say, 20,000 years ago... they might very well have been located in a coastal area. Sea levels were hundreds of feet lower back then. There's literally millions of square miles if ancient coastal areas that are now underwater.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for physical evidence, there's more than one way to be advanced. Advanced mathematics, philosophy or even psychology probably would leave much behind in terms of physical evidence. Yet those are legitimate characteristics of what we would consider to be advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       For decades, archaeologists thought that Sumeria and Egypt were the cradles of civilization. Then came the discovery of Catal Huyuk, over 3000 years older than either Sumeria or Egypt. Also, there's the megaliths at Gobekli Tepe... which date back to at least 11,000 BC.

       Who knows what still out the waiting to be discovered?

       I can't vouch for its veracity; only you can do that. But it looks like it's right up your alley.
