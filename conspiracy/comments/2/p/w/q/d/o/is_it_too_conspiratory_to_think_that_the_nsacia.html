       Regardless if they are behind it or not, they are almost certainly using propaganda to shift the narrative in the direction that they want.  I can't believe so many people are actually buying into the whole North Korea angle, it's not even close to being believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       They still won't release any videos from the over 100 cameras at the Pentagon on 9/11 because of "National Security" why would they be telling us details of this supposed North Korea terrorism hack on every news station if there was no agenda?

       Okay, but it's not until
       <a href="http://deadline.com/2014/12/sony-hack-timeline-any-pascal-the-interview-north-korea-1201325501/">
        the 21st day since the actors made themselves known
       </a>
       (Tues., December 15th) that the federal government 'claims' to get involved (along with the cybersecurity firm Mandiant). The SSCI CIA report was published December 9th, (8 months after a report was requested on events that happened ~11 years ago). There were 15 days of reporting on the Sony hack before the CIA report was released (and there was probably at least an additional week before Sony came out with the news or even realized they were hacked). It wasn't until December 18th that the federal government announced that (or I guess blamed it on, according to your opinions) North Korea was behind the attack. The North Korean government's response is basically,'We didn't do it, but it's real great that this happened.' Both stories are still being reported on daily on the same for-profit networks that ran all sorts of coverage on the Snowden leaks/Wikileaks/Manning/etc. Further, there has been (IMHO) great, almost daily in-depth coverage of congress' opinions on the torture reports (both for and against the CIA's actions) on the radio, television, news sites, and in print since its release. The same has happened for the Sony story, but most of it has been concentrated around Sony's profits and losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       (IMHO Section) If the federal government was trying to create a distraction from the SSCI CIA reports they've obviously failed: the story's everywhere. For the federal government to stage something like the Sony hack would require throwing hundreds of federal laws out the window and suppressing the findings and opinions of everyone involved in dissecting the attack and of everyone involved in the attack. It would also most likely require burning an access method (some sort of million-dollar 0-day or technique used by the U.S. to gain access to the network and subsequent boxes, unless Sony's security really was that weak), potentially developing bad relations between the U.S. government and U.S. companies (given everything is attributed back the U.S. eventually), and further damaging relations with North Korea (which the U.S. would like to avoid given North Korea is constantly playing the South Korea hostage game so that we'll hand over more aid). If the government really wanted to cover up the SSCI CIA report they could have just falsified everything in it given it happened ~11 years ago and given the 'government' released the report. And really, why shouldn't we expect this from a place like North Korea? Though, I suppose that's what they want you to think...

       I'm not necessarily saying that the government or Sony staged the hack (I wouldn't be surprised if they did) but even if someone or group did hack them the North Korea angle just seems silly,  they have nothing to gain by going to war over a movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the celeb nudes that were "hacked" and now the North Korea hack and terrorist threat, it seems likely they are ramping up for another round of Internet censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't researched this one enough to have a major opinion on the motives, but the story they are telling isn't believable to me.

       Well, you say 'they' and 'agenda', and somehow pull in a relation to 9/11. North Korea has almost 'gone to war' (hoped to launch primitive ICMB's) with the U.S. several times over seemingly trivial things. However, these trivial things are really the life-lines helping the North Korean leadership save face with their people while obtaining nation-saving aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how could this possibly work out in North Korea's best interest? The hack was probably justified in the beginning by North Korean leadership wanting to protect their leader from potential slander (being that the nation functions on the belief of a supreme leader). If the North Korean leader appears weak, the people of North Korea would revolt in an instant, but since his reach would appear far and strong (strong and far enough to hold a U.S. company hostage), the people fear worse things would happen to them should they question their leader. So this is good for North Korea because it protects their leader's image and makes the nation's capabilities look strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who's going to slap the North Korean's on the wrist and say 'Stahp it!'? Not Sony, because they're a big bitch. Also, who are they going to take to court? The U.S. government would have to step in with some sort of consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be scared of the repercussions, right? Not really. We can't really blow PuneYoung-Yang up, cause the rest of the world would freak out at the U.S. blowing up something that looks like a 1st or 2nd world country. Further, the "rules of cyber-engagement" that some military officer was hoping to get a blowjob for writing don't really exist yet, and a good number of people in the U.S. are outraged that someone can sit behind an air-conditioned drone keyboard and blow someone up half way around the world because hand-to-hand combat wasn't involved to determine the superior nation (just imagine justifying blowing something up because someone else touched your computer from their computer...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, end of rant. This guy mapped out the events quite well:

       Events like 9/11 worked so well because they served as a near perfect beacon for Problem, Reaction, Solution scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had a problem with the
       <strong>
        trillions
       </strong>
       of dollars being announced the day before. As a Reaction, we set up a team in the Pentagon tasked with investigating this issue. And their offices were located on the outer E-Ring of the Pentagon. Solution?
       <a href="http://wp11.americanobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pentagon-9_6.jpg">
        Yep
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We also had to deal with Afghanistan messing with the poppy trade, and they even told their citizens
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/25/afghanistan.terrorism8">
        they could grow opium again 2 weeks after 9/11
       </a>
       because they knew we were coming and wanted as many allies as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there was Saddam, who's been a pain in the ass since we had to check him with the whole first Gulf War, of which we faked testimony about Iraqi soldiers
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/15/opinion/deception-on-capitol-hill.html">
        taking babies out of incubators
       </a>
       to go in the first time. The second time, he distanced himself from the dollar in the
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/16/iraq.theeuro">
        Food For Oil
       </a>
       program, and enough was enough. We said he had WMDs, and we got 'em.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one is different, notably because the morning and late night talk shows have the Hollywood angle covered, and the afternoon /evening talk have the cyber terrorism angle covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess who's gonna need some new weapons to take over as the US is letting them take care of it themselves starting in
       <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/asia/us-and-south-korea-sign-plan-to-counter-north.html">

       </a>
       , but they're gonna need some big shiny things considering North Korea has conveniently started to sabre-rattle (
       <em>
        according to US sources
       </em>
       , of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it as a big PR campaign to sell SK weapons at a perfect time, and some cyber security bullshit our way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because people are paying attention now, and that's never good.

       I said almost the same thing in another /conspiracy posting, so for once, here it is again:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's almost certain that the Sony hack was an inside job I'm afraid. It's likely to be a CIA operation instead, and the North Koreans can't do anything about it because for 40 years they have been doing it themselves, although not at Sony. That required some high level thinking and planning, and the CIA is extraordinary at doing that, and pretending it's the North Koreans in this case.

       Unfortunately, in the process, the NSA is only to get stronger and more powerful -- it's such a shame, but that's where we are in the United States at present.

       Not really Sony has had hacking problems in the past, I think it is more likely that a Sony employee or ex-employee did the hack. Someone who knew the system and knew where to find stuff.

       Sony employees themselves have come out and said that there is no way North Korea did this and that whoever hacked Sony knew the system too well and it had to be from the inside.

       Obama took time out of his busy schedule to read his opinion on the whole shebang.  He stated that we shouldn't let dictators censor us on our own soil.  He went on to compare it to self-censorship down the line and how anything can start to be considered "politically incorrect".

       I think far too many things are already too politically correct and find his words to be both empty and hypocritical as always.

       Why would they release the torture report in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       And regardless, they don't need a distraction. Most Americans support the torture, as disgusting as it is. And Cheney went on air saying he did it and would do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       A distraction wasn't necessary. No one's going to do shit about us torturing innocent people. If anything this was just a publicity stunt.

       I really don't think the distraction angle works because it has not silenced news about the NSA/CIA. Furthermore I think the Sony hacks was done buy a layoff employee.

       Yes, it is pretty conspiratory, there is no evidence showing a connection between the two events, therefore you must fabricate hypothetical connections, most of which are based in an assumption that the government is inherently evil, a thought I'd say is shared by the conspiracy theorist and other woo-woo communities in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very definition of "conspiratory" would be something that relates to an anti-ethical/immoral/evil action taken by some group, so even if you don't use it in the sense of "conspiracy theory" that I took, it'd be a conspiratory thought by its very definition.

       You're right. It is based on the assumption that the government is inherently evil, but also because they have proved time and time again that they earned the distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, it's ironic that the US government's explanation of what happened is pretty much a conspiracy theory as well. They have not presented any proof that the hackers were from NK and Kim Jong-Un has just called for a joint independent and open analysis with the US government into the identities of the hackers. Why would NK suggest that if they genuinely did do it?

       Well, yeah, there are some governments who like to create their bullshit explanations, the US government being especially famous in this field considering how powerful the USA are and... Well, from the red scare to the "war on terrorism", you see a story of half-assed explanations for what is mostly internal interests, so maybe they just took advantage of the opportunity to throw some extra shit at NK since they already hate each other, if anything goes to shit on the South and North Korea conflict at least there'd be some public support for an intervention if you can paint an ever worse image of NK for the laymen, but that is if anything wild speculation on my part.

       Well, you say 'they' and 'agenda', and somehow pull in a relation to 9/11. North Korea has almost 'gone to war' (hoped to launch primitive ICMB's) with the U.S. several times over seemingly trivial things. However, these trivial things are really the life-lines helping the North Korean leadership save face with their people while obtaining nation-saving aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how could this possibly work out in North Korea's best interest? The hack was probably justified in the beginning by North Korean leadership wanting to protect their leader from potential slander (being that the nation functions on the belief of a supreme leader). If the North Korean leader appears weak, the people of North Korea would revolt in an instant, but since his reach would appear far and strong (strong and far enough to hold a U.S. company hostage), the people fear worse things would happen to them should they question their leader. So this is good for North Korea because it protects their leader's image and makes the nation's capabilities look strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who's going to slap the North Korean's on the wrist and say 'Stahp it!'? Not Sony, because they're a big bitch. Also, who are they going to take to court? The U.S. government would have to step in with some sort of consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be scared of the repercussions, right? Not really. We can't really blow PuneYoung-Yang up, cause the rest of the world would freak out at the U.S. blowing up something that looks like a 1st or 2nd world country. Further, the "rules of cyber-engagement" that some military officer was hoping to get a blowjob for writing don't really exist yet, and a good number of people in the U.S. are outraged that someone can sit behind an air-conditioned drone keyboard and blow someone up half way around the world because hand-to-hand combat wasn't involved to determine the superior nation (just imagine justifying blowing something up because someone else touched your computer from their computer...)
