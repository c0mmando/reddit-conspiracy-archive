       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed a trend when it comes to the politics of this sub-reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's particularly 'cold war' in it's views. It openly excepts the idea that the US government has lied to all of us to further its power, but when it comes to terms like Socialism and Communism, it accepts the governments line on these terms hook, line and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a sub-reddit of free thinkers there is a surprising amount of people who think Socialism and Communism is all about government control when in reality Communism means no government and Socialism was founded on the idea of anti-authoritarianism. Not to mention there are many anti-government figures that share Marxist views. Noam Chomsky and Immortal Technique for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gives?

       Most people know something is wrong but have no principles to reference them with so they fall into the cradled arms of the state and post some bullshit Russell Brand said and think it's revolutionary.

       Socialism is the opposite of freedom; it's government control of every aspect of life. If that seems remotely appealing to you, you may feel more at home in

       I grew up in the most hardcore of republican households but we never took it this far...
      </p>
      <p>
       Took me awhile before I realized that socialism is painted pretty negatively and for good reason.  Many rich republicans need people to accept a person's right to riches, over a person's need to eat.  Had to learn some history and moral clarity before I changed my view.

       is a place to start if you still think socialists are here to take your freedoms away.

       The fact that they were a form of government means they weren't Communist. Communism means no government.

       Ok, then in a true communist society without a state, and presumably without private property, why would anyone create anything at all? In other words, why would a farmer try to raise grain if he can't claim his own work as his?

       You need to remember these systems have been destroyed by Feudalism. The same system we use in America. Lots of ways to run a society have been destroyed by Feudalism. its not that they dont work, its that other dominate systems have over run humane ways of operating a society. People have this wrong, you need to take a good look at history.

       Have you seen mention of those two ideas, the government lies and communism/socialism is bad, in the same thread, written by the same person?

      <p>
       Conspiracy is full of free thinkers, we get all types of ideas and people. Hell, there are 1000 online as I type this, and there sure isn't only one ideology
       <em>
        accepted

       on this sub. We attract all types of free thinkers and people with common ideologies will generally all post in the same place, giving the impression of that ideology being the common narrative on conspiracy but that is nothing close to the truth.

       Conversations about class inequality, production and economic goals are woefully absent from this sub imo. I haven't seen much energy directed towards various marxisms either in favor of or against in this sub.

       Anarcholibertarianism seems to be the trending flavor of modern self styled revolutionairres. I can't figure it out for the life of me. I think socialism is pretty freaking beautiful, it meshes fantastically with the ecovillage sorta response I favor.

       "Anarcholibertarian" aka voluntarist here. For one, I am no revolutionary, and favor a gradual evolutionary shedding of the mantle of sociopathic mercantilist corporatocracy. I've also concluded -- and I'm far from being alone in this conclusion -- that all forms of initiation of aggression are wrong and bad for humanity in the long term.

       Class inequality is an essential marker of the well-being of a society, and it's pretty clear that ours is not doing too well. There's may be value in bridging  or at least discussing the new socialist / anarchocapitalist divide.

       I don't agree with the OP, but the discussion is still worth having, it appears, by the comments people are posting. Good stuff.

       Honestly I don't think this is a subreddit of "freethinkers" as you suggest.  It's more than a quarter million people for sure, but most are lurkers that rarely contribute.  The ones that do, myself included, are hardly free thinkers.  We have our own agendas.
