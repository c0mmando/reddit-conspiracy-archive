        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed a trend when it comes to the politics of this sub-reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s particularly &#39;cold war&#39; in it&#39;s views. It openly excepts the idea that the US government has lied to all of us to further its power, but when it comes to terms like Socialism and Communism, it accepts the governments line on these terms hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>For a sub-reddit of free thinkers there is a surprising amount of people who think Socialism and Communism is all about government control when in reality Communism means no government and Socialism was founded on the idea of anti-authoritarianism. Not to mention there are many anti-government figures that share Marxist views. Noam Chomsky and Immortal Technique for instance.</p>

<p>What gives?</p>

<p>I grew up in the most hardcore of republican households but we never took it this far...</p>

<p>Took me awhile before I realized that socialism is painted pretty negatively and for good reason.  Many rich republicans need people to accept a person&#39;s right to riches, over a person&#39;s need to eat.  Had to learn some history and moral clarity before I changed my view.  <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zeidler">Frank Zeidler</a> is a place to start if you still think socialists are here to take your freedoms away.</p>
