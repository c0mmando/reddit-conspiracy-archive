       I don't think so personally. I think that the pieces have been set up simply because of other factors. The killer was a legit thug or crazy and the officers were unfortunately targeted. The public's response is natural based on our divided mentality of us versus them.

       because I think it will always be important and this is a situation, if simplified, is because of division amongst people and that we need to be standing together here. Nobody should be killing anybody.

       I was listening to the radio and they said the guy who did the shooting explicitly stated that he was motivated by what happened to the chokehold victim and that this was all about revenge. He even made the statement online. It was on BBC.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we've got cops going out in public having to worry that some random civilian is gonna take a shot at them. Now consider the kind of person that usually gets hired as a police officer these days. Macho bullshit warrior mentality all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public is afraid of the cops and they're afraid of us. I can't help but think more shootings will result. If a couple more unarmed civilians go down, someone else might decide to go vigilante and shoot some more police.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that starts happening, you've just handed to government the perfect excuse to implement the permanent national emergency some of us have been predicting for a while now.

       No I didn't. But I would still go so far as to say most cops have the characteristics I mentioned to some degree. Something tells me you're either a cop shill, or someone in your family is a police officer.

       I should have clarified, you're right: you made a blanket statement over the entire community that they mostly hire those types these days.  My point still stands that you shouldn't make a statement like like without proof...which you don't have
       <em>
        outside of your own little percent of space
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and I love the jump to being a cop shill or knowing someone who is a cop.  Fact is I was arrested on a bs charge, the cop lied in the police report, my attorney was terrible, the DA didn't even consider anything other than the dishonest police report, and now I'm a felon on 3 years probation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have every reason to hate cops...but I don't because I critically think about my feelings instead of making sweeping generalizations about a community of which I've only interacted with maybe 1/2% of said community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you keep on defending your stance and making assumptions, and I'll sit back and actually think before I speak.

      <p>
       My own little percent of space includes dealing with various cops in four different countries. They all have a certain prick attitude that comes from being "the law". If you want to disagree with this, that's your prerogative.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last point. My original comment was about the kind of people "that usually get hired these days". So, you misunderstood what I wrote. Then you took me to task based on that misinterpretation. I tried to point that out to you already. But, like a dog with a bone, you just can't let go. Even more strange, since you yourself have been on the receiving end of wrongful treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last random point. Most people's perception of police is at least partly based on a Hollywood/TV presentation of police as hero types. Police are just people. Most people, when you give them a bit of power, can't help but engage in power tripping.

       I don't think it is a setup.  I think people have become disillusioned with the police and we are going to see attacks like these become more commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad for everybody involved.  It will make police be more aggressive and in turn the vigilante activity will increase making the police more aggressive and so on and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is needed is meaningful change and peaceful protest to change how police handle things.  Cops are taught that a routine traffic stop could be a life or death situation.  It is a hard place to start from an maintain calm.
      </p>
      <p>
       People expect "peace" officers to promote peace. Not shoot or choke to death unarmed civilians whatever color they may be. These expectations are not usually met.  If you are a visible minority, police experiences are usually bad ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be a reduction in acceptable force a peace officer can use. There needs to be a restriction in their ability to arrest and detain, (without a judge signing off), of about 6 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should not be able to confiscate money and other legal goods just because you have a lot of it on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be afforded the respect of citizens as long as they treat the citizens with respect and understand that citizens have rights greater than any department policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be courteous and not bullies.  We pay their salaries to protect us. Not to harass us and make unreasonable demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to roll back to the 50's in terms of their respect for the law and constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       In kind, we should be polite and not disrespectful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should calmly explain when we understand our rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not engage in physical confrontation with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protest should be peaceful. Roll back to 50's style.  Burning and robbing only strengthen their position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful change happens when one side moves forward while turning the other cheek and refuses to succumb to the violence put upon them by those that fight the change. Those that commit the violence will always be cast as the villain.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could take a page from Gandhi and from MLK Jr. Both were great humans and both were the catalyst for change that came at a price, but was effective in the end.

       No, claiming he was ISIS inspired is the only way to condition cops  into seeing the public as the enemy.

       The fact that you got downvotes for this shows exactly what this sub is and who subscribes to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supporter of any murder,
       <em>
        of anyone

       , is a sign of a deranged and mentally handicapped mind.

       The murder of the two police officers in New York is a natural consequence of Obama, Al Sharpton, and the media deliberately fostering racial hatred against whites, by championing the causes of three black criminals. In all three cases the blacks involved were committing crimes, and their deaths were due to resistance of arrest or overt violence on their part. The blacks were wholly in the wrong. But because Obama, Sharpton, and the television networks kept beating the drum of racial hatred against whites, the police are now seen as the enforcers of white oppression. By killing the police, this black criminal thought he was striking out against white people. He was a racist who hated white people.
