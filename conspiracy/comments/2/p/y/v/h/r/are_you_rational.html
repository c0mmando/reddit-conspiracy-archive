Are we rational in real life?  I just want some backgrounds so we can gauge for ourselves where conspiracy theorists come from.  </p>

<p>I am pursuing a bachelors in economics. I work for a newspaper. I do smoke pot. I would say i come from a middle class economic background. Im in my early twenties. </p>

<p>Do i fit the tinfoil bill?  Do you?  Im just curious to know if a demographic for theorists actually exists or r we all waking up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO I don&#39;t fit the tinfoil bill. I&#39;m an upper middle class 30 year old female with a good job, a kid, fiancé, my fiancé says I look like a &quot;basic bitch&quot; because of the way I dress, and I can be very irrational in real life (but that&#39;s typical as a woman). </p>

<p>I  think slowly more and more are waking up. I have a co-worker who&#39;s an upper middle class male in his 40&#39;s with several degrees in many areas and he knows what&#39;s going on, we talk about what&#39;s going on and theorize on what&#39;s going to happen and when and how to prepare. </p>

<p>Now I have an older man who lives near me who fits the bill perfectly. I used to think he was crazy, now I understand him. </p>

<p>With more and more becoming aware the tinfoil bill gets thrown out the window; we&#39;re all the same inside, we just look different on the outside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Early forties, well balanced (besides not getting laid enough). I&#39;m an  aspiring musician. I&#39;m always into learning new things. Currently getting Cello lessons. I smoke the herb and like the beer. I guess it helps me cope with the weight of this place. I try to keep it moderate though.</p>

<p>Some of my friends think i&#39;m a bit too serious about worldly matters. They haven&#39;t realized the bigger picture yet, although some of them are coming around nowadays. It&#39;s getting harder not to notice how fucked up things are. They see how weird the news is getting too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of them would call me irrational, just passionate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn well said.  Everyone can try to be as rational, but if you&#39;re missing one tiny bit of pertinent information then everything you think falls apart.  At least, that&#39;s how I interpreted it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you were referring to how people will simply deem another &quot;irrational&quot; because they disagree and believe themselves to be correct.</p>

<p>Reminds me of that verse something like: before you remove the speck from your neighbors eye, remove the log from your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is rational whether they say they are or not. In fact, the very term &quot;rationalizing&quot; means the opposite of what it should mean. We don&#39;t look for rationality, we look for patterns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the helpful replies. The reason i wanted to know was because there is a belief that the most disfranchised or from the lower economic backgrounds believe in conspiracies. Medias projection is always as such. I could call bullshit but i felt this community would help prove me right and it has to an extent . As for the grass well it helps elevate our senses i guess. Read a religious book high and then you&#39;ll know what i mean. :) thanks again! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy &quot;demographic&quot;, other than perhaps there are few young people/teenagers who have taken the red pill. It takes time to break out of the restrictive world view that we are inculcated in at school/university. </p>

<p>There are, however, some personality types which are more likely to question the status quo. Several months ago, I ran a little survey on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to see which of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">16 Myers-Briggs personality types</a> were most common here. I posited that my own type (INTP) was likely to be well represented, and as you can see, that seems to be the case.</p>
