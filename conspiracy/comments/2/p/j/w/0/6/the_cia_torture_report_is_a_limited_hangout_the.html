       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ^ &gt;I am now convinced that Snowden is part of a "limited hangout" operation, and here's why. (If you downvote, please explain in comments, because I put in some effort into this)
      </p>
      <p>
       garnered 111 points
      </p>
      <p>
       Now:
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       Snowden's documents are limited hangout
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do you think the MSM would cover him if he wasn't?
       </strong>
       [Operation Mockingbird = They control anything and everything the MSM/Corporate Media tells you.
       <em>
        EVERYTHING
       </em>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Argument
       </strong>
       - they were forced to cover snowden, too big of a story
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Response
       </strong>
       - Ok.... but you think TPTB would put him on the cover of TIME, or on 60 minutes, or fly Brian Williams to Russia to interview him?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, because TPTB want you to know about Snowden
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Question- why?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they want the following:
       <em>
        spread fear, control dissent
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) chilling effect on the people
      </p>
      <p>
       2) scare potential whistle-blowers ( snowden sets an example that you get charged with the espionage act)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) scare journalists ( they dont want them covering corruption/the elite)... [michael hastings death is the opposite of a limited hangout, they want us to know they killed him, they wanted it to be obvious so that
       <strong>
        WE KNOW
       </strong>
       they can do something like that and get away with it
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO -- In my opinion, the whole reason behind this would be to let us know we are being watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden's cache being limited hangout was a very serious and risky operation intended to create the
       <strong>
        PANOPTICON
       </strong>

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They did the Snowden false flag to scare people, fear fear fear
      </p>
      <p>
       very simple.

       If it comes out of the CIA then it is almost guaranteed to be a limited hangout. The director of the CIA can keep things secret FOREVER. All he has to do is say so.

       What else do you think is still being covered up?
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example, I'd guess that the CIA was doing the same kind of torture stuff that SAVAK and the Gestapo used to do. Beatings, electric shock, pulling fingernails etc. The kind of stuff that would just be too hard to pass off as "enhanced interrogation".

       I once came across some report from a human rights group where they interviewed Iraqi prisoners, they did just that. The problem is "they" are the Iraqis and it's impossible to proof if the US did look away.

       I think the rape of a young boy in front of his imprisoned parents is way beyond "enhanced interrogation".  And its stories like that, if actually true, that can cause people to sympathize with terrorist organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you with no shame that if the government, in an attempt to get information out of me that they thought I knew, raped my child in front of me... I would abandon the rule of law and take matters into my own hands.

       Yes, this and probably worse.  Possibly experimentation/mutilation - who knows how bad it can get.  And if the past is any indication, it can get pretty bad.

       I thought you'd be all over finding #10 from the torture report summary,
       <a href="/u/George_Tenet">
        /u/George_Tenet
       </a>
       . It's practically the textbook definition of a limited hangout.

      <p>
       "#10: The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques."
      </p>
      <p>
       They even go on to quote a deputy director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, "we either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has implications beyond the media... we either put out our story or we get eaten. [T]here is no middle ground."

       It is just intuitive that any "report" about secret US government operations especially, (but not limited to) snoop organizations is going to be a "limited hangout".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that they would "voluntarily" turn over to the public would be done for them not the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the only reason that any "secrets" of Deep Government operations are ever released, is because the top people view not releasing them to be more dangerous than doing so.
