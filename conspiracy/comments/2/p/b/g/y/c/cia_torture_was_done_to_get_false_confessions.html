<p><a href="http://therightstuff.biz/2014/12/11/cia-torture-report-reveals-americans-are-pussies/">http://therightstuff.biz/2014/12/11/cia-torture-report-reveals-americans-are-pussies/</a></p>

<p>ZeroHedge has a great article that summarizes this, but it has next to nothing new in it; this has all been known for years and years and years and years. For instance, it was reported that they reverse engineered SERE in order to use the same tactics that <strong>the Communist Chinese had used to get false confessions.</strong> We know now that <strong>virtually the entire 9/11 Commission Report was based on false confessions generated through Communist torture tactics.</strong></p>

<p>Did everyone forget that the CIA brought the hijackers to the US, gave them visas, and trained them on CIA affiliated air fields? Maybe it’s time to anally force feed certain high level CIA officials that were involved in this?</p>

<p>Richard Blee anyone?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-12-12/media-focusing-wrong-senate-torture-report">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-12-12/media-focusing-wrong-senate-torture-report</a></p>

<p>Now, why would they need to get false confessions about 9/11? It pretty much answers itself, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>I’ve said it for years, 9/11 makes a really good litmus test. It’s something anyone with half a brain could figure out, so just realize that the majority of people pushing the (completely false) Official 9/11 Conspiracy Theory are not confused, or suffer from a lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>They are knowingly and purposefully lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to keep in mind that the government is using the definition of national security as it chooses. Everyone uses this expression as he chooses.</p>

<p>When the government feels sad for the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on September 11, we also should feel sorry that the American government who is represented by General Martins and others who have killed thousands of people. Millions. This definition is a resilient definition. Every dictator can put on this definition as the shoes that he uses to step on every person in this world, every law and every constitution.</p>

<p>Many can kill people under the name of national security, and to torture people under the name of national security, and detain their children under the name of national security. I don&#39;t want to be long but I can say that the president can take someone and throw him in the sea in the name of national security. And so well he can also legislate the killings, assassinations, under the name of national security, for American citizens.</p>

<p>My only advice to you that you do not get affected by the crocodile tears. Because your blood is not made of gold and ours made of water. We are all human beings. Thank you.</p>

Obama the Candidate was created by the leading Zionist families of Chicago:  the Klutznicks, the Pritzgers, and the Crowns.
