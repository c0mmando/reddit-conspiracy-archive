    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> uses automoderator to silently ban a <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/automoderator#wiki_domain_bans_.28exact_match.29">large list of domain names.  See automoderator configuration</a>. I hate the silent bans where the poster is not directly informed  and only a few really shitty subreddits  still do it.</p>

<p>The recent url you tried to submit is for washingtonsblog.com and it is on the list of silently-banned domain names.  <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=url%3Awashingtonsblog.com&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=all">They have not approved a post from that domain in over a year.</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> have never provided good reason for the bans on many domain names.   The new mods took control on the promise of ending censorship but they have kept the same policy of banning domain names and added to it.  </p>

<p>I have been nagging them about it for a while now for an explanation but only seen a couple of the most obvious domains removed from the blacklist.     <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> is now a catch-all and is already full of clickbait and blog spam.  So there is no ideological reason to ban popular and informative websites. I do not understand why they single out certain domain names at certain times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there, <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod here. eberkneezer&#39;s a troll. He mods subs like <a href="/r/oppression">/r/oppression</a> which make fun of the very idea of mod abuse in any form so please don&#39;t take him seriously. Notice how he didn&#39;t actually name any of those &quot;popular and informative websites&quot;?</p>

<p>The domains you see on that list were mostly likely put there because they were spamming the sub or are petition sites which are against the rules of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. We do not and never will censor any topic like the old moderation team was doing by banning specific keywords in titles. So if you&#39;ve got something technology related and you want to make a post about feel free to come on over. You&#39;ll always be welcome. Just read our sidebar before posting. </p>

<p>To address the ban on washingtonsblog.com though, the reason its been left there was not because we like censoring you it was because often the site staitup plagiarizes stuff, publishes things that are blatantly incorrect, and generally speaking doesn&#39;t usually go into technical subjects. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2pbskp/the_big_story_torture_everyone_is_missing_at/">The link you posted</a> doesn&#39;t even have anything to do with technology. It&#39;s about the CIA torturing people and the shit main stream media covering the wrong thing. So I&#39;m sorry but no that wasn&#39;t acceptable. Please try staying at least somewhat on topic. </p>

<p>I note you have recently stopped blocking spectrum.ieee.org</p>

<p>The popularity is indicated by their usage throughout reddit.</p>

<p>rawstory.com and thinkprogres.com are two domains that <strong>you yourself</strong> have described as <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/23ee42/meta_i_have_identified_a_list_of_domains_that_are/">popular when complaining about the censorship on /r/news</a>.  However, you seem to think it is ok when you are the one doing the censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, </p>

<p>I have already sent a mod mail and am shocked you have returned to this thread to continue where you left off.</p>

<p>Firstly, please don&#39;t attack me through a mischaracterisation of a subreddit I happen to contribute to.  I see <a href="/r/oppression">/r/oppression</a> as no different to <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> - another subreddit that I also have heavily contributed to.  It can be as serious or light-hearted as you want.  The main thing for that subreddit is that documentation of moderator indiscretions takes place and people can treat it as they will.</p>

<p>Your mischaracterisation of <a href="/r/oppression">/r/oppression</a> is completely irrelevant here but possibly is the only thing that you can point to despite all the time you have invested to try and discredit me.   The funny thing is that two <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> moderators are also moderators on <a href="/r/oppression">/r/oppression</a>.  So I am not sure how you paint this as inter-sub rivalry and it is obvious that you are grasping at straws or using it as a distraction?</p>

<p>Lets be clear, there is nothing of substance beneath your constant name-calling and witchhunting.  In contrast, all my arguments about <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> presented here are based on facts with references.</p>

<p>By attacking my character as your first line of defence, it shows a lot of weakness and fear.  However, you should know that I will not be silenced by your attacks and will continue to put information out there where it is appropriate such as is the case here.   I am not interested in getting anywhere with you.  I have already made suggestions about various aspects of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> through other channels such as <a href="/r/technologymeta">/r/technologymeta</a>.  We both know that <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> is a long way of the transparent and the fair subreddit that it might have been.   You could spend some time fixing that instead of just attacking me.  </p>

<p>It is also interesting that you conveniently forgot to mention the fact that the <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> word filter was dropped, as the word filter was censoring everything related to topics such as NSA, SOPA/PIPA, Net Neutrality, in a manner much more egregious than a domain filter. </p>

<p>I  would argue that <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> are closest to free speech because it is literally just reddit rules and users don&#39;t get banned for things like  trolling.

    <div class="md"><p>r/geopolitics isn&#39;t too bad either. I&#39;ve seen some fairly realistic, unbiased articles there on Russia, Ukraine and Crimea. </p>

<p>To the rest of reddit, r/conspiracy has become a sort of court jester. Don&#39;t get pissed off at me for saying that. Why? Because in the days of Kings and Monarchies, the jester was often the only one who could say the truth. It was usually wrapped up inside a joke or some other form of humor. But it was still the truth.</p>

<p>So let the rest of reddit look at us like we&#39;re a joke. That&#39;s a small price to pay for free speech and freedom to express a dissenting opinion. They can laugh all they like, but the joke (ultimately) is on them. </p>

<p>And now to address that highly ignorant top comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re interested in how the NWO is using Technology to subjugate us all against the wishes of Ron Paul. Take a look at their front page and see fo&#39; yo self.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top post on the NSA on <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2pcs3j/over_700_million_people_taking_steps_to_avoid_nsa/">this one</a>. The article was written by a highly intelligent, cryptographer and security specialists. He is a board member of the EFF. This is not Paulspam, this is not LOLbertarians, he is an academic badass who really really knows his shit and is pretty much one of the most (if not the most) highly regarded figures in all the computer security world. <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is no longer a place to point and laugh at nutters, but a place for people to gather when they disagree with things on a purely political level, not a factual one. What a pity. </p>

<p>We are a community of IT professionals like programmers, systems administrators, cryptographers, web developers, and network administrators so how the fuck do you think we feel when we see shit like <a href="https://leaksource.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nsa-hunt-sysadmins.jpg">this</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t help that so much censored content gets funneled here, simply due to the fact that no other subreddit will take it.. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of garbage here. Most people think Expanding Earth theory is garbage but I&#39;m glad I can post about it here. I find the evidence extremely compelling. People come here with their own crazy theories and better than simply removing them based on some mod&#39;s bias, a discussion happens and maybe some minds are changed.</p>

<p>Many of the popular subreddits are modded by people who believe that their perception of reality is the ultimate truth, and that the users should be sheltered from ideas that the mods don&#39;t agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a lot of cases, people are just brazenly pushing agendas into subs inappropriately. Like, TIL isn&#39;t &quot;I think everyone should know:&quot; or &quot;Hey gather around my soapbox&quot; but a lot of people treat it like it is, and then get indignant when it&#39;s removed. It&#39;s censorship, I tells ya!</p>

<p>It&#39;s really like walking into a random office building and milling about the cubicles handing out flyers when you don&#39;t even work there.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you want to start your own sub for whatever it is you want to talk about it, you should. Be your own mod, make all the choices. If you wonder why there are no &quot;completely free&quot; subreddits (aka, completely unmoderated) that have any activity, it&#39;s because nobody is interested in a group of random people pontificating about random things.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t with the medium. I can&#39;t stress this enough. <em>The issue is not with the medium</em>. The issue is people don&#39;t like evangelists barging in out of context, be it your home, on the street, or on  your subreddit.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to start your own community on reddit where you can not ever remove anything, you could also try 4chan. You won&#39;t find censorship there.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;m really fed up with people who feel like they&#39;re entitled to something. You already have a platform to create your own sub and make whatever community you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument is that you&#39;re subverting the intended nature of the sub.</p>

<p>I moderate <a href="/r/thatHappened">/r/thatHappened</a>. We cater to a specific subset of cringy content. Often people post stuff to make a point about how stupid somebody is that doesn&#39;t fit the theme of the sub, or content that is otherwise outside of the intended purpose of the sub (like a never ending stream of people looking to make karma on <a href="/r/adviceAnimals">/r/adviceAnimals</a> posts). We remove them to maintain the theme of the sub. If there was no moderation, <a href="/r/thatHappened">/r/thatHappened</a> would just become <a href="/r/adviceAnimals">/r/adviceAnimals</a>. People like advice animals, and upvote them, but frankly those people can just go to <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a> if they want to see image macros.</p>

<p>I STRONGLY recommend that you and other like minded people form a sub which caters to the subset of of people that enjoy conspiracy themed TILs. If they&#39;re popular in TIL, then there is no reason to think that you can&#39;t leverage that fact into your own sub. I&#39;ll help moderate it if you want.</p>

<p>The mechanics of reddit give you little recourse with moderators on different subs removing your content, that is just the fact of the matter. I think a lot of people overlook that the recourse is to form your own community, and it&#39;s an incredibly powerful course of action.</p>

<p>Conspiracy stuff comes from people who are not conspiracy theorists as well in TIL. Why? Because public schools don&#39;t teach that kind of stuff, or gloss over it, and those people actually did learn that today, somewhere, probably from a guy like me educating them.</p>

<p>So, either you can accept that I will post it, or accept that somebody else will post it, conspiracy posts will be on TIL. Besides, they don&#39;t have a rule that says I must have learned this today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most subs don&#39;t explicitly disallow every possible thing that they don&#39;t want. They just try and lay down between 3-10 rules that catch 99% and use discretion for the rest. Reddit isn&#39;t a democracy that has elected officials or courts of appeal, that is just the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>I can easily accept that you&#39;ll post them to TIL. I personally see no issue with that. At the same time, I can accept the reality that moderators can remove whatever they want and aren&#39;t accountable to anyone. This, again, is just the reality of the situation. If you&#39;re content doing what you&#39;re doing, all power to you. I&#39;m just saying I would at the very least augment my approach by creating a safe haven sub for the type of content you want to publish. From my perspective, I think you only stand to gain by doing so.</p>

I did essentially nothing and 2 years later it has 170k subscribers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a fair comparison, I&#39;m just saying that subs that serve an underserved niche area seem to grow exponentially, and from what you&#39;ve described your TIL posts probably fit that bill.</p>

<p>Do whatever it is you wanna do, all I&#39;m saying is not to discount creating a sub because you think it&#39;s too late to get into the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good question. I think yes, if the posts are truly exceptional. If someone is just trying to use the sub as an excuse to widen their audience, then that&#39;s usually pretty obvious. I&#39;m not sure what the situation is, but after so many abuses of the intended purpose of the sub (to showcase spectacular content) then I could understand how eventually moderators would form a bias against a certain community.</p>

<p>I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, obviously, I&#39;m subbed to it... but IMHO for every good post there are like 50 shit posts. The gems are worth it, but not everyone has the same tolerance for wading through the garbage and form their opinions based on the 50 instead of the 1. I think members of this community are by nature inclined to wade through bullshit... wading through bullshit is what drives people here in the first place if they&#39;re into that. I am. You are. Just don&#39;t be surprised that it isn&#39;t in the nature of most people to do that. If it were, there wouldn&#39;t even be a need for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because digging through problematic statements would be the rule rather than the exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, IP has been doing great stuff. My issue with your idea about a TILconspiracy sub creation would be that if created, would be the place for these types of posts to <em>only</em> be posted.</p>

<p>What&#39;s to stop TIL from adopting a rule such as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This forum is for interesting, documented facts that you learned today. Anything <em>conspiracy related</em> will be removed, as a specific sub r/TILconspiracy exists for this reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, that sub <em>could grow</em>, and I would subscribe and help out if necessary. But I do potentially see some drawbacks that would negatively affect how users here try and inform and spread content to other parts of reddit legitimately and without malice or intent to deceive.</p>
