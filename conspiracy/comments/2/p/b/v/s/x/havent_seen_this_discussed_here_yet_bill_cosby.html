<p>Let me put it this way: I know what I would do and say if I were accused of something like rape and I was innocent....and it&#39;s not <em>at all</em> what Bill Cosby is doing. Just saying. </p>

<p>A comedy yes, but I recommend all, no matter whether guilty or not, don&#39;t say a damn word. Not to the media, not to the cops, not to your buddies. Always invoke your right to silence, because all words can be used against you in the court of law, not &quot;for you&quot;. Cheers.</p>

<p>PS. Being silent  != being guilty, he is being smart. We shall see.</p>

<p>I know I read some blurb about him wanting to buy some big movie studio - Paramount, MGM...I don&#39;t remember - but this just doesn&#39;t seem like enough of a reason to crucify him as badly as is going on.  I have no idea what&#39;s going on w/this really.  Again, my questions are similar to yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the woman came forward because, during an awards program, he got up and drunkenly rattled off all these moral dos and donts about how black people should behave.  There was a lot of media given this speach and it generated the publuc to say, hey hes right.</p>

<p>This upset some of these woman because it insulted and demeaned their experience.  By coming forward they were setting things in its proper prespective in their eyes.  They are wanting us to unserstand the man is not the character he projects to the public and, after what he did, he was not in any position to spout about morality.  </p>

<p>I also understood these women are additional women who experienced similiar behavior from him than the ones who were kept quite from a non disclouser statement.</p>

<p>You realize there are now a literally <em>shit ton</em> of women who have come out of the wood work to say the same thing as whoever it is you&#39;re talking about, right?  I&#39;m not referring to only one female in particular.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is if what all these women are saying is true.  If it&#39;s not, then there is some seriously messed up shit underfoot.  And if it is?  Then how come they waited so damn long to &quot;finally come out&quot;?</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty damning too if you simply stop and think about it for a moment, and it doesn&#39;t make things any clearer at that point.</p>

<p>Ultimately, your response is only stating the WHAT HAPPENED part of things...not the WHY or even <em>IF</em> it actually happened.</p>

<p>I know what the running story is.  I know what the MSM has been spewing out.  That doesn&#39;t answer why it&#39;s all coming out NOW so many years later, and the fact that this question hasn&#39;t been answered indicates (to me at least) that there are some <em>very</em> weird holes in this whole story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Cosby is damned if he denies allegations, just like he is damned if he doesn&#39;t deny them.  Only thing that matters is actual proof of rapes he committed and in that category there is none.  I was never a fan of Cosby  but I don&#39;t get why everyone is throwing him under the bus, unless of course it has to do with him pissing someone off and this is revenge.  Strange that he is found guilty with no evidence and no one in Hollywood is standing up for him.

    <div class="md"><p>I think what we are now wittnessing is our society is more open to discussions on topics like rape and so people are more willing to tell their stories.</p>

<p>In the 70s, women were higly critized by the public as deserving what they got should they say they were raped.  People said it was the way a woman dressed that invited it.  People would draw conclusions to rape not being rape because of life sytle choices and locations these things happened like bars, etc.  People believed that many woman got ahead in their fields by slepping with celebritys, directors etc.  People did not believe a woman could make it on her own talent but slept her way to the top.  People believed this happened in the business world as well.  They didnt even believe it could be rape unless the woman suffered some kind of brutality from the act.  This was public opinion and it was reinforced by lawyers tearing down a womans reputation in court while they were on the stand.,  the public believed that good girls didnt get raped.</p>

<p>Since this was so prevalent in the publics views, many woman decided to bear the emtional scars of rape and not say anything.  For even a handful to come forward during those years and .point an accusation towards Bill Cosby would mean there was likely more creedence to their stories enough to make it an out of court settlement closing the details to the public.</p>

<p>I remember those days.  Bill Cosby was not the publics favorite dad on tv at that time.  I believe he was actting in some kind of spy series like I Spy?   But I cant remember the name for sure.  He was protrayed as sauve and sophisticated,  dressed in very fashionable cloths of the time (like a James Bond kind of thing). It was only after a long absence that he took a role as a concerned father on a series.  I use to wonder if he did that to clean up his image but I am only guessing.</p>

<p>Why is it hard to believe these woman?   We believe adults who accussed Priest of acts committed a long time ago.  Explain the difference please in how the public can support one and not the other?</p>

<p>Very doubftul. 18 women have made accusations about him, these accusations have been around for over a decade, and the accusations are all extremely similar. And then he refuses to even acknowledge EIGHTEEN women?! Bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly not sure what to think. I like bill Cosby the comedian and entertainer. I don&#39;t believe much the media has to say in general and remember what happened with Michael Jackson (everyone was convinced he was a child molester and then his autopsy reveals the kids inaccurate description of jacksons junk). It&#39;s hard to see through the bullshit - are these women being paid? Cosby knows anything he says in response will be spun to make him look guilty. If he were really guilty I think he would be scrambling to put a cover story in place. Maybe he knows this is just a smear campaign and keeping quiet doesn&#39;t fuel the fire. If he is guilty, why now?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t listen to the media then. There are 18 different accusations out there and many of them have done interviews. Go listen to their stories, see if you think they are lying.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think the opposite. If he were innocent he&#39;d be all over talking about it. Instead he won&#39;t even address it. I&#39;ve never been innocent and not wanted to proclaim it.</p>

Do rapists usually voluntarily confess their crime, or do they keep quiet and/or deny all accusations? Do all rape victims immediately contact the police? Do they all seek medical assistance? Do they all confide in family and friends? No, no and no. Quite often, physical evidence is not collected while it exists, nor do witnesses always exist.</p>

<p>One Cosby victim did call a friend. That friend can corroborate much of the victim&#39;s story. He shared his story with the media. Oh, but since it&#39;s an interview conducted by, and reported by, the media; I guess we should discount it. </p>

<p>You are aware that these accusation have been in the public for over a decade right? There is nothing soon about this.

Did he ever think that some of those women would come forward because they carried enough of a reputation now that they would be believed?</p>

<p>What are the ladies motive?  I suspect that details are meantioned in reports that are similar in nature not completely disclosed to the public.  These reports can verify the validity of the reports if the information keeps showing up similar to someone elses report.</p>

<p>I think he wants it to blow over so he is staying quite.  If he continues to voice his opinion he might end up being reponsible of those reports coming to the publics attention.  Its best he just doesnt say anything and he lets the public back him because of his later reputation as being kid friendly.</p>

<p>Him refusing to speak is the best thing he can do legally, if it ever goes to trial he doesn&#39;t want his story to be shredded because the media edited something he said out of context and then pushed that onto the TV screens.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but it gets harder when you make police reports and have to corroborate your claims.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my understanding that the statue of limitations is up on these but the police are still investigating and have asked for a sit down talk with Cosby. So they must think there are more than lies there.</p>

<p>Also, as far as I know Cosby doesn&#39;t deny meeting or knowing any of these women. You&#39;d think he&#39;d at least deny this stuff if it were completely fabricated, no?</p>
