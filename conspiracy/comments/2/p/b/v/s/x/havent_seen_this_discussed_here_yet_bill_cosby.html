       Is Bill Cosby being railroaded with everyone jumping on the bandwagon because of his controversial remarks about blacks or is he more of a jimmy savile type who is now being outed? I'm aware it's a distraction and any argument is most likely based on opinion but what do you think?

       Yeah but wouldn't you think he'd have come out and vehemently denied it if it weren't true?  Or at least
       <em>

       Of course it's not. But it is a factor, and it can't simply be ignored because on it's own, it means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it this way: I know what I would do and say if I were accused of something like rape and I was innocent....and it's not
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       what Bill Cosby is doing. Just saying.

      <p>
       EDIT: In fact, Cosby is doing
       <strong>
        exactly
       </strong>
       what I would do if I
       <em>
        were

       guilty. So, yeah...

       A comedy yes, but I recommend all, no matter whether guilty or not, don't say a damn word. Not to the media, not to the cops, not to your buddies. Always invoke your right to silence, because all words can be used against you in the court of law, not "for you". Cheers.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. Being silent  != being guilty, he is being smart. We shall see.

       Not saying any of it's true; but if it is, why is this happening to him now after many years of being protected; what did he do to piss the puppet masters off. Someone paid those women to keep quiet, and now they are being paid to speak up; but by whom.

       This is exactly what the fuck I've been wondering and asking myself as well.  I haven't followed it too closely, but I think "Why now?  Who tf did he piss off?"

      <p>
       I know I read some blurb about him wanting to buy some big movie studio - Paramount, MGM...I don't remember - but this just doesn't seem like enough of a reason to crucify him as badly as is going on.  I have no idea what's going on w/this really.  Again, my questions are similar to yours.

       I believe the woman came forward because, during an awards program, he got up and drunkenly rattled off all these moral dos and donts about how black people should behave.  There was a lot of media given this speach and it generated the publuc to say, hey hes right.
      </p>
      <p>
       This upset some of these woman because it insulted and demeaned their experience.  By coming forward they were setting things in its proper prespective in their eyes.  They are wanting us to unserstand the man is not the character he projects to the public and, after what he did, he was not in any position to spout about morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also understood these women are additional women who experienced similiar behavior from him than the ones who were kept quite from a non disclouser statement.

       You realize there are now a literally
       <em>
        shit ton

       of women who have come out of the wood work to say the same thing as whoever it is you're talking about, right?  I'm not referring to only one female in particular.

      <p>
       This is if what all these women are saying is true.  If it's not, then there is some seriously messed up shit underfoot.  And if it is?  Then how come they waited so damn long to "finally come out"?
      </p>

       That's pretty damning too if you simply stop and think about it for a moment, and it doesn't make things any clearer at that point.

       Ultimately, your response is only stating the WHAT HAPPENED part of things...not the WHY or even

       it actually happened.

       I know what the running story is.  I know what the MSM has been spewing out.  That doesn't answer why it's all coming out NOW so many years later, and the fact that this question hasn't been answered indicates (to me at least) that there are some
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       weird holes in this whole story.

       Is it possible he is a rapist? Yes, do we have a trial and any evidence to support it? No. People can lie, we don't know if these people are or not.

       If it can be brought to trail, then it should be.  I think I would leave it up to twelve peers to decide guilt or innocence.  Its not the best system but its the only legal one we have.  But I think to much time has passed to take legal actions.

       Bill Cosby is damned if he denies allegations, just like he is damned if he doesn't deny them.  Only thing that matters is actual proof of rapes he committed and in that category there is none.  I was never a fan of Cosby  but I don't get why everyone is throwing him under the bus, unless of course it has to do with him pissing someone off and this is revenge.  Strange that he is found guilty with no evidence and no one in Hollywood is standing up for him. Shows how fake show biz people really are, most of the people that work in it are despicable kiss asses.

       I think what we are now wittnessing is our society is more open to discussions on topics like rape and so people are more willing to tell their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 70s, women were higly critized by the public as deserving what they got should they say they were raped.  People said it was the way a woman dressed that invited it.  People would draw conclusions to rape not being rape because of life sytle choices and locations these things happened like bars, etc.  People believed that many woman got ahead in their fields by slepping with celebritys, directors etc.  People did not believe a woman could make it on her own talent but slept her way to the top.  People believed this happened in the business world as well.  They didnt even believe it could be rape unless the woman suffered some kind of brutality from the act.  This was public opinion and it was reinforced by lawyers tearing down a womans reputation in court while they were on the stand.,  the public believed that good girls didnt get raped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this was so prevalent in the publics views, many woman decided to bear the emtional scars of rape and not say anything.  For even a handful to come forward during those years and .point an accusation towards Bill Cosby would mean there was likely more creedence to their stories enough to make it an out of court settlement closing the details to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember those days.  Bill Cosby was not the publics favorite dad on tv at that time.  I believe he was actting in some kind of spy series like I Spy?   But I cant remember the name for sure.  He was protrayed as sauve and sophisticated,  dressed in very fashionable cloths of the time (like a James Bond kind of thing). It was only after a long absence that he took a role as a concerned father on a series.  I use to wonder if he did that to clean up his image but I am only guessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it hard to believe these woman?   We believe adults who accussed Priest of acts committed a long time ago.  Explain the difference please in how the public can support one and not the other?

       Very doubftul. 18 women have made accusations about him, these accusations have been around for over a decade, and the accusations are all extremely similar. And then he refuses to even acknowledge EIGHTEEN women?! Bullshit.

       I'm honestly not sure what to think. I like bill Cosby the comedian and entertainer. I don't believe much the media has to say in general and remember what happened with Michael Jackson (everyone was convinced he was a child molester and then his autopsy reveals the kids inaccurate description of jacksons junk). It's hard to see through the bullshit - are these women being paid? Cosby knows anything he says in response will be spun to make him look guilty. If he were really guilty I think he would be scrambling to put a cover story in place. Maybe he knows this is just a smear campaign and keeping quiet doesn't fuel the fire. If he is guilty, why now?

       Don't listen to the media then. There are 18 different accusations out there and many of them have done interviews. Go listen to their stories, see if you think they are lying.

       I think the opposite. If he were innocent he'd be all over talking about it. Instead he won't even address it. I've never been innocent and not wanted to proclaim it.

       Are rapes usually committed in public and in front of witnesses, or in private or secluded places, away from witnesses? Do rapists usually voluntarily confess their crime, or do they keep quiet and/or deny all accusations? Do all rape victims immediately contact the police? Do they all seek medical assistance? Do they all confide in family and friends? No, no and no. Quite often, physical evidence is not collected while it exists, nor do witnesses always exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       One Cosby victim did call a friend. That friend can corroborate much of the victim's story. He shared his story with the media. Oh, but since it's an interview conducted by, and reported by, the media; I guess we should discount it.

       Exactly. You should be able to tell the difference. If it's a snippet don't rely on it. If it's a drawn out interview where you hear the questoins and the full answers it's a different story.

       You are aware that these accusation have been in the public for over a decade right? There is nothing soon about this. The reason I'm more sure of it than ever is because there are now 18 seperate accusations that all have almost identical stories that match the stories that came out a decade ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I could be wrong, but as long as Cosby keeps stutterng and stammering when confronted with the accusations I'm going to keep giving the benefit of the doubt to the 18 women. If he wants to give his side of the stories then I'm all ears and would give him a chance. If there's anything I have it's an open mind.

       So who in particular do you feel is lying and what part of their story made you think that? Because there are some pretty detailed accusations out there that mention specific casting calls and very specific instances of meeting Cosby. I'd like to know which ones you feel are lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because itt sounds to me like you haven't actually heard any of their accusations outside of the headlines. You should take a minute and actually listen to some of their stories of what happened. As far as I know only one or two of the accusations have been made anonymously. So who don't you believe?

       I don't care who you are if you get raped or feel like you got raped or drugged you're not going to wait 30 years to report it. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. Fuck how much money he has you still can have your voice heard.

       Sure, but it gets harder when you make police reports and have to corroborate your claims.

       It's my understanding that the statue of limitations is up on these but the police are still investigating and have asked for a sit down talk with Cosby. So they must think there are more than lies there.

       I would, yes.  Having said that though, I'm always suspicious of potential "smear campaigns" when a person is convicted in the "court of public opinion" so to speak.

       The other possibility is that the claims are true and the women were paid or coerced to keep quiet and now were told to come forward.

       If you're certain Bill Cosby is a rapist please take your evidence to the police as quickly as possible, rape is a very serious crime and people should be in prison if they abuse someone that wa... oh right, you're you're assuming he is guilty without a trial.

       Dude, it's not a fucking sexcapade. He has been accused by EIGHTEEN different women of drugging and raping them. Who the fuck cares that he bought you a fucking bus pass? At this point if he doesn't address the accusations I'm convinced they are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first accusations came over 10 years ago and now there have been eighteen different people all claiming almost identical stories.

       That's the oddest part. SO many women are silent about a famous person, especially one known for his Fatherhood memoir and Tv persona? Doesn't make sense...

       You're assuming he doesn't get due process?
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell do you take someone seriously who waits 30 years to report rape. This is nothing but a smear campaign against Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean come on it's Bill Cosby with his kind of money there are plenty of girls willing to throw themselves at him, now all of a sudden when he's ripe, old, and full of money they want to cash out.

       And then again, some of these woman are at the top of their proffession and dont need the money.  If they are correct, didnt he ever think it would eventually come up?  Did he ever think that some of those women would come forward because they carried enough of a reputation now that they would be believed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the ladies motive?  I suspect that details are meantioned in reports that are similar in nature not completely disclosed to the public.  These reports can verify the validity of the reports if the information keeps showing up similar to someone elses report.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he wants it to blow over so he is staying quite.  If he continues to voice his opinion he might end up being reponsible of those reports coming to the publics attention.  Its best he just doesnt say anything and he lets the public back him because of his later reputation as being kid friendly.

       Why do people confess to murders they didn't commit? People do fucked up stuff and we have to account for it.

       Him refusing to speak is the best thing he can do legally, if it ever goes to trial he doesn't want his story to be shredded because the media edited something he said out of context and then pushed that onto the TV screens. If any one accused me of rape I would say "Speak to my lawyer, I will not publicly comment on this matter" because it is the only possible way to keep yourself safe from your words being twisted against you

       Sure, but it gets harder when you make police reports and have to corroborate your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my understanding that the statue of limitations is up on these but the police are still investigating and have asked for a sit down talk with Cosby. So they must think there are more than lies there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as I know Cosby doesn't deny meeting or knowing any of these women. You'd think he'd at least deny this stuff if it were completely fabricated, no?

       How did they find these women? Run a series of ads in major newspapers and on Craigslist for several months? "Are you a woman who once met Bill Cosby? If so, we'd like to talk with you. Contact us at (800)123-4567"
