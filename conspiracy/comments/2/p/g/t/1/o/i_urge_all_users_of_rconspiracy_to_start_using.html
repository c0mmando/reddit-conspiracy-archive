       I've been doing this for a while now. When I see an obvious shill, I tag them as such with Reddit Enhancement Suite. I'm sure I'm nowhere near tagging all of them (as most of them probably run dozens of accounts), but in no time, you'll start to notice those tags popping up everywhere you go.
      </p>
      <p>
       How I determine if someone is a Shill, thus getting them on my tag list:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moderates and/or frequently posts on known Shill-filled and otherwise harassment subreddits. Examples include
         <a href="/r/conspiratard">
          /r/conspiratard
         </a>
         and
         <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">
          /r/SubredditDrama
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moderates political subreddits which are likely to be subverted, based on their censorship history or being moderated by other known shills. Some examples include
         <a href="/r/politics">
          /r/politics
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="/r/news">
          /r/news
         </a>
         and
         <a href="/r/worldnews">
          /r/worldnews
         </a>
         , as well as a plethora of very specific political or otherwise sensitive subs,  and anything involving recent "terrorism" attacks (which are always squatted on by known Shills the moment any sort of attack of this nature happens.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moderates literally dozens (if not hundreds) of Subreddits, especially of the political or harassment variety.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Frequently makes posts whitewashing horrible government or military practices, or tries to make excuses for why these violations of the constitution or war crimes are acceptable to them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Calls people "Conspiratards" or says comments such as "Your tin-foil hat is too tight!" or "
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         is leaking!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Frequently makes satirical jokes about known conspiracies or what are believed by the mainstream to be conspiracies but are actually controlled opposition talking points. For example, joking that they just received their payment of Shekels for shilling.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mocks people for questioning the official story of anything. Even if the official story may be correct in some cases, the story should always at the very least be questioned and examined from alternate angles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Obvious JIDF shills. People who do virtually nothing but whitewash the crimes of Israel and demonize Palestinians and Muslims in general. Crying Antisemitism when anyone says anything negative about Israel is a common trait of these people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gets a post reaching the front page of Reddit and/or a major Subreddit (such as
         <a href="/r/pics">
          /r/pics
         </a>
         ) with obvious military/government worship propaganda, or an obvious advertisement, especially if they are a new account or an account that has not posted in several months.  In the former case, an example might be "Look at this cute puppy our squad got!" or "Check out us Marines doing this hilarious pose!". In the latter case, an example might be "Look at this Major Cola Brand Can that I found! It looks kind of mildly interesting for some reason! Here is a picture of it where you can't see anything but a logo!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Obvious controlled opposition. People who pretend to be on our side, but work for the government to try and make us all look like fools by association, posting things that are either blatantly insane or try to incite violence against the enemy. For example, someone who posts things like "Alex Jones should become president to free us from the mind control of the Reptilians!" or "Zionists are scum! I say we should start a new Holocaust!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://pastebin.com/irj4Fyd5">
          People who follow the shill handbook, so to speak.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do not immediately tag someone as a Shill based on these reasons alone. Always look into their history to make sure that they are doing this frequently and not once or twice. Just because someone who is ignorant of what is going on posts on one of the harassment subs once or twice does not mean they are automatically a shill.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       After you have done this for some time, you will notice that these people pop up all over the place on Reddit, and though it may seem like there's literally thousands of people who agree with the government's story, it's actually the same couple dozen people with sketchy histories talking around in circles.

       People need to look at themselves and make sure they aren't labeling people as shills just because they disagree.  One of my good friends meets about half the shit on this list and they are not paid shills, though I'm sure they wish they got paid for it.  He is very far right wing, former military, and enjoys mocking conspiracy theorists.  He's also very "patriotic".  Based on what people have been called shills on this subreddit, and comparing it with how he posts on another forum, he would be labeled a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he's not.  Becareful that you don't mistake a pro-state patriotic person who has fallen under the sway of the media they follow as a shill.  One is a lost cause, the other is worth an intelligent discussion.

       This is right, the level of paranoia in relation to shills has understandably risen in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       since the NSA leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reality of the situation is that some people genuinely enjoy arguing with conspiracy theorists (political debate can be fun, especially with someone who wholeheartedly disagrees with you), some enjoy mocking them, some are honestly here because they care and are interested in conspiracies, but they do not subscribe to about 80 percent of the content posted here (I belong to this category).
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are trolls, just stupid teenagers who love nothing more than to wind up this community and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, there are far more users here that fit into one of the above categories than there are paid government shills, if there even are any paid shills here, because no one can really prove it anyway.

       I disagree.  I have routinely seen people who believe some conspiracies but disagree with others, labeled as "shills".  And it happens frequently.  In fact, anytime there is a major disagreement about a conspiracy in this sub you can see someone claiming that "shills are rampant" in this thread.  I normally say nothing, but the claim of "shill" is used most frequently by people in place of discussing.  Sometimes its been used on people who are simply asking questions that 100% should be asked, but the person doesn't know how to answer.  There is a good answer, they just don't know it, so, into the shill bucket the asker goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a significant difference between a troll, a shill, a disagreer, and a mocker.  I have no doubt there are paid shills, especially when it comes to larger issues like GMO's/Monsanto.  But sometimes its just a very controversial topic with a lot of heated opinions.  But the claims of shill are used pretty indiscriminately.

       I rarely see anyone here actually accuse a specific user of being a shill due to a disagreement. I see plenty of people referring to shills or broadly talking about shills here being a problem. But I have rarely seen one user directly accuse another person of being a shill, I have seen users hint at it, but that is different than straight up saying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Impling that another user may be here with an agenda is not the same as a straight up "you are a shill" accusation.

       Thats because we do routinely have threads that are brigaded and full of shills. Whats your point?

       Sourcing a thread is not the same as "accusing someone of being a shill because they disagree with you".

       No, its worse.  Its accusing entire threads worth of people who disagree as being shills.  Any significantly controversial topic is subject to being "brigaded" by people who disagree with you.  It happens all over reddit with all kinds of issues and subjects.  You don't NEED shills to explain it.  All you need is a small fractions of the hundreds of thousands of redditors to disagree, or find the view silly, and get their online buddies to come over and argue with them.  Brigading is a real thing on Reddit.  But you don't need shills to do that.  I'm not saying shills don't exist, but I think the claim is largely over used.

       </p>

      <p>
       At least they think they are dealing with shills and think they can recognize the difference. There is no objective proof, just their interpretation and opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They always run the risk of being wrong. Which I think is worth baring in mind when having discussions on here.

       Yup. And they could be right. In the end, some are wrong and some are right. Yet a lot of the users here like to act like everyone is wrong about shills and that they don't even exist or only exist in our imaginations. Or we get that same tired excuse "people just accuse others of being shills because they disagree".

       I'd be interested in seeing the direct evidence online government shilling that mentions Reddit by name.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, I am aware that shills exist, China and Russia are guilty of that, and it would appear that the US is just as bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I question whether or not they frequent this subreddit in particular. To my mind, governments will only spend time and money on popular online political communities that actually have some sort of influence in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I'm shitting on this community by saying that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a bad place or anything, it just seems to be a drop in the online political ocean that doesn't have any influence over the online or real world political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there are a few shills who might be hear to subvert discussion, but only on very select topics. Maybe Monsanto, maybe. Certainly not topics like 9/11 or Sandy "Hoax".

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       by this thinking, anyone who disagrees with you can be essentially labeled a shill.  This is the antithesis of intellectual discussion and deductive reasoning to simply label someone as a shill and move on.  But its your mind.  Close it off as you wish.

       OP is talking about tagging them for their own use.  You would have to tag your own.  You can do this through the Reddit Enhancement Suite.  I know you can download it for Firefox, not sure about Chrome and IE since I don't use them but I think you can for them as well.
