       Why does it look like this, does it mean that the user has been banned from Reddit?

       That won't take more than a day at the most, if you made 5 comments and they got neither an answer, an upvote or a downvote, you would check for a shadowban.

       I sub to
       <a href="/r/Futurology">
        /r/Futurology
       </a>
       .  A while back (8 months or so), the subreddit was becoming a default sub, the mods
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/needamod/comments/23e7du/rfuturology_new_default_subreddit_dedicated/">
        started looking to expand the modlist
       </a>
       .  One of the applicants was the notorious
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       . Since this was a community-driven application process, I downvoted and wrote a fairly worded dissagreement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Strong vote against BioplarBear0 being a mod of
        <a href="/r/Futurology">
         /r/Futurology
        </a>
        . I am a member of that subreddit, and have seen the majority of the issues presented against him (
        <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">
         /r/SubredditDrama
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        and elsewhere) and do not feel he is a qualified mod for any default subreddit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The next day I stopped receiving upvotes or responses.  It took until I tried to link post to
       <a href="/r/Futurology">
        /r/Futurology
       </a>
       (ironically, the reason I even commented in the first place) to realize I was shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       That whole experience really turned me off of reddit for a bit, so I went back to lurking.  Eventually I set this account up, but now I keep my mouth shut on any mod issues.  Not worth it to fuck with petty assholes who think internet power == real power.

       Or maybe the reddit admins learned from

        this incident

       If we all saw a [deleted] next to the thread then that would throw even more suspicion on to the motives of removing it.

       The admins have shown they are indifferent when it comes to the mods, the mods can do whatever they like for the most part.  This has been well established if you have followed r/subredditdrama and some of the shit the mods have pulled over the years without being bammed themselves.

       Get your facts straight. That mod held the wow subreddit for ransom and contacted wow devs saying that unless they helped him skip login queues he'd keep it private. He then tried to play the victim card.

The mods have gotten away with tons of shit over the years and alot of them are still top mods on most of the default and major subs.

       Someone posted an answer but I wanted to provide another.  A mod was pissed off that he couldn't play the expansion due to the queue times.  So he threatened to shut down the sub unless he could play by a set deadline.  And then he did.  Admins stepped in and did what they had to to remedy the situation.

       Are you going to answer these questions? 3 years of surfing reddit does not give one insight into what admins give a fuck about. 3 years of being an admin would.

       Yes, voting and commenting brigades that came through links from other subreddits or external sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there's no toxic intent behind,  a lot of users swarming a thread linked in another subreddit is considered a voting brigade and they will get banned if the subreddit is influenced by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accidently get caught in it,  the admins will undo the ban if you message them.

       Yes,  admins don't care about conspiracies and would never be stupid enough to abuse their most powerful tool and get into the line of fire.  Why would they ban someone for a political link when they allow racist,  misogynist and rape subreddits? That's just naive thinking and grabbing for straws.

       I have seen so many accounts getting shadowbanned and all were justified. Some weren't and were banned because they accidentally were identified as a part of a brigade, but it got revoked after a short communication with the admins.

       The "but" clause doesnt matter, the fact is some undeserving users were shadowbanned. Some might still be and have just not contacted admins or just dont know. Thus by saying all shadow bans are deserved but some in the past was also not deserved he is invalidating his claim in the same paragraph.

        When did reddit become a pro-establishment echo-chamber?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Long time ago my friend. It is steadily getting worse so that the front page and most of the main subs are indistinguishable from the likes of tumblr or the kind of shit people's moms post on Facebook. Anything serious is very much pro-establishment.

       It's nice to have a forum for ourselves, but the real work that needs to be done is spreading knowledge efficiently and accurately. Maybe a few thousand people will see a post of mine, but those people will parrot the knowledge off to family members, coworkers, and across Reddit as well.

       It has been a concerted effort of the U.S. military and intelligence community to marginalize and label anyone who does not toe the line. That is how you keep leaders of revolts from rising. . . You give the the followers the strong suggestion that if they believe anything other than the party line, they will be ostracized. "Be safe, stay with the herd."

       I think the real problem with this sort of thing is that it usually discredits any valid arguments on the Big Guy's side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very pro-vaccine, somewat pro-nuclear, worriedly pro-GMO, pro-empathy for folks dealing with people who might really know about ticking time bombs, and pro the idea that Putin might have some valid points to make. I'm pro the idea that something or other might unexpectedly  rescue us from global warming. I feel as if Israel is my strong, smart, wonderful, addled little brother who is being goaded by real bad guys into doing crazy things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also think there are so many shills and manipulators who are sort of on my side on those issues that it's hard for me to make a credible case for my positions. Any thinking swing voter will think I'm a shill and tune me out.

       Yea it's been going on for years. Wasn't there some big thing about this a few years back? It was when all of a sudden there was a huge influx of patriotism and all the tils about Americas navy compared to other nations. In the end iirc a lot of those posters only posted pro American content and there was a whole reddit investigation.

       They remove posts because people often vote based on political ideas and not whether the contents actually worth reading. The mods there have been doing their best to make sure

       Yeah, no idea how people rationalize it away as political bullshit. I mean come on, how far does your head have to be up your ass to believe that? The timing lines up perfectly. TIL is not political, this is idea control plain and simple. I've been noticing a trend on reddit where asking for a source was attributed to being a neck beard, entertaining the idea of conspiracy is ridiculous / has something to do with people not having real world experience / you are a conspiritard.

       That may be but there are certain taboo posts that they don't allow. We all know the political arena this tarnished and not looking good right now. TIL is a great place to vent those things out so others can learn. Where else would someone post something like that others can learn?

       How do you verify why a person voted the way they did without polling them directly? Furthermore, what does it matter the reason behind why it was voted for? If you / they / it disagree, talk about it in the comments. Removing a submission shuts down any chance of debate or conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that the post would have stuck had the political views of the moderators / admins / whomever agreed with the message? Why should a post be censored purely for political views? Reddit left subreddits such as
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/picsofdeadkids">
        /r/picsofdeadkids
       </a>
       up forever, which is arguably much more offensive and damaging then the effects of a single post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who decides what content is actually worth reading?More importantly, who decides what is worth reading for reddit users? Isn't that the point of the voting system, such that users can downvote irrelevant posts / comments and upvote something interesting / worth looking at? I didn't join and I don't use this site because I want my information pre-screened and filtered for me, that's why I the user have the ability to hide comments, downvote them, unsubscribe from subreddits... I don't need anyone else to filter my content, I'm perfectly capable of doing it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To sum up, you may think that's political bullshit, but it does not justify preventing me from viewing content and forming my own opinions of said content.

       Your questions are all misdirection, and you never answered my first question. When's the last time a top post in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been non political? Look at the difference between the votes for political post vs non political posts,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is what happens when you allow political posts in a non political subreddit. It becomes a giant shithole circlejerk pushing political opinions on people.  I dont want your political agendas shoved down my throat. All of reddit is not your soapbox. Keep it in the cesspit that is
       <a href="/r/politics">

       I had lots of karma in a sub thread of this thread which was pretty high up.  A gentleman had basically made a joke about tinfoil itching a bit before saying ''thus is the stuff we know about.'' What followed was a food discussion about psyops  around  conspiracy theorists to shut down debate.  I don't doubt the content of the comments played into the removal.

       Yes, I saw the exact comment chain actually. It sparked a discussion that actually made me proud to be here again. Reminded me of the kinds of things we talked about 6-7 years ago.

       Now says 'Removed due to copyright complaint by Honr Network'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Checked their YouTube channel. Full of 'anti-conspiracy' videos claiming to debunk Sandy Hook anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did another search and found this guy complaining about them - getting his videos removed despite not having copyrighted material...

       They want to hold "hoaxers" legally responsible for what they say. I'm looking more into it. Read the about. They basically use every tool they can from straw men and I'm sure other fallacies I don't know the name of. Talks about truthers crossing the line of free speech. Holy shit.

       It's the user base really. It's become mainstream for Americans and other Westerners and now we are seeing the publics opinion reflected in perhaps a more true manner. And that means shit like being racist, being pro-war, being very nationalist and militaristic, getting angry whenever someone criticises "da troops" or "the people that keep us safe" (e.g: CIA or GCHQ). Stop copping out and saying it's the government and realise that the average person is a pretty fucked up person, who is also there to be easily manipulated by populist far right agenda. It has happened since day 1 of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read the comments on news websites like BBC or Daily Mail when it comes to torture. Every comment is vehemently in favour of doing all kinds of torture and nobody gives a damn if anyone innocent is caught up or not, or whether it even works. As far as people are concerned, because ISIS does it, they can do whatever they want too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It honestly won't take much at this point for something to happen and for people to get on board with some seriously crazy things, things that have happened in so called enlightened European countries not many decades ago. Not much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I've been trying to say for a long time but what people just don't get.
      </p>
      <p>
       These countries we live in, America, Canada, UK etc.. are just as fucked up as any other country, the people are just as fucked up, ignorant and stupid and downright evil as any other country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody gives a fuck about democracy or any of the ideals that the West likes to harp on about, especially in the UK, where even the concept of human rights is being ridiculed on a daily basis. Canada is no better, Australia is no better. They both have batshit insane far right  governments that have massive popularity.

       Given the timing of the post (with the recent CIA torture report) I'd say there's a pretty solid argument that the post IS related to recent politics.

       I think its fair to say that if a thread being deleted makes you think its connected to censorship about a recent political event, the topic of that thead is related to that recent political event. The whole reason you think its suspicious is because of the recent report.  There have been links about cia torture at the top of most political subreddits for days, from r/republican to r/politics to r/worldnews.

       I was assuming that you think that its getting deleted is cencorship relating to the recent cia torture report. if not, other people in this thread have found, for you, where this was posted months ago in til and not deleted. If a post about torture got to the top of funny it would also get deleted and I would similarily defend that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do think that post was deleted due to recent cia torture, than your admitting that the material is related. Do you think the comment section was about anything other than recent allegations against the cia? And more importantly, what does it matter next to the dozens of articles about it in other subreddits that arent trying to avoid heated political discussion. The only thing thays blatant your hyperbolic style of thinking, where I and dozens of people in this thread are supporting blatand cencorship. No one supports cencorship here, and the fact that so many people here arent going with your view means its not so blatant.

       I think it is getting deleted because anything that goes against the "US is great, pro-establishment circlejerk" and ends up getting a lot of attention, suddenly disappears.

       I don't give a shit about how rules can be interpreted, at the end of the day I see a bigger picture than that. And that picture is what disturbs me. So I will keep pointing out the little bumps in the road like this one. These incidents are not isolated. They are part of a bigger design.

       Are you for real dude? If recent news talk about something that happened a while ago, but is still one of the main event talked about in the news, then the rule applies. It's just there to avoid people posting news to farm karma. If you want to discuss recent news, go to
       <a href="/r/news">

       Exactly -- the point being that a CIA torture program that occurred in the Vietnam war is not news, it's
       <em>
        history
       </em>
       . That is stunningly obvious.

       Since they deleted the post anyway the conclusion is that the rule is not in place to address practical problems like people spamming news; it's in place to minimize discourse around politics in general. So any historical fact or event that is related to the current CIA torture debacle
       <em>
        in any shape or form

       is blacklisted on
       <a href="/r/TIL">

       you have support, at least from me (I PM'd you about similar stuff the other day with another throwaway), and your posts are not unnoticed.
       <em>
        I want to thank you personally for your persistence
       </em>
       in raising these issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       whether it's from top-down broken administration, from outside investments in manipulating the site, or some incestuous combination,
      </p>
      <p>
       you are time &amp; time again helping to highlight suspicions I have had about reddit for several months, suspicions piqued only further by the bizarro reddit that emerged during Ferguson.  suddenly crowds that espouse rational discourse and argumentation are pitchforking anybody who dares to entertain anything less than the hardline creed in this week's news or worldnews
       <em>
        2 Minute Hate
       </em>
       .  even asking questions and expressed uncertainty re: MSM narrative was getting people downvoted into -50 oblivion.  people who simply catalogued facts from the livestreams that weren't mentioned on this or that mainstream account of protest were being similarly nuked off into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is not the ordinary dissonance of being met with a large group with whom you disagree, but the implausibility of such a sudden change in "zeitgeist" when certain hot topics make the rounds on worldnews or what have you.   there is a palpable &amp; purposeful myopia in effect.  Ferguson threads would have been all the more interesting to read had reddit not cloaked its voting process in a blanket of secrecy.   now subject to fuzzing and "arbitrary" weighting behind the scenes, we can no longer say "alright, well, I got shilled down to -50 or a bunch of rabid partisans legitimately disagreed with me, whatever, but at least 30 users agree with me anyways" &amp; this strikes me as a clear move to push for so-called social cohesion on every community this website hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       look deeper.  when you see a sudden influx of uncharacteristic pro-cop postings in this or that sub normally ready to lynch even the most justified police officer, and when you see posts being buried by the hundred before they even score, investigate a few related posters and you will often note registrations of less than a year -- these are in themselves unremarkable, but those with no post history prior to recent events (pre-aged accounts) and those with Markov chains gibberish and what appears to be reposted content (pre-seeded accounts) are worth further note.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point there can be absolutely no ignoring that reddit is a forum festering with the rhizomic interests of multiple parties, government PR programs, bots and shills at one another's throat, and a heavy hand of moderator and Conde Naste influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is
       <em>
        easy
       </em>
       to ignore the fact that reddit hosts an atmosphere steeped with ideology &amp; ideological actors, but it's dangerous to ignore the fact that this ideology is now all the more obviously on strings.

       Well, for one, you could let the people voting decide what goes on the front page and not throw together a list of "terms and conditions" that are designed to be interpreted any way the mods please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving them license to delete whatever they want and then just sit back while a bunch of know-it-alls come out of the woodwork to naively defend them because "its the rules guise". People are so damn gullible.

       That was an established subreddit though.  This is from scratch.  Plus, I'm lazy as fuck and really have no desire to actually put in the work as a moderator. We'll see how it goes I guess.

       Interesting interview with ex-reddit mod....
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview recently conducted with an ex Reddit moderator, details have emerged that suggests initial speculation on content manipulation within Reddit.com for the purpose of profit for 3rd parties to be not only true, but common place in practice among certain members of its moderation team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the source of these accusations has declined to comment on specific cases of such behaviour, IndieJuice has been informed that content manipulation for 3rd party profit is part of a much larger issue within Reddit’s internal posting and user relationship structure. The extent to which is currently unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original allegations of content manipulation arose from members of Reddit’s own community as part of an online controversy surrounding allegations of nepotism within the video game industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such allegations were dismissed by a member of Reddit’s administration team as the work of another online community, in an attempt to discredit a known games developer, as well as embroil their associates in a sex scandal, by method of an ‘internet raid’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given new light on the matter, such claims are only partially valid.
While an attempt was made by an alternative online community to influence specific content on Reddit.com, the practice of content manipulation is itself an issue that has been common place on specific subreddits by members of their own moderation team.
      </p>
      <p>
       IndieJuice’s source on this matter has suggested that moderators on particular subreddits have engaged in the practice of content manipulation to unfairly benefit specific websites, as well as platform favourable discussion for a 3rd party, at the price of ‘luxuries’. All of which remains unknown to the subreddit’s subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the source was unwilling to provide specific instances of such behaviour, examples were given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trading ‘content flair’ and an ‘ask me anything’, for particular users, was ‘standard’ in a ‘favour for favour’ trade. Though the purpose might vary for a moderator accepting such a request, it was implied that such trades are made at an equal benefit for both parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The implication of such evidence in the case of pre-existing questions of nepotism raises further concern for the question of corruption within the video game industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current discussion on the matter has only ever suggested at the existence of such corruption and has, as such, been limited to possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The form of corruption suggested by IndieJuice’s source is extensive. It is also very particular, in that it extends itself far beyond normal questions of ethical conduct and acceptable practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though IndieJuice is unable to mention further specifics that implicate members of Reddit’s administration team in general, informal, misconduct despite the interview revealing as much, what may be said is that specific moderators are involved in the original controversy of ethical press coverage itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scale of this entire issue has yet to make itself known, though the source did hint at the fact that major video game news sites, and members of their associated press, might also be involved; or at the very least, specific well-known individuals acting of their own accord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the original controversy raised on Reddit focused specifically on a game developer, recent events have caused the entire ethic of journalism within the video game industry to come into question.
This also includes quality of content and the nature of favourable reviews in the instance of pre-existing relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction to this issue has been mixed, by those both within the scope of controversy, and those beyond.
What may be said is that it is no longer an issue of ‘misogynists’ on the loose in social media, but of the ability of those whom wish to express themselves being able to do so safely. On both sides of the argument.

       Because it was

        deleted
       </em>
       from the sub. Hence finding it in r/undelete.

       If it were removed after its allotted time slot, then it would still be in the subreddit.

       I saw that thread for hours before I left the house yesterday. Hours and hours. Long enough for it to reach the top of All. You would think that if this was deleted because of the content it wouldn't have made it more than maybe one hour. Certainly not most of the day. It was up for a LONG time. ok maybe not a full 24 hrs as all day would imply. But really, it was up all day.

       No, you cannot change the bar and say "You would think that if this was deleted because of the content it wouldn't have made it more than maybe one hour."

       It being deleted after hours on the front page proves that it isn't the big deal you want it to be. Hours. not a single hour as if it were some secret the PTB want kept. Why did it take hours if there are people monitoring this site and deleting things ala the memory hole? You are just wrong. And you can downvote me all you want I dont care. You're simply wrong. That thread was up for hours, during daylight. Not "when America woke up" as all this implies. That shit was up for hours during business hours. You guys are simply wrong.

       Those aren't mistakes. Those are exactly what this thread is all about. That isn't a mistake, it's completely intentional. idk why I bothered with this at all. There's a good reason you guys are derided. You can't take simple criticism. Ironic given the nature of your obsession. You can't take someone pointing out your faults. Those things you want to not be made public. You're fucking delusional.

       Do you think the humans working behind the scenes are almighty and powerful, like the gods? Because that is what your thinking implies. It implies that such gods would never make a silly thing like an error. They are obviously more like a machine with a 100% success rates that perfectly conforms to MrPim's personal philosophies of reality.

       So, the powers that be monitor Reddit, but they do it incompetently? They are so worried about a reddit thread that they would have it deleted, but drag their feet in doing so? See if I had that power, and gave two shits what the world thought, I'd have someone on this. That would be their job. Oh no, we'll just get back to that after lunch.

       You would think that they'd be a little better at their job. Being all powerful and all.

       Oh please. This is implied here every day. This entire thread is implying that TPB are here deleting threads to keep information secret. Every anti govt thread in existence is "The Powers" want to keep you stupid. That's why those threads exist. You want to feel smarter than your average citizen and the govt itself.  YOU CAUGHT EM PUTIN_HATES_CATS THEY DELETED A THREAD, after it had been up for hours and hundreds of thousands of people saw it. Good work detective. Good thing they were asleep at the switch.

       Yeah, whether you want to keep your head in the sand or not, there is loads of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hf77e/internet_trolls_may_be_trained_government_agents/cks8exy">
        well documented proof
       </a>
       that the government has its hands all over the web in places like FB, youtube, twitter, and reddit.
      </p>

       But hey, if you feel like "you want to feel smarter than your average citizen and the govt itself" then maybe you are just projecting. You shouldn't feel so inadequate.

       Absolutely. So I'd think maybe they have a little better handle on it than just leave shit laying about. Or no, you're right. That thread existed for as long as it did and Sam was asleep at the switch. Bullshit. And the longer you keep selling bullshit like this the longer people wont take you seriously when they need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, what most of the conspiracy community doesn't understand is the danger of 'the boy who cried wolf'. You keep selling bullshit, and no-one is going to take you seriously when they need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, you keep doing what you're doing. Unless you want to be taken seriously when the time actually calls for it.

       You've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins. I'm just politely letting you know, because otherwise you'd continue writing comments that no one can see.

       Want to change it, start organizing. Ensure that as many submissions to as many subreddits as possible on the same day are about this. Coordinate 1000 people all submitted different links on this to the site all at once. Sure, the mods will start working on removing them, but hit this at the appropriate time, and people will notice, and then the site admins will have to respond.

       the comments in that thread were atrocious, blaming the current administration for the worst activities of the CIA during the Vietnam war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the title was factually misleading for political reasons. The atrocities were committed by vietnamese civillians, and not under orders from the CIA. The CIA doesn't even give orders. Their goal was to create a counter insurgency in Vietnam and they succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a war, by the way, which killed something like 3 million vietnamese, and would have killed more if we had "won". A terrorist program which were to dramatically lower the cost in lives of that campaign is simply a better alternative. It seems particularly horrible now because we all seem to agree that we should never have invaded Vietnam in the first place, but that was not the CIAs prerogative.

Nobody oppresses political activity like left-wingers.  Look at the USSR, East Germany, China, any far left country.  No matter what - these countries use any measure possible to repress any contrary opinion to theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is echoed in the left wing's view that "freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of consequences for the speech."  Even though that's exactly what it does mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wherever you find the left wing operating, you'll find a horde of censors ready to silence any political view that doesn't agree with the party line.

       Why are people saying the post being up for 9 hours was proof it wasn't corrupted? Wouldn't it have made more sense for a mod to pull it before it got 3000 up-votes if it was breaking the rules? Do the mods then disagree on what makes a post deletion worthy or breaks the subreddits rules? Either way, seems like corruption to me, but I might just be reading into dumb subreddit b.s.

       lol ok and plus who is going to be held accountable for this most of the people involved are most likely rotting in hell figuratively. All I am basically seeing is the South Vietnamese a known regime who tortured were torturing people and from that the CIA would get some information don't you love sensationalism

       To be clear, I didn't mean to insult anyone, just to say that it wasn't Reddit's doing. It came out wrong, sorry about that.
But I think we all know the government has the power to pressure Reddit to remove it. Plus, this is

       Yeah it was us pesky Americans deleting posts so the world doesn't know what they can search on the Internet. Dumbass. On behalf of my fellow Americans and the Marines I served with, I'm here to say: WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS BULLSHIT. We're not parading around acting like our government is golden. Quite the contrary, it feels as if we are slowly but surely becoming aware of what needs to change. That's the majority of drone like people that live here, but there's a lot of us that are ready and have been ready to help initiate that change. No matter what it takes.

       even if it did break rules, how are these moderators so fucking stupid and narrow minded to believe their own little rules are more important than educating people on such important matters?

       It was still an echo chamber 6-7 years ago, just a different one. There was no competition and it was controlled by liberal techie early adopters. Now it's mainstream and larger entities are trying to control the conversation. I don't disagree with the sentiment of your post, but the voting system is basically designed to produced an echo chamber so let's make sure we call it what it is.

       In order for you to feel all warm inside, who would go to jail and for how long? Cheney, Bush, the entire staff of the CIA that period, only those directly were involved? 1 week, 1 year, life in prison? People will never be content. I think discussion and acknowledgment of the poor nature of some of the tactics is enough

       i've been disappointed with news coverage, frankly. NPR refuses to even say the word 'torture' on their program, instead using the state department's language : enhanced interrogation.
      </p>
      <p>
       USA Today remarked that 'al qaeda' was the target of torture, but the torture reports demonstrate not only al qaeda people tortured, but several others including those who don't condone terrorism at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from my very limited experiences with the news coverage, it is not very critical. More like throwing soft balls at the torturers, when the torturers should be removed from power and locked up in a jail cell. Do you know of any major news agencies calling for trials and arrests of decisionmakers, top-to-bottom?

       No, you cannot change the bar and say "You would think that if this was deleted because of the content it wouldn't have made it more than maybe one hour."

       I think its fair to say that if a thread being deleted makes you think its connected to censorship about a recent political event, the topic of that thead is related to that recent political event. The whole reason you think its suspicious is because of the recent report.  There have been links about cia torture at the top of most political subreddits for days, from r/republican to r/politics to r/worldnews.

       Those aren't mistakes. Those are exactly what this thread is all about. That isn't a mistake, it's completely intentional. idk why I bothered with this at all. There's a good reason you guys are derided. You can't take simple criticism. Ironic given the nature of your obsession. You can't take someone pointing out your faults. Those things you want to not be made public. You're fucking delusional.

       It did have an explanation, It was banned for "politics". And the actual rule written in the sub is "No recent politics".
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I keep forgetting that the "rules" are open to interpretation to the point where mods or admins can do anything they want.

       I was assuming that you think that its getting deleted is cencorship relating to the recent cia torture report. if not, other people in this thread have found, for you, where this was posted months ago in til and not deleted. If a post about torture got to the top of funny it would also get deleted and I would similarily defend that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do think that post was deleted due to recent cia torture, than your admitting that the material is related. Do you think the comment section was about anything other than recent allegations against the cia? And more importantly, what does it matter next to the dozens of articles about it in other subreddits that arent trying to avoid heated political discussion. The only thing thays blatant your hyperbolic style of thinking, where I and dozens of people in this thread are supporting blatand cencorship. No one supports cencorship here, and the fact that so many people here arent going with your view means its not so blatant.

       Yes, voting and commenting brigades that came through links from other subreddits or external sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there's no toxic intent behind,  a lot of users swarming a thread linked in another subreddit is considered a voting brigade and they will get banned if the subreddit is influenced by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accidently get caught in it,  the admins will undo the ban if you message them.
