       I was watching "Today" this morning and just thought about how cool our society could be if it was actually how it appeared, and our leaders weren't so corrupt/wasteful.  How cool would the world be?   All the cool technology and gadgets we now have, advancements in many countries with respect to science and medicine, people are generally more educated, etc.  I can see how someone who doesn't look hard enough would think "Everything is Awesome!"

       The whole idea of all this crap going on is to weaken the minds of people. These behind the green curtain "psychotic" entities want to keep people mentally below them thus why we are seeing things like spying, torturing and bombing with machine to which people are just accepting it as normal. Its about placing that small bit of fear in the minds that will keep the population in a mental prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once anyone realizes this they can see it for what it is and move beyond it mentally and beyond the 10% they always say we are using. Its time everyone moves beyond this basic level of thinking allowing the people, planet and universe to get back to center.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever entities are creating this undesired disturbances, they need to find another planet to destroy and let us enjoy this planet!

       A person I used to consider a reasonably intelligent friend, recently posted a photo expose' of themselves receiving and installing that new NEST thermostat in their house.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said "You realize that advertising has just convinced you that something was wrong with your old thermostat and you needed a new one?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of seeing the obvious folly of their purchase, this "friend" proceeded to defend his consumerist indoctrination and thus labeled me as a "hater."

       What sucks is how hard it is to address even aspect, like education. The southern states lag way behind the rest of the country, yet any increase in standards or incentives is met with opposition. Like they say: "You can't fix stupid."

       I was commenting more on the dangerous thinking that such sentiments can be seen as. It might seem funny, but to those that they view as "less than" themselves, you know, like "stupid" people are to many, they think the same way.

       I feel the same way sometimes, but I try to check that thinking. The concept of eugenics comes from the same place as that kind of thinking does. Whether we want to be honest about it in ourselves or not is another question.

       Ah, but it's already underway and they're doing it in a way that pits conspiracy theorists against themselves. It's brilliantly diabolical. Unfortunately, it misses the target by one generation. Then again, the people who put it into motion probably don't care.

       I am with you on that, I believe the program is way more multi-pronged and comprehensive than has ever been discussed here (afaik). From GMO's to pharmaceuticals to brainwashing to fluoridation to vaccinations to other things I don't know about, there is a culling going on that I think people are too horrified to even contemplate existing. You get labeled as crazy for even taking your thoughts there.

       You've fallen into the same trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confirmation bias works both ways. Conspiracy theorists carry a confirmation bias that the establishment (government, big corporations, ultra-wealthy) are always up to no good. Any statement to that effect passes their bullshit filter without a second thought. Just like any statement to the effect of, "The government is looking out for me," passes through the "sheeple's" bullshit filter without a second thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment has leveraged the confirmation bias that mistrusts the establishment to convince non-critical thinkers to chamber a round and play Russian Roulette with their kids' lives. That's the brilliantly diabolical part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might do a more comprehensive analysis of what I mean specifically at some point. We shall see. For now, I need to contemplate it a bit more since I only recently figured out this specific conspiracy. There are a lot of tendrils and I'm still uncovering them.

        Conspiracy theorists carry a confirmation bias that the establishment (government, big corporations, ultra-wealthy) are always up to no good.

      <p>
       But this isn't it. There is so much empirical evidence to support the conclusion that Governments, corporations and the ultra-wealthy are self serving and amoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact many of them are quite open about their intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are attempting to equate confirmation bias to believing something to be true without "evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately when the suspects have a track record of deceitful behavior that includes destruction or concealment of evidence, It's necessary for one to rely on reason and intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
       That really is the difference between the conspiracy theorist and the so-called skeptic.

       There is also evidence to support the conclusion that not EVERYTHING that governments and big corporations and the ultra-wealthy do is immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some billion dollar corporations are neutral to helpful. Some branches and individuals in, and actions by, the government are actually meant for the common good. Some ultra-wealthy people really do just want to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not 100% dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where the CT confirmation bias trips up conspiracy theorists and imparts a degree of control over them to those who understand how to manipulate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinkers should question EVERYTHING, not just what they are predisposed to disagree with, and most especially the things they agree with out of hand / without much thought.

       This is the skeptics approach that I find loathsome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is not a conspiracy, so nothing is a conspiracy unless you can prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just bad logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.) Conspiracies, even massive ones like MKUltra and The Manhattan Project have been revealed throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.) There was a point in time when these conspiracies were unknown to the public and considered heavily guarded secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given these two premises, it is logical to believe that there are currently existing conspiracies, perhaps some quite grand in scope, that have not yet been revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the task of the theorist, to peel away at these conspiracies until they are revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that it's unwise to believe that everything is a conspiracy, however it is equally unwise to believe that only things that can be proven, are a conspiracy.

       I never said the last part. Just the first. Not everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the same token, it's well nigh impossible to prove most conspiracies. You have to get to a point of reasonable belief. Example, Michael Hastings. Will probably never be proved. But sure as hell seems real.

       The character (and intelligence) of peoples around the world has not kept pace with the progress of technology.  This boom in technology is only empowering those who crave power.  This will not end well, because to many people can be fooled and manipulated into war and conflict that only strengthens the position of those who crave power.
