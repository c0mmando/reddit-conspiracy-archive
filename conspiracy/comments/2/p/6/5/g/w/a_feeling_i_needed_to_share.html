    <div class="md"><p>The whole idea of all this crap going on is to weaken the minds of people. These behind the green curtain &quot;psychotic&quot; entities want to keep people mentally below them thus why we are seeing things like spying, torturing and bombing with machine to which people are just accepting it as normal. Its about placing that small bit of fear in the minds that will keep the population in a mental prison.</p>

<p>Once anyone realizes this they can see it for what it is and move beyond it mentally and beyond the 10% they always say we are using. Its time everyone moves beyond this basic level of thinking allowing the people, planet and universe to get back to center.</p>

<p>Whatever entities are creating this undesired disturbances, they need to find another planet to destroy and let us enjoy this planet!</p>

<p>Look at your Newsfeed. Everybody thinks everything is just fucking great. </p>

<p>A person I used to consider a reasonably intelligent friend, recently posted a photo expose&#39; of themselves receiving and installing that new NEST thermostat in their house. </p>

<p>I said &quot;You realize that advertising has just convinced you that something was wrong with your old thermostat and you needed a new one?&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of seeing the obvious folly of their purchase, this &quot;friend&quot; proceeded to defend his consumerist indoctrination and thus labeled me as a &quot;hater.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve fallen into the same trap.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias works both ways. Conspiracy theorists carry a confirmation bias that the establishment (government, big corporations, ultra-wealthy) are always up to no good. Any statement to that effect passes their bullshit filter without a second thought. Just like any statement to the effect of, &quot;The government is looking out for me,&quot; passes through the &quot;sheeple&#39;s&quot; bullshit filter without a second thought.</p>

<p>The establishment has leveraged the confirmation bias that mistrusts the establishment to convince non-critical thinkers to chamber a round and play Russian Roulette with their kids&#39; lives. That&#39;s the brilliantly diabolical part of it.</p>

<p>I might do a more comprehensive analysis of what I mean specifically at some point. We shall see. For now, I need to contemplate it a bit more since I only recently figured out this specific conspiracy. There are a lot of tendrils and I&#39;m still uncovering them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it does. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theorists carry a confirmation bias that the establishment (government, big corporations, ultra-wealthy) are always up to no good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this isn&#39;t it. There is so much empirical evidence to support the conclusion that Governments, corporations and the ultra-wealthy are self serving and amoral. </p>

<p>In fact many of them are quite open about their intentions. </p>

<p>You are attempting to equate confirmation bias to believing something to be true without &quot;evidence.&quot; </p>

<p>Unfortunately when the suspects have a track record of deceitful behavior that includes destruction or concealment of evidence, It&#39;s necessary for one to rely on reason and intuition. </p>

<p>That really is the difference between the conspiracy theorist and the so-called skeptic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also evidence to support the conclusion that not EVERYTHING that governments and big corporations and the ultra-wealthy do is immoral. </p>

<p>Some billion dollar corporations are neutral to helpful. Some branches and individuals in, and actions by, the government are actually meant for the common good. Some ultra-wealthy people really do just want to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not 100% dark.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the CT confirmation bias trips up conspiracy theorists and imparts a degree of control over them to those who understand how to manipulate it.</p>

<p>Critical thinkers should question EVERYTHING, not just what they are predisposed to disagree with, and most especially the things they agree with out of hand / without much thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the skeptics approach that I find loathsome. </p>

<p>Everything is not a conspiracy, so nothing is a conspiracy unless you can prove it. </p>

<p>That is just bad logic. </p>

<p>A.) Conspiracies, even massive ones like MKUltra and The Manhattan Project have been revealed throughout history. </p>

<p>B.) There was a point in time when these conspiracies were unknown to the public and considered heavily guarded secrets. </p>

<p>Given these two premises, it is logical to believe that there are currently existing conspiracies, perhaps some quite grand in scope, that have not yet been revealed. </p>

<p>It is the task of the theorist, to peel away at these conspiracies until they are revealed. </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s unwise to believe that everything is a conspiracy, however it is equally unwise to believe that only things that can be proven, are a conspiracy. </p>

<p>I never said the last part. Just the first. Not everything is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>By the same token, it&#39;s well nigh impossible to prove most conspiracies. You have to get to a point of reasonable belief. Example, Michael Hastings. Will probably never be proved. But sure as hell seems real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s &quot;awesome&quot; for a lot of us because we&#39;re comfortable, but another billion people live in poverty, while ~300 hold a preposterous amount of the global wealth.  It&#39;s okay for <em>a lot of us</em> on a daily basis but everything&#39;s fucked up regardless.  And the shit on TV is nuts; the products and messages they promote to children...they&#39;re rotting society from the inside out, and it sucks because it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.  But it makes more money for the top, so directors and producers are willing to sacrifice a generation&#39;s sense of decency.  It all comes together, and it&#39;s just disheartening.</p>
