        The benefits of vaccination have been systematically oversold for one obvious reason – to drive sales with public health mandates and a huge booster of fear – for the profit of Big Pharma.

        And this push has not been harmless, it has put many people at risk and devastated families – all because margins of known risk from the vaccines have been accepted as a minor casualty in the effort for the “greater good.”

        Berezow argues:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Measles is perhaps the most infectious human disease. Virus particles can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves. And measles is not a minor infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that before widespread vaccination began in 1980, 2.6 million people a year died from measles. About 400 people a day still do.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Put simply, no person has the right to threaten the safety of his community. Like drunken drivers, the unvaccinated pose an imminent danger to others. They pose a lethal threat to the most vulnerable: the immunocompromised, such as HIV or cancer patients, and infants who have yet to receive their vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Anti-vaccine parents are turning their children into little walking time bombs. They ought to be charged for endangering their children and others."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, there you have it: people who create walking time bombs are terrorists; terrorists should be arrested; parents who don’t vaccinate should be arrested for weaponizing their children. Great.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, this propagandist fails to point out, or perhaps even comprehend, that the real reason behind these deaths, though still quite tragic, is compromised immune systems – not the disease iteself. The vast majority of these deaths occur in populations who live without basic conditions of clean water, sanitation and sufficient levels of essential vitamins in their diet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the flu, it tends to kill those who already have weakened or underdeveloped defenses against illness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Measles poses relatively little risk to a healthy child.
        <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-explains-why-he-lets-kids-avoid-the-measles-vaccine/">
         Pediatrician Dr. Jay Gordon told CBS News:
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “This measles outbreak does not pose a great risk to a healthy child,” said Dr. Gordon. “And quite frankly I don’t think it poses any risk to a healthy child.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Not meningitis, not the plague, not Ebola, they’d get measles. Measles is almost an always a benign childhood illness.“

         This chart shows
        </a>
        that while the measles vaccine, first introduced in 1963, dramatically decreased the number of measles cases, the number of deaths from measles was already in a downward spiral, thanks to general advances in reducing childhood mortality, in part due to social focus on improving nutrition and hygiene.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deaths from measles declined from around 10 per 100,000 people in 1912 to around 0.25 per 100,000 in the 1960s. While the introduction of the vaccine did reduce the deaths to near zero, the trend was headed there anyway.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prior to vaccinations, the vast majority of children who contracted measles in the United States caught the disease, endured it, built up their own bodily defenses, and recovered, often after spreading it to other children who also endured it much in the way children spread chickenpox to one another, often intentionally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today there are vaccines for these diseases and more, with plans to roll out vaccines for every conceivable disease under the sun or in the known galaxy. Many parents, doctors and advocates have argued there are now simply too many vaccinations on the schedule for most children to handle, increasing the risk of side effects.

        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#mmr">
         the admitted risk of side effects from the vaccines themselves have overshadowed the risk of the disease.

       <p>
        Hence, many parents have opted out of them, based on a mix of supporting data, precautionary apprehension and, of course, word-of-mouth rumors.
       </p>
       <p>
        After all, it was the MMR shot – the vaccination for measles mumps and rubella that started the whole “anti-vax” affair – prompting significant numbers of parents to opt out of vaccines for their children en masse, and inadvertently triggering panic in the powers-that-be.

       It's funny because I'm not vaccinated for anything -- I got a tetanus shot after an injury and that's it -- and I got most of the childhood diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get sick about once every 3-5 years. I have friends who weren't vaccinated as kids, and they hardly ever get sick either. Everyone else I know who has been vaccinated gets sick once a year, at least. They're lucky not to get the flu, even if they've had the shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your vaccines compromised your immune system. And now what you're experiencing with these outbreaks is secondary vaccine failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccination technology itself works and is useful. But you stupid Americans (and stupid Brits) take everything too far due to greed, and now you're reaping the consequences. Nobody needs a flu shot or an MMR unless you want to wreck your body's ability to naturally fight disease. Vaccines should be reserved for special cases, like the polio vaccine when traveling abroad or a tetanus shot when injured by a metallic object. Giving MMR vaccines to infants and taking a flu shot every year is

       It's known that vaccines are harming fertility, the anti-vaxx will be the only ones having kids, you pro-vaxxers will soon be gone from the genepool.

       The linked article doesn't say where it got its figures from, but as far as I can tell the original source for this claim is here:
       <a href="http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/#map">
        http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/#map
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how the OP says "Number of outbreaks" and not "number of cases"? That's because the outbreaks are tiny. Mouse over them on that map - in 2014, there was a measles "outbreak" of one single person in Fort McMurray, Canada, another single case in Utah, etc. "Number of outbreaks" is not a meaningful statistic when it equates a single case of measles in Bumfuck Nowhere, Alberta with a 3,800-case epidemic in the Solomon Islands, a 2,500-case epidemic in Chad, or a 38,000-case epidemic in China. Each of these epidemics has more cases than every "outbreak" in Canada and the U.S. combined. The Solomon Islands alone had more cases of measles than the whole of North America and Europe put together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder why these small, isolated outbreaks in countries with high vaccination rates remain small and isolated rather than becoming a single nationwide epidemic...

       This is due to good levels of nutrition and sanitation, however the diseases which vaccines are causing do not get prevented by being healthy, the vaccines can harm anyone and leave them permanently disabled for life.

       Or because the measles vaccine works. Even the OP admits as much:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While the introduction of the vaccine did reduce the deaths to near zero, the trend was headed there anyway.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is beside the point, anyway, which is that "number of outbreaks" isn't a meaningful statistic. Number of cases? Number of cases per capita? Sure. But those don't look nearly as good for unvaccinated countries. Not to mention tiny outbreaks of like 1-5 people are much more likely to go unnoticed and unreported in Chad or Sudan than they are in Portland or Glasgow. Simply looking at the number of reported outbreaks while disregarding the number of actual cases is deceptive bullshit for a multitude of reasons.

       Fortunately there are enough armed anti-vaxxers in the US who will shoot to kill anyone who forces their children to be vaccinated, while happily acknowledging that they are defending themselves against a gross violation of their civil liberties.

       Vaccines could only be forced if they could ever be made safe, but unfortunately to make a vaccine effective we also have to make it dangerous, there's no way around that, so hence vaccines have to remain freedom of choice, we can't go forcing parents to have vaccine disabled children.

       I don't agree with that. I believe common vaccines are currently extremely safe and only have a very negligible risk of adverse reactions. I believe even this tiny risk has been reduced over the last few decades by improving manufacturing process, switching from problematic preservatives, and phasing out use of a few controversial components such as thimerosal (the mercury one).

       I respect people's right to disagree with my assessment and encourage them to research and make up their own minds.

       You know, all this hype about measles lately, and i questioned "what do i know about measles?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So i looked into it. First, as always, wikipedia.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 out of 1000 die from measles.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Really? A death rate of 0.3% is causing enough fear that the "general populace" is advocating the passing of legislation to criminalize non-vaccination? Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       So i was like, what does WHO have to say about this?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions...
        <em>
         The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then i found this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prior to the vaccine, 3-4 million cases of measles occured in the United States each year. &lt;—True.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also true, however, is that of those 3-4 million cases, only about 450 people died each year from it in the years before the vaccine....That still seems like a lot? Instead of running out to make sure your vaccinations are up to date, how about a shot of perspective instead?...In the screen shot below, I have figured out the percentage of people who died from measles of all of the measles cases back then.  0.015%.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From here:
       <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2012/01/measles-perspective/">
        http://vaxtruth.org/2012/01/measles-perspective/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 0.3% death rate, or 0.015% death rate, which one is more accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       So i looked further, and turns out, neither the cdc nor WHO clearly defines the average death rate per measles case.
      </p>
      <p>
       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further analysis showed me that measles isnt
       <em>
        THAT
       </em>
       deadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, cherry picking statistics, incredulous sources, whatever the argument against whst im about to say may be warranted. But nothing can really stop the People from asking this one...
      </p>
      <p>
       Does legislation need to be mandated and do threats of incarceration need to be presented to innoculate our children against a disease that really doesnt cause as many deaths as, say, the fucking flu?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really? Or am i missing some incredibke citations that both the CDC and WHO conviently omit from their websites concerning the actual death rates from measles?

       Some tl;dr results from a little [laymen Wiki researching] I did based on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The measles virus used in the MMR vaccine, is grew from the same strain that has been long adapted to strive in hen eggs, but are known to be extremely weak in the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main Polio vaccine was killed with Formaldehyde, which is later washed away leaving the inactivated virus for your immune system to learn. But the small traces of Formaldehyde still get boasted as a potential concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oral Polio vaccine is a special strain of Polio that was mutated using a special technique. This mutated Polio strain is quite understood to be more effective, but have some side effect that could, in a generic and overly-simplistic way, be interpreted as spreading Polio. That is why Oral Polio vaccines are/where only used in areas where live Polio is common. As the population no longer contains live Polio, the Oral Polio vaccine's risk to benefit balance becomes less favorable and the inactivated Polio vaccine is favoured.

       I'm gonna say this again. Soon, half population will be in jail and half will be police. Not in 1 to 1 ratio necessarily.

       I have never given my son vaccinations and he is perfectly healthy.  There is no need for vaccinations they are just a revenue tool.

       Of course they're the highest number of outbreaks.  Probably 6 billion people are vaccinated vs. a few million who are not.  Just by chance you're going to see a lot of people who actually get the disease they were vaccinated against.

       I don't think they should go to jail. I think they should go over there on their own though.

       You and yours are vaccinated, and according to your beliefs, safe from the virus.  Who cares what others choose to do.. Herd immunity is fiction.

       All live virus vaccines can shed the disease, the recipient remains infected for up to two weeks.  Typical examples are the Oral Polio Vaccine and MMR
