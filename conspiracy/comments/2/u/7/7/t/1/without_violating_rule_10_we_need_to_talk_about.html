        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I&#39;m not talking about shills. (Don&#39;t even go there, these are users who sit on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> all day to derail topics and talk shit, but aren&#39;t paid for it. That&#39;s even MORE PATHETIC than being a shill.) </p>

<p>Without mentioning handles, AGAIN, PLEASE DON&#39;T MENTION HANDLES: I&#39;ve noticed a few consistent, persistent users here, who, while refraining from slurs, abusive/threatening language and <em>overt</em> attacks on users and this sub, they are definitely here to stalk and troll. There are two users who first come to mind, just because of their frequency, they sit here for hours a day. But there&#39;s also been a few names I&#39;ve noticed lately, that used to be &quot;regulars&quot; here, that seem to suddenly have switched their views and are now arguing against widely accepted ideas here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about skeptics or the truly inquisitive, who freshly arrived here, are asking for definitions or background information. I&#39;m referring to DEBUNKERS, those so rigidly set in their ways, that they deny any theories, dismiss any evidence as &quot;invalid&quot; or generally dismiss users here as &quot;mentally ill, uneducated, paranoid, religious, superstitious,&quot; ad infinitum...  They are subtly engaging in nearly every thread in the new queue. Getting into deeply threaded arguments with users, then POOF! refusing to respond to direct questions about their actions. OVER ONE HUNDRED COMMENTS IN ONE DAY, ALL IN CONSPIRACY. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve messaged the mods. Yes, I&#39;ve reported comments. Yes, other users are making the same allegations against these users. </p>

<p>I&#39;m am not one to knee-jerk call someone a shill, because they disagree with my opinion. But conversations here are being derailed. I don&#39;t know if this is a passion project, since <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> has stopped directly linking to other subs. I don&#39;t understand the motivation to spend one&#39;s time this way, but I am not implying a shill. This feels <em>personal</em>. </p>

HyperLogLog counters would be a great thing...the only thing that would NOT be all too great about them that I can see is losing complete anonymity...and, of course, not being able to track your history re: dvs and uvs. But I don&#39;t think that you can anyhow...right?</p>

<p>Good luck getting Reddit to implement this though. As soon as its not a wasteland I&#39;m moving to voat.com.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I love conspiracy theories (I agree with some of them, while disagree with many other), but I think Reddit is generally a game, just like many other parts of the culture. We should not take it TOO seriously. We should just go on with it, enjoy it, and try to take the best out of it.  :-)</p>

<p><strong>There are many verified conspiracy theories</strong>, that have been confessed / declassified / otherwise proved after some time: </p>

<p>However before verification they will be always attacked. Let&#39;s say that you live in Germany, Poland or England around 1935. You see many signs that Hitler and the Nazis want another huge war. Or alternatively before the whistleblow of Edward Snowden (so before 2013) you keep telling people that the world governments monitor everything that we do. Or that Santa Claus does not exists (this is a conspiracy theory among children, but I know he is real!). Or maybe that you think that religions are fake: &quot;Jesus / Mohammed / Buddha / Ganesha is the only true way&quot;; saying otherwise in the Middle-Ages meant execution; actually it still means that in many places in Africa and in the Middle-East. Or that CIA created the Taliban by supporting and training the Mujahideen, and by this Osama bin Laden too. Or that there can be other intelligent civilizations (<a href="http://imgur.com/IJ9e48b">&quot;ALIENS&quot;</a>) in the huge universe with billions and billions of galaxies, stars and planets.</p>

<p><strong>However people keep telling you that you are crazy.</strong> Why would that happen / why would it be true? LOL, it does not make sense! It is illegal / impossible / useless / nonsense. Maybe you have some mental issues... And then BOOM!!! It happens, now everyone knows about the thing, it is not a theory anymore. Now the funny thing is, that now most people will change their state of mind. It was obvious. Yeah, they expected it too. They KNEW it for ages, just did not want to talk about it...</p>

<p>This is how people are. <strong>We live in a chaotic world, with chaotic events. Do not take it TOO seriously. Relax.</strong> Have a good laugh about it. Take it easy man. Of course, it is worth to think about it, and try to find the connections, to connect the dots, but do not care too much about all the people who say that there are no dots.</p>

<p>You had me until here my man. Good post.</p>

<p>Some of us simply cannot laugh about it anymore. I cannot speak definitively for others, but I&#39;ll contribute a little bit here and why I feel broken at this point.</p>

<p>I started really contributing to this sub when I <em>went to get some sources</em> when all the news was abuzz about the ISIS beheading videos this summer. The news said they showed beheadings, but when you see the source material, they <em>do not</em>. </p>

<p>What it did was not gentle lift the veil of propaganda and how easy it is to manipulate us (well, not me any more, suckers!) into doing what TBTB want. I stated numerous times (check through my posts). Sure, sometimes I succumbed to the propaganda/paranoia a bit, but nobody is truly immune. I said that they were going to use this propaganda campaign as a long con to eventually justify another war in the Middle East, and another generation of America&#39;s youth are going to volunteer to go to war <em>again</em> (thankfully, I missed the last round about).</p>

<p>I see it, you see it, and it fucking sucks. Every day I wake up, hear some more bullshit on the news, and I can&#39;t laugh about it any more. I don&#39;t remember the last time I laughed genuinely, and haven&#39;t found anything particularly joyful in over 8 months, and that shit takes a toll, man. It&#39;s affecting me personally, professionally, and in all of my personal relationships in an extremely negative way.</p>

<p>And the worst part? Besides the core users here who appreciate the sub, my contributions, and everyone else&#39;s, nobody understands or knows what&#39;s bugging me. Part if it is epic fail on my part for not being able to combat the propaganda machine, and part of the blame lies on the machine itself.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m done laughing. I&#39;m no longer satisfied with <em>anything</em>, and am unsure how I can affect and change things for the better. And that sentiment cycles back around again and I can&#39;t figure out the next step.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll hang around and contribute and point out bullshit when I see it, but the effort involved is no longer worth what I hope to accomplish (which seems utterly fucking impossible, at this point), but my heart&#39;s not in <em>anything</em> anymore, and I really don&#39;t know where to go from here.</p>

<p>My apologies for the rant. Just having a really tough week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chin up, bro. Darkness only exists as illlumination is obstructed. Thus, darkness can only exist as a dependent upon light. What i mean by this is that there sre good things veiled in evil. </p>

<p>Im going to share something with you thst i havent shared much at all. I come from a strong german bloodline. (Not in the dynastic sense, but i am a son of a german immigrant). My german grandfsther was an officer in the german navy (he also had a NATO Top Secret Clearance, if thst matters). My german great grandfsthers also served as officers in the germany military. And yes, during ww2 they were nazis. </p>

<p>One of which i actually met when i was younger. One of the things he said to me, though it didnt make sense at the time, reverberates through me today. He told me, &quot;All wars are fought by good Men.&quot; </p>

<p>I didnt understand until recently (a few yrs ago). Soldiers are pawns. Even the &quot;bad guys&quot;. They all fight for whst they believe is Good. The evil is veiled by the soldiers who masquerade the intentions of the damned, all the while believing they are sacrificing for Good. It is the orchestraters, safe behind their desks, who perpetuate evil with merely pen strokes. </p>

<p>Propaganda is but one of their tools to get their followers believing they are doing good. As pungent as it gets, we must not wince and close our eyes or cover our faces. Smokescreens dissapate, and when all comes to a rest, light is shed and uncovers that which is secret.</p>

<p>Its a daunting task, to see the world around us dooped and being unable to help. Its a burden thst must be worn, as it has been worn before us. But it is always more important to find joy in seemingly dismal times. There is always something. Even Captain Kirk says there must be a way. </p>

<p>Its okay to feel down, to feel crushed. How else can we recognize when we are up? To be your own master is freedom, and is your only duty to this universe. But alas, we are human. Sympathy kills, but empathy motivates. </p>

<p>One of the things i contemplated about during my break from reddit was whats worse than the possibility thst the worst of these theories are true? I came up with an answer. The only thing worse is if they were all false. That means humanity itself is a fucked up paradigm of survival at the expense of another. In this game, we all lose. </p>

<p>Nothing is going to be solved tomorrow. And we cannot possibly defend the next attack. TPTB have had generations worth of a head start <em>(reading through those papers confirms this, imo)</em>; to think one individual can muster enough effort to confront that proposition is delusional at best, and a sacrifice born of ignorance at worse. </p>

<p>Chin up, bro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks STK. We&#39;ve had one of my favorite correspondences on this site that I actually cherish, as I feel I&#39;ve tried to point you in a direction or two and you&#39;ve constantly picked me up when I needed it most.</p>

<p>I appreciate all the nice comments and PMs from that rant above, and feel that there is no real way to repay you all besides putting my head down and him up (still trying to figure out how I can do that simultaneously, but that&#39;s another story), and hunkering on.</p>

<p>We all have our demons. And mine decided to fight fiercely this week. Just something I gotta deal with.</p>

<p>But the support from the users here is impossible to thank. I thought this morning about making a self-post saying I need to take a break from everything, but I feel that I can&#39;t unplug anymore. I&#39;ve forgotten how. I cannot.</p>

<p>And I somehow have to figure out how to reconcile my feelings and views I share with you all with my actual self in my social circles.</p>

<p>And maybe this is a good place to ask how other people here deal with the divide between your reddit identity and your real identity. I know we&#39;re all <em>conspiracy theorists</em> here, and most of us take a few steps to conceal our true identities due to privacy concerns/somewhat-founded paranoia.</p>

<p>How do you guys do it? I think this is on of hr biggest sources of inner conflict and what&#39;s really affecting me, and maybe it deserves a self-post if it&#39;s on.</p>

<p>Either way - thank you - STK, for being my sounding board and hand to pick me up, whether you realize it or not.</p>

<p>I think this would make a good thread, possibly its own self.post.</p>

<p>Personally, i compartmentalize. It helps me entertain ideas while withholding my own beliefs on the subject matter. It also allows me to get back into my real life without bringing all the negativity with me. But ill admit, im not perfect at it, amd so sometimes ill pick up on something in my real life and think, &quot;well shit.&quot; Then ill go into reddit mode and come on here for awhile if i cant void myself of those thoughts. </p>

<p>I also schedule reddit time into my week. Like during lunch at work, or right before bed, or when i have downtime and dont need my mental facilities for anything imminently important. That way when i get a thought, ill be like, ill save it for reddit time and if i forget, then it mustnt have been too important. </p>

<p>And i forget ALOT, btw.</p>

<p>Theres more probably, but ill save it for the moment in the case a self.post is created for this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you man. Just remember this: on the way to the truth there are three stages. The first is ridicule...but the last is people finally realizing, and accepting, that what you&#39;ve been saying was the truth all along.</p>

<p>Reddit can really get to you. This sub is basically every goddamned thing that is wrong with the world--condensed. When I start to feel as you&#39;re describing I just drive the ten minutes to the airport and fly. Even 15 minutes in the air clears my head for the entire week.</p>

<p>Above all, remember that, without others, you are powerless to stop anything from happening. Reddit may be great to get the word out, but it&#39;s heavily censored and the people who are in this sub &quot;for real&quot; and not to debunk/troll are already well versed on what various governments are capable of. Don&#39;t let it get to you so much. Above all--STOP WATCHING TELEVISION unless it&#39;s something good like The Wire. All it&#39;s used for (ESPECIALLY the &quot;news&quot;) is propaganda that is completely and utterly false. Remember that such a thing is now 100% legal due to the signing of NDAA.</p>

<p>Accept that the country in which you live is dying thanks to parasites from other nations that have, quite literally, sucked this nation dry. Make plans to leave if you can. I will happily renounce my citizenship from this shithole as soon as I am financially able and will seek asylum somewhere overseas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree with you about that it is irritating that many people do not care at all about the world around them. An example for the &quot;stupid troll&quot; character (please do NOT downvote it to hell to prevent vote-brigading), it is the one above my post linked below from <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a>. There was a guy who actually said <em>&quot;why don&#39;t Ukranians just go home, they would be safe then&quot;</em>, while on one of the videos in the commented post a mortar shell kills a poor guy at home in his own balcony, and his family keeps crying around him... :-(   </p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/2u0sos/any_videos_of_the_ukraine_war/co4xm41?context=3">http://np.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/2u0sos/any_videos_of_the_ukraine_war/co4xm41?context=3</a></p>

<p>You know, <strong>authentic sources are always interesting</strong>. But there will always be people online who will call others stupid / crazy / worthless. Do not care about them, just downvote and move on, if their opinion does not add anything meaningful. Just like in online games (DOTA / LOL / Team Fortress 2 / Call Of Duty), there will be always some 13 years old schoolboy who knows that you are a NOOB and he also f*cked your mother last night... Even if you post the most interesting link / photo / artwork / article, some people will still say that it is &quot;rubbish&quot;. Stupid / childish people will always exist, who just go online to troll others. But there are luckily normal people too.</p>

I&#39;m amazed at the critical thinking shown by those who previously showed little--10 years ago, you were considered informed if you watched the news. Today, one is informed if they can adequately dissect and critique it. It&#39;s amazing that we have the sharing platforms to disseminate such things, too--filmmakers can criticize the fake nature of ISIS videos, for instance. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much good out there. I don&#39;t like using holier-than-thou &quot;awakening&quot; rhetoric, but people are genuinely awaking to the complete and utter manipulation happening by our govt, corporations, and even within social media. It&#39;s great. I can commiserate with so many more people than I could a decade ago, back when I was seen as overtly paranoid. </p>

<p>Hey Jim i&#39;d like to offer up some advice. I learned this while reading <a href="https://www.dmt-nexus.me/doc/The%20Celestine%20Phrophecy%20.pdf">The Celestine Prophecy</a>. Imagine your life was an old VCR tape. Rewind it and press play from the beginning. Try to remember every detail. Imagine in your minds eye whatever you can. Just go with whatever seems to come naturally in your mind. Fell free to pause, rewind ect, there are no rules. Try your best and something really cool will happen. It&#39;s the beginning phase of understanding you really are.  </p>

<p>This endeavor helped me understand what I needed to do to be happy again. Not that I&#39;m perfect, but I can honestly say I feel pretty good. Maybe this could help you too. Food for thought. Hate to see you down in the dumps. Cheers.</p>

<p>This is so true. People say conspiracy theories can never be falsified but try talking to someone about a confirmed theory. They either say it was not truly a conspiracy, or it was always known, or the details aren&#39;t quite right so the theorists were wrong, or that it was never a theory before it was exposed so it doesn&#39;t prove conspiracy theories can be true... there are a million and one ways for them to stick their head deeper into the beach.

    <div class="md"><p>For all the negatives thst these types bring to this sub (and i agree, there is a lot of negstives), there are some positives. </p>

<p>If we were never confronted by &quot;debunkers,&quot; how would we know whether our arguments are airtight? How do we find the holes? How do we upgrade our understanding of the larger picture?</p>

<p>Generally, i welcome debunkers. However, their conduct must be cordial and their mindset open. (It is these attributes that are lacking in the users i think you are mentioning).</p>

<p>So we can actuslly grow as a community by not shunning, in general, debunkers merely for the principles they stand for. </p>

<p>But like i said, there are some who remain closed off to new information. There are those who pretend that if a theory were to be true, enough people would know about it and it would be common knowledgd, or there would be concrete evidence. Well, i am one of the belief that perceives TPTB to be masters of plausible deniability. So intricate are they, that they murder or steal right in the open. And of course, everybody has a price, but thst price isnt always money. </p>

<p>These users are seperate from what i consider debunkers. These are dedicated souls who devote a lot of their free time to fuck around with people, and to generally cause disarray. To try and figure out why they do this is a waste of time, imo. Its best to remember them, and save our energy towards cordial discourse with the contributional members of this sub. </p>

<p>I know that ignoring them wont make them go away, nor is that exactly whst im getting at. We can identify these users, on an individual basis, just by trying to conduct reasonabke conversations. Asking one questions as to why they believe what they do typicslly disarms them enough to allow information to be passed along more freely and openly. And, as always, sometimes the end of a conversation is a &quot;agree to disagree&quot; scenario, and this shoukdnt be avoided. </p>

<p>I feel like im rambling, so in short, there is good to come of these folks. And when all else fails, ask why they think we are wrong, look into their claims, and maybe lesrn something. Trolls wont go this far, so they grt weeded out, and all thsts left is those passionate debunkers, and if they dont have solid arguments, they arent worth the investment of conversation.</p>

<p>I say we just use a designation... such as &quot;DNE&quot; or Do Not Engage for those who are continuous problems.  It would be up to the individual to decide if they want to downvote or simply ignore, but I think the first step is making some sort of informal &quot;gentlemen&#39;s&quot; agreement that those who behave like this will simply be ignored.</p>

<p>So, for instance, say someone we all know and love shows up to post the usual BS.  Just reply &quot;DNE to me.  Sorry.&quot; and move on.  Others will do the same and we are well within the rules of the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an idea:</p>

<p>Ive noticed a few users comment here about their experiences with these DNE types. Maybe we can  create a post explaining the difference logical fallacies that are often used in arguments. Not only will that help us avoid logical fallacies within our own arguments, but it would also arm us with a beneficial knowledge of how those who wish to derail and disengage constructive contributions operate, thus, enabling us to better identify them...</p>

<p>Again... Just a thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #1 - &#39;FORUM SLIDING&#39;</p>

<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#39;forum sliding.&#39; In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to &#39;age.&#39; Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a &#39;forum slide.&#39; The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a &#39;forum slide&#39; and &#39;flush&#39; the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then &#39;replying&#39; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#39;slides&#39; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>

<p>What is hard to grasp, even for many here, is the scale of the information war. It is massive. Deception is the primary tool, with a healthy dash of fear mongering. But we must remind ourselves that we mostly deal with the foot soldiers, and most of them are deeply deceived, just like we all once were.</p>

<p>We are at war, and the primary battleground is the mind. And the primary weapons are the media; Video, print, radio and the amalgamation of all three.. the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on this one man.  I don&#39;t comment on Reddit much in general but have been trying to contribute more here. A noticable amount of the shit I post gets these kind of attacks.  Usually involves focusing on half a sentence of my post, completely changing the idea behind it, and discrediting or debunking that.  And there&#39;s no way to reply because their response is so far off point I can&#39;t answer in a way relevant to my original idea.  That&#39;s just my personal experience, but I see the same tactic, and different ones, just about every time I read other comments.  It&#39;d be fine if it was skeptical view points that stayed on point and added quality, but it mostly reads like intentional personal attacks on posters and their ideas without offering up any actual content.</p>

<p>I think this would make a good thread, possibly its own self.post.</p>

<p>Personally, i compartmentalize. It helps me entertain ideas while withholding my own beliefs on the subject matter. It also allows me to get back into my real life without bringing all the negativity with me. But ill admit, im not perfect at it, amd so sometimes ill pick up on something in my real life and think, &quot;well shit.&quot; Then ill go into reddit mode and come on here for awhile if i cant void myself of those thoughts. </p>

<p>I also schedule reddit time into my week. Like during lunch at work, or right before bed, or when i have downtime and dont need my mental facilities for anything imminently important. That way when i get a thought, ill be like, ill save it for reddit time and if i forget, then it mustnt have been too important. </p>

<p>And i forget ALOT, btw.</p>

<p>Theres more probably, but ill save it for the moment in the case a self.post is created for this...</p>

<p>Rule 11: Replying to a comment with DNE is classified as brigading and will be subject to a ban</p>
