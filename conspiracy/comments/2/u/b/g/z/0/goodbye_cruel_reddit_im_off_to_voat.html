<p>...and from the government,  mostly through MacDill AFB in Florida.</p>

<p>I have direct contact numbers for the government  manipulators  but that would actually help our cause, so of course it would be against the rules to divulge them and I would be banned.</p>

<p>MacDill AFB is close enough for here and now.</p>

<p>Is anyone forgetting that censorship is just a form of damage control? </p>

<p>Second, are you advocating censorship?  I&#39;ve been on the internet since dial up on 300bps. Free speech is easy on the internet.  CENSORSHIP on the internet? Are you fkin kidding me?  This is new BS.  The proof is I&#39;m gonna switch forums and VOILA! no more censorship because a billionaire doesent own the fkin servers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not &#39;giving up&#39;, which is what would be a victory to them. I&#39;m in fact moving to a different web site: a competitor, where they will have no ability to censor forums I wish to participate in.     I&#39;m saying this is tacitly my victory, and secondly: voat.co &#39;s victory. </p>

<p>I have bought and received reddit gold. So yes, I&#39;m a customer. As well as ad-clicked and purchased from advertisers.  I will likely do the same at voat.co now. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I&#39;ll publicly advocate and SOME people will switch. I&#39;m ultimately having an effect on their revenue. </p>

<p>There was plenty of free speech here on reddit a couple years ago. It&#39;s decline and influx of shills has steadily increased. The corporate takeover was simply the final straw, or should have been.  Censorship was rare, and frequently justified (doxxing, etc).. But SLC is NOT DOXXING.  It&#39;s all very public information and the only reason anyone cares is it&#39;s VERY SHADY. There is something fucky going on. </p>

<p>Censorship is damage control. Mods just sweeping very hot topics under the rug defeats everything this forum is about. </p>

<p>[Thanks for the vote of confidence in my intelligence m0q, always nice to end a conversation questioning someones mental capacity. Really, it&#39;s a very telling comment on the kind of smeghead you are].</p>

<p>Until I can&#39;t open my own server with a forum PHP, THERE IS COMPETITION to reddit. </p>

<p>You make it sound like they can cut out all our tongues. The internet is still free. I can share information pretty damned effectively and confidently if I want.  Just not at sites like reddit, where they are under the yoke OBVIOUSLY. </p>

<p>The solution is simple. User funded forums. Voat.co   -perfect.</p>
