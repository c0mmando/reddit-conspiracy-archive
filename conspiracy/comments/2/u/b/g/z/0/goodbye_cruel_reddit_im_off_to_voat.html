       Enough censorship and subversion of facts and stories. Why we ever tolerated even one article being buried was the problem we could never correct.

       These people who run reddit are a big part of the problem. The first thing you can do to stop supporting them is STOP SUPPORTING THEM.  Leave. Find independent forums, they are there. Voat.co for example.

liked it well as an alternative and it didn't take 10 seconds before it was censored...

       When I first read of Whoaverse I jumped in and created the subs I mod to prevent them from being created and controlled by our adversaries. I suspect the same thing happened with /v/conspiracy.

       There was quite a bit of interest here when Whoaverse first started up. Still, the number of subscribers here has been increasing at a fairly constant rate. We average about 325 new subscribers every day... and over 3 million pageviews per month.

       if you think you are offended by something, more than likely you have a weak argument without merit.

       They want to get rid of me?  Normally shareholders have issues with management driving off customers.. Even though it's a private corp, I still don't see any motive though to get rid of users.    Explain your interesting POV?

      <p>
       Is anyone forgetting that censorship is just a form of damage control?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, are you advocating censorship?  I've been on the internet since dial up on 300bps. Free speech is easy on the internet.  CENSORSHIP on the internet? Are you fkin kidding me?  This is new BS.  The proof is I'm gonna switch forums and VOILA! no more censorship because a billionaire doesent own the fkin servers.

       In what position does reddit think they are that they can simply start selecting at free will what is up for discussion and what not?

       The internet is a free market and consumers will in the long term move towards more free alternatives if no huge changes happen in the management of this platform.

       I'm not 'giving up', which is what would be a victory to them. I'm in fact moving to a different web site: a competitor, where they will have no ability to censor forums I wish to participate in.     I'm saying this is tacitly my victory, and secondly: voat.co 's victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have bought and received reddit gold. So yes, I'm a customer. As well as ad-clicked and purchased from advertisers.  I will likely do the same at voat.co now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I'll publicly advocate and SOME people will switch. I'm ultimately having an effect on their revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was plenty of free speech here on reddit a couple years ago. It's decline and influx of shills has steadily increased. The corporate takeover was simply the final straw, or should have been.  Censorship was rare, and frequently justified (doxxing, etc).. But SLC is NOT DOXXING.  It's all very public information and the only reason anyone cares is it's VERY SHADY. There is something fucky going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Censorship is damage control. Mods just sweeping very hot topics under the rug defeats everything this forum is about.

       [Thanks for the vote of confidence in my intelligence m0q, always nice to end a conversation questioning someones mental capacity. Really, it's a very telling comment on the kind of smeghead you are].

       If your mission is to spread truth then you do that where ever you find an open ear. You use them. You don't need to support them, but you can perform Drive-By shootings and run in to piss in their Cheerios. I'm not saying don't go to voat, by all means, spread the good news as far and wide as possible.

       happy to tell you the truth. hope you don't get fucked when the other competitor website will censorship your speech since it obviously you learn nothing from this current experience.

       Pffft. Do you listen to yourself?

       Until I can't open my own server with a forum PHP, THERE IS COMPETITION to reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make it sound like they can cut out all our tongues. The internet is still free. I can share information pretty damned effectively and confidently if I want.  Just not at sites like reddit, where they are under the yoke OBVIOUSLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is simple. User funded forums. Voat.co   -perfect.
