I have even seen people mock this sub in other places because of the anti-vaccine posts. I am not vaccinated and neither are my siblings. We abstained from vaccinations for our children as well.

I almost wasn&#39;t allowed to attend public school, and I barely got into college because of it.  My question is this: are any of you unvaccinated?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, i got the usual set of shots as a kid growing up, you know, tetanus, hepatitus, probably even the mmr. Honestly, i would probably have my kids vaccinated as much as i have been, but nothing more.</p>

<p>For instance, the flu shot. I think its ridiculous, tbh. Ive never had the flu in my life, and im not about to get the flu shot either. My wife got the flu shot once, and she got the flu shortly afterwards. Then she got the flu again the next year, withiut grtting the flu shot.</p>

<p>There is tons of anecdotal accounts like this, but personally, i follow the msntra &quot;if it aint broke dont fix it.&quot; I have never had the flu, not even once. So i wont get the flu shot, i wont make my kids (when i havr them) get the flu shot either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I and my siblings were vaccinated.  I do not vaccinate my children.  My rationale for this decision is based on my study of the history of the procedure and its evolution from the days of heroic medicine.  </p>

<p>Simply put it was rapidly forced upon populations the world over with 100% of scientific backing 300 years ago.   The backing of institutionalized medicine for the procedure has been unwavering ever since - in spite of objections that it is ineffective and dangerous (objections which have been noted since it&#39;s initial invention).</p>

<p>Nonetheless men of power have made it a matter of policy to vaccinate/inoculate for centuries.</p>

<p>The son of the very first president of Harvard brought inoculation to the colonies.  Supported by Isaac Newton&#39;s secretary and religious leaders in the region.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin wrote pamplets on how to self infect oneself with smallpox (to prevent smallpox).</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson sent vaccines with Lewis and Clark in order to train the natives to accept the rite.  </p>

<p>During Napoleon&#39;s empire conquered peoples would be violently (at gunpoint) forced to vaccinate.  </p>

<p>... and these are but a few anecdotes from the first century of it&#39;s European/American utilization.  Again what struck me during my research was the fact that thought leaders (whether religious or politcal) have been preaching the same mantra for centuries - even throughout the East. </p>

<p>And this was during the day when you might lose your medical license for refusing to slice veins and arteries open in the name of health.... </p>

<p>Funny to note that one of the key proponents of the prototype vaccination - Baron Dimsdale - recommended deliberate smallpox infection for all newborns and for adults every few years.  For emphasis - infecting people with smallpox every few years was how they imagined the world would eventually be rid of smallpox.  In other words it was understood even then that so called &quot;immunity&quot; didn&#39;t last.  </p>

<p>It is the unwavering support of thought leaders of every era including our own... even retrospectively analyzing past systems of vaccination which were obviously deadly... which sparked my strong doubt of the process.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sibs and I were all vaccinated as children (mumps, rubella, small pox, etc).  Other than an updated tetanus shot following an injury, I haven&#39;t had any other vaccines.  I don&#39;t get an annual flu shot, because I don&#39;t think I need it.  The one year I did get a flu shot (required at work), I got the flu so bad I could barely move.  Since then, no flu shot and no flu.  </p>

<p>I would probably vaccinate my children, but I don&#39;t believe people should be forced to do so or pilloried for choosing not to.  It&#39;s a personal child care and health care choice and the government needs to stay out of it.  </p>

<p>I only know one family that was unvaccinated because they were Christian Scientists (didn&#39;t take <em>any</em> medicine). They were rarely sick but I&#39;m sure they also never came into contact with Ebola. Who knows. Never tell anyone you and your kids are unvaccinated, some crazy person will call CPS on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a comment like this comes from ignorance of those diseases for which we have vaccines. And that isn&#39;t meant to be rude. I think it&#39;s an amazing time we live in where we are ignorant of these diseases. I have never known anyone to get polio, small pox, or measles etc, and presumable neither have you. But these are actually horrible diseases that can be very deadly or lead to long lasting health effects.</p>

<p>The risk of getting those diseases now many be small but that&#39;s only because of the current levels of immunization of the population. If you decide you or your children don&#39;t need a vaccine because everyone else will get one you might be fine. But if more people start thinking like that (and the statistics indicate that this is precisely the thinking of younger generations today), you and your children will be at a very real and fairly large risk of getting one of these diseases.
And supposed risks that vaccines many present are absolutely dwarfed by the risk of getting a pretty terrible disease or viral infection.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s because we live in a time where we can and have forgotten how terrible those diseases are that we have the luxury to think it&#39;s sensible to &#39;take our changes in the diseases&#39;.</p>
