<p>Funny that he&#39;s blaming arguing about vaccines when I bet you guys did it as he was spamming the sub prattling on about his butt and feminism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did not swing your way in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and it rarely does for ANY moderator of ANY subreddit.<br/>
So there is no need to attack <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> as a whole because it is just doing what it has always done with sensationalist meta posts attacking mods.  Remember, <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>&#39;s main purpose is to have a bot that records removals.  The bot has never had any problems apart from occasional downtime.  Therefore, I think you are doing a good transparency tool a big disservice by making such broad attacks against <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>&#39;s reputation.  it has been disheartening to see a number of attacks on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> emerge from here.  </p>

<p>On the topic of the linked thread, no one seems to mention that the OP there ( <a href="/u/gameshowissues">/u/gameshowissues</a> ) was an account that was already banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by another mod. <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2rg5tx/user_banned_for_exposing_the_overlap_of_our_mods/cnfsq75">Yet I believe that you were one of the mods who sought to reinstate that blatantly obvious troll .</a>  The troll repaid you by stirring up trouble and trolling the mod team again !  So unfortunately, I thought you brought it on yourself by inviting that guy back.  The troll has been successful in stirring up shit which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Personally, I could see what was happening in that thread but really couldn&#39;t be bothered with it.   <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2rfx8a/i_got_banned_from_rconspiracy_for_this_our_mods/cnfhkmj">Last time I tried to explain how u/gameshowissues account was a troll account trying to put pressure on /r/conspiracy,  I was attacked by an /r/conspiracy mod trying to discredit me </a>   n.b. not conspiratard users or any of that ilk.   I think there is all sorts of of faction-driven bullshit that goes down on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> that derails reasonable discussion plus a strong anti-mod circlejerk.  It is disingenuous to pretend it is is a single group.  It is part of the deal for having no rules and such a diverse userbase.  The key is to rise above nonsense .  </p>

<p>So I am sorry you feel hard done by.  An important thing about <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> is that people who are interested in making up their own mind can find the facts they need amongst the noise.  This is because <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> is a subreddit free from any form of censorship.   So while groups may try to manipulate or dominate it at certain times, no one can be silenced unless it is through their own choice.  So please don&#39;t give up on it.</p>

<p>In retrospect I worded the title harshly.</p>

<p>I do really appreciate what <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> has done for reddit as a whole.</p>

<p>However, there is <em>already</em> another witch hunt post in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> directed at me. The 2nd in 24 hours.</p>

<p>It too is a lie...I didn&#39;t ban that user either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just unfortunate that <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> has become a soapbox for these loons.</p>

The mod team has a hard job that I personally think you all do with an great amount of poise. Keep it up and remember that this community steps on a lot of toes, toes with money and power. It&#39;s not surprising at all that there is a vast amount of uniformed, yet ravenous opposition. Keep it up I for one appreciate this place!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if i read this right, and Lord knows i&#39;m one to misread something, then the ppl that run conspirtard are the same ppl that run this place? And all of it would sell out to stormfront (whose vids i enjoy, lil angry at times, though i get why, but they have a reddit don&#39;t they?)? </p>

<p>Is the upper management really just ready to drop this place because of the heat? Idk, wild suggestions in that link. If they&#39;re true, I&#39;m truely disappointed in a few ppl here.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>No one is protecting everyone on Earth. No one died on the cross for your &quot;sins&quot;. There is no place to get &quot;called up&quot; to, and no one to do the calling.</p>

<p>Please stop spreading ignorance in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do appreciate this.</p>

<p>In retrospect I worded the title harshly.</p>

<p>I do really appreciate what <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> has done for reddit as a whole.</p>

<p>However, there is <em>already</em> another witch hunt post in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> directed at me. The 2nd in 24 hours.</p>

<p>It too is a lie...I didn&#39;t ban that user either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just unfortunate that <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> has become a soapbox for these loons.</p>
