<blockquote>
<p>Health Officials in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31145604">UK have admitted</a> that the flu strain that is sweeping the planet this year, H3N2, is barely affected by the vaccination that is meant to prevent it. </p>

<p>Only 3 out of every 100 vaccinated people are prevented from getting full-blown influenza, a situation that has led to a large rise in the elderly winter death rate in the UK.</p>

<p>This shows the uselessness of the World Health Organization system of deciding a year ahead which flu strains will be circulating the following winter. One of those strains, the one that happens to be causing most illness this year, has mutated so significantly that the vaccine is ineffective against it.</p>

<p>The strain, H3N2, causes major respiratory issues in the elderly and those with medical problems. It also happens to be the strain that is dominant in Canada and the USA this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p1204-flu-season.html">The CDC is recommending</a> prompt treatment with anti-viral drugs for anyone at risk of complications from the flu…regardless if they have been vaccinated or not.</p>

<p>Their website states that the virus has mutated and that the vaccine is therefore far less effective than it should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;This means <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm">the vaccine’s ability to protect</a> against those viruses may be reduced, although vaccinated people may have a milder illness if they do become infected.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While on the subject of vaccinations, California is attempting to make opting out of having children vaccinated for personal or religious reasons illegal.</p>

<p><a href="http://rt.com/usa/229715-california-vaccination-bill-mandatory/">From RT:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;New legislation proposed in the California Senate would outlaw waivers that allow parents to exempt their children from receiving basic vaccinations for religious or personal reasons.</p>

<p>&quot;The bill is a response to the latest measles outbreak in the state.The bill, announced Wednesday, would require all children to receive vaccinations prior to attending public school in the state. The proposal allows for exemptions only in cases where a pre-existing medical condition would prevent a vaccination. Schools, meanwhile, would have to make their vaccination rates public.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make their vaccination rates public…lets hope they make public the number of children sickened, disabled or killed by vaccines as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to point out that <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is a mod on this sub and his bottom three links going out to Amazon are referral links.

Normally I wouldn&#39;t care, but since he/she is a mod, I think that&#39;s something to consider.</p>

<p>Edit: So first we have this: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2unbia/remember_the_good_old_days_before_polio_was/coa4pws">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2unbia/remember_the_good_old_days_before_polio_was/coa4pws</a> and now <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is pushing amazon referral links to earn some money while using an anti-vaccination agenda? <strong>Wasn&#39;t there a recent post that linked to a website where people could get paid for being pro-vaccines and now <a href="/u/uaxolotl_peyotl">/u/uaxolotl_peyotl</a> is doing the same exact thing just in reverse?</strong> Tisk Tisk... I think people should agree with me that we should expect more out of our mods. This is just sad really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This almost sounds like a...<em>conspiracy theory</em></p>

<p>Joking aside, this is a serious accusation and it deserves a serious response. </p>

<p>tbh, I&#39;m surprised no one has defended me with the obvious explanation yet.</p>

<h2>Those links were all included in the original article.</h2>

<p>This <em>entire post</em> was copied from the source, which I link at the top. Did anyone bother to check?</p>

<p>So in your conspiracy theory, someone is paying both a mod of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a silly website called &quot;The Daily Sheeple?&quot;</p>

<p>The author of the first two books that were linked, Robert Mendelsohn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Mendelsohn">certainly isn&#39;t getting the money.</a></p>

<p>I hate to invoke Occam&#39;s razor, but don&#39;t you think it&#39;s just a tad more likely that I copied everything from the source I&#39;ve provided?</p>

<p>See if this alleviates any of your suspicions:</p>

<p>When reddit changed the voting algorithm to conceal <em>actual</em> votes, I knew the system would be even more rigged than before, and I pledged to never post for link karma again.</p>

<p>I hit 333,333 link karma that day so I took that as a good a sign as any.</p>

<p>Since then, I <em>only</em> submit self-posts (no link karma). </p>

<p>However, I still want to share exciting articles and information that I find. </p>

<p>One of the unfortunate things about many of these &quot;alternative&quot; websites is that they&#39;re so full of ads--and hideous ads at that--that it can be an immediate turnoff to those who might be stumbling on this type of material for the first time.</p>

<p>You know what I&#39;m talking about: survivalist ads, &quot;healing crystal&quot; ads, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not knocking the sites...I recognize that they have to keep running somehow.</p>

<p>So instead of providing <em>just</em> the link in the text box of the self-post, I&#39;ve started linking to the source and then copying the <em>entire</em> article into the sub. </p>

<p>Sometimes it can be very difficult to navigate these sites, so I&#39;ve been told many times that it makes it <em>much</em> easy when all the material is right here in the sub. I&#39;ve noticed that the more material in my posts, the more vibrant discussion that results.</p>

<p>If <em>anything</em>, I&#39;m <em>taking away</em> revenue from these sites by keeping the majority of the traffic here on reddit.</p>

<p>The irony here is that if I <em>only</em> linked to, say, The Daily Sheeple on a frequent basis, then I might be accused of being paid by the owners of the site to do so. </p>

<p>The timing of your &quot;accusation&quot; is certainly interesting as well. </p>

<p><em>I have submitted hundreds</em> of these self posts over the last few months. </p>

<p>I have consistently and faithfully copied every link from these articles, and that includes links to Amazon and a myriad other sites. </p>

<p>I <em>always</em> provide the source and make the formatting absolutely clear that this is not my original material. </p>

<p>Just the other day, when I announced the upcoming AMA with Judyth Vary Baker, I linked to <em>both</em> of her books on Amazon.</p>

<p>Where was the &quot;outcry&quot; then?</p>

<p>I have to say, I do find it rather curious that your comment comes <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2uwk47/i_was_banned_from_rconspiracy_for_disagreeing/">one day after a ridiculous witch hunt</a> against me in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2v0mdn/i_was_banned_from_rconspiracy_because_of_this/">And hey look, here&#39;s another one</a> from just a few hours ago.</p>

<p><em>I didn&#39;t ban either of these users.</em></p>

<p>I can have the other mods vouch for me. </p>

<p>They are lying.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really beginning to think that some of the vaccine posts, and maybe even the upcoming Baker AMA, are striking a nerve.</p>

<p>Naw, I&#39;m just a crazy conspiracy theorist!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your entire post and while it may be great that you are copy/pasting directly from other articles, I do not like the fact that Amazon referral links (that take a cut of the profits) are posted. It&#39;s possible that you can switch the links to your referral code (not saying either way if you did that or not). Do you see the dilemma this can cause?</p>

<p>Regarding the above, I went to that post and stated very clearly that I would like to see proof that you banned that user. I still haven&#39;t received a reply so I will reserve my judgement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where was the &quot;outcry&quot; then?</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself, but I consider myself to browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regularly. I can&#39;t catch everything nor am I always looking to catch something. I can see why you might be suspicious of my timing, but please understand that your post caught my eye and that&#39;s when I made my comment which other people happened to agree with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, we can talk about that too, if you want. I love discussing controversial issues. However, I don&#39;t love the fact that mods make submissions to outside sources (it has the potential to become abused as you mentioned earlier). In other subs, mods usually act behind the scenes and are not active posters. </p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve made my point. If you are curious about anything, please let me know.</p>

<p>That&#39;s common sense 101 Mr. Tree Monger.</p>

<p>Because I didn&#39;t ban them.</p>

<p>Nor did I ban the second user starting a witch hunt in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> atm.</p>

<p>You seem like a smart person, doesn&#39;t it strike you as <em>slightly</em> suspicious that neither of them provided a screenshot?</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s the issue I have with you. I think that mods should be voted in a democratic fashion. That&#39;s just me though. While it&#39;s great that you were an active poster before you became a mod, I think it&#39;s weird that you are an active poster + mod. I like to steer clear from conflicts of interest, but if the rest of the community here is okay with that then that outweighs my opinion. </p>

<p>Edit: And please do me a favor, if I&#39;m such a &#39;smart guy&#39; then please don&#39;t tell other redditors that what I posted was &#39;manufactured&#39;. Thanks.</p>

<p>Really? How is my post paranoid in any way, shape, or form? <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is a mod on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, he/she is pushing an anti-vaxx agenda while making money from it via amazon referral links, I called him/her out on it and now the post has coincidentally been removed. Again, how is that paranoid? You can name-call me all you want, but facts are facts regardless of who says them. You are the one rechecking my edits, so maybe you&#39;re the paranoid one?</p>

<p>I&#39;m still just concerned. I&#39;m not being malicious in any way. It&#39;s important that our mods shouldn&#39;t have money-seeking agendas on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s my point of view anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You actually posted this as a separate post with this title: Something to consider: A Mod of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> pushing anti-vaxx via Amazon referral links (to make $$$). [We&#39;ll see if this gets deleted] ?????</p>

<p>Seriously...having the top comment in the thread wasn&#39;t enough for you?</p>

<p>You really didn&#39;t expose something big or really all that stunning.  When I compare your comment to u/axolotl_peyotl&#39;s explanation <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uzzub/further_evidence_of_the_ineffectiveness_of_the/codjgr7">here</a> I side with u/axalotl_peyotl.</p>

<p>Then you turn this into your own post...AFTER the very clear explanation was given...It just makes you look juvenile and petty. You even ask &quot;let&#39;s see how long it takes before this gets deleted&quot; or whatever petty phrase you used, as if <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>, or any of the mods for that matter, are actually stupid enough to delete a random post like yours just because it happens to call them out?</p>

<p>Are you really that new here? Most likely. People like you have been popping up here not so randomly since all the obvious pro-vaccine shit has been forced on us from all directions on Reddit. Do you people really think you aren&#39;t obvious? The more you do shit like this idiotic comment and your stupid petty post linking to this...the more obvious it becomes.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t stop debate and good discussion. Sure, you&#39;re group picks someone to get the top comment, but that doesn&#39;t stop us from continuing our own conversations down below, and on new homes we&#39;ll find in other places. Maybe it&#39;s time to start making a plan to migrate from Reddit: the Shit page of the internet.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really sad is that you&#39;ll stupidly see this as a victory for you. &quot;Oh look! I got the top comment on an r/conspiracy post when I called out one of the mods on his own post and made him look bad! Hur-fuckity-dur!&quot; </p>

<p>No, just...no... I don&#39;t think you understand...no, you know what, never mind...Here&#39;s your gold star for the day. Be proud of it.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind, the more this shit starts happening here, the more principled we have to be when responding to, if responding to it is even the right course. Maybe I didn&#39;t do a good job of this with this comment...It&#39;s just frustrating to have to face a new challenge to just trying to openly discuss things in an intelligent way and mind my own business when this guy and his ilk start doing things like this.</p>

<p>I think the real question for <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is whether he is actually Chris Carrington, the original author of the article on Daily Sheeple, and likely the one profitING on the referral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got sick with a nasty bug just a week before New Years and I was very surprised to see the symptoms continue for another 2 weeks and a half. I wonder if that illness could be this strain. I use to get flu shots in the 90&#39;s, but a family member got the flu after getting the shot. </p>

<p>For 3 years after that, every time this person would get a flu shot, they would get the flu in 1-2 days. The flu would last 2-3 weeks and after that we both stopped. I prefer vitamins chicken noodle soup and buckets of drinking water from now on. This scenario was going to happen. The more you vaccinate or sterilize viruses, the better the chance of them mutating into more resilient strains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point? You are obviously ignorant about the science. That&#39;s how the flu vaccine works. Sometimes we get it wrong. You aren&#39;t saying anything thought provoking or interesting to people that actually know the science. We will try better next time, sad that the old people died but it is barbaric to insinuate we should stop trying to save the elderly and just let them die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>democratic voting is just another form of mob rule. People should hold positions based on (P.A.S.T) Participatory, Accountability, Skillfulness and Trustworthiness. A system where the right people get put in the right positions by their deeds, not by mob mentality.

<p><em>To men who prefer a safe strategy, voting becomes a substitute for action and politics becomes a sort of game, like checkers or backgammon, only with a slight moral tinge.
To Thoreau, anyone willing to leave moral decisions to the will of the majority is not really concerned that right should prevail.</em> - <a href="http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html">Henry Thoreau and &#39;Civil Disobedience</a></p>
