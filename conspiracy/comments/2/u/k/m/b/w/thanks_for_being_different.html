How is it possible that such a large majority of minds all center around one particular topic, such as supporting vaccinations and countless other mindless bullshit (such as their obsession with Neil De Gressie Tyson, &quot;science&quot; and Cats). Yet, there is an insane amount of confirmation, circlejerk bias that people on reddit are &quot;intelligent&quot;. You would think, just statistically, that there would be a varied split on opinions of popular topics, yet when you scroll through a comments section, all differing opinions are downvoted to oblivion. </p>

<p>Is there some sort of robot algorithm that upvotes all posts that fall within the calculated perspective necessary to be viewed on reddit or have we, as a culminated population, truly created a singular hivemind that is so indoctrinated to believe one particular side of an argument or perspective that the system just perpetuates itself forward.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for being here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret that governments, intelligence agencies, and corporations Astroturf their products and agendas here (and elsewhere), because the ROI is staggering.</p>

<p>Get a top post or <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ti88e/snowden_iphones_have_secret_spyware_that_lets/cnzagdk">comment</a> in one of the defaults? You got some exposure. People always be talkin&#39; about <em>some link I found on reddit</em>, bro (at least in my circle still, but we&#39;re reddit&#39;s target demo (18-34 males). And when your buddy talks to you about a comment he read that was <em>yours</em> (once you learn to play the reddit meta-game), it&#39;s a creepy feeling. This place is a digital megaphone for propaganda, with cat GIFs sprinkled in for good measure.</p>

<p>And the hive/mind circle jerk can be slowly massaged and manipulated over time to focus on any agenda, really, given enough time.</p>

<p>So, at least here, on this forum, we at least acknowledge that it happens, because we have all peeled back the onion in our own way and pace to at least see that far.  And we learn how to work around them and have little skirmishes once in awhile. Sometimes it ends up in mod drama, other times it&#39;s used to paint the sub as anti-vaxx (currently), or anti-Jew, or anti-something.</p>

<p>Think of this place as part-time Ministry of Truth, part time Looking Glass to see what <em>they want us to see and focus on</em>, part-time internet highschool with cliques and a currency, and part time small-town internet pub, where some of us hang out at night drinking and talking and tossing ideas around. And I upvote you if you link to sources. </p>

<p>You should stay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that Winston&#39;s job was to take facts and change/manipulate them, or to erase undesirables from memory by altering old archives.</p>

<p>I am merely likening this to redditors who inject these types of ideas into stories and comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, Putin annexed Crimea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without detailing the nuances with the US involvement with the National Endowment of Democracy, Victoria Nuland&#39;s comments regarding the eventual leadership succession and her negative feelings towards the EU, the armed protesters in Maidan, the snipers..

<p>You miss a lot. I see those redditors as unwillingly Winstonian, be it by their naivete of geopolitics, or their blatant disregarding facts in favor of a political agenda. And with the repeal if Smith-Mundt, it&#39;s no surprise that they are now working the internet beat. At least to me.</p>

<p>Never underestimate the <strong>powerful</strong> yet spiritually immature &#39;need&#39; to be accepted somewhere in life by someone or something. The paradigm of mainstream is not built on rock solid facts or any need for truth, it&#39;s built from the collectively misunerstood feelings of loneliness and a yerning to feel well accepted and a part of something outside ones self, even if that means being part of a majority that is acting detrimentally towards the long term welfare of said majority and others by way of being the majority and the &#39;power&#39; that holds in itself. <em>If the ships sinking it&#39;s ok, look at how many people I get to sink with.</em></p>

<p>Man...You want <em>the</em> most glaring example of some of the most blind sheeple-like following you&#39;re talking about here? well check out a post I threw up in <a href="/r/losangeles">/r/losangeles</a>.  The shit is like...fucking hilarious/frightening (take your pick, as both apply).</p>

<p>The main crux of my point was that ALL vaccines are <em>not</em> &quot;100% fool proof&quot;...and dayem.  I think I&#39;m at -50 plus downvotes and counting so far.  lol.  I&#39;ve been besieged by one of the fiercest hive mind assaults I&#39;ve gotten yet since I&#39;ve been on this website.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not the nicest guy around, and sometimes HOW I say things pisses people off regardless of WHAT it is I&#39;m actually saying one way or the other...but (again) dayem.  I think this occasion is just a straight up example of the hivemind having gotten itself into an absolute <em>froth</em> of downvoting hatred (lol) regardless of <em>how</em> I would have phrased the subject matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/2uk2ew/baby_contracts_measles_at_santa_monica_high/co9a1gj">Take a look</a> (if you dare...a <em>lot</em> of it is pretty facepalmingly bad).  Again, I&#39;m not super nice in it, but the level of sheer sheepdom immediately expressed in it just made it almost impossibly difficult to handle these people with any real intelligence.  It was more than obvious that the vast majority (if not all of them) are already emotionally committed to their PTB-indoctrinated stance that &quot;all vaccines are guuuud!&quot; and they just absolutely <em>refuse</em> to be shaken from it...so there&#39;s not really much one can do but just sit there and watch more and more cars pile up on top of the wreck that post turned into. lol</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any sort of robot algorithm at all.  I think, unfortunate and disheartening as this is for the human race, the hivemind is a just a bunch of people that really do follow each other regardless of whether what&#39;s being said actually IS correct or not.  The mind of the general public apparently really <em>is</em> that stupid.  It&#39;s just one of those things where people go &quot;Well, it seems most people are going in &#39;this&#39; direction, so I&#39;ll go ahead and go with the crowd without actually stopping and REALLY seeing if this actually makes real sense or not.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course there are people that DO really check and question, but the vast majority, it seems, absolutely do not.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s saddest of all is that there are actually <em>multiple</em> comments in there saying things like &quot;go back to the rest of the idiot retard no thinkers just like you on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>lol.  Wow.  I&#39;m like wtf?  Man...Just...shakes head...</p>

<p>EDIT:  What&#39;s even more embarrassing <em>still</em> is that some of them have, for whatever disturbing reason, taken it upon themselves to begin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/2uk2ew/baby_contracts_measles_at_santa_monica_high/co9o6qh">stalking (yes, stalking)</a> my account and have come to this subreddit only to report my activities back in <em>that</em> one. lol.  What the actual fuck?  Wow.  Scary little gerbils, these people.</p>

<p>I disagree. If an idea is truly too idiotic, nobody would give it the time of day. If you posted, for example, &quot;my family lives in a bunker and only eats canned food because it&#39;s the only safe source of sustenance,&quot; you might get three downvotes and have it die out.</p>

<p>People are more worked up than ever about the vaccine debate because <em>there are enough people doubting their safety and efficacy.</em> I read a parenting article the other day about whether to vaccinate (they answered a resounding yes), but the point is that they said the main demographics that don&#39;t vaccinate are the poor because of resource scarcity, and--here&#39;s the important point--California&#39;s educated, specifically in Silicon Valley and San Francisco. So, contrary to what the Reddit masses would have us believe, it&#39;s not the ignorant slack-jawed yokels who are abstaining from vaccinations here.  </p>

<p>Basically, I think people are so rabid about the issue because they&#39;re indignant that others disagree. And the higher the number of people, the more vitriol.</p>

<p>Completely agree. I don&#39;t align entirely with the people who don&#39;t vaccinate whatsoever (nor do I buy the &quot;vaccines are totally safe&quot; line), and it&#39;s only been on this subreddit where I&#39;ve been able to have any meaningful discussion on the matter. </p>

<p>It&#39;s gotten to the point that I don&#39;t touch vaccine or GMO topics on the regular subs with a ten-foot pole. It&#39;s a shame because I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what they--being the corporate interests that no doubt have people and bots patrolling Reddit 24/7 to shape discourse on the topic--want to happen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to say, &quot;that&#39;s all the more reason to be diligent,&quot; but really, I&#39;m starting to see Reddit as a carefully-managed echo chamber no different than newspapers and broadcast networks. And just like I find writing to the studio executives to be a pointless endeavor, I&#39;m thinking the same is true of commenting on certain topics on Reddit. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always this way but yeah, it&#39;s bad and getting worse in this regard.  The main subs are pretty much entirely gamed and even ones such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are subject to an incredible amount of manipulation and attacks from outside sources.</p>

<p>Reddit is the 9th top website in the US, 3rd for social media. It&#39;s rigged by various corporations and governments. Not only that, once an entity establishes what content is &quot;good&quot; to the hivemind, it&#39;s self-perpetuating. People want to fit in, be part of groups.

    <div class="md"><p>The upvote/downvote system is vastly too simplistic. It should be a four pronged vote on each post which everyone is allowed. Given reddit, there should be a &quot;this makes me sad/upset, and this makes me happy/thoughtful&quot; button.

<p>I hate mainstream reddit. I hate the hivemind and I hate how unbelievably predictable they all are. How is it possible that such a large majority of minds all center around <strong>one particular topic</strong>, such as supporting vaccinations and <strong>countless other mindless bullshit</strong> (such as their obsession with Neil De Gressie Tyson, &quot;science&quot; and Cats). Yet, there is an insane amount of confirmation, circlejerk bias that people on reddit are &quot;intelligent&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Switch out the obsessions and that&#39;s a fair description  of <em>any</em> grouping. It works for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> too.</p>

<p>This post doesn&#39;t actually make sense.</p>

<p>Also, almost all the mindless bullshit belongs to the sky-is-falling anti-vaccine idiots.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re one to have a civil discussion on the efficacy of modern vaccinations i see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I don&#39;t deny there are reasonable people with concerns, but if you read the comment again you&#39;ll see the bullshit belongs to the hyperbolic morons and the overwhelming majority of civil discussion backed up with evidence comes from those who see no issue with vaccination.</p>

<p>Put simply, the pro-vaccine posters aren&#39;t the ones getting their arguments from Natural News, Zero Hedge, or Alex Jones</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is that Winston&#39;s job was to take facts and change/manipulate them, or to erase undesirables from memory by altering old archives.</p>

<p>I am merely likening this to redditors who inject these types of ideas into stories and comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, Putin annexed Crimea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without detailing the nuances with the US involvement with the National Endowment of Democracy, Victoria Nuland&#39;s comments regarding the eventual leadership succession and her negative feelings towards the EU, the armed protesters in Maidan, the snipers.. It was really fucked up Ukrainian Spring event.</p>

<p>But when you boil it down to </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin invaded Ukraine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You miss a lot. I see those redditors as unwillingly Winstonian, be it by their naivete of geopolitics, or their blatant disregarding facts in favor of a political agenda. And with the repeal if Smith-Mundt, it&#39;s no surprise that they are now working the internet beat. At least to me.</p>
