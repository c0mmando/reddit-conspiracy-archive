       I keep seeing so many posts condemning those who do not vaccinate. Calling them stupid, calling them bad parents, claiming that their kids should be forcefully removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this such an issue now? What is the significance of this becoming a big issue lately, I heard about the Disneyworld/land thing, so I assume its a case where an infection/disease started spreading and now everyone is jumping on the anti-vax bandwagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems weird to me how these posts are getting so many consistent upvotes.

       Any American who thinks the government has the right to either violently force the use of vaccines on the public or discriminate against people who lawfully chose not to vaccinate ought to move to China so they can have the government decide EVERYTHING for them without referendum.

       The whole idea of forced vaccination baffles me. I wouldn't let the government force-ably feed me fiber because its good for your shit, I wouldn't let them force me to eat 5 bits of fruit a day, so why should I let them force a vaccination on me?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I want to get vaccinated it should be my choice. I am not anti-vax, I am pro choice.

       Driving a car is dangerous because you are 'choosing to put people in a situation where they could potentially crash into you'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not vaccinating is choosing to put people into a situation where they could POTENTIALLY get harmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of things people do could potentially harm others, why is this the exception?

       Not vaccinating is more like drunk driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are putting other people's health, safety, and lives at risk through a reckless decision as opposed to honest accidents that happen from driving every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some accidents aren't preventable. Measles outbreaks are preventable through vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, getting drunk and operating a motor vehicle is a lot like not vaccinating.

       If the vaccine is as safe and effective as the pro-vaccine camp (and their propaganda) say it is, then there is no worry about who is or is not vaccinated - those who are vaccinated are perfectly safe. The hue and cry about getting everyone vaccinated is a "group think" conformity issue, not true science.

       you are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all some people resist the vaccine through no fault of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, and this is extremely important to remember, some people cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such as children with weakened immune systems from things like...oh Leukemia and chemotherapy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a child who is being treated for and has the possibility of surviving cancer cannot be immunized against measles, but kid whose parents are irrationally afraid of vaccines (amagad its gonna give mah child the autisms) gets measles and spreads it to someone who spreads it to kid with leukemia who dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That outbreak shouldn't have happened. The people who are immune protect those that cant be immunized from dying of diseases that shouldnt be being spread around at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, not everyone who is pro vaccine is perfectly safe, and the behavior of anti vaccine idiots who dont believe in science is putting lives in danger.

       The
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       point of the issue is autonomy. Choice. Do children belong to the parents or the state?  Does the state have the right to force anyone to take a medication - regardless of other considerations? I say the Parents should have 100% say about their child's health. And that the state has
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       right - at all - to force its citizens to take any medication, ever. Now, that said, I do realize that there are a lot of mitigating factors. Religious nuts. Uneducated people. Propaganda (both for and against).
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we allow the government to dictate to us how, or if, we take any medication, vaccines or otherwise, then our whole society will be irrevocably harmed - forever, because we all know that once the state gets a certain power it is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       misused.

       I do understand the concern, but vaccines are not just a matter of the government forcing medication on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an issue of public health that affects everyone, potentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter, while parents should make medical decisions for their children, do we draw the line at something that potentially puts that child's life at risk?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a parent does something directly harmful to their child, like leave them outside in the snow while they go to work (extreme example I know) no one would argue that child should be protected from their parent. The child has no choice in the matter, and probably wouldn't choose to freeze to death in the snow if given the choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that parents that refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated are neglectful and putting their child's life in danger. I do believe it is justified for the government to intervene when a parent puts their child's life in danger. It is neglect and abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: A child that young, does not understand the nature of the vaccine argument. They do not understand the implications of not being vaccinated. That point could go towards or against vaccination IF the science didn't overwhelmingly support the safety of vaccines, while most of the anti crowd is relying on bad research and misinformation (i.e. vaccines cause autism).
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont belive that parents should be able to put their children's lives at risk so recklessly.

       <em>

       agree to giving the state absolute power over people's bodies - regardless of circumstances. That said, it is the states job to start to
       <em>
        properly and correctly
       </em>
       educating its citizens instead of using school for political indoctrination. This would include medical issues. But the government is not interested in educated citizens - just mindless obedient ones who don't question anything. This is bad. A truly educated population is good for
       <em>

       You are changing the subject but yes, like I already stated several times in this thread, the vaccine is not 100 percent effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it is extremely effective at is preventing the disease from having a breeding ground, and extremely limiting the transmission rates of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point is even more of an argument in favor of vaccines, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I made earlier was that some people are still vulnerable after vaccination, but the vast majority are not vulnerable. Which means that people that choose not to vaccinate are putting those people who did but didn't gain immunity at risk.

       There is no diagnosis. No. Vaccines are not a diagnosis. That is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one expects vaccines to be perfectly uniform to everyone, that's not the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they DO is prevent large widespread outbreaks of diseases that have killed many people throughout history. There will still be infections,  (due to those that can't be vaccinated or those that resist the vaccine) but those infections won't be huge outbreaks and public health crises.

       I never said vaccines ARE the diagnosis, the thought that everyone ought to use the same exact formulation WITHOUT proper individual diagnosis is YOUR argument. Which is as ludicrous as it is dangerous and pompous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each patient must be taken on a case by case basis. Tested for possible side effects. And then determine if the side effects outweigh the benefits or not. Then and only then can an informed decision be made on whether or not vaccination IS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PATIENT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, people like you want to just go ahead and make a blind, blanket diagnosis of the nation, as if everyone had the same exact body chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, humans are greatly alike, but everyone is slightly different from one another. Can you not agree to that? Then why can you not agree to the fact that using the SAME EXACT formula on EVERYONE will have DIFFERENT effects on all those different body chemistries? And that forcing everyone to use the same proprietary formula will only lead to great numbers of unnecessary side effects?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no universal answer for a topic such as this, the human body is too complicated to pigeonhole everyone to use the same proprietary formula.

       The problem is that it isn't just that person's health who is put at risk by not vaccinating. It is everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       You chose the word diagnosis not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what you described DOES happen. If a child has a weakened immune system from something (let's say Leukemia) they can't be vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, that child is at extreme risk of infection if exposed to the disease and also carries a higher risk of serious complications or even death BECAUSE of that weakened immune system. Those children are relying on other people having the vaccination to prevent them from being exposed to the disease. Every anti-vaxx parent that chooses to not vaccinate their children is potentially putting one of those childrens lives at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       There ARE children whose doctors determine that they can't be vaccinated for health reasons. It ALREADY exists, so you are arguing for something that is already real WITH vaccinations.

       YOU choose to attempt to force vaccinations on people. So, YOU, without realizing it(no surprise), chose the word diagnosis, when you believe that ALL SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME EXACT PRESCRIPTION. That, in an of it self, is a diagnosis, a diagnosis to prescribe proprietary chemical formulations without properly testing individual patients before there administration.
      </p>

       I am arguing to keep individual freedom of choice a reality in this nation. And not allow fear mongering to persuade people to make uninformed decisions about their and their loved ones' health. Decisions that can affect the duration of their and their childrens' lives.

       Any doctor worth their salt will reach a proper diagnosis before administrating powerful substances into their patients. They don't pigeonhole all of their patients into one large group and medicate them identically. No,sir. And this is no laughing matter.

       A child with leukemia cannot be vaccinated due to weakened immune system, which also puts them at high risk of death or sever complications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people resist the vaccination as well but are generally safe from infection because of herd immunity.

       Unvaccinated doesn't mean anti-vax. Therein lies the deception. Religious objection to vaccines isn't anti-vax either. People who have adverse reactions to vaccines are not anti-vax.

       For the hive mantra correlation =/= causation this is some suspect deduction. Unvaccinated =/= anti-vax.

       The Disney angle must be the issue. Easier to blame vaxxers than admit a popular meeting place had an outbreak even while kids were vaccinated.

       Raised the point about questioning NOT the validity of a proven method of disease control (vaccination) but about problems with SPECIFIC batches, manufacturing, and the companies profiting from those with acquaintances both online and AFK and got mostly regurgitation of current MSM talking points and unfollows on twitter.

       You do realize that measles requires a higher level of vaccination to control than most other vaccinated diseases right?
      </p>
      <p>
       One infection of measles often causes a very high rate of secondary infections, compared to other diseases. So the less people that are immune, the higher the rate of infection is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is basic math.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccination is not 100 percent effective (more like 95) and some people aren't able to be immunized. So the more vulnerable our population is, the more likely those people are to be infected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 95 percent of people are immune, the odds of infection spreading are much lower than if it drops to 90 or 85 percent or whatever, because measles has such a high secondary infection rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with perfect 100 percent vaccination, there is a small chance that one person can get infected that isn't immune. But with that high vaccination rate, the odds of causing a secondary infection are low. The less people are immunized, the higher that secondary infection rate is and (guess what) outbreak!
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind. This requires too much critical thinking for you.

       You are missing the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it is only 95 percent effective, and some will still be vulnerable, there aren't outbreaks because the disease has nowhere to spread. No public health crisis. No epidemic. Fringe cases of infection MAYBE.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what we have right now is NOT the result of ineffective vaccines. It is the result of the unvaccinated giving a breeding ground to the disease and allowing it to spread
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 5 percent that were vulnerable are now a much bigger deal with people refusing vaccines. Before it was unlikely they would be exposed to the disease, now the odds of exposure are much higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disease has hosts to breed and spread in. The infection rate of measles is extremely high. Giving it the slightest bit of room to spread amplifies it greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Measles spreads easily. It is airborne and highly contagious.
      </p>
      <p>
       One person with measles infects more people than one person with EBOLA, and our country was freaking the F out about a few ebola cases. You saw how we had to react to that because there is no ebola vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This measles outbreak is a serious public health issue and people need to get their shit together and protect their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell would you feel if you didn't vaccinate your child and they died of measles? Is that fair to them? Your child doesn't get to make the choice, you make it for them and they suffer for it.

      <p>
       You'd really trust a "scientist" whom you've never seen or heard about? Do you also pro research the credibility of ANYone making these statements?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or for gods sake, you'd really trust Obama with your health? Obamacare for example? It's like a fucking for-profit charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be pro vax all you want but goddamn this whole thing is a bunch of horse shit. I mean this might end up being mandated.. why is this seemingly insignificant juice being forced in my body?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm irrelevant for saying I want to trust my own opinion, based on my own personal track record. Statistics is what pro vaxxers have to fall back on, are you part of that statistic?

       There is no soul; no entity is making life and death decisions with it.

       The nifty thing about science and scientists is that they publish their research. They publish their math. They publish the reproduction steps of their experiments. They publish their findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, other scientists can come along and evaluate all those things. They can poke holes in them. They can attempt the experiments again to see if they get the same or different results. They can check the math to see if it's right, or they can find errors. They can validate the research.
      </p>
      <p>
       And built right into that whole thing is the, "
       <strong>
        I'm better than you
       </strong>
       " mentality. If I can poke holes in the stuff you published, if I can disprove it, I automatically prove that I'm better / smarter than you are. And sometimes, depending on whose published works I disproved, I might even get worldwide recognition and/or a lot of money as a reward.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to trust "a scientist" if you trust that aspect of human nature to exist... and I know without a shadow of a doubt, that exists.

       Yes there is.

       And your soul will be tried, and tried, and tried. Until you give up.
      </p>

       Your soul is what keeps you alive. It's your conscience, your instinct, your body, your emotions. Everything. We live in a world where our souls are tried in every which way.

       Some are too weak and give up, and release their souls from their bodies for peace at last.

      <p>
       My soul is what's telling me that what is happening in this world right now is very scary. The single thought of how much control these people have over our lives and souls is outright scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all we've known, and the possibility of everything falling to pieces before our very eyes.. is something I honestly cannot fully grasp and understand. You know how when you realize something huge? And you feel it? I don't feel that when I think of it because they have made such a possibility literally so unimaginable it's insanity. That scares me. How will I react when shit really does start falling apart? Thoughts like these alone try my soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your soul is your will, and I have a
       <em>
        will

       to do the best I can to protect the people I love. And while past vaxxing could have been safe and okay.. There is purpose behind this incredible push behind vaccination right now, and I do not intend to be a part of that.

       You are letting statistics control your fate, and it doesn't matter if you survive or not. You are basing what you believe in on statistics. And that's your choice.

       I'm a better sample, without taking vaccines, i used to get just as sick as everyone (including the people taking vaccines). Then pro research + critical thinking happened, i found superior science, so i still don't take vaccines, but now i never get sick.

       You do realize that measles requires a higher level of vaccination to control than most other vaccinated diseases right?
      </p>
      <p>
       One infection of measles often causes a very high rate of secondary infections, compared to other diseases. So the less people that are immune, the higher the rate of infection is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is basic math.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccination is not 100 percent effective (more like 95) and some people aren't able to be immunized. So the more vulnerable our population is, the more likely those people are to be infected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 95 percent of people are immune, the odds of infection spreading are much lower than if it drops to 90 or 85 percent or whatever, because measles has such a high secondary infection rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with perfect 100 percent vaccination, there is a small chance that one person can get infected that isn't immune. But with that high vaccination rate, the odds of causing a secondary infection are low. The less people are immunized, the higher that secondary infection rate is and (guess what) outbreak!
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind. This requires too much critical thinking for you.
