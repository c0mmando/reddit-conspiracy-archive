<p>Some mods censor what they can&#39;t wrap their heads around. By doing this, they are controlling what we are allowed to discuss and learn about here. In their mind, it is not malicious, they just think they know what is important to talk about, and what isn&#39;t. In most cases, they are wrong.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, that by agreeing with 80% of &quot;The Big Picture&quot; they can more effectively keep people from looking at the other 20%. They are granted unwarranted credibility, allowing them to censor the important stuff more easily.</p>

<p>If you want this place to get better, we need to get rid of the cancer. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t turn that on.  Reddit does that.</p>

<p>This is partly why a lot of more heavily moderated subreddits use bots to effectively sub-reddit shadowban users they don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s based on karma, I think you need at least +2 comment karma in a subreddit to avoid the rate limiting but I could be off on that.</p>

<p>You can see you per sub-reddit karma counts on your own user profile page.  I can&#39;t see yours, and you can&#39;t see mine.</p>

<p>But given that your overall comment karma is -50 it&#39;s not that surprising that you are rate limited.</p>

<p>Again, this is a overall reddit.com behavior.  Not something the mods here have instituted, and not anything we have control over.</p>

<p>If you believe (as I do) that this &#39;feature&#39; of reddit often stifles legitimate debate then you should consider making a suggestion to change it in <a href="/r/IdeasForTheAdmins">/r/IdeasForTheAdmins</a></p>

<p>As someone who likes a good argument I know just how frustrating the rate limiter can be.</p>

<p>I am rate limited in <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a> for instance, due to being heavily down voted for expressing AnCap views.</p>

<p>Aside from that, all I know is. . . I had free range to comment in this sub (despite my generally unpopular views) and then I made the post and I was rate limited. I commented about the rate limit, and then the rate limit disappeared. </p>

<p>Perhaps I was on the threshold and only dipped for a moment.</p>

<p>Maybe admins have a plant on the mod team and someone flipped a switch, and then decided against it when it was noticed immediately. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you know that there&#39;s an admin somewhere that could turn my rate limit on and off at will.</p>

<p>But, I know, I don&#39;t have any peer reviewed studies to back any of this up, so I&#39;m just a nutter.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to commenting at will.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t think I like you. My interactions with you have been minimal, but from what I have seen, you are a strong supporter of the worst of the mod team, which makes me pretty suspicious of you.</p>

<p>But, to be perfectly honest, my information is limited. But I do think that ax, ambiguous and probably assured, should outrank you. </p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t even thought about that until you brought it up, but I think you might be right. I think there is a greater than zero chance that IlluminatedWax and Mr Dong are agents of Lucifer. Whether or not they realize it. </p>

So they don&#39;t have enough to shape-shift, but still plenty to be easily brainwashed and controlled using radio waves and electro-magnetic radiation. The tech they developed at montauk project. They just mindlessly do what they do without realizing why.</p>

<p>In case you aren&#39;t aware of the connection, if you read the original religious texts, and you compare it to government whistleblower testimony and contactee reports, it becomes quite evident that &quot;Lucifer&quot; was a real entity (or technically, a Group Soul Matrix), from another planet and that he looked much like the typical reports of the Royal Draconian Reptilians; The Ciakar, I believe they are called. Basically, a Dragon.</p>

<p>Furthermore, that is why all these elites go to places to Bohemian Grove and practice satanism and/or luciferianism. They believe they are descendants of the true ruler(s) of the Universe. That is also why they worship various ancient gods like Enki, <strong>Is</strong>is, <strong>Ra</strong>, <strong>El</strong>, Horus, etc etc</p>

<p>Some, if not all of these gods, may too have been &quot;Reptilian&quot;, and all were certainly extraterrestrial.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s true, I ain&#39;t mad at him. If we couldn&#39;t make alt accounts to avoid bans, there&#39;d be no one to post in this sub.</p>

<p>Is that correct?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, in general, i am seeing more involvement of the mods with the rest of us, and thats always a good thing, imo. Though, there is the question of ones demeanor when abroad visiting other subs. But ive personally never had any qualms with any of them in regards to my own transactions with them.</p>
