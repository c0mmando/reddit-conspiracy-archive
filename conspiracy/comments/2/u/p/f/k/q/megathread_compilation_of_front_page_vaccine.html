<p>One thing notably absent from each of these posts is any direct reference to scientific research or data. Also of note is the rapidly growing public support for legally enforced vaccination. It&#39;s important to collect these posts in one place to serve as an example not only of the power of propaganda, but of how well the Mainstream Media is able to disseminate that propaganda and shape public opinion. Can you think of a more obvious astroturfing campaign in recent memory? (Ebola? ISIS? Did either get as much play as vaccines are right now?)</p>

<p>If any have been missed, by all means link them here. Let&#39;s keep on top of this subject and continue collecting these posts.</p>

<p>Is it possible some of them could be dangerous? YES</p>

<p>But there are certain vaccines that none of us can deny are beneficial, assuming of course the government hasn&#39;t changed these vaccines in recent years in a plot to poison us all... In which case we&#39;re all fucked anyways right?</p>

<p>We need to have REASONABLE conversations about this. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is all about FREE THINKING people, meaning critical evaluation of all information and logic.</p>

<p>THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU CAN&#39;T FORCE PEOPLE TO INJECT THINGS INTO THEIR BODIES OR THEIR CHILDREN&#39;S BODIES. Whether or not an individual vaccine is dangerous is a whole other discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I get really frustrated when they take very complex issues and try to make them black and white. </p>

<p>While some of the vaccination fear is based in ignorance, I can&#39;t blame these folks for being skeptical. </p>

<p>Some of these same people that are whine about the &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; are the same people that are die-hard anti-GMO, anti-corporate. They have complete distrust for the &quot;evil corporations&quot; when it comes to them paying taxes, but when a big corporation gives them a vaccine, they question nothing. They listen with blind faith. 
I think GMO&#39;s should be approached with the same criticism and skepticism, but I think they shouldn&#39;t considered simply good or bad. I think there are some GMO&#39;s that are completely harmless, but some that are quite dangerous. </p>

<p>This is why we should approach these issues with reason and intelligence. If the science is challenged, with the goal of finding the truth, and the &quot;official story&quot; is proven accurate it will also mean a bunch of new data was collected and scrutinised. This new data may contain some information that solves new problems, finds new cures, etc. </p>

<p>&quot; I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue  to save countless lives.  I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated  with their administration are vastly outweighed  by their individual and societal benefits.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He expressed objection due to a specific (small) finding not being included in the final released paper, citing the need for the CDC to release all findings, not matter how insignificant.</p>

<p>In large scale studies there are bound to be outliers and bits of data that an article may not address. I was under the impression that all Mr. Thompson Was expressing his disagreement with that certain aspect being excluded.</p>

<p>Do I think that should&#39;ve been addressed in the paper? absolutely. Do I think it really does anything to hurt the case for the safety of vaccines related to autism? Absolutely not. The research showing the lack of correlation is vast and scientifically unchallenged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard of the Canadian Problem?  Initial data on the H1N1 &quot;pandemic&quot; a few years ago seemed to find that people in Canada who received the seasonal flu shot were more susceptible to, and suffered worse symptoms from the H1N1 virus.  Dr. Danuta Skowronski, lead epidemiologist at the BC centre for disease control, <a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAAC/34674">performed a double-blind, placebo controlled study on ferrets to see if the initial data was replicated, AND IT WAS!</a>  A rarely spoken of effect of some disease strains is infection can actually make you MORE susceptible to other strains.  This may be the case here, or it could be that people who actually got the flu that year developed stronger antibodies to H1N1 than the flu shots provide.  It is well known knowledge that most vaccines offer only temporary incomplete immunity.  </p>

<p>One vaccine that offers some of the least effective immunity is the whooping cough vax, DTaP. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22970945">Scientists found that every year after vaccination, the odds of catching whooping cough increased by 42%</a>, meaning after 5 years a vaccinated person is no more protected than unvaccinated.  The largest major outbreak of whooping cough in America affected a population that was around 90% vaccinated.  Now this brings me to the second problem with DTaP: <a href="http://www.cidd.psu.edu/research/synopses/acellular-vaccine-enhancement-b.-parapertussis">DTaP vaccination ENHANCES b. Parapertussis colonization by 40,000 times!</a>  Parapertussis is another strain of whooping cough, though not as symptomatic as Pertussis.  The vaccine actually greatly increases your chance of getting and spreading whooping cough!  This comes back to the dynamic I was discussing before: being infected with some strains of virus can make you more susceptible to others.  </p>

<p>This leads me to my last main point: some inoculations can actually make you a vector for the spread of the virus!  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1679866">Here is a study done on an outbreak that occurred right after mass Polio vaccination with the OPV vaccination</a>.  An important thing to note: the OPV polio vaccination is a live-virus vaccination, and it is banned in every major first world country.  Guess why?  Because it actually increases the risk of Polio.  Now instead of destroying this trash what have they done? Universally pawned it off on the third world.  There are hundreds of reported Polio outbreaks that occur right after a mass vaccination.  The whole &quot;India is now Polio free!&quot; situation?  It&#39;s bullshit! To understand this I have to get into the history of Polio vaccination.  Long story short, Polio is actually a host of separate syndromes.  Polio eradication in the first world was more of a &quot;reclassification&quot; of the disease.  Now instead of Polio we have new, symptomatically identical conditions such as asceptic meningitis, and non-polio accute flaccid paralysis.  While it is true that the new polio vaccine in the first world is effective and Polio is very rare here, the disease we knew as Polio in the 1940&#39;s is not completely eradicated.  Now, back to India.  Despite the fact that &quot;Polio&quot; has been eradicated, <a href="http://www.webmedcentralplus.com/article_view/35">rates of NPAFP have skyrocketed!</a>  Not only this, but risk of NPAFP is directly correlated to the amount of OPV shots received!  if this isn&#39;t a smoking gun, then I don&#39;t know what is.  </p>

<p>There are a few more important things to note about vaccines, such as: the varicella, or chicken pox, vaccine is tied to a huge increase in shingles cases.  Shingles is a caused by the same virus as chicken pox which gets reactivated later in life.  It is a FAR more debilitating condition than chicken pox.  There is some debate over what exactly is happening here, obvious shill publications are giving the same ludicrous excuse as they do with cancer &quot;the higher incidence is because people live longer.&quot;  This is stupid, because the varicella vaccine was introduced in 1995 and people don&#39;t live all that much longer than they did in 1995.  The rise in shingles is also strongly correlative with varicella vaccination rates.  Some scientists have posited that when old people are around children with the virus, it acts as a &quot;booster&quot; to keep shingles at bay, now that chickenpox vaccination has greatly reduced the incidence of the virus, the older generations are no longer exposed to this booster.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol... CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION (a big prinicple to understand when reading scientific research)</p>

<p>A few points:
-the article about whooping cough is only referring to the chance of acquiring whooping cough AFTER a fifth dose, no where does it say the vaccine is ineffective. the study is just showing a slight correlation between the fifth dose of the vaccine and increase of whooping cough YEARS later (which makes sense because science has already shown us that this specific vaccine is KNOWN to wear off years after).... the point here is that the vaccine is still worthwhile to young children, it just will wear off (as expected)</p>

<p>-the OPV polio vaccine is a ATTENUATED vaccine... which means the virus they use has LESS virulence (altered genome) which means it provides active immunity with none to slight side effects. The article you linked about the outbreak states that the strain of polio was known to be from a different country and over half the population was already vaccinated before the increase, which you state &quot;made the people vectors&quot;.. if you knew anything about polio, you would know that primates are NOT vectors for the virus... there is a difference between being a vector and being infected.. also, the opv is not a &quot;live vaccine&quot; it is a attenuated as i stated before. you also aren&#39;t mentioning there are two types of polio vaccines and that the one which injects dead virus (causing the immune system to form antibodies) is much more widely used.
-you also state that rate of NPAFP have skyrocketed.. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLIO; NPAFP = NON POLIO ACUTE FLACCID PARALYSIS...the article literally states the correlation might just be an artifact (meaning the statistics are irrelevant)</p>

<p>in conclusion: you make a lot of statements that with a simple reading of the articles provided, are shown to be simply correlation... not actual causation. do yourself a favor, instead of reading into bullshit science and filling your head with lies, take an immunology course or some basic microbiology and find out exactly how wrong you are.</p>

<p>have you noticed that no reputable doctor will ever say vaccines are bad? it&#39;s hilarious when people think they have figured some shit out that doctors haven&#39;t </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know a lot about vaccines - I&#39;m trying to learn by reading arguments from both &quot;sides&quot; with my limited amount of free time - but this statement is a dumb appeal to autority. We&#39;re talking about the same doctors that are pushing useless and likely harmful statin drugs to millions of people based on outdated anti-cholesterol science so their stamp of approval of vaccines as a whole isn&#39;t an argument in favor of vaccines. </p>

<p>And by the way I tought you were doing OK until that paragraph. You sound like you have enough knowledge to debate these things in an intelligent manner but for some reason you felt the need to add that paragraph. Please refrain from shooting yourself in the foot next time. Some people here are trying to understand a few things and we appreciate good arguments not these appeals to authority.</p>

<p>Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you&#39;re being had.
Let&#39;s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#39;s consensus, it isn&#39;t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.</p>

<p>As long as you keep posting pseudoscience garbage (well, you didn&#39;t even bother this time) that is paid for by pharma corporations, people will continue to ignore you, and rightly so.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you&#39;re being had.
Let&#39;s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#39;s consensus, it isn&#39;t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I get really frustrated when they take very complex issues and try to make them black and white. </p>

<p>While some of the vaccination fear is based in ignorance, I can&#39;t blame these folks for being skeptical. </p>

<p>Some of these same people that are whine about the &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; are the same people that are die-hard anti-GMO, anti-corporate. They have complete distrust for the &quot;evil corporations&quot; when it comes to them paying taxes, but when a big corporation gives them a vaccine, they question nothing. They listen with blind faith. 
I think GMO&#39;s should be approached with the same criticism and skepticism, but I think they shouldn&#39;t considered simply good or bad. I think there are some GMO&#39;s that are completely harmless, but some that are quite dangerous. </p>

<p>This is why we should approach these issues with reason and intelligence. If the science is challenged, with the goal of finding the truth, and the &quot;official story&quot; is proven accurate it will also mean a bunch of new data was collected and scrutinised. This new data may contain some information that solves new problems, finds new cures, etc. </p>
