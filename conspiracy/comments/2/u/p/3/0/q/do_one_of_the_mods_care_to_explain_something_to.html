        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why is it that no action is being taken against obvious vote-rigging and the influx of brand new alt accounts who all post(and then swarm together in) threads that link <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to things like neo-naziism, holocaust denial(or sorry, &#39;revision&#39; - things that will have no effect on anything except to discredit all the other content and users here by association and give the modern state of Israel perfect ways to ignore any legitimate, logical criticism by linking it to &#39;holocaust deniers&#39; and Nazi apologists)?</p>

<p>I make a post in one of those threads and immediately get 5 responses personally attacking me without any meaningful content, from accounts that are days, weeks, or a month-ish old - there is no conspiracy to be found there except the meta-conspiracy of people trying to discredit any &#39;non-mainstream&#39; content aggregators on major social media websites - so why is it that these attacks on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are continuously allowed?</p>

<p>They literally cannot accomplish anything else because what they are doing is the equivalent of saying &quot;this murder happened but look, it wasn&#39;t that bad, because the victim was killed with blunt-force trauma to the head instead of in an oven&quot; while feigning some kind of passion for &#39;the truth&#39;, when in reality that IS the truth, and all they are doing is discrediting the rest of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users and all the rest of the content here by linking it to neo-naziism, nazi apologists, and holocaust denial.</p>

<p>At the very least, why is nothing done about the influx of new/alt accounts and the obvious vote-rigging that they do to get their threads up and downvote and swarm on/attack anyone who points this out to them? All of their threads are literally full of accounts that are &lt;3 months old, why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Why is an attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> allowed to continue unopposed? If they want to debate numbers in a historical atrocity, they can go to another subreddit, it&#39;s not a conspiracy - the only conspiracy here is their attempt to discredit all the other content and users on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by associating them with heinous, horribly stupid shit that will not help anyone or change anything - and only serves to distract from the real issues(like the fact that Israel was set up by the Western elite ~50 years ago to serve as a ground base of operations to destabilize and moderate the behavior of the muslim world - the holocaust is just part of a founding mythology used to get the jews to think and behave in the right way - and changing &quot;the number of jews brutalized by the nazis&quot; would change nothing about that or <strong>have literally any impact at all on the world</strong>).</p>

<p>What DOES, however(have an impact on the world) is linking any form of legitimate criticism of <strong>a</strong>. the officially-authorized modern social narrative and <strong>b</strong>. the policies of the modern state of Israel to nazi apologists, neo-nazis, racism, holocaust denial in all it&#39;s forms, etc. It also helps the establishment discredit/ignore any major source of anti-establishment information or any unauthorized social commentary - like what would otherwise be taking place here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit or a major online social media site. <strong>We have all those links to the facts about JTRIG and online-media-manipulation by the western intelligence communities, so why would we think they wouldn&#39;t target us?</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Distract, discredit, deceive, dilute discussion, etc.&quot; - injecting fake issues, feigning organic support, diluting real debate, discrediting the whole community, causing false and meaningless conflict - that&#39;s exactly what these armies of alt accounts do</strong>, and one of them is literally called &quot;redit-army&quot;(not the actual username wouldn&#39;t want to <em>violate the sub&#39;s rules</em>, but it sounds that out phonetically), &quot;reddit-revision&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, if they were doing so in a way that a. refused to view the situation with logic, b. discredits themselves and everyone / every issue they associate themselves with, c. distracts from real issues that matter(<strong>like the fact that regardless of the number or method of execution it&#39;s totally inexcusable for a government or military to commit mass murder, and no difference in number of &quot;mode of dying&quot; is going to change that reality or the horror it&#39;s many victims had to undergo</strong>, so it shouldn&#39;t be something anyone tries to exonerate anyone for doing), and c. ignoring that very fact - the real truth of the situation - which is that no &quot;revising&quot; or &quot;questioning&quot; the number or method of execution changes the underlying reality or fact of the inexcusable nature of those crimes against people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really believe you - either you&#39;re not able to actually grasp the points being made by me - or you&#39;re intentionally trying to mis-frame this discussion in this thread as if it&#39;s about holocaust denial, when in reality it&#39;s about a bunch of people <em>using</em> holocaust denial and nazi apologist theories to discredit all the other users and content coming out of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and which helps the current criminals/brutal policies in the world today which can silence any legitimate critics by associating them with or connecting them to holocaust deniers - by pointing to them and saying &quot;look that&#39;s what our critics are&quot;. Maybe you&#39;re the main account of one of the many alt accounts involved in what I&#39;m talking about, who knows, that would make sense though.</p>

<p>The point is that these holocaust &quot;revisers&quot; are simply helping the people they pretend to be opposing, <em>ignoring</em> the truth(which I just stated in bold, that their attempts at &#39;revising&#39; the numbers of the holocaust change nothing in any meaningful way about it or the truth about it or what it did to people or the horror for the victims of it), and helping to perpetuate evil by associating it&#39;s critics with stupid bullshit and evil(trying to excuse or defend the intolerable behavior of the nazis during WWII is stupid).</p>

<p>You&#39;re just one more poster trying to mis-frame the context of this post in a way that prevents the real issues being talked about from being addressed by trying to distract people from it by trying to make it &quot;about jews&quot;.</p>

<p>Logically discuss any inconsistencies in the history of the holocaust in any other large sub and see what happens.  </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s me, but I haven&#39;t seen anyone say that it wasn&#39;t a horrible thing.  I have seen it said that it is not as horrible as other genocides in the 20th century, as in more people died in Russia.   Is that what you take offense to?</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think anyone is arguing that it&#39;s horrible.  But I think people would like to see more to the story than some cartoon villain with a small mustache trying to take over the world because he is evil.  </p>

<p>Right, so why should you give a shit if they discuss it.  It doesn&#39;t change anything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People discuss history in hope to better understand what happened AFAIK.  </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s not my area of interest, but knowing and understanding what made so many people follow a mad man should be something that is discussed and dissected thoroughly if the goal is to prevent it happening again.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t, and you&#39;re providing a meaningless &quot;answer&quot; without addressing 99% of what I&#39;m saying or asking, thanks for acting like a CNN news anchor though that way by providing a window-dressing response that makes you and &quot;your network&quot; look good by connecting it to some good archetypal concept without actually addressing the real specific issues at hand in my post or the real substance in the questions asked.</p>

<p>This is something that is happening constantly and should be clear to any diligent moderator, and I&#39;m making sure it&#39;s brought to your attention here and now and looking for a legitimate response, not window-dressing.</p>

<p>The fact that this is <em>supposed to be</em> a &#39;last bastion of free discourse&#39; within the system of media available to people of the western world is <em>why</em> all of what I see going on is going on(to make sure nothing good can come out of that &#39;last bastion of free discourse&#39; by weighing it down with bullshit, deceit, dilution, and discrediting nonsense that has no meaningful value to <em>anyone</em>), and it should be addressed by the moderators rather than ignored, because there are armies of alt accounts and teams rigging votes and swarming on anyone pointing to the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Are you serious? In this thread my &quot;issues&quot; are clearly being illustrated and points are being proven - the fact is there are numbers alt accounts posting here and vote-rigging in this thread, there are at least a handful of accounts responding in &quot;opposition&quot; here with that are <em>days</em> old or 2-3 weeks old, and you&#39;re sitting here ignoring the points made and <em>proved in the very thread that you&#39;re posting in</em> - while you ignore the major issues entirely and pretend this is about &quot;holocaust denial&quot;, when in reality that&#39;s just an example being used to illustrate the actual points I&#39;m making about an attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that you seem to be propping up and defending yourself personally.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The holocaust&quot; is fucking irrelevant, it&#39;s just one non-issue thing being used to distract from real issues and meaningful content and one thing being used to distract/deceive people here and dilute the community here, and what a fucking coincidence it&#39;s pushed by brand new reddit accounts and brand new days/weeks/months old reddit accounts are always easily found in those threads upvoting/downvoting and &#39;supporting it&#39; - people who refuse to engage in actual debate or conversation even about the issues their own threads are about and who simply personally attack anyone who tries to get them to engage on a rational level</strong>, it&#39;s just one thing that can have no meaningful effect on anything in the world EXCEPT the effect it has in linking this community and what it represents to nazi apologists/neonazis and &quot;holocaust denial&quot; - and here you are doing the same thing.</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally sitting there ignoring very clearly made, well illustrated, and easily proven points(the proof is right here in this thread, look at the posters responding &#39;in opposition&#39; to what I&#39;m saying and check their account histories and join dates, they&#39;re alt accounts gaming this subreddit - are you a part of that group, SovereignMan? Because that&#39;s what it seems like to people with brains). Why else wold you be doing this? Either you are being PERSONALLY PETTY and behaving in ways that are negative reflections of you on a personal level - or you&#39;re doing this intentionally. So which is it? Because you&#39;re obviously not being above-board and responding to the actual points being made - you&#39;re creating straw-man arguments to use &#39;against me&#39; and to avoid addressing what is actually being said here. <strong>So which is it, what is the reason for that, why don&#39;t you tell us all and your fellow moderators all about why you&#39;re behaving that way?</strong></p>

<p>Either you are a part of what I&#39;m talking about(an attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) and you&#39;re making <em>your</em> agenda very clear from your responses/deflection in your posts here - or you&#39;re not doing your job as a moderator and you should really consider stepping down and letting people know you need someone to take over for you who has the time and brain power to moderate and watch over this community diligently. <strong>Right now you&#39;re just refusing to even address the points being made and issues of concern brought up by members of your community - why is that?</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re ignoring the actual issues here and pretending that something else is going on(as if this is a thread about &#39;holocaust denial&#39; instead of a thread about people with armies of alt accounts USING &#39;holocaust denial&#39; threads as a way to attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and dilute/discredit all discussions and content here). So good job making your own agenda clear - you remind me a lot of TTrns who <em>also</em> won&#39;t engage in rational discussion and does everything in his power to avoid any point that I <em>actually</em> make while coming up with some straw-man to respond to instead, is that your alt account? How about all the other brand new alt accounts here in <em>this</em> thread, are those you too, SovMan? I suppose it would make sense for someone trying to attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to desire/attempt to gain a moderator position to best position themselves to control the flow of content here and ensure they can protect their own schemes against legitimate moderators.</p>

<p>Do you think maybe I should contact the admins about this instead? If you don&#39;t have the time or energy to investigate and stop the massive vote-rigging and influx of alt accounts gaming the subreddit, that is. The fact that you won&#39;t even acknowledge that point being made is what clearly demonstrates your agenda here, and it&#39;s not a good sign, Sovman, but hey we&#39;re all learning a bit from this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalizing words in a larger post is not &quot;spamming caps lock&quot;, you are really on the line here of abusing your powers as a moderator while completely failing to use them to address legitimate concerns of the members of this community. Why are you trying to do that? Are these alt accounts yours as well?</p>

<p>Why are you taking moderation action against me but not the droves of alt accounts constantly breaking many rules here and manipulating this subreddit? Why are you not demodded for that - for using your mod powers in a petty way against someone who you disagree with while completely ignoring <strong>provable, legitimate concerns being raised and pointed out to you right in front of your face</strong>? What is your thinking here? </p>

<p>You think all these days/weeks/months old alt reddit accounts all responding in the same way and doing the same things/voting the same way and showing up in threads about the same content are <em>legitimate and organic</em>? Why are you not addressing these concerns? Why are you not using your moderator powers to benefit this subreddit/community - and why are you trying to use them to attack someone who is pointing that out and asking &quot;why&quot;? So much for &quot;bastion of free speech&quot;, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is abusing his moderator powers and the other mods need to look into everything he&#39;s just deleted. He&#39;s also just banned someone telling the truth about what we can all see happening here without attacking anyone - SovereignMan&#39;s calling it &quot;attacks&quot; because he&#39;s being called out for ignoring reddit manipulation by a sea of alt accounts(who were very visibile in this thread) who he is apparently here protecting while banning/censoring anyone observing what is going on in this subreddit/what they are doing. It is a conspiracy, and SovereignMan is either wittingly assisting it or is too personally petty to be a moderator here, either or.</p>

<p>You just ignored everything that he said to you, censored him, and banned him while talking about how you &quot;protect free speech&quot;. He wasn&#39;t &quot;attacking you&quot;, if you <em>felt</em> attacked it was because he was telling the truth about you ignoring very visible, obvious reddit gaming and content manipulation by a mass of alt accounts who are right here in this thread and all over the holocaust denial threads trying to create meaningless petty conflict and distract people from real issues - and you are protecting them from being called out / pointed out for what they are doing, while using your moderator powers to NOT &quot;enforce the rules&quot; against anyone who sees you not enforcing the rules.</p>

<p>You should reconsider your behavior or step down or be demodded as you are seriously abusing your position, you are taking part in vote manipulation and content rigging either by cooperation or omission of action - and you should know people see it, not just the people you ban for pointing it out. You&#39;re seriously making it clear to everyone what is happening to this subreddit right now - exactly what was pointed out in this thread before you came in and tried to censor everything. </p>

<p>Input from members of the community isn&#39;t a bad thing and shouldn&#39;t be a bad thing or something you&#39;re resistant to and defensive to - unless you are actually doing something wrong, which in this case, it is clear that you are - which is why you deleted the comments and banned the person while making up excuses. I know what you deleted, and that&#39;s what just happened here. </p>

<p>PS - <strong>unless</strong> of course you think all those 8 day, 11 day, 16 day(etc.) old reddit accounts are all here in this specific thread supporting you, and swarming all over those nazi apologist threads, NATURALLY, organically, as &quot;genuine redditors&quot; who all just happen to type the same way, have the same views, vote the same ways, and <strong>who all practice the same tactics</strong> in their responses toward anyone who questions them or tries to get them to engage in actual, genuine dialogue. You seem to be defending them while banning or threatening anyone who points that out, therefor there is a problem and you are violating the rules of this community. It is very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing to &quot;be obvious about&quot;, SovereignMan, what was obvious is that you <strong>didn&#39;t respond to a single actual point that was made, you instead created and responded to a single &#39;straw-man&#39; and then censored the thread, deleted the posts, and banned the user</strong>. You are supporting vote-rigging, content manipulation, and gaming the reddit system while banning anyone who calls you on it, and now you are also trying to threaten <em>me</em> as well. Good job proving your abuse of your position as a moderator and your true personality and agenda here.</p>

<p>You are abusing your moderator powers, and it&#39;s pathetic to see you do so in a way that harms this community.</p>

<p>Edit: Are you aware that using your moderator powers to help game reddit, support vote-manipulation, and support content manipulation by massive waves of alt account is subject to global banning by the admins? <strong>You just banned a user for pointing all of those things out to you instead of responding to a single concern that was raised.</strong> Do you want that? You need to step down or admit to your actual agenda here - because it&#39;s obvious you aren&#39;t working for the people here or the members of this community. So what are you trying to do here aside from censor the truth, support vote-rigging and content manipulation, and banning anyone who calls you out on it? </p>

<p>This thread couldn&#39;t have worked out better because it showed exactly what was claimed was true, some users/accounts behind it, and it helped draw out a wave of brand new alt reddit accounts - showed their tactics/let them put their tactics on display for everyone - and also gave <em>you</em> a chance to show what you&#39;re made of and what you are doing here. So thanks for putting all of that on display for everyone - if there are any legit moderators online, they will see your mod-actions here and hopefully reinstate all the comments you&#39;ve censored and consider finding a way to demote you so that you can no longer abuse the moderator position over this community :/</p>

<p>There is no manipulation or ban-evasion going on here except that which your abuse of your position as moderator is creating and allowing to happen - <strong>which you just banned a user for pointing out, censoring his posts</strong> and ignoring his appeals to you(or a moderator) for help with a very obvious and blatant issue of ongoing waves of alt accounts manipulating votes and content in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, a subreddit of which you are a moderator and should have taken it seriously rather than attacking the user looking for a mod to help with it. You use the word &quot;obvious&quot; and you don&#39;t know how ironic that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you banned/censored a user for trying to get a mod to address concerns about obvious and constant vote-rigging and content manipulation by waves of brand new days/week alt accounts(many of which made multiple appearances in this thread) who all seem to center themselves around threads like &#39;holocaust denial&#39;, while not really being willing to engage in rational conversation or dialogue about it meaning they are not genuine users(when taken in context with their new account statuses and team-efforts).</p>

<p>You ignored the real problem, defended it, covered it up, and censored/banned a user&#39;s account for pointing it out and trying to get a moderator to address the concerns - all while <strong>never responding to a single point actual made or any concerns actually raised</strong>. You still haven&#39;t even while examples were given to you, reports were made, and you&#39;ve probably taken steps to try to cover them up/mark them as responded to yourself.</p>

<p>You are either abusing your position as a mod on a <em>personal</em> level because you were thinking &quot;don&#39;t tell ME what to do or how to moderate&quot;(even though the abuses being pointed out are BLATANT(gee I hope you don&#39;t censor my post for &quot;breaking the caps lock rule&quot; with the word &quot;blatant&quot; :/), obvious, and really almost ubiquotous in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> recently), or you are taking part in this abuse yourself. Those are the only two options here, so don&#39;t pretend you were &quot;just trying to follow or enforce the rules&quot; - because you just banned a user for trying to get you to do that and censored the posts about it while talking about how &quot;free speech blahblah&quot;. Unless you think all those brand new reddit accounts who all post the same thing, upvote/downvote the same ways, all show up in the same threads at the same times or around the same times are genuine - you are either abusing your position in this community on a personal level, or to support and cover up blatant abuses happening here / gaming the reddit system. Which is it? </p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, you could have responded in a genuine, credible way - instead you participated in this thread the exact same way all of those brand new alt accounts did, by <em>avoiding</em> all the real issues / concerns about abuses and manipulation being raised, deflecting from it using a simple straw-man argument about &#39;free speech&#39;, then totally contradicted yourself by censoring/banning a user for pointing out obviously legitimate concerns to you about the rigging/manipulation/abuses happening here in this subreddit - instead of addressing any of them - you chose to &#39;address them&#39; by ignoring them, taking part in it yourself, and supporting them/censoring someone speaking honestly about it. You&#39;re being dishonest and disingenuous, plain and simple. I have no &quot;personal problems&quot; with this or anyone here, so I wouldn&#39;t be saying that if it weren&#39;t true - I do have a problem with constant &amp; blatant manipulation of content in an online community I frequent by users who are not genuine, though, and moderators doing nothing about it or even working to actively <em>support it</em> and ban/censor critical observation of it(when &quot;it&quot; is harming the real purpose of this subreddit to begin with - and so are you, SovereignMan, by your blatant abuse of your site power).</p>

<p>If this starts happening here users have no choice but to raise their concerns - and you shouldn&#39;t censor the posts and ban them for it <strong>while their concerns are proved valid IN the very thread they make about it, which you are posting in</strong> - which you then ignore while trying to cover your own behind with &quot;oh rule breaking #10&quot;, as you simultaneously show you d</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to let the admins browse through this thread, you can go ahead and threaten away, unless you are working for / as part of an overarching agenda that would enable you to get away with total abuse of the reddit system and your moderator position in this community, my bet is that you would be the one who will be the one with admin action against your account.</p>

<p>but honestly - I don&#39;t doubt you would be a part of something like that, judging from the way you&#39;ve acted here, the way you speak, and the position you seem to think you hold here/the mental position where you seem to talk from or address the concerns of members of this community from - because it&#39;s clear that your &#39;agenda&#39; isn&#39;t to honestly serve this subreddit or this online community or keep discussion free and prevent vote rigging/content manipulation by waves of alt accounts, which is exactly what the user you banned and censored was pointing out(and which you have completely and totally failed to address except by <em>being a part of it</em> and preventing it from being pointed out openly by a member of the community).</p>

<p>If that&#39;s how it is then that&#39;s fine - but I was just pretending for a second/operating under the assumption that this <em>might</em> actually BE &#39;a last bastion of freedom in media&#39; with genuine/credible members or community moderation.

<p>Please do the job you have and address the members of this community, or admit to what you are actually doing here and be honest with us(or with yourself). The proof of what I am saying can be found throughout this very thread, with brand new reddit accounts posting non-stop using all the same tactics while refusing to address anything I actually say - just like you are - and trying to deflect everything while pretending somehow &quot;I&#39;m wrong&quot;(but if I was wrong you could actually address what I&#39;m saying - which you aren&#39;t doing).</p>

<p>Do we need to ask the admins for help with this subreddit? Can you guys please address the vote-rigging and manipulation of content going on here by all these days/weeks/months old reddit accounts who all coincidentally show up in a thread made about them and their rigging / attack on this subreddit and who also, incidentally swarm around in support for holocaust denial threads and jew-bashing threads that aren&#39;t even &quot;conspiacy&quot; in nature? All with YOU defending them and pretending it&#39;s not happening while it is going on right in front of your face - Most of all SovMan, why are you not looking out for this stuff and why are you trying so hard to avoid addressing it when abuses of this subreddit are being pointed out to you and can be clearly seen and easily proven?</p>

<p>Please go ahead and answer and stop pretending &quot;our sub&quot; means your sub, members of this subreddit are voicing concerns right in front of your eyes(here) which are easily shown to be true in THIS VERY THREAD and you&#39;re flat out ignoring them and attacking me for it, what&#39;s up with that bud? I&#39;m going to try to ask the other moderators what&#39;s going on, because I doubt very much that you&#39;re being honest or genuine here in how you are responding to me - as you are completely ignoring what I&#39;m saying, responding by making up fake/straw-man arguments(responding to points I&#39;m not actually making, while ignoring the ones I am) - and you are ignoring clear abuses of this subreddit and reddit system/content by new &#39;alt accounts&#39; who are here in droves.

<p>What a coincidence, you&#39;re on a reddit account that&#39;s 21 days old, ignoring all the points that I actually make, while coming up with straw-man arguments to try and deflect from/distract attention from the real issues I&#39;m talking about(which is an influx of users on massive numbers of nearly brand new reddit accounts gaming the subreddit and reddit system here while using <strong>things like</strong> &quot;holocaust denial&quot; to distract, deflect from, and dilute the real issues and real content here.</p>

<p>But good job trying to do what I&#39;m guessing is your <em>job</em> in trying to again distract from the real issues actually effecting people, deceive people, dilute discussion, etc. Would we find that your IP address is coming out of Eglin AFB is the reddit admins checks on it?</p>

<p>Thanks for proving my point, automurderator - keep up the good work at what you&#39;re doing. You can&#39;t really &quot;win&quot; in an argument with me because I&#39;m being honest(and I&#39;m right, as all I&#39;m talking about are <em>facts</em>) - and you aren&#39;t. So please do feel free to try again and keep proving all of my points like all of the other brand-new reddit accounts on your team are posting in this thread in apparent &#39;opposition&#39; to me have, all of which tried to fake conflict using strawmen arguments they invented while ignoring the actual context of the thread and not addressing any of the points I actually made.</p>

<p>Nice technique/attempt at deflection/petty conflict creation in place of addressing the issues I am pointing out again - the &quot;real issues&quot; are &quot;the points actually being made by the person who posted the thread or comment you are responding to&quot; - do you notice how I&#39;m responding to what you are actually saying, and a point you have actually made, rather than simply making something up about you or what you said and pretending I&#39;m &quot;responding to the real issue&quot; by responding that way?</p>

<p>You are part of &quot;the real issue&quot; as you are demonstrating the points that I have made without realizing it or meaning to in your attempts at distraction/<strong>petty</strong> conflict creation/deflection -  <strong>one of many</strong> brand new reddit alt accounts who are failing to respond to anything I actually say or the real issues I am here posting about or the points I <em>actually make</em> while trying to dilute discussion, distract from real issues, deceive other people, and manipulate content in this online community with droves of alt accounts and techniques like the ones you are practicing in all of your responses to me - and also practiced by all the other alt accounts(less days/weeks/less than 3 months old) who have replied to me in this thread.</p>

<p>It seems obvious to me that I&#39;ve hit a nerve here with this thread because of the massive influx of all of you guys and your new/alt reddit accounts and the way you are trying so desperately to harass me here (without actually responding to what I say, or trying to distract from the issues I am pointing out by mis-framing them, personally attacking me, or creating straw-man arguments to dilute and deflect from the actual points being made/the real issues being pointed out by me/talked about here). I even have a moderator here doing all those same things, which is very interesting to me, a bunch of brand new alt reddit accounts and one particular moderator <strong>all trying to shut down what I&#39;m saying or distract from the issues I present without ever actually addressing the issues I am bringing up</strong> - which is what you&#39;re doing, automurderator.</p>

<p>In a way, the response, types of responses, and types of &#39;accounts&#39; that have responded to this thread has been more eye-opening and telling than I think anything else could have been, and anyone else with a brain will see that same thing, as what you are all doing is fairly transparent. It sucks, too :/</p>

Are you intentionally being this way and intentionally, dishonestly creating a straw-man argument to deflect from the real issue this thread is about or to avoid the real issues being pointed out and the specific points being raised that the mods should be addressing here in order to avoid responding to it, or are you seriously not able to discern what is being said?</p>

<p>&quot;The holocaust denial threads&quot; are just one example of where all of these brand new reddit accounts show up, all days/weeks/&lt;3 months old, all voting the same way, all swarming and attacking anyone who disagrees and all refusing to engage in any kind of rational discussion about that particular kind of post, all while supporting it and manipulating the content.</p>

<p>..and incidentally all while doing things like exactly what you just did - deflecting from the real point(what I just mentioned, the holocaust threads are an example of them and where they all show up to manipulate content - this thread you&#39;re posting in is another, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m saying &quot;I&#39;m specifically offended by <em>this thread</em> - so that&#39;s the dishonest, bluntly stupid strawman argument you&#39;re using to deflect from the reality of what is going on here and the issues of concerned being raised by a member of a community that you&#39;re pretending to moderate), distracting from any meaningful discussion, creating false &amp; petty conflict and trying to terminate any meaningful questioning by doing what you just did - creating a straw-man and then &#39;responding to that&#39; instead of the real context or issue being raised, or the specific concern posted.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, Flytape, why are you doing that? Why are all of you seemingly unable to address that actual concerns being raised here and instead replacing them with suggesting &#39;love for jews&#39; or &#39;specific offense at holocaust denial&#39; - when it is <strong>perfectly clear</strong> that that&#39;s not what is &quot;offensive&quot; and it&#39;s <strong>not</strong> the specific issue or concern being raised by this thread.</p>

<p>So good job following the same tactics that all the days/weeks old alt accounts manipulating content and just generally circle-jerking around distracting/deceiving/deflecting around the real issues this thread is about. I guess that would follow - the same way SovereignMan and all the brand new alt accounts who responded to it are doing, and I guess it would follow from people who specifically participate in this with all those alt accounts by stickying their favorite subject - their holocaust denier threads. Good work, Flytape and SovereignMan. I don&#39;t think you two are as stupid as the lack of reading comprehension your posts imply, so I guess you&#39;re showing people your real agenda here by your lack of meaningful response to the concerns being raised in this thread - just the same way all the legion of new reddit accounts are showing their own agenda in how they responded to this thread and rigged the votes(<strong>or no, my bad, it&#39;s all legitimate, normal, genuine users who seem to be full of brand new reddit accounts all failing to actually address anything I say while still trying to create petty conflict and do the same propaganda-rigging that CNN or FoxNews does - by falsely contextualizing any debate or argument and ignoring the meaningful issues brought up by it or inherent to it</strong>).</p>

<p>You do a good job at what you do, but obviously that isn&#39;t serving this community or protecting it from attacks even when they&#39;re the most obvious thing in the world(droves of random brand new reddit accounts all posting the same way, talking the same way, acting the same way and using the same tactics, voting the same way, and all showing up at the same times in the same threads about very specific issues). Either be better or quit your pretending - <strong>you are ignoring obviously, blatantly valid concerns from members of this community and censoring them and banning them for pointing it out while leaving obvious abuse of this subreddit to continue, even while it happens in this very thread right in front of your face</strong>. Stop abusing the members of this community, please, Flytape - I&#39;d expect it from all the people on brand new reddit alt accounts, but two moderators? Really? :/ Those are pretty sad uses of your positions - so is stopping anyone from pointing it out by threatening them and banning them, but that seems to happen with anything meaningful posted here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> these days.</p>

<p>Good luck doing your jobs, enjoy yourselves, huh? Do the admins know about this? Because they shou</p>

<p>Bullshit,</p>

<p>Fistly, considering how people have been banned from an entire network of subs moderated by Zionist hive bumpers, I don&#39;t blame people for using throwaways to talk about that subject.</p>

<p>Secondly, you claim we won&#39;t engage in a rational discussion about it.  There is no such thing as a rational discussion when dealing with offended people.  The conversation is framed &quot;I don&#39;t like this, make it go away for me.&quot; Okay great, go somewhere else.  We aren&#39;t reshaping this sub because some people don&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>Bullshit,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s clear in this very thread and you are pretending it isn&#39;t, the posters in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have known you are a shill scumbag for a while now. Your response (avoidance) to a clear reality - one which is <strong>demonstrated in this very thread</strong> with all the very same brand-new alt accounts coming in here, voting the same ways, using the same dishonest tactics to respond(or rather to try and divert attention away from what I&#39;m actually saying and distract people&#39;s attention from the real issues being addressed and the real concerns being raised) - is very telling.</p>

<p>The fact that you would even use the term <em>&quot;zionist hive-bumpers&quot;</em> is extremely telling and you are either a fucking neo-nazi scumbag who has infiltrated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s mod list or you are here to support the pollution and dilution of this subreddit&#39;s ability to intelligently handle content by defending teams of alt accounts that are here to manipulate it, just like SovMan is, which is why you are both failing to do your duties as moderators when clearly valid concerns are pointed out to you by members and then proved in the very threads made about them - and why you are both abusing your moderator powers. The admins will need to be contacted for this.</p>

<p>You&#39;re either personally involved, personally petty and too dishonest to be a moderator here(just look at how you are trying to make everything about &quot;jews and zionism&quot; instead of simply responding to concern about an obvious, provable, ongoing attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which has nothing to do with &quot;jews&quot;, you ridiculous excuse for a moderator), or you are here to a do the job of making sure this subreddit goes to shit and stays there. Either way, you are not serving the interests of the members of this online community, and you are doing the opposite in a personally petty or professionally stupid kind of way(depending on whether you&#39;re just personally involved or paid to distract people from real issues and dilute real content/defend the teams of alt accounts used to do so with a mod-position on a major social media website) - <strong>paid to act as &quot;fly tape&quot; for the real content and real opposition to the modern official/authorized-social narrative by filling places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with bullshit, content manipulation, false debate, fake and petty conflict, dilution, distraction, deception</strong>. <strong>Fly-tape</strong> for the internet.</p>

<p>You are extraordinarily obvious - both of you - it&#39;s really totally transparent and it has been for some time to anyone who comes to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and has a brain in their heads that the place has fallen to the attack it has clearly been under. Whatever the reason is, you should be ashamed and embarrassed of yourself and know that you hurting everyone&#39;s chances at a better tomorrow/future in general. Either way Flytape, congratulations on your personal participation in a worse tomorrow for your family and children, you scumbag. Enjoy clocking out of  your terminal at Eglin AFB and going home to drink your beer and play with your children whose lives you are helping to ruin by diluting and distracting people from real social commentary on the internet today that may have improved their lives tomorrow - unfortunately for them, you are here with your team acting as &quot;flytape&quot; to catch all of that and prevent it from having any meaningful effect in changing how people think by diluting it with bullshit, distracting from it with bullshit, and deceiving everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks for making your username telling - because that combined with your actions and your abuse of your moderator powers here certainly are. You <em>are</em> a bumper used to keep real content down and false bullshit clogging up the works in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and you are one of the many people working at that on reddit. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is a team of people using your account to do it, same with bipolarBear, the account the somehow &quot;moderates&quot; hundreds of subreddit communities. You guys couldn&#39;t make your true intentions and reason for being here more obvious if you tried, not without posting an open explanation of your goals.</p>

<p>Thanks for immediately providing proof of my concepts - no one could truly just <em>miss the point</em>  in such a huge way honestly.</p>

<p>What a coincidence, a 3 month old reddit account who seems to have a personal problem with &quot;the jews&quot;(when that&#39;s irrelevant to this thread to begin with - but he needs to, again, <em>&quot;dilute the discussion, distract from the real/meaningful issues here, and deceive you</em>&quot; by trying to falsely contextualize my post as if I&#39;m trying to &quot;defend the jews&quot; while in reality I&#39;m trying to effectively comment on an organized attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to degrade it, dilute it, and deceive people through it - and all around use it to support the establishment and prevent it from being a source of credible discussion - by literally doing exactly what he just did.</p>

<p>He is doing what I suggest he is doing in my original post - maybe he&#39;s one of the many alt accounts browsing the &quot;new&quot; tab to help rig the votes in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and pollute this community with garbage using teams of reddit accounts.</p>

<p>The way that these posters/this group of posters function(look at sanantoniobay for example) is obviously <em>not</em> genuine or organic. What he is doing should be apparent to everyone in how he&#39;s trying to avoid addressing the real issues this post is about while attempting to falsely contextualize it in a way that serves the agenda of discrediting the entire place/diluting all discussion here by connecting it to people who focus completely on &#39;da jews&#39; - even though that had nothing to do with the <em>actual</em> points made in or context of this post. He&#39;s trying to shift attention off of the real issue - and put it back onto the fake ones used to discredit everyone here and dilute/distract from all real debate or issues by trying to distract focus and place it squarely back on &quot;the jews&quot; as if that means anything.</p>

But my position is that I&#39;d like to stop brainwashed idiots arguing &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy, your deluded lol&quot; (sic) because they haven&#39;t the wit to think beyond what the mainstream media has told them.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, are trying to restrict discussion of a legitimate conspiracy, because from whatever angle you look at it, the Holocaust was/is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>From one perspective, it was the Nazi elite conspiring to systematically exterminate millions of European Jews with a Final Solution. Why wouldn&#39;t you want that to be discussed? Are you concerned that we are still waiting on real documentary evidence (ie orders or plans) proving the existence of this elusive &quot;Final Solution&quot;? Or are you concerned that the actual number of civilians who died at the hand of the Nazis could have been grossly exaggerated, and that many details of atrocities that were published at Nuremberg were made up, sometimes by German prisoners undergoing torture? That this was a conspiracy by the Russians, British and Americans to shame and punish the defeated Nazis, with the enthusiastic support of the Jewish diaspora who used the deceit for political reasons, notably to facilitate the creation of a Jewish State? </p>

<p>The Holocaust was one of the greatest conspiracies in history, whatever way you look at it, and if you don&#39;t think it should be discussed on this sub, then this sub is not for you. </p>

<p>No offense man but that seems awfully easy.  You either get your way or you get your way.  Or you don&#39;t get your way and everyone else is the idiot.</p>

<p>I must say that this choose your own adventure book really fucking sucks.</p>

<p><em>choose your own adventure</em> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you want to walk through the door and jump into the battle, flip to page 82</p></li>
<li><p>if you want to run away and live to fight another day, flip to page 82</p></li>
<li><p>if you want to wait to see how the battle progresses a little before getting involved... flip to page 82</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well... I guess I have to flip to page 82...</p>
