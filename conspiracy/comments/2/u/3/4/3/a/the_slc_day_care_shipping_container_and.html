    <div class="md"><p>Folks,</p>

<p>The mod team wants to let you know that some strange things have been happening in this thread.</p>

<p>Firstly, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ieOku5t.png">the main post was just sent to the spam filter</a> (it has now been reapproved) for reasons we cannot determine. This action was not done by an admin or a mod, from what we can discern based on the modlog.</p>

<p>Secondly, the top comment by <a href="/u/shemp33">/u/shemp33</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u343a/the_slc_day_care_shipping_container_and/co4pwx5">here</a> was also <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oAFjFI4.png">sent into the spam filter</a> about 3 hours after it was posted. Again, we have no indication from the modlog that this action was done by an admin or mod, and we have, of course, reapproved the comment.</p>

<p>To give just a general picture of what you&#39;re looking at in the above screenshots, when a normal removal occurs the name of a mod (or admin) is attached next to the &quot;removed&quot; line under the comment or submission; I.E. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SGZXfdc.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>When there is no username attached to a removal this signifies that the site wide spam filter removed the post. The spam filter is a site wide blacklist of terms and domains setup by the admins, it is kept propriety and is not viable in the public reddit code; however, some information on blacklisted domains can be found in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/28d487/meta_the_reddit_admins_employees_automatically/">this</a> post.</p>

<p>We had this spam filter issue yesterday with the original recap thread by <a href="/u/blink_and_youre_dead">/u/blink_and_youre_dead</a> as he had included a shortened google maps link which triggered he filter.</p>

<p>However, today we cannot explain why the main post, nor the top comment, triggered the filter.</p>

<p>We are a bit taken aback, and will continue to keep an eye on this thread to approve any erroneous spam filter removals. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>It was the admins removing the post and comments. We are speaking with them now and will make a statement at the conclusion of our discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were trying to review all of the information he posted to discern if there was any doxxing contained therein, and we&#39;ve yet to finish the analysis; it&#39;s likely the admins determined something he posted was personal information and banned him as such.</p>

<p>To that end, the shadowban is not out of the norm (although I do wish the admins would have dropped us a line to let us know where the offending information was located, such that we could remove it from the sub, as we do not want to facilitate doxxing of any kind).</p>

<p>That said, the spam filter removals are quite strange, and have my attention focused squarely on this thread for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>An alphabet soup agency probably contacted the admins and told them to get rid of these threads ASAP.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, the government is well aware of what this daycare center really is. Either:</p>

<p>A) They&#39;re already actively monitoring/investigating it and they don&#39;t want reddit/4chan/ATS scaring the proprietors away</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>B) It&#39;s some sort of government installation and they don&#39;t want people snooping around it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fucking disgusting.</p>

<p>Reddit is a disgusting platform overrun by busy-bodies who take pleasure in removing people&#39;s comments and content. The more popular the content, the more they get off on it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s censorship, they do it without ANY concern for notifying people, and if it wasn&#39;t for your diligence they would get away with it.</p>

<p>Disgusting that this behavior is normalized on reddit. Absolutely disgusting. And it&#39;s not like they&#39;ve had people tell them this for the best part of a decade - so they can&#39;t come out and say ever &quot;in light of recent events / we&#39;ve had a thought&quot;.</p>

<p>Who the fuck is harassing a day care center? I just got to this single comment from another part of reddit.</p>

<p>Find a comment, and quote where this person is &quot;harassing&quot; (and define harassing) a day care center.</p>

<p>I am concerned with the fact that reddit admins, like a bunch of kids, are deleting people&#39;s shit on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went back to look at Funn Stuff Inc and this is weird too. They are listed as a trucking and transport company formerly owned by Fred Calhoun. Hes passsed away now and a company named Caldee LLC Got it in 2008 for what looks like 1.5 million.</p>

<p>Funn Stuff is also associated with a russian real estate attorney as well as a sex offender who is currently in jail. <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm0f43w/fun-stuff-inc">http://www.manta.com/c/mm0f43w/fun-stuff-inc</a>  ( who knows)</p>

<p>Weird thing is the address is 404 Hampton as the address but operating address is 405. This puts another company in the mix called HCC LLC. As that owner now.
<a href="http://webgis.hampton.gov/sites/ParcelViewer/">http://webgis.hampton.gov/sites/ParcelViewer/</a>
 404 ABERDEEN RD 
HAMPTON , VA 23661   use that adress and look through the records yourself. </p>

<p>Its listed as a company with 1 truck and 1 driver.... to all these different places???? Makes no sense <a href="http://www.quicktransportsolutions.com/inspectionreports/fun-stuff-inc-usdot-2284872.php">http://www.quicktransportsolutions.com/inspectionreports/fun-stuff-inc-usdot-2284872.php</a></p>

<p>Caldee, LLC is owned by another lawyer. James J Knicely which the address is just some house.</p>

<p>HCC LLC is the owner of that which the address makes it Hampton Collision Company. Maybe its just they share a mailing address heres a screenshot of both places. -<a href="http://imgur.com/D9cCtTC">http://imgur.com/D9cCtTC</a></p>

<p>I dont know why they are connected but something is strange here too. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Could 1 truck even handle 17,000lbs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.  The inspection reports quoted above list it as a straight truck, meaning a GVWR of over 12,000 lbs(edit: 10,000 lbs), and no provisions for a trailer over 12,000 GVW.</p>

<p>u/Tremendousdread lists a straight truck as having 8,000-15,000 lbs capacity, but that is only for straight trucks with two axles (steering and rear.)  If it has two sets of axles on the rear, a straight truck can hit GVWRs of 34,000 lbs or higher.  Think dump trucks, they too are classed as straight trucks, if they don&#39;t have a trailer above 12,000 lbs.  </p>

<p>Though you might just be able to hit 17,000lbs of effective payload on a two axle truck, if  it is a day-cab truck (no sleeper) and you remove the box, convert the truck into a container hauler.  Definitely doable on a three-axle.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try and find a picture of one.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Just guessing, but either they didn&#39;t run them across the scale (which is odd for an inspection to take place before a scale in a weigh station or port of entry) or they already ran them across the scale, and they weren&#39;t overweight.</p>

<p>Last edit, I swear:</p>

<p><a href="http://containers4sale.com/container-delivery/">http://containers4sale.com/container-delivery/</a> has an example of a 20&#39; intermodal on a straight truck.  With three axles and a sleeper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one shipment that goes to a US Distributor of cheap china toys. Their catalog is password protected because you have to become a member to buy the toys at their wholesale cost. Basically they are the middle man between china and the US, these are the toys you find at Zoos, gift shops, gas stations, and other places that sell cheap shit to kids. This is a VERY common practice for US distributors. A lot of times they have to verify that you are a business to offer you the wholesale price. The website &quot;Fonroid.com&quot; is pulling similar companies with &quot;Fun&quot; in their name, the shipment DID NOT go to any of those other companies.</p>

<p>I work in logistics and imports on a daily basis. I tried some of my containers in that website and it is wildly inaccurate or did not produce any results. IMO, I would not take the info displayed there as fact. </p>

<p>EDIT: Did some playing around with that Fonroid site to see if I could get it to list random companies in the side bar. Typed in &quot;CRG Events&quot; which is a local Seattle company. It pulled up the contact info for &quot;CRG Events&quot; in the side bar and then 2 unrelated shipments. &quot;CRG Events&quot; is a corporate event planning company, they do not typically receive shipments especially ocean shipments. If they do get shipments it would most likely be through a contracted 3rd party. My theory is correct they are just pulling companies with &quot;fun&quot; in the side bar and displaying contact info. STOP CONTACTING AND RESEARCHING THESE RANDOM COMPANIES.</p>

<p>Not really. Yeah things can come in the same container but every company is going to have their own freight broker to bring the shipments in. In this case it is a shipment that went directly to Norfolk, VA, the distribution warehouse for Fun Time.</p>

<p>Fun times is a large distributor of random crap. You can search their history and these are regular shipments for them, as would be for any large distributor.</p>

<p>The carrier website that shipped the product is the best option. This looks to have shipped with Hanjin. Though as a decent source you could use <a href="http://www.track-trace.com/bol">http://www.track-trace.com/bol</a> and search the master BOL# HJSCSZP3J5137700. Which is shows that it went from HUANGPU, GUANGDONG ,CHINA to its port of discharge Norfolk, VA.</p>

<p>This witch hunting crap has to stop. While we may not know the whole story about the day care, this shipment is completely unrelated as well as the other companies you guys are trying to contact and bring in to this.</p>

<p>The carrier website that shipped the product is the best option. This looks to have shipped with Hanjin.

<p>This witch hunting crap has to stop. While we may not know the whole story about the day care, this shipment is completely unrelated as well as the other companies you guys are trying to contact and bring in to this.</p>

<p>Not sure if which hunting, at least not me personally, nor advocating for it.  Scratching a curious itch would be more apt, again, personally speaking.  If they do happen to be unrelated, we have at least untangled some threads indicating some very shady operating practices from some companies which can be reported.  And I totally agree that people calling up any one mentioned here is complete asshatery.  And tbh, I can only hope that the link you provided is accurate enough to debunk this chain.  If I have to go to work with this on my mind it&#39;s going to be a very long and annoying day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, nuts to reddit!</p>

<p>I come home from work and find the site trying to sweep this under the rug.  Tsk, tsk.</p>

<p>I may have done it to myself.  I had taken the suggestion to contact Customs.  At first they didn&#39;t seem much to care (like reddit) until I mentioned the weights involved with the shipment and what it was supposed to be.  At this point I was transferred to another agent and reiterated the information.  He asked for specifics, so I had (admittingly stupidly) emailed them from work computers the source links collected in this and the other thread.  They thanked me for my time and I went about my day.</p>

<p>Apparently not too long after that, reddit admins take aim on this topic.  Colour me surprised.</p>

<p>I plan to continue researching, more than likely one of the chan sites, since they seem to be the only ones not actively hiding/removing this discussion.  4 sites, including this one, where I had been talking to people have all had the topic shuttered this afternoon.  If you would like to know where/stay involved, feel free to PM me so I can note it and I&#39;ll link you to talks when they come back.  Sometime tomorrow more than likely, I&#39;m going stargazing tonight to clear the brain.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who wanted to get to the bottom of this and helped disseminate the information.</p>

<p>Keep the faith!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that the kid is the next in line of superhuman bionic weapons currently being tested at their secret facility in SLC. The shipping container held a giant cell to contain the weapon in case of emergency with the other people on the shipping info being &quot;keyholders&quot;, the only ones who can release him in case of emergency. The other kids at the Day Care go in but don&#39;t came back out, they are the weapons poor test subjects, and first victims.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, if we are to follow your idea, is anyone else kinda weirded out by the similarities this has to True Detective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to check on the bait shop in Iowa City. But the road it&#39;s on(W Overlook Road NE) is not mapped by google street view. Although it looks like a normal road that should be. Weird.</p>

<p>Someone in Iowa City, go stake this place out!</p>

<p>Another note. The business right next to the bait shop is also called funcrest. Funcrest Dairy and Grill. Possibly owned by the same people? Or is funcrest just what the location is called?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to live in North Liberty, and you had to drive past this stuff to get to the Coralville dam.  I currently live about 2.5 hours away, but I was never suspicious of these places when I lived there.  Pretty old, but definitely fitting with the rest of the area surrounding the dam and lake.  I still have friends in IC, and a few that disc golf, but I would feel weird asking them about the place.  I&#39;m possibly going to watch the super bowl at my parents&#39; house, but that&#39;s in CR about 30 min north.</p>

<p>Also, for the last year I lived there, the road in question was closed off and under repair.  I was trying to get to a 10K that started on the dam and it was near impossible.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s fixed by now, though.</p>

<p>But what if, and I mean just what if, robots didn&#39;t need us to tell them what to do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting anything, but after reading all these threads this creeped me out. The music alone.</p>

<p>Also it gives me this kind of esoteric vibe, like maybe the people who made it may have some kind of religious/spiritual agenda they are trying to imbue it with. It seems like a badly realised but really ambitious/grandiose thing that reminds me of like Churches trying to be down with the kids and putting &#39;&#39;subtle&#39;&#39; messages in things.</p>

<p>One thing I will say about the competing daycare: There was a comment on one of the threads (can&#39;t spend too much time finding it now) about how you can only get your kids in there through workforce solutions. So...not sure there&#39;s any real &quot;competition&quot; if that&#39;s true.</p>

<p>Mass of a soccer ball is ~0.43kg</p>

<p>0.43kg * 20 balls/CTN * 763 CTNs = 6561.8 kg</p>

<p>Now, 15 260 soccer balls is absolutely ridiculous for any establishment, especially a day care. However the actually shipping figures are possible.  20 deflated balls/box is also possible, as is 763 cartons in a container. </p>

<p>Again, this is a ridiculous amount of balls especially when it&#39;s x5 orders, but I just wanted to work out the math and it&#39;s not completely unreasonable in that aspect </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, being an engineer, when you said those weights I had to do some calculations. Let&#39;s say this was shipped in a 40ft shipping container. If you look up the volume you&#39;ll see they have an internal volume of 67.5 m<sup>3.</sup> Now let&#39;s assume all this plastic crap was made of polyethylene  (a very cheap mass produces plastic) which has a density between 910 and 960 kg/m<sup>3.</sup> If we take the 8000 kg in the container. And divide by the volume times density (which will give us the mass if the container was filled with pure polyethylene) we get 8000/(67.5*960)= 12.3% full of polyethylene (with the rest being air pockets, passing material, etc.) Now I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s guaranteed to be just a bunch of plastic shit, but it is possible. I still like the gun theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did stumble across your post earlier and can appreciate your debunking. I did see that someone had pictures of crates out back of the day care covered in secured tarps so I was just letting my mind wander off with that thought for a bit. Whether the shipping info found is fishy or not (and not seems to be the more accurate answer) the day care is still shady with the violations that are still coming and the random owner info that matches up with shady stuff, and the laundromat across the street still concerns me just in general haha.</p>

<p>I also have been an advocate for not contacting these places. If anything shady was going on, the people involved are very much aware now so I&#39;m expecting that all these vigilante geniuses have ruined our ability to follow more crumb trails. This is my first time ever really watching something unravel in this sub so I&#39;m definitely disappointed haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty, the day care looks sketchy but I have seen way worse. This is not exactly in the richest neighborhood and is probably ran by someone that is not up to speed on business practices for the most part, that is why it can seem a bit shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt, I live in a similar looking neighborhood, it does indeed suck and places look sketchy but I&#39;ve never seen securely-tarped containers around them, any owner changes are proudly stated on the outside with some sort of &quot;Under New Management&quot; or &quot;Grand Re-Opening&quot; and the artwork changes frequently, the shades aren&#39;t drawn and creepy, and there&#39;s certainly children there visibly during normal day-time hours. Shady is an understatement. Maybe the population of adults to children is really low in that area. Idunno. Just rubs me the wrong way coming from someone who lives in the ghetto haha.</p>

Some kind of legislation that makes it illegal to &quot;investigate&quot; a potential crime without a license.

Regardless of how this turns out, &quot;public information&quot; is what is being used to compile this &quot;investigation&quot;.

<p>Facebook Page for A Chunga Company. Only company ive been able to find with that name so I assume its the same one. Written in the description is.</p>

<p>&quot;Civil engineering,Road construction,projects,production,general contracts,consultant&quot; </p>

<p>Also listed are several phone numbers.</p>

<p>&quot;77508032 , 75728299, 77238863&quot;</p>

<p>None of these seem to be valid american phone numbers. Maybe for fax or something but i have no way to tell.</p>

<p>9 pictures are posted on their page. 8 of these pictures are tagged as being in  Adamaoua, Cameroon and show what seems to be several construction projects in that town. Album is titled &quot;Work in progress with viettel cameroon sall&quot;</p>

<p>9th picture is a tagged photo by a man named Mula Fordip Divine. Picture is of a slightly open metal cabinet on a faux wood wall with a door next to it. The Company commented saying &quot;New Office&quot;. The cameroon photos were posted November 26 2013 while the office picture is dated May 4th 2014 making this picture the most recent activity in this group.</p>

<p>I also did some research into the names mentioned in the building album title. Viettel Mobile is the largest Phone service provider in Vietnam. I found mention of the cameroon company as follows.</p>

<p>&quot;It won a contract in Cameroon in December 2012, which it bid for in a joint-venture with Bestinver Cameroon S.A.R.L.&quot;</p>

<p>This sentence cites this article in the Newspaper &quot;Vietnam Voice.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://english.vov.vn/Economy/Viettel-gets-Cameroon-telecom-contract/251490.vov">http://english.vov.vn/Economy/Viettel-gets-Cameroon-telecom-contract/251490.vov</a></p>

<p>Chunga is not mentioned in either the Wiki article nor the newspaper article. This is probably a bit far fetched but there is mention of a Taiwanese Telecommunications company called Chungwa Telecom</p>

<p>&quot;In May 2007 Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. established a joint venture with Viettel Mobile to provide Internet data center services in Vietnam.&quot;</p>

<p>Most likely unrelated but the name similarity makes it worth mentioning. </p>

<p>Very little of note on the facebook page excluding that it has 11 likes (including myself) and has no text posts only photos. </p>

<p>Go check the shipment. It was a container for Norfolk, VA. Which is the location of the china toy distributor. The other companies, including the day care, had absolutely NOTHING to do with the shipment. There is also an explanation of why the random companies were displayed on that site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to say thanks for your input, you very may well of helped squash this.  Just using the info on the companies we have and the website you gave me, I&#39;ve noticed discrepancies.  Sadly, I must now plunge into the slave wage life for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Should anyone feel like clarifying our information through this (and hopefully other) sites some more, have at it.  Otherwise I&#39;ll continue this when I return.  Also edited OP to include this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not accurate at all depending on how dense the item being shipped is. A pallet of bottled water (72x24 packs), for instance, is 1700lbs alone. That would only be 10 pallets of bottled water, while a large tractor trailer can carry 24 (2x12) pallets. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re shipping something that&#39;s a bit lighter than water or canned foods, you can double stack them and still get over 1000lbs into the footprint of a single pallet quite easily. </p>

<p>17000lbs is less than one trailer for heavy stuff. </p>
