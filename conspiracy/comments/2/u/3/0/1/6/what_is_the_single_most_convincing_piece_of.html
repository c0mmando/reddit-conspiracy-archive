       We attacked Iraq in retaliation for a terrorist operation carried out by a bunch of Saudi nationals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if you believe the official story 100% without question, our own reaction to the attack is ridiculously questionable!

       I cant believe how many people get this confused! We attacked Iraq because Saddam supposedly had wmd's ( which were never found). We attacked Afghanistan based on 9/11. I hate to be the guy that corrects people but this is important.

       The 'dancing Israelis'  who had cameras set up and running BEFORE the first plane hit (to 'document the event' as they told an Israeli talk-show host)...well, that and the fact that they were in a van that tested positive for explosives and were carrying large amounts of cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli explosives were indeed found...set to annihilate the GW Bridge when they detonated. Police just barely defused it in time. Both the van with the explosives and the van carrying the dancing Israelis were owned by the same guy, Mossad agent Dominik Suter, who quickly fled back to Israel.

       Didn't read or hear about this right? That's because the highest-ups covered it up. The info is out there though.

       Have a link of the interview those 5 did when back home in Israel where they claimed they were there to document the event?

       Actually if you'd bothered to investigate the source materials (the new york times article) and not just skimmed all the shoddy-conclusions that truther sites make from it you'd see this is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere in the NYT article does anyone make any reference to "setting up cameras to document the event". It
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       however state that the accused were
       <em>
        photographing
       </em>
       the event. Photographing it much as the dozens of others who did the same. Nowhere in that article does it describe a concerted effort to set-up and film in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, their claim that the were simply "documenting" the event does not indicate any kind of knowledge or collusion. They were "documenting" the event just as dozens of reports and amateur photographers or a kid in a dorm room with a camera were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further eyewitness accounts do not indicate any foreknowledge and simply that people saw "some men filming" the event as it unfolded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing unique about these people documenting the event (as many others were) is that they were Israeli.

       First, those reports too are unconfirmed. What was said is "they appeared to be celebrating or cheering".  One of the accused said he was in tears and actually quite distraught.
      </p>

       Moreover the act of cheering itself doesn't indicate anything. It's a little crass but being crass isn't illegal.  They could have been saying "wooo!! shit blowing up! cool!!!" or they could have been saying "wooo! the western capitalist regime is being toppled!" or they could have being saying "wooo!  dead innocent people!" or the could have been saying "wooo! our plan worked!" or they could have been saying "wooo! they got the bad guys and we are safe!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know what their reactions were, nor can we make any inferrences as to why they acted that way. People act all kinds of strange ways following intense events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the day it happened we had some nice talks in class about what happened and what it meant and there was the unfortunate sentiment (usually from some edgy punk rock drop outs) that "Cool America finally got what they deserved" or "Glad they finally got a wakeup call".  And that's from people who have zero political affiliation other than "smoke weed on third period spare". It's unfortunate, but it doesn't mean anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's assume they were in fact cheering at the deaths of all those innocent people. So what? We live in a free and open society. They weren't inciting a riot or shouting Fire! In a crowded building.  Them cheering, assuming they in fact did so, does not implicate them in anything.

       So, I am slightly amused and slightly concerned that I can still remember,
       <strong>
        verbatim

       , some of the most important words of testimony that contradicts the narrative of (at least) the Pentagon attack on 9/11.

       And to my right, if I asked my wife who Norman Mineta was, I wouldn't get a correct guess in 1,000 years.

       People like you give me hope, James. No, really. I still remember his scratchy voice when he gave the testimony. Got the exact sound in my head.

       I just wrote you a complete meta text block about the positivity in life ... then my browser let me down. And now I feel discouraged to retype all that. How ironic ;).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, to make it short:
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it was very fascinating when I first realised all the trickery going on in the world, but it was also very painful. So who would want to be pushed into feeling that? We shouldn't try so hard to convince people, but pick them up where they are. Also we need to get that there is always just a very small number of experts on any topic, so it is very unlikely that we have some of them in our circles of friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all about empathy. Don't just try, but really think of yourself as being in your peer's position. I am sure we all can think of stuff they annoy us with and probably we annoy them at times ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the new age movement was completely controlled tavistock crap, but the only reason it got so popular is, because it had a point. After all we are just beings of resonance. All there is, is frequency. So at some point of our lives we made the decision to play the part of a, what we believe to be, positive frequency, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are endless interpretations of reality. The one thing we are trying to do here however is to contribute to something positive. So in the end, we just need to figure out how to be in equilibrium with ourselves. The rest comes naturally.

       Thanks Rick. Your post from earlier I meant to reply to but I drank at least another bottle of wine after I saw it and crawled into bed.

       Your words are more beautiful than you know. I've dug myself
       <em>
        deep
       </em>
       , lately, likely
       <em>
        too deep

       , and words like yours lift me up a little bit.

       I'm still drowning, but at least I know I have an audience and my activities and contributions have had an impact on at least someone.

       I'd be willing to bet that most of it was office supplies that were blown out of the building due to the force from the impact. Having a hard time believing that the passport was blown out from the INSIDE of the plane.

       Could be fake I suppose, although we have no real reason to doubt it, beyond conjecture and opinion. That is what you're getting at, that the story is fake, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But assuming it isn't fake, and we have no evidence to suggest otherwise, then that means the hijackers passport was not the only document that made it out unscathed. Not saying that that totally weakens any inside job theory, but it's just another thing that shouldn't really be used as actual evidence of anything untoward.

       Do me a favor. Watch a few videos of that second plane hitting the tower. Try a couple different newsfeeds to really let it sink in (ABC, FOX, NBC, whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a second, ignore that the second plane comes in at different angles/trajectories, sometimes the wings clip in and out behind buildings, and sometimes
       <em>
        the nose of the plane pops out the other side
       </em>
       , despite being made of aluminum and it hitting a 100+ steel reinforced skyscraper.
      </p>
      <p>

      <blockquote>

        it was flying at 500+ mph!

       Because Boeing 757s can't fly that fast at sea level anyway. They would literally break apart.

       what? So there were all kinds of multiple doctored feeds created? Is that what you're saying? Because none of this is true.

      <p>
       Yes they can. These sorts of aircraft are designed to maintain levels of stress to a considerable greater degree than their "safe" limits.  I don't recall there ever being a single incident of 767s breaking up due to overspeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       done is because it is potentially difficult and dangerous. Consequently, the people flying the planes were not terribly concerned with safety.

      <p>
       Yes. And small, soft debris survives large explosions all the time. We can see this in the piles of paper and other human belongings recovered. A silk scarf recovered unscathed from the
       <em>
        very bottom floor
       </em>
       . Stacks of paper. Identification cards and personal belongings from the people on the planes. Those sorts of things can and did survive.

       The fact that the impact did not structurally damage WTC, and that jet fuel burns 500°C too cool to even weaken steel.  And the perfectly symmetrical collapse of all 3 buildings that could only result from a controlled demolition.  The physics are there, and forbids everything that happened (assuming only a jet crash).

       "Inside job", I'm not entirely sure what that's supposed to mean, but if you want evidence of a conspiracy, the official story details one of the terrorist's passport falling from an exploding airplane and being recovered on the ground.  At the very least, that's pretty clear falsification of evidence.  Anybody who went along with that nonsense is complicit.

       the only reason one happened at all was pressure from victims families. who do they select to chair the commission? henry kissinger. how much do they budget for the investigation? less than a 30th of what they spent investigating clintons jewish blowjob.

       So, I am slightly amused and slightly concerned that I can still remember,
       <strong>
        verbatim
       </strong>
       , some of the most important words of testimony that contradicts the narrative of (at least) the Pentagon attack on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to my right, if I asked my wife who Norman Mineta was, I wouldn't get a correct guess in 1,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is why I am always depressed. If 2/3 of my house are like that, what hope do I have of changing anything on this fucking rock?
