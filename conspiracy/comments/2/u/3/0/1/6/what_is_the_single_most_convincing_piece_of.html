<p>The Israeli explosives were indeed found...set to annihilate the GW Bridge when they detonated. Police just barely defused it in time. Both the van with the explosives and the van carrying the dancing Israelis were owned by the same guy, Mossad agent Dominik Suter, who quickly fled back to Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually if you&#39;d bothered to investigate the source materials (the new york times article) and not just skimmed all the shoddy-conclusions that truther sites make from it you&#39;d see this is not the case.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the NYT article does anyone make any reference to &quot;setting up cameras to document the event&quot;. It <em>does</em> however state that the accused were <em>photographing</em> the event. Photographing it much as the dozens of others who did the same. Nowhere in that article does it describe a concerted effort to set-up and film in advance.</p>

<p>Later, their claim that the were simply &quot;documenting&quot; the event does not indicate any kind of knowledge or collusion. They were &quot;documenting&quot; the event just as dozens of reports and amateur photographers or a kid in a dorm room with a camera were.</p>

<p>Further eyewitness accounts do not indicate any foreknowledge and simply that people saw &quot;some men filming&quot; the event as it unfolded. </p>

<p>The only thing unique about these people documenting the event (as many others were) is that they were Israeli.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, those reports too are unconfirmed. What was said is &quot;they appeared to be celebrating or cheering&quot;.  One of the accused said he was in tears and actually quite distraught. </p>

<p>Moreover the act of cheering itself doesn&#39;t indicate anything. It&#39;s a little crass but being crass isn&#39;t illegal.  They could have been saying &quot;wooo!! shit blowing up! cool!!!&quot; or they could have been saying &quot;wooo! the western capitalist regime is being toppled!&quot; or they could have being saying &quot;wooo!  dead innocent people!&quot; or the could have been saying &quot;wooo! our plan worked!&quot; or they could have been saying &quot;wooo! they got the bad guys and we are safe!&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what their reactions were, nor can we make any inferrences as to why they acted that way. People act all kinds of strange ways following intense events. </p>

<p>I remember the day it happened we had some nice talks in class about what happened and what it meant and there was the unfortunate sentiment (usually from some edgy punk rock drop outs) that &quot;Cool America finally got what they deserved&quot; or &quot;Glad they finally got a wakeup call&quot;.  And that&#39;s from people who have zero political affiliation other than &quot;smoke weed on third period spare&quot;. It&#39;s unfortunate, but it doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s assume they were in fact cheering at the deaths of all those innocent people. So what? We live in a free and open society. They weren&#39;t inciting a riot or shouting Fire! In a crowded building.  Them cheering, assuming they in fact did so, does not implicate them in anything.</p>

<p>So, I am slightly amused and slightly concerned that I can still remember, <strong>verbatim</strong>, some of the most important words of testimony that contradicts the narrative of (at least) the Pentagon attack on 9/11.</p>

<p>And to my right, if I asked my wife who Norman Mineta was, I wouldn&#39;t get a correct guess in 1,000 years.</p>

<p>And this is why I am always depressed. If 2/3 of my house are like that, what hope do I have of changing anything on this fucking rock?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like you give me hope, James. No, really. I still remember his scratchy voice when he gave the testimony. Got the exact sound in my head.</p>

<p>I just wrote you a complete meta text block about the positivity in life ... then my browser let me down. And now I feel discouraged to retype all that. How ironic ;).</p>

<p>Anyway, to make it short:</p>

<p>To me it was very fascinating when I first realised all the trickery going on in the world, but it was also very painful. So who would want to be pushed into feeling that? We shouldn&#39;t try so hard to convince people, but pick them up where they are. Also we need to get that there is always just a very small number of experts on any topic, so it is very unlikely that we have some of them in our circles of friends and family.</p>

<p>It is all about empathy. Don&#39;t just try, but really think of yourself as being in your peer&#39;s position. I am sure we all can think of stuff they annoy us with and probably we annoy them at times ...</p>

<p>I believe the new age movement was completely controlled tavistock crap, but the only reason it got so popular is, because it had a point. After all we are just beings of resonance. All there is, is frequency. So at some point of our lives we made the decision to play the part of a, what we believe to be, positive frequency, right?</p>

<p>There are endless interpretations of reality. The one thing we are trying to do here however is to contribute to something positive. So in the end, we just need to figure out how to be in equilibrium with ourselves. The rest comes naturally.</p>

<p>(Not half as beautiful as my first attempt, but anyway.)</p>

<p>Edit- If I&#39;m getting downvoted, might as well go hard.</p>

<p>This might be the most stupid proof of the 9/11 conspiracy I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>WTC 7, yup hinky.</p>

<p>28 pages, kind of want to read them.</p>

<p>The billions made by our admin through their cronies?  Suspicious for sure.</p>

<p>No usable footage from gas stations or hotels?  That&#39;s just dumb.</p>

<p>what? So there were all kinds of multiple doctored feeds created? Is that what you&#39;re saying? Because none of this is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because Boeing 757s can&#39;t fly that fast at sea level anyway. They would literally break apart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes they can. These sorts of aircraft are designed to maintain levels of stress to a considerable greater degree than their &quot;safe&quot; limits.  I don&#39;t recall there ever being a single incident of 767s breaking up due to overspeed.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s <em>not</em> done is because it is potentially difficult and dangerous. Consequently, the people flying the planes were not terribly concerned with safety.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I want you to watch is that fucking fireball. And ask yourself:
Could a plastic/paper passport survive that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And small, soft debris survives large explosions all the time. We can see this in the piles of paper and other human belongings recovered. A silk scarf recovered unscathed from the <em>very bottom floor</em>. Stacks of paper. Identification cards and personal belongings from the people on the planes. Those sorts of things can and did survive.</p>

<p>Of course the order still stands. Have you heard anything to the contrary?</p>

<p>So, I am slightly amused and slightly concerned that I can still remember, <strong>verbatim</strong>, some of the most important words of testimony that contradicts the narrative of (at least) the Pentagon attack on 9/11.</p>

<p>And to my right, if I asked my wife who Norman Mineta was, I wouldn&#39;t get a correct guess in 1,000 years.</p>

<p>And this is why I am always depressed. If 2/3 of my house are like that, what hope do I have of changing anything on this fucking rock?</p>
