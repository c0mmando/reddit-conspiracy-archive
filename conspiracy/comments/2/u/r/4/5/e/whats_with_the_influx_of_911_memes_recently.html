    <div class="md"><p>i actually think it&#39;s a more outspoken concept in general. the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of 9/11 being an inside job was something that should not/could not be discussed if you were in NYC or North Jersey. More recently I&#39;ve seen propaganda pushing people to ask questions about what actually happened. The most recent occurrence was a giant video ad on the corner by Port Authority Bus Terminal that was saying It was an Inside Job. And showing videos and facts.. This ad wasn&#39;t a stand alone one either, it shared screen time with promotion of Broadway Shows. I thought it was crazy at the time, but I really think people are waking up to this concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you see any on reddit that you can link? I deleted my facebook account recently.</p>

<p>I do have a lot to say about such a situation:</p>

<p>A movement of the public acknowledging that 9/11 was a false flag attack is actually a really volatile situation. We should be careful not to seek vengeance against government past and present should this movement actually come to fruition.</p>

<p>The actions of NATO are only representative of what we as people allowed them to become (yes, even you and me at some level). The point is that blame and anger will only lead to more blame and anger. Anger leads to a desire for vengeance on those we blame, and possibly violence which will only lead to more violence.</p>

<p>If we are to evolve as a species we ALL have to be willing to admit we are all capable of evil, and therefore have to learn to share the responsibility of that evil. We all allowed this to happen, those of us on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are probably the least guilty... but placing blame is the most useless human emotion of them all. </p>

<p>There is a version of America that represents what everyone on this planet really wants, it only existed for fleeting moments in history. The best way to honor those who died on 9/11 and it&#39;s resulting wars would be to admit that we as a species are flawed, and that every single man and woman shares responsibility for the violence in our world.</p>

<p>You personally may have not flown those planes into those towers, and you personally may not have worked as a drone operator killing innocents in the middle east. But we all either let ourselves live in the delusion, or at the very least let others do the same.</p>

<p>Nobody can deny that evil is most often created during childhood, and this gets to the essence of our problems. We breed evil, and then blame that evil for it&#39;s own existence. ISIS is most likely full of children who grew up during the Iraq war, and all western nations allowed it to happen. These people that run our government are simply damaged souls that were allow to float to the top of the madness we are all responsible for.</p>

<p>Many would seek public humiliation, and capital punishment. This would only serve to prove we are not worthy of peace, as we can&#39;t even control our emotions long enough to see that these people are only products of such ugliness. </p>

<p>This is what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is about, it&#39;s about ending the insanity that grips the world. If we have sociopaths running our countries, then we have none to blame other than ourselves. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not religious, but I have always believed the bible quote &quot;Those who live by the sword, die by the sword&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little outside perspective here. In my country (western world, free democracy, NATO ally), you will often hear &quot;Das war&#39;n die Amis doch selber!&quot; - that was the Amis themselves - from people not so familiar with the research done by what <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a> calls the &quot;Rational Truth Movement&quot;, who sometimes just feel towers shouldn&#39;t desintegrate from top to bottom or want to express their stupid antiamericanism (yes, that&#39;s a word).</p>

<p>They usually do not make a distinction between the U.S. government, or even the deep/shadow government or rogue elements of the CIA and the American people. Not everyone will see the general public as much a victim of lies and deceit and media manipulation, and the guilt will be a collective one - that&#39;s what maybe more Americans should be aware of, unless they are prepared to stand up to the questions their grandchildren will ask them &quot;Today at school we learned 9/11 was a false flag attack and jet fuel does not melt steel beams, how could you allow the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the Patriot Act to happen?&quot;, as happened to German grandparents five decades after WW2, just in a slightly different context.</p>

<p>Only I&#39;d rather not have my children and grandchildren ask me that. I&#39;d rather it be us demanding answers <em>now</em>, to stem the tide of interventionism and death we have been exporting for so long. It is truly tragic and like good little war mongers, we don&#39;t <em>like to think about it</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t either. But I do. Because nobody else is. And that weight is heavy sometimes, and it&#39;s important to vent and talk things out, because dwelling on conspiracy and shadow government shit day after day wears on your and there&#39;s only so Mich before you say FUCK IT and travel down two paths:</p>

<p>You take a left, which loops around and brings you back from whence you came. This was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7BuQFUhsRM">Cypher&#39;s solution</a>.</p>

<p>Or you take a right, and choose to stop bitching and start making changes. This is our solution.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important point, which is painfully obvious to me. Just look at how easily Russian civilians feed into Russian propaganda, and how easily western civilians feed into NATO propaganda.</p>

<p>You try to tell people there&#39;s no good guys and bad guys, but they just call you a &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot;. If there are good guys and bad guys, the bad guys are politicians and the good guys are the average citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations, Come7rain. Nobody&#39;s gonna beat this today. Top notch.</p>

<p>9/11 is <em>the issue</em>, IMO. It split this country into another 1%/99% paradigm (although I have no real idea how big the Rational Truth Movememt, which you described actually is. As far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s pretty much the 30-50 if you here) where you either believe the Official Version™ or you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t really admit you&#39;re in this minority with out serious social consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Rational Truth Movement&quot; is a good way to describe something like this, and it may have just started today. The links between 9/11 and Saudi Arabia are going to have light bulbs in people&#39;s heads starting to flicker.</p>

<p>It gets really hard to believe both the CIA and FBI had no idea Saudi Arabia was involved with Al-Qaeda, even for those with brains which have been thoroughly washed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point and I agree at a certain extent. But you miss something,  the 9/11, is the living proof of the failure of the Western political system. I mean yes violence is congenital,  but we have to learn a lesson from it. The world we live in today is a decaying world and we need to change it. I feel what you are saying is just an excuse, that doesn&#39;t point to  the problem. I understand that a mainstream knowledge of the government actions will create anarchy,  and this  should be contained. But we need to learn from it we need to start to questioning democracy
,  the system and change it. Idk if I was clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also a glaring indicator, the elephant in the room bigger than any other, of the failure of the media and/or the level of control The Permanent Establishment holds over the media. Part of the reason the  &quot;Truth&quot; -- whatever it is, I&#39;m not sure, it&#39;s bad but I&#39;m not sure how bad -- is so dangerous is because it doesn&#39;t just take down politicians, it takes down journalism. The twin towers we should be able to trust to look out for our best interests, you might say. And mutually assured destruction, so the lie(s) continue.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s coming. I feel like they&#39;re almost softening us up for it. More and more people I talk to are willing to listen now, there&#39;s almost enough distance. There are certainly forces that do not want Jeb Bush to be president, and I suspect that will be the ultimate catalyst for exposure. Because if Jeb gets elected, I&#39;m pretty sure that means we&#39;re just about to Game Over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there will be chaos and lot&#39;s of changes, but if you are suggesting violence will be necessary then you should check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC3L8QaxqEGUiBC252GHy3w">Stefan Molyneux&#39;s videos</a> on the subject (he&#39;s essentially a very well spoken philosopher with a youtube channel).

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I don&#39;t agree with this at all. The whole &quot;collective guilt&quot; thing, for the actions that were demonstrably the result of the policies of a very small group of people, is not right IMO. The small groups of people using social engineering and incredibly advanced methods of brainwashing cannot be compared to the average person, the 9-5 joe. And it&#39;s not like people haven&#39;t <em>tried</em> to not allow these policies to go through, before the Iraq war we saw the largest demonstrations in US history in the streets, did it stop it? No. </p>

<p>You know how America became free, at least for a little bit? Revolutionary war, against the British. And the founding fathers tried to keep the bankers from gaining control, but inevitably, inexorably, they did. They have become masters of the universe through amazing deception and manipulation of world systems, laws, government, etc, and if we have a feel good moment of forgiveness, we will just slip back to where we were before we admitted their crimes. </p>

<p>What we need is AWARENESS, of ourselves, and our capacity for evil, but also of the driving forces behind world events, and have the population become militant against manipulation. We need people to turn off their tv&#39;s in disgust, to abjectly refure to repay usurious loans, to demand a non-debt based monetary system, to reject apartheid policies wherever they may emerge. </p>

<p>We can forgive in our hearts those that have succumbed to evil, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we cannot also incarcerate and enact vengeance. Vengeance is the right of the one who has been wronged, I believe no one can deny them that. And in this case, it is humanity as a whole that has been wronged and denied our birthright - the ability to live free on the planet on which we were born. </p>
