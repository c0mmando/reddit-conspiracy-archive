        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>TL;DR: Living in such a world depresses me. Does it depress you?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always believed that everybody is equal and that they can all strive to greatness, regardless of the cards they are dealt with at birth.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s like that giant &quot;g&quot; word (government) is holding us back. Greed and corruption are holding us back, too, and that&#39;s just scary, y&#39;know? Knowing that your life can be bought in seconds by some white guy sitting comfortably in a deluxe office chair made by angels and impoverished children or something expensive like that. A few words said or written and poof, you and your family have never existed.</p>

<p>I was studying biology in high school (in the US) one day when we came across the topic of overpopulation. One student asked, &quot;Woah, so if it&#39;s like that for X species to pretty much die off at a certain point even though they were at their peak, what&#39;s going to happen to us?&quot; And somebody else responded, &quot;We&#39;re probably going to kill each other off before nature does anything to us.&quot; Everybody laughed, but shit, that made me nervous. That&#39;s been in the back of my mind ever since.</p>

<p>I moved to Mexico when I turned 16 and continued my HS studies there. In our social studies class, we were talking about our government and acting out a scenario where there was a social problem we needed to solve (4 people in the class were government officials, 2 were representatives for the rest of the class, which was the public). Solutions were brought forth to the representatives by the public so they could tell the government officials to do some shit to solve the problems, but after the results were given to the officials and they passed the fake laws, the public was not happy with the outcome. It turns out that most of them hadn&#39;t even participated in the skit, which means that the public didn&#39;t even express their thoughts properly to the representatives, leading to outcomes that were not favored.</p>

<p>After we expressed our concerns with the outcome, our teacher asked us,&quot;Do you think our government is shit? Do we deserve the government we have?&quot; We replied with the obvious &#39;no&#39; (because, fuck, we live in Mexico) and that we need a better system. He laughed and then said, &quot;You know what? We <em>deserve</em> this shitty government. We deserve it because we as the public won&#39;t even try to solve the problems we have. After all, you guys didn&#39;t even think it was worth participating.&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s always in the back of my mind, too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary to know how much you don&#39;t know about your life and the things that surround you. How much information is hidden from you. How easily a Ferguson 2.0 can happen. An Ayotzinapa 2.0. How many shitty people have power. How we as a public don&#39;t open our eyes and do something about it. How even if we did do something about it, our little rebellion could be nipped in the bud by Day 1. How all of these problems won&#39;t be solved until we as a society can learn to rethink our way of thinking, because even if our world becomes a Nirvana, as long as we still have greed in our hearts, we&#39;ll be fighting World War XI not long after.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR (X2): People suck. Refer to TL;DR #1.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Living in such a world depresses me. Does it depress you?</strong></p>

<p>Fuck yeah it does. But as a few people, namely <a href="/u/strokethekitty">/u/strokethekitty</a> told me yesterday, it doesn&#39;t really matter if you think the end goal (or your ultimate success) seems impossible - it&#39;s the journey that counts and every second you are crippled by anxiety and hopelessness you&#39;re exactly that: <em>crippled</em>. You&#39;re broken, bro, and you&#39;re no longer a help to <em>The Cause</em> in that type of mindset.</p>

<p>So you gotta blow past it. Easier said than done - trust me - I&#39;m digging myself out of a 6-8 month hole while I&#39;m typing this and I feel monumentally better than I did 24 hours ago.</p>

<p>Still stressed about most things. But once you realize that&#39;s <em>how you&#39;re being controlled</em>, you eventually compartmentalize it out and stop giving a shit about things that don&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the part when our Narrator in Fight Club starts losing it a bit too much and starts showing up once in a while with a black eye. We&#39;re fighting with each other here and with ourselves every day demanding sources, fighting brigades and trolls, of course that&#39;s gonna leave a dent or two every once in awhile.</p>

<p>But realize that the reason you&#39;re here isn&#39;t some pie-in-the-sky Hollywood ending - because we both know that only happens in the movies, and it happens in the movies <em>to make you think it happens IRL</em> (Holy Circular Logic, Batman).</p>

<p>We&#39;re all in this together. And we&#39;re gonna come close to making some noise in the next year.</p>

<p>Because a lot of us are now OK showing up to work with some blood on our collar.</p>

<p>And if you remember - that&#39;s when Act II began with Cornelius/Travis/Jack/The Narrator anyway. So onward I say! And let us see what is to come and at the very least, have our eyes open and hearts ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;m not here to preach to anybody, but I have to say that I &quot;woke up&quot; a few months ago and went through a severely depressed and anxious period feeling helpless, and not sure what to do. </p>

<p>One rainy Sunday morning I woke up and just felt like &quot;I gotta get out of here, be with people, people who aren&#39;t too fucked up,&quot; and I walked literally one block up the street to the church in my neighborhood. Just to be around people.</p>

<p>They turned out to be nice people. Good people. Not that smartest, mostly older than me, not a lot of attractive faces or bodies, I&#39;d guess few even make middle class. </p>

<p>But they were good people. Generally happy. They were welcoming. Nobody pressured me about anything. Since then, I&#39;ve been going back, week after week, and while I don&#39;t agree with everything they say, I mostly keep my mouth shut and just enjoy hanging out with good people, people who aren&#39;t hopeless or feel defeated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a Christian church, but I&#39;ve been to lousy, greedy, intolerant, status-oriented Christian churches, too. I don&#39;t think Christianity is the only way off this planet, if there had been a Buddhist temple up the street I would have gone to that.</p>

<p>But if you hang out in this space for any length of time, you learn that the Secret(s) we&#39;re all trying to get awareness and knowledge about, the deeper you dig, the more it becomes obvious there are things going on far outside the dimensions we live in and can perceive. There are either spiritual forces or some kind of advanced life form, or something beyond the human experience. </p>

<p>Apparently there are ways to channel this supernatural experience through the human experience, but from everything I&#39;ve seen and experienced, it can quite often fuck you up severely, mentally. Maybe some people can handle it, but probably not me.</p>

<p>So all I&#39;m saying is, really, don&#39;t isolate yourself. Find other good people. Bounce from a church to a synogogue or a mosque or a Hindu or Buddhist temple, I&#39;m not going to tell you where might work for you. But good people do gravitate to houses of faith -- not only there, maybe at your local homeless shelter or food bank or somewhere else, but I do believe the spiritual element is important -- and if you shop around you will likely find a collection of souls who will help you feel less alone.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. Again, I&#39;m not trying to preach. I can only tell you what&#39;s worked for me. Please come back and let us know what&#39;s worked for you. Because life should not be about despair. There&#39;s more  it than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about religion. It&#39;s about relations. Religion has no place in today&#39;s society, for it breeds contempt, profiling and judging. Relations however produces trust, love and companionship. I can believe in God but as soon as I call it religion there&#39;s a pile of laws I have to keep. If I call it a relationship there is none. Same with people, we have to stick together, like minded with different ideas but all reaching for the same goal. Relationships are paramount, not arguing over the crap we are getting force fed daily, because then our ideas become a religion. <em>go easy on me, I&#39;m new</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been getting any of the negative stuff you&#39;re saying from the church I&#39;ve been attending. They&#39;ve all been really cool and accepting. Some places of worship do so from a starting point of faith, not religion. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve not seen that in any place of worship you&#39;ve yet attended, and I will admit to attending many in my life where I could sense no such spirit as well. That&#39;s why this place has been such a relief and, dare I say it, Godsend.  </p>

Now I wouldn&#39;t go around telling everyone to kill themselves, of course, but after going through that process/not dying I learned each one of us puts ourselves into our own conscious situations. Our &quot;cards&quot;, if you will, are all shuffled differently. We will all react a different way to different situations, but that&#39;s the beauty of it. You can chose to obsess over the problems of the world, or you can accept it&#39;s presence and assess yourself- just as you are right now- and act upon the positive and beautiful things that make us human (i.e. taking opportunities, traveling, loving yourself).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A buddhist might say: &quot;Life is suffering. Suffering is caused by desire.&quot;</p>

<p>For most people on the planet it&#39;s a real struggle. If you have a roof over your head and food on the table, you&#39;re better off than most. </p>

<p>Me? I try to take a two pronged approach. I actually try to cultivate desire; I build on my desire and passion until it becomes a raging bonfire, burning inside of me. I use that desire to motivate myself and follow my passion. If I encounter a failure along the way, then I invoke the Buddhist philosophy: depression is in my mind alone. It is caused because I do not live in the world I desire. I  have tried to change the world and failed; now is the time to remember that the desire is a game; I played that game as if it was a matter of life and death (It is! It IS!) but in this moment it becomes just a game. If it is just a game, this small loss is trivial. I get a chance to wake up tomorrow and play another game. I can choose to focus on thoughts that depress me, or I can choose to focus on the good and the beauty which surrounds me. Our ability to make change in the world is greatest within our sphere of influence, and the best place to start is with ourselves. In this moment, I choose the good; I choose the beauty, and with my focus I make the world a better place. Coming from a place of good and beauty, I can connect with those I love, share it with them, and make their world better too.</p>

<p>Learn to enjoy what you have; focus on the good. Work to change the bad. If things don&#39;t always go your way, learn to accept that. </p>

<p>We are being fed a dream by the media: work hard, be successful, get a house, a shiny car and a partner, make babies. The reality is that sometimes no matter how hard you work it all falls apart, sometimes for reasons outside of our control. Make sure that your dreams really are YOUR dreams. Know thyself, first and foremost: the path forward becomes clear.</p>

<p>the only time i had negativity issues was not long after i awoke (911 was my redpill, many years post) looking around at all the people asleep next to me, wanting to wake them up too. the journey to realizing that you can&#39;t is rough but it passes. you do what you can, when you can as opportunities arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You know what strike me most, is that I would like to try and do something, present myself at councils and read nice speechs and try to wake up officials, but if i dont present myself at my 8-5 5 days a week job, who will pay my bills? not the officials... So in order to help society i need to live on welfare or live in the street, if i do this, what credibility will I have in front the council, also if i do not want to leave my job to help society, i need to take all my days off for that, im left with nothing as a good choice. also my work is indeed for governement and we are open at the same time other goverment services etc, are open so its impossible for me to meet anyone in business days and when its not business days its closed, they make sure to close at 4PM everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the system is rigged in this way too.</p>

<p>thats why ive been saying t his for years.</p>

<p>everything should be open 7 days a week until 9PM every day, but not everyone work 7 days, we have offdays but when im off someone else take my seat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;m not here to preach to anybody, but I have to say that I &quot;woke up&quot; a few months ago and went through a severely depressed and anxious period feeling helpless, and not sure what to do. </p>

<p>One rainy Sunday morning I woke up and just felt like &quot;I gotta get out of here, be with people, people who aren&#39;t too fucked up,&quot; and I walked literally one block up the street to the church in my neighborhood. Just to be around people.</p>

<p>They turned out to be nice people. Good people. Not that smartest, mostly older than me, not a lot of attractive faces or bodies, I&#39;d guess few even make middle class. </p>

<p>But they were good people. Generally happy. They were welcoming. Nobody pressured me about anything. Since then, I&#39;ve been going back, week after week, and while I don&#39;t agree with everything they say, I mostly keep my mouth shut and just enjoy hanging out with good people, people who aren&#39;t hopeless or feel defeated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a Christian church, but I&#39;ve been to lousy, greedy, intolerant, status-oriented Christian churches, too. I don&#39;t think Christianity is the only way off this planet, if there had been a Buddhist temple up the street I would have gone to that.</p>

<p>But if you hang out in this space for any length of time, you learn that the Secret(s) we&#39;re all trying to get awareness and knowledge about, the deeper you dig, the more it becomes obvious there are things going on far outside the dimensions we live in and can perceive. There are either spiritual forces or some kind of advanced life form, or something beyond the human experience. </p>

<p>Apparently there are ways to channel this supernatural experience through the human experience, but from everything I&#39;ve seen and experienced, it can quite often fuck you up severely, mentally. Maybe some people can handle it, but probably not me.</p>

<p>So all I&#39;m saying is, really, don&#39;t isolate yourself. Find other good people. Bounce from a church to a synogogue or a mosque or a Hindu or Buddhist temple, I&#39;m not going to tell you where might work for you. But good people do gravitate to houses of faith -- not only there, maybe at your local homeless shelter or food bank or somewhere else, but I do believe the spiritual element is important -- and if you shop around you will likely find a collection of souls who will help you feel less alone.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. Again, I&#39;m not trying to preach. I can only tell you what&#39;s worked for me. Please come back and let us know what&#39;s worked for you. Because life should not be about despair. There&#39;s more  it than that.</p>
