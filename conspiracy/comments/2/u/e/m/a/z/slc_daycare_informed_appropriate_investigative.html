And it might not mean hiring more but structuring people to come in at different times or people having breaks at different times or not taking the day off. Yes because of people on Reddit blowing things out of proportion and going onto the property taking pics and looking under tarps. That is creepy to deal with when you have to watch children</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look through my history on the SLC posts you will see I was warning people of about the legalities and implications on stalking a daycare. I did tell them of that people were probably just trolling r/conspiracy into thinking that there was some shady business going on. Either way it is a daycare and alerting someone for the safety of kids is the right choice to make. Instead of sitting here watching something escalate and make stupid comments I decided to do something.</p>
