        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of the most interesting pieces of evidence for a 9/11 conspiracy are circumstantial and financial.  They have to do with Project Hammer,  one of president Bush I&#39;s first orders as president,  secret from congress and funded by $240 billion in U.S. government securities purchased from cantor Fitzgerald, which expired on September 12, 2001. </p>

<p>A top secret CIA/DoD project created  in 1989 to destroy the soviet union through asymmetrical warfare --- essentially a continuation of the tactics which had successfully driven the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the Reagan years: the Arab mujahadeen + expensive arms race + financial piracy. The Soviet union quickly fell apart abd the project was diverted for other ends.  More on that later. </p>

<p>The biggest problem at the beginning was the funding.   Since bank records are held on computers with backups now,  it is a lot harder to fudge the numbers,  even when you are as close to the source as the Pentagon budget office. In the 80s, illegal covert operations were funded with all kinds of criminal activity--- most famously drug money ( look up Michael Ruppert &amp; the crack epidemic in L.A., and  Oliver north &amp; Iran -contra). </p>

<p>They got caught doing that under Reagan, so the next project had to be smarter, Bigger &amp; badder. And it was.  But it still failed massively,  so read on.  </p>

<p>First, the exact spot where the plane impacted the Pentagon was  the administrative office, specifically the budget analysts office, (Resources Center Washington -- lost 34 of 45 employees) which had announced late the previous afternoon -- on September 10 -- that a vast sum of money was unaccounted for in the DoD budget ($2.3 trillion). meaning they had spent it,  but it wasn&#39;t in the budget. </p>

<p>So where did the money come from and How do you hide that kind of money?  </p>

<p>the section of the Pentagon impacted was the first of the 5 &#39;wedges&#39; that make up the Pentagon to undergo a major renovation, completed in 2000. It was renovated to house the budget analysts office &amp; all hard copy budget records  in the new administrative control center on the first floor of the outside rim of wedge one with windows  on the parking lot facing interstate 395. The backups were in a facility in building seven of the world trade center.  </p>

<p>If the records had survived they might have shown that the missing billions from  several large government securities brokers in New York.  CantorFitzgerald was the  largest and the first brokerage to offer government securities electronicly beginning in 1979, and it is one of 22 suppliers for the federal reserve. it&#39;s main offices were on the 101st-105th floor and it&#39;s computer backups were in building seven.  both were destroyed and two thirds of its work force killed.  many brokerages in the world trade center fit similar profile.  </p>

<p>Here is a link about insider trading on 9/11.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/sept11/stockputs.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/sept11/stockputs.html</a></p>

<p>this was the subject of the largest SEC investigation in U.S. history,  but the report was never released and then it was destroyed.  </p>

<p>in the aftermath of what happened,  the SEC (Securities and exchange commission) stopped enforcing regulations on clearing government securities , meaning you could cash out without the normal identification and documentation process.  This is the only time in history the SEC has used this &#39;emergency power&#39; granted to it in 1934.</p>

<p>So back to project hammer.  Funded by an unlimited government checkbook good until September 12, 2001, it is unknown where all the money went. We can only speculate for now.  More info: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is another one of those article where I read it and wonder if this information is out there, why do I only read about it on r/conspiracy? How come the MSM or even Russia Today reported on this, dug deeper, compiled the source evidence and actually done something with this information? It seems like at this point, I have a fairly good idea what really happened on 9/11 along with everything that occurred to get us there and everything after so how come this hasn&#39;t been looked into by anyone with the power and authority to do something about it? Well, I think we all know the answer but this article covers plenty of the means and motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just curious. I don&#39;t mean to be rude in any way. Are Americans ever going to stop talking about 911 and finally do something about it? Last I heard Americans were the most armed country in the world. It&#39;s not like the government has Americans under their thumb the way the British and Canadian governments do. Getting a handgun in Canada or the UK is a seriously difficult operation but even 6 year old American kids find guns to take to school. Not to mention the 50 cal sniper rifles and automatic weapons that Americans can gain access too. I know fully automatic weapons aren&#39;t legal but any gunsmith can modify a semi-auto to full auto. Why aren&#39;t Americans willing to revolt against a corrupt and tyrannical government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think it&#39;s because a good majority of the people don&#39;t see a problem. When you say &quot;are American&#39;s ever going to stop talking about 911..&quot; that&#39;s a mindset I find myself in but realize it&#39;s not too true. I browse this subreddit and I start to think that the majority of people must be feeling the same way (9/11 was a false flag, we&#39;re heading/in a police state) but go back to Facebook and see the same ridiculous Fox news posts or people bashing these ideas, or idolizing Chris Kyle.</p>

<p>I honestly thought that when Snowden released the info he did, people would finally wake up in large. I think the fact that everyone remained docile answers your last question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem as I see it with Americans is the fact that they still believe in this idea of American-exceptionalism and its actually taught as a legitimate theory in universities - although to be fair its one of many.</p>

<p>It basically rests on the foundation that American political systems, institutions and &#39;culture&#39; is one that &#39;truly&#39; seeks a freedom-loving inherent liberty based system which the people can strive. A lot of this is backed by appending the word &#39;free&#39; to whatever it is that&#39;s political ie: free-market, free-elections, free-press; the truth seeker would show these as obviously manipulated. </p>

<p>In fact, its funny how much this propaganda is pushed even in academia. Anyone know this guy? : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama</a></p>

<p>Hes fucking insane. He really buys into the idea that American style democracy and free market is the last institution and style of government the WORLD will ever see because we beat the game - its what everyone was trying to achieve. What the worlds powers were attempting to get at since the very beginning. His work can be read - &quot;The end of History&quot; if anyone wants to read it. Its compelling within the propaganda paradigm, but once you have alternative narratives, its complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Fukuyama, interestingly enough, was actually one of the prominent think tank members of PNAC - the guys who essentially said we should increase military spending, we need to secure energy reserves, we need a &#39;pearl harbor style attack on us&#39;, we could use biological weapons as a politically viable tool, etc, and which was largely made up of the former Bush administration: </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a></p>

<p>What is funny, however, is that Fukuyama some years later distanced himself from PNAC and disavowed anything they had to say. Basically, he did a 180 on his political ideology since his infamous PNAC says: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/31/comment.usa">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/31/comment.usa</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/fukuyama_francis">http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/fukuyama_francis</a></p>

<p>Interesting what happens to these guys before and after. Fukuyama was convinced of the &#39;realities&#39; when he was talking his good shit, but when he saw that it was lies and deception he quickly reformed his ideas. </p>

<p>So even with the propaganda narrative, you have disobedience at a certain level. Will Americans stop talking about 911 in the sense that they need to engage in political action to rectify it? Possibly. But unfortunately that day when the critical mass was all gung-ho is long gone and time cannot be reset. It almost does not matter anymore.</p>
