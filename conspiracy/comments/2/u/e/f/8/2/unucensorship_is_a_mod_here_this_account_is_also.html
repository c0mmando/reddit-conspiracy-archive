    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you&#39;re asking?</p>

<p>If you want to use the nucensorship bot, add <a href="/u/nucensorship">/u/nucensorship</a> as a moderator and message cojoco.</p>

<p>If you are asking about what I think about this particular submission:</p>

<p>I really try to avoid following the personality dramas on reddit, I&#39;m vaguely aware that <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a> is a moderator of some large subs.  I have no idea what your beef with him is or how legit it is.  I&#39;m not gonna get into that at all.</p>

<p>In general terms, assuming you have a valid beef with this user:</p>

<p>Association doesn&#39;t imply guilt, but it reasonably raises suspicion sometimes.  I take no offense at this post as a mod here or author of the revamped uncensorship <a href="/u/nucensorship">/u/nucensorship</a> bot.</p>

<p>cojoco operates the nucensorship account.  <a href="/u/sunshine-x">/u/sunshine-x</a> operated the now shadowbanned <a href="/u/uncensorship">/u/uncensorship</a> account.</p>

<p>Moderators add the bot without any permissions at all.  It&#39;s just an observer that is given privileged access to the moderation log of the subreddit it &#39;moderates&#39;.</p>

<p>The bot posts reports to <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a></p>

<p>Once the bot posts them there, the moderators of the original sub have no direct control over those reports unless they also moderate <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a></p>

<p>There have been no cases that I&#39;m aware of where bipolar or anyone else has ever requested that we remove a report for anything other than a <a href="/rules">reddit rule violation</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what would happen if someone did request that, but I doubt we&#39;d ever remove a report that didn&#39;t violate reddit&#39;s overall rules and wasn&#39;t deleted by the original OP.</p>

<p>And if we did, I&#39;d probably step down as a mod there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking personally, not for the mod team here:</p>

<p>I think the concept of Limited Hangouts is something that absolutely needs more exposure.</p>

<p>Why is the header so huge?  I really don&#39;t like the css.  I highly recommend <a href="/r/edurne">/r/edurne</a> if you don&#39;t want to deal with CSS much and still want to get creative with your subreddit style.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t think Snowden is a limited hangout.</p>

<p>Here is a clear example of what I think was a clear and blatant example of a surveillance related limited hangout that is deserving of more investigation and exposure.</p>

<p>The 2006? story in the New York Times that broke about the &quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program&quot; or TSP this was the public&#39;s first introduction to the idea of &quot;metadata&quot;.</p>

<p>This story landed at almost the exact same time that Mark Klein was testifying that AT&amp;T split fiber optic connections into NSA controlled rooms located at backbone internet locations across the nation, and specifically San Francisco room 641a.</p>

<p>A fiber split does not metadata make.  A fiber split is absolutely everything.  You can&#39;t tell metadata from content when you are beam splitting or relaying light over fiber optic cables.</p>

<p>A fiber split allows for no logic.  It&#39;s the whole shebang, into a NSA controlled room.  Documented and testified to under oath by a meek and aging engineer.</p>

<p>But the NYT drops a story on phone call metadata and that&#39;s what everyone talks about.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met Mark Klein, I believe him with ever fiber of my being.  He&#39;s a man who cares for his country and was sad to see what it had become.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting Snowden, and I doubt I ever will.</p>

<p>But I personally have no reason to disbelieve anything he says.  I&#39;ve always been a fan of Glenn Greenwald since around the same timeframe.</p>

<p>Having a decent background in computer security, and programming I fully believe Snowden is the real deal.  </p>

<p>And speaking from experience in the public tech sector, It&#39;s not that unusual for an IT contractor to have more information access that one might expect.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve subbed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I avoid getting into judging people&#39;s reddit character as much as possible.</p>

<p>To be honest I just completely glossed over usernames and focused on the links and stories until I noticed links and stories and domains disappearing.  Then I started asking questions, getting to know who was who and such, and getting into pointless slap fights.</p>

<p>Redditors are meant to be anonymous, this is enshrined in the rules of the site.  How can you effectively judge the character of someone who is supposedly anonymous?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t.  You can only judge their actions, and observable facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the government had prior knowledge that the attacks would take place.</p>

<p>The governments fetishism with surveillance didn&#39;t start with 9/11.  See the testimony of the Qwest CEO who got convicted of insider trading for refusing to go along with the type of cooperation that AT&amp;T is documented to have done.</p>

<p>The government&#39;s reactionary response to the attacks was predictable and unfortunate.  The first reaction of government is to grab more power; never let a good crisis go to waste.</p>

<p>In my mind, given how the government reacted after the attacks, whether or not it had a hand in them hardly matters to me.</p>

<p>Even if you accept government condoned sequence of events our governments actions were absurd and unacceptable to a free society.</p>

<p>Even if you think 911 was a false flag, I would say that it is counter productive to argue that it was.  People get defensive to any sort of major shift in thinking/trust like that.  It shuts off logic.</p>

<p>Post 9/11 US Govt behavior is every bit as damning as a false flag attack would be in my opinion; so why bother?</p>

<p>So to answer the first:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care, and neither does anyone else.  Like it or not; that&#39;s the way it is.  Harping on it will only serve to discredit yourself in the minds of others.</p>

<p>And regarding Hastings.</p>

<p>It seems exceedingly suspicious to me, did Mercedes ever make a statement on that whole thing?</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know enough to say yes or no, murder is a serious charge.</p>

<p>There is plenty enough reason to oppose government without having to get into speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty obvious that this thread, and this sub have been taken over by people who will censor anything they see fit as damaging.  The SLC day care is a perfect example.  The mods here bent over and took it in the ass when their masters,  or supposedly the admins made them take it down. </p>

<p>Until I see a message from an admin saying to take it down,  I&#39;m leaning more towards select mods,  <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a> at the top of my list,  took it down without a mod even being involved.</p>

<p>This sub has been compromised by the BipolarBear&#39;s, and SovereignMan&#39;s of Reddit. The question is what are WE going to do about it? </p>

<p>Now sit back and watch this comment and this post get down voted and buried into the &quot;controversial&quot; section,  just like all posts related to Israel and vaccines are on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Poiluv, could you try to make a worthwhile contribution to this subreddit, instead of your constant stream of disruptive and antagonistic bullshit? Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you&#39;re asking?</p>

<p>If you want to use the nucensorship bot, add <a href="/u/nucensorship">/u/nucensorship</a> as a moderator and message cojoco.</p>

<p>If you are asking about what I think about this particular submission:</p>

<p>I really try to avoid following the personality dramas on reddit, I&#39;m vaguely aware that <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a> is a moderator of some large subs.  I have no idea what your beef with him is or how legit it is.  I&#39;m not gonna get into that at all.</p>

<p>In general terms, assuming you have a valid beef with this user:</p>

<p>Association doesn&#39;t imply guilt, but it reasonably raises suspicion sometimes.  I take no offense at this post as a mod here or author of the revamped uncensorship <a href="/u/nucensorship">/u/nucensorship</a> bot.</p>

<p>cojoco operates the nucensorship account.  <a href="/u/sunshine-x">/u/sunshine-x</a> operated the now shadowbanned <a href="/u/uncensorship">/u/uncensorship</a> account.</p>

<p>Moderators add the bot without any permissions at all.  It&#39;s just an observer that is given privileged access to the moderation log of the subreddit it &#39;moderates&#39;.</p>

<p>The bot posts reports to <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a></p>

<p>Once the bot posts them there, the moderators of the original sub have no direct control over those reports unless they also moderate <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a></p>

<p>There have been no cases that I&#39;m aware of where bipolar or anyone else has ever requested that we remove a report for anything other than a <a href="/rules">reddit rule violation</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what would happen if someone did request that, but I doubt we&#39;d ever remove a report that didn&#39;t violate reddit&#39;s overall rules and wasn&#39;t deleted by the original OP.</p>

<p>And if we did, I&#39;d probably step down as a mod there.</p>
