<p>I suppose I&#39;d need to see some evidence that they are. Top 4 wealthiest Americans and their residence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bill Gates, Medina, WA, elev 69&#39;</p></li>

<li><p>Charles &amp; David Koch, Wichita, KS, elev 1,299&#39; (born there)</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>is the so called global warming really the earths core being heated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any evidence that the planet&#39;s core is heating? What would a heating of the core look like? Probably more volcanic activity and heat rising up from the ground as opposed to being generally in the air.</p>

<p>Seems like that&#39;s a scientifically testable theory. Got any studies to back the supposition?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planet X is approaching?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moon&#39;s mass is 7.34767309 × 10<sup>22</sup> kilograms and it is 384,400 km from the Earth. The best it can do is impact tides by a handful of feet.</p>

<p>For a planet to be able to exert enough force on the earth to alter the temperature of its core, wouldn&#39;t it have to be visible to even amateur astronomers, or just by looking up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is there a &quot;fake&quot; sky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When would &quot;they&quot; have installed that? It would have to be higher than about 60,000 feet since just about any joker with enough money to rent a jet can get there. </p>

<p>This would require a sphere of a diameter of roughly 41,927,040 feet, with a surface area of 5,522,532,473,737,275 square feet.</p>

<p>If there would be such an effect, in a hypothetical scenario of an approaching planet, i would think the first signs would be alterations of the oceanic tides. Small perturbations shoukd be noticed, first, as the approaching planets gravity woukd soon affect the moons grip on our oceans. Also, electromagentic changes in our magentosphere woukd undoubtedly be affected, probably well before the tides. These shoukd happen, i woukd think, before the forces could affect our core to any degree. So i woukd have to go with &quot;No,&quot; unless there is any other arguments i havent thought of...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I honestly doubt it. I think they are actually supposed to be smaller than pluto, if im not mistaken, making them planetoid objects or whstever they call those things nowadays... </p>

<p>I love the theory of nibiru, but i just havent seen any conclusive (or even suggestive) evidence yet for it. Unfortunately, this is one of the many kinks in my favorite theory (ancient astronauts). Id be excited as hell to find something like nibiru, though. But im not betting on it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i haven&#39;t read any books about this although i&#39;m aware of some authors (Zecharia Sitchin is one that comes to mind), i only bring this up as <em>another</em> conspiracy to consider, one that is rarely mentioned, </p>

<p>previous post offered other info, but this is what i have now,</p>

<p>&quot;This year, a University of Madrid team suggested that there could be ‘at least two’ unknown planets beyond Pluto in our own solar system, in a little-studied area at the ‘fringe’ or our solar system, known as the ‘inner Oort cloud’.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/30/are-we-closing-in-on-the-solar-systems-mysterious-planet-x-5043236/">http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/30/are-we-closing-in-on-the-solar-systems-mysterious-planet-x-5043236/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Is Nibiru real? Does it take Nibiru 3,600 years to complete one orbital journey? As you can imagine, the gravitational effects of a sizable planet moving close to the inner solar system would spell big trouble for planet Earth. Earth has been acting up lately with an increase in earthquakes, volcanoes, global warming (oops..I meant “climate change”), blending of seasons, and more. Open your mind a little and stop believing everything our so called scientists and NASA folks have to say. &quot;</p>

<p>edit: if you have the distances from the Sun of the new bodies i would very much appreciate it!</p>

<p>edit2: ok nvrmd i checked what i wanted to check, octave theory is killed by this, new bodies are beyond 150 AU, octave theory predicted 58 AU</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure what to believe, but what I am open to the possibility is that &#39;Nibiru X&#39; or &#39;Planet X&#39; is is written in history is actually Saturn.  In fact, I think it is highly more likely this is the case over the possibility of another red dwarf star orbiting us. Read below.</p>

<p>If you follow all the religions, freemasony and other secret societies to the root you will find they all worsehip the planet Saturn. Word is, is that possibly 10,000 years ago as our sun was dying (saturn) we were fortunate enough to land into the orbit of the sun we are currently in which saved us. </p>

<p>Some facts that support this theory is that if the Earth and the sun were created by the same gases / stellar dust then we would have hd similar composures, but we do not which is a big important factor.</p>

<p>The other interesting is that the way we were orbiting around saturn with mars and venus previously, it created all sorts of plasma patterns from venus&#39;s tail (today it still has a tail, but it is very marginal), and these patterns are all depicted throughout history in the form of cave paintings and scroll writings.</p>

<p>check out that documentary i posted above, and if you liked it watch some of the other &#39;thunderbolt&#39; documentatires that are related to the theory.  The quality of the science is rather high in this theory compared to typical conspiracy theories, in the sense that they actually had legit scientists doing the research.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed, was pretty surprising for me too but when you think about it, it makes sense and also offers a much better explanation for what gravity actually is, an electrical attraction.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of the Rossetta commet in their argument proves the electric theory is far more realistic / likely then the icy universe currently pushed in mainstream which makes little sense.

    <div class="md"><p>People are constantly predicting the imminent return of Nibiru lately.   According to Sitchin&#39;s Earth Chronicles, where Nibiru was first discussed (at least in modern times), the super elliptical orbit of Nibiru takes 3600 years, and it was last near the sun (as in between Mars and Jupiter orbits) in about 140 BC.   That means that if you believe the theories on it, Nibiru is near the other end of its orbit now, far beyond Pluto, and we have about 1400 years before needing to worry about it again.</p>

<p>is the so called global warming really the earths core being heated because Planet X is approaching?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there was a planet so close that it could somehow (not sure what you think the mechanism behind this is, or how it would work) &quot;heat up the Earth&#39;s core&quot;, wouldn&#39;t it have been hugely obvious due to planets also having a large gravitational field? It would have to be right on top of us.</p>

<p>Planet X / Nibiru would disrupt the orbits of every planet in the Solar System if came anywhere near the inner.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean there couldn&#39;t still be undiscovered planets outside the orbit of Pluto, but they likely don&#39;t come very much closer than that or they would have been detected before now.</p>

<p>Finally, these &quot;two newly discovered planets&quot; - where are you reading about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i had info about a &quot;second sun&quot; that we&#39;re not able to see, Planet X isn&#39;t <em>close</em>, those that believe this, think that even if it passes earth, the tail of the planet will be life threatening, wish i had saved the interview i heard,</p>

<p>&quot;Astronomers announced today that they have found eight new planets in the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where liquid water can exist on the planet&#39;s surface. This doubles the number of small planets (less than twice the diameter of Earth) believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Among these eight, the team identified two that are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date.</p>

<p>&quot;Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth,&quot; says lead author Guillermo Torres of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).</p>

<p>These findings were announced today in a press conference at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>The two most Earth-like planets of the group are Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b. Both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than our Sun. Kepler-438b circles its star every 35 days, while Kepler-442b completes one orbit every 112 days.&quot;</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think this is the &quot;second sun&quot; that has anything to do with Niburu,</p>

<p>Will Betelgeuse Become a Second Sun?</p>

<p>Betelgeuse will explode someday. It lies some 430 light-years from Earth. Yet it’s already one of the brightest stars in Earth’s sky. The reason is that Betelgeuse is a supergiant star. It is intrinsically very brilliant.</p>

<p>Such brilliance comes at a price, however. Betelgeuse is one of the most famous stars in the sky because it’s due to explode someday. Betelgeuse’s enormous energy requires that the fuel be expended quickly (relatively speaking), and in fact Betelgeuse is now near the end of its lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for antartica being off limits, it was by an international treaty, mixed with its natural inhospitability.</p>

<p>But you do bring up an interesting point... I mean, our solar system has an ecliptic, wherein the planets orbit the sun. It does seem plausible that another body could be orbiting skewed from the ecliptic. In this sense, &quot;amateur&quot; astronomers wouldnt be able to see it, unless they were far enough south on our globe. Which brings up a question, is there a point in our southern sky this could be possible?</p>

<p>My guess would be it wouod have to be damn close to due south, as Polaris is due north (that why its our current &quot;North Star&quot;). However, even then, someone in the southern hemisphere woukd be able to see it, for sure, just as almost everyone in the northern hemisphere can view the north star. </p>

<p>Sure, availabke technology comes into question, but im sure our brothers and sisters in australia have telescopes.</p>

<p>This must mean, if nibiru is real, that it is jist about invisible to all but the latest telescopes. But the sky is pretty fucking big, and this makes me wonder if amateur planet hunters would even try to look beyond out solar systems ecliptic?</p>

<p>And for what its worth, i havent seen a single &quot;debunker&quot; in this thread, yet. Just folks who seem as interested in this theory as OP, and who have come to a seperate conclusion than OP after looking into the claims and trying to figure out themselves. </p>
