        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello folks,</p>

<p>As you may be aware, over the past few days some threads have popped up both on <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">/r/SaltLakeCity</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regarding a day care center which, according to the research and observations of some users, was perhaps more than a simple child care operation.</p>

<p>While the moderators of this subreddit were happy to allow discussion of the topic to the extent permitted by the site wide terms of service, the admins have informed us that the information and research contained therein amounted to what they considered to be, on the whole, &quot;personal information being used to harass a business.&quot;</p>

<p>While the mod team had removed information we considered to be doxx on multiple occasions within the threads, the decision of the admins regarding the removal of the content in its entirety must be respected on our end.</p>

<p>To that end, after a long discussion between the mods and the admin team, we have been left with no option but to prevent future discussion of the situation involving the day care. </p>

<p>We want to make it clear that, from the perspective of the mod team, the free flow of information is our paramount concern. To that end, this prohibition is quite bothersome and clashes with the ethos of organically curated content that we take pride in fostering on this subreddit. However we also absolutely understand the importance of protecting personal information and the lives of innocent people. Weighing that balance can sometimes be difficult, and in this situation the admins have made the choice for us. We have agreed to the prohibition in order to protect the existence of the subreddit, and we ask that you do as well. </p>

<p>As a quick recap from our end;</p>

<p>Yesterday, a post regarding the daycare center became quite popular on <a href="/r/slc">/r/slc</a> but was removed for witch hunting. At that point, another post was made on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but only received a few hundred upvotes (no witch hunting occurred in that thread).</p>

<p>A recap thread was then post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which garnered over a thousand net upvotes. That post was removed by the site wide spam filter at some point yesterday, and the mod team checked in with the admins as to whether or not they had caused the removal. At that point, the admins reviewed the spam filter removal, informed us that they had not removed the submission, and told us that &quot;all looked fine&quot;.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we had assumed that the admins had looked into the situation and determined that an investigation into the day care did not violate the TOS. </p>

<p>Today, another recap post was submitted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and, after a few hours, was removed by the admins. The mod team was confused at first, as we had been under the impression that the admins had reviewed the day care thread from the previous day and determined the content was not in violation of the TOS. However, we were informed that a mistake was made on the admin&#39;s side and they failed to look into the situation beyond simply examining why the spam filter had tripped on the submission from the previous day.</p>

<p>At this point the only option going forward would be to find a means of facilitating heavily redacted recaps of the day care situation; something that the mod team feels is not feasible.</p>

<p>We want to make it clear that this was a decision on the part of the admins, and we, as moderators, are obligated to follow their directives to protect the subreddit itself from being banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t expect this comment to change the outcome of these SLC posts, I thought I&#39;d chime in my disappointment.</p>

<p>This is a pretty blatant act of censorship under the guise of &quot; harassment&quot; or &quot;doxxing&quot; when really it&#39;s just a matter of speculation using public record to back it up. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this has the Barbara Streisand effect (more people going to visit the location due to the removal).</p>

<p>Again, none of us posted links to their Facebook profile or anything personal. The only remotely personal data was their name and address <strong>which were obtained via public record</strong>. They incorporated themselves, filling their own name and address as the registered agent. This was their choice and they knew the risk at the time.</p>

<p>This risk is not justifying any harassment (which is laughable to claim). The risk is the risk of being exposed and every business person knows this is part of becoming a company. Assume the risk or abstract it through another party.</p>

<p>They left a <strong>public</strong> paper trail and we followed it and connected the dots. The fact that this is all being censored due to that is bogus and bullshit.</p>

<p>No one here advocated any violence or harassment towards the business or employees. Any information we linked was public and could be found by anyone looking themselves.</p>

<p>The only thing this shows is how easily this site (admins) kowtow to ridiculous requests like this. I do commend the mods for sticking up for this topic and subreddit as a whole. Thank your for trying to keep this as fair as you possibly could. We know who the real problem is.</p>

<p>That all said, I&#39;m not done with this. This place stinks to high heaven and I think we can get to the bottom of it without overstepping our bounds.</p>

<p>I knew this day would come where the topic got canned. I&#39;ve saved and screenshoted all my research so I can continue elsewhere (possibly IRC). I refuse to let blind censorship shield potential illicit activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. This was clearly not a dox, and is all public records being put in some order. That&#39;s all. A strange event, a strange place, with no official explanation, or even an unofficial one. Something that should be looked into.</p>

<p>However, could be pointless to do so; but hey, this is reddit, most of it is pointless anyways. So long as it doesn&#39;t devolve into harassment, I say continue the investigation elsewhere.</p>

<p>I hope so.  To be honest, I think it already has.  How many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts have gotten over 1000 comments?  This topic has led to two if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>And I personally agree that the post shouldn&#39;t have been deleted and advocated for such.  I think that building is fishy as hell and there a lot of unanswered questions regarding it.</p>

<p>Same thing happened back when those two SH subreddits were deleted and their creator had like 4 accounts banned.</p>

<p>Edit: Grammar.</p>

<p>Your unhealthy fear of law enforcement stems from the shit you always see on here. The hate that permeates all facets of reddit. What you dont see is the ones that want to make a difference because that isnt as relatable. Its easier to get pissed off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. I want to expand on the harassment part as well: There&#39;s no proof that harassment has taken place. If you consider going up to a public daycare to take pictures of the inside &quot;harassment,&quot; well...that&#39;s your own problem. But there was a comment somewhere (can&#39;t find it at the moment, I&#39;m at work between tasks) saying that &quot;there are people ordering pizzas for this daycare, it&#39;s harassment!&quot; There&#39;s no proof of that anywhere. As far as I can tell, no one ordered a pizza for anyone. Even on the 8chan and 4chan threads, where you would expect it. No one has called for pizzas to be sent to the daycare. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all &quot;these people were being harassed so we removed the threads&quot; but if you were actually in the threads or on the *chans you&#39;d see that there was no advocacy of harassment, and no real harassment took place besides scoping the place out/taking pictures. I mean, sure, that&#39;s a little shady in and of itself, but come on - it&#39;s a shady damn daycare, surely if you operate a shady daycare you&#39;d expect people to take pictures of your joint, right? Seems like all a bullshit excuse to get the threads taken down, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually was a picture taken of a pizza guy arriving at the building if I&#39;m not mistaken, it just was never posted on reddit to avoid breaking the TOS.  I&#39;m pretty sure was on the 8chan thread, though I don&#39;t know those forums too well.  I was reading a thread yesterday that had the picture on it.</p>

<p>I do agree with the rest of your point though, I don&#39;t think the threads needed to be deleted.</p>

<p>People do pranks all the time, pretty bogus to cry wolf about &quot;harassment&quot; because you get a pizza delivered to your business.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it funny how we get called the &quot;crazy ones&quot; for suggesting such a &quot;conspiracy&quot;.... yet they can call harassment while suggesting something equally absurd?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t any.  In fact, the context of the thread was that the pizza guy never delivered the pizza and, shortly afterward, a couple of kids arrived at the building and were let in.  Pictures were taken of this as well.  A few people suggested that the pizza delivery guy might&#39;ve been the &quot;cue&quot; to say that people were about to be dropped off.  Again, complete speculation, but these are some of the comments I read yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more likely that the guy there to take pictures ordered the pizza to get someone to come out. Although that&#39;s also based on speculation. It&#39;s very odd that no body answered for the pizza but then answered for the kids. Unless the photographer omitted some part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the very last thing Reddit admins would want is a very public instance of the supposed &#39;tin-foil hat wearing crazies&#39; finding and busting open a pedophilia or drug smuggling operation in the heart of Salt Lake City. Especially if the police or any state officials are involved. That would easily lend credibility in the same sort that 4chan receives when anonymous goes chasing the rabbits.</p>

<p>Please PM me if you have a place where this is to be discussed, and when I get back to it, if I haven&#39;t heard from you, I will do the same.  The more private, the better.  The threads gained legs, so while I don&#39;t think it was reddit responsible for harassing people, we provided the links with the information.  Doesn&#39;t excuse in any way the removing of the post. Again, it&#39;s all public info.</p>

<p>Perhaps just create a private subreddit?</p>

<p>I duuno, just so disappointed.  I&#39;m out for a bit.  Gotta find my balance.  Thanks for your contributions and I hope to talk to you again soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care whether or not the site in question was anything interesting, but what&#39;s unsettling here is that Reddit is making a decision to censor business information.</p>

<p>Business information is NOT the same as personal information and should not be treated as such.  Just as a person acting in a public role is no longer entitled to the same latitudes of privacy afforded to a person acting privately, a business is automatically a publicly accessible entity.</p>

<p>Why should a business or persons acting on behalf of a business be protected from the inquiring public by Reddit?  Are we not allowed to post the phone numbers of our public representatives anymore?  Am I not allowed to post the address of an establishment in question?  </p>

<p>There are pictures of strangers posted to reddit all the time without their consent.  That&#39;s a pretty unique identifier.  Why does a business get better treatment than an individual?</p>

<p>This sets a poor precedent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m disturbed greatly they didn&#39;t give a reason.  Why not just say &#39;what if they sued us?&#39; or &#39;what if somebody got hurt&#39;? </p>

<p>Like is every daycare now going to be under this kind of scrutiny?  Would that be a good thing?  </p>

<p>There are legitimate questions to ask, but the mystery they keep on the reasons seems to either stupidly feed the curiosity or be actually part of the conspiracy, or just the system that allows certain types of evil to exist in plain sight.  </p>

<p>That said, shouldn&#39;t someone be making a youtube video about this putting all the evidence of wrongdoing together?  On the other hand if at this point we still have nothing but weirdness, are all of us weird folk ready for this kind of scrutiny ourselves?    </p>

<p>I do have a legitimate question that who in their right mind would think this was the day care for their kids?  </p>

<p>And what do libel laws really say about this?  Isn&#39;t the line the intent to harm the other party?  Can we investigate for legitimacy and safety without risking this?  Do people and places that work with children have a higher standard to uphold?  </p>

<p>Like what if the guy turned out to be some Jim Henson/Mr Rogers dude with like a puppet show he was working on and was a shy reclusive artist who was dedicated to kids but just weird?  (one of the villains in American Horror Story Creep Show was pushed over the edge by a cruel baseless pedo witch hunt...)</p>

<p>Do we really believe in innocent til proven guilty?  Are we ready to throw trial by jury out the window and make it trial by subreddit?  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s enough questions for now, but people interested in general &#39;wtf is going on around here&#39; have legitimate cause to be fascinated with this whole thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the distinction of <strong>personal</strong> information and <strong>business</strong> information.</p>

<p>The fact that they registered their <strong>business</strong> to a residential address hardly makes it any less public information. If you ran a business out of your home and that was your business address, would it be my fault for showing a link to the <strong>public</strong> record of it?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want your business getting back to you so easily, don&#39;t register your home to the <strong>state&#39;s public business records</strong>. Derp.</p>

<p>Example, a person runs a business out of their home. I put a link to their <strong>business</strong> from the local yellow pages, which has their address because that is what they <strong>registered their business with</strong>. Again, all of this is easily accessible, so does that make it personal now?</p>

<p>There are names in there, they are calling it &quot;bait shop&quot; (with no real proof), throwing terms like sex offender and sex slave ring... even though we don&#39;t know the full story. What if that person and business is innocent? Well too late, &quot;reddit&quot; already decided on the contrary.</p>

<p>there&#39;s no due process, no lawyers, no discovery, no rules of procedure, no decisions on admissible evidence, threat of perjury, confrontation of witnesses or any of the things we do to ensure we don&#39;t ruin an innocent&#39;s life</p>

<p>And the information being public or not is irrelevant, it&#39;s simply reddit rules to not post personal information</p>

<p>You have to becareful when posting personal information, because here on the internet there&#39;s no due process, no lawyers, no discovery, no rules of procedure, no decisions on admissible evidence, threat of perjury, confrontation of witnesses or any of the things we do with the law to ensure we don&#39;t ruin an innocent&#39;s life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The removal of the discussion is asinine on every level.  Everything was public record.  Hell, I ran a company (now defunct) about ten years ago.  All my old information is still out there and floating about in the ether, do I like that?  Not in the slightest, but it was part of the risk of running a business and risk is <em>the</em> nature of running a business.  The whole point of the public record is to have a record available to the public.  People say there&#39;s some imaginary line where it&#39;s not ok to post public information, and they&#39;re wrong.  States require there be a public record of ownership. Ask yourself why that would be, if they didn&#39;t expect the public to, at some point, review and disseminate that record.  </p>

<p>If Buisness X is given multiple citations over the years for failure to comply to regulatory standards, where would you think a reporter would find the information on who owns Business X?  The public record.  Would they let people know who owns Business X or would they tip-toe around names and addresses for fear of the owners harassment?  What if you, as a person, find that Business X has multiple citations over the years for failure to comply to regulatory standards?  By this &#39;thin-line&#39; logic then, I&#39;m not supposed to tell other people who owns this business?  That&#39;s absurd on every level.</p>

<p>Educate yourself as a user of the system in which you are engaged.  If you want to run a business, but don&#39;t&#39; want people to know it&#39;s you who owns it, then don&#39;t run a business or have someone else organize your articles of incorporation, or list some guy who has been dead since 1945 and hope no one ever catches on.  If you don&#39;t like that states keep public records of business owners because &#39;the devils on the internet can see it and give it to people&quot; then contact your local legislators and try to do something about it.  Don&#39;t cry foul because we use it as it&#39;s supposed to be used.  Did people do really dumb shit with that information?  Yes.  People do dumb shit all the fucking time, everywhere, every day.  This is as absurd as the whole &quot;caution, your coffee is hot&quot;.  Just because people can&#39;t exhibit common sense, everyone shall suffer and everything will be (and arguably is) programmed to accommodate to the least common denominator.

<p>So this sub is responsible for the actions of every nutjob in the wild now, no evidence necessary or consideration of facts. I&#39;m so glad that&#39;s finally been established.

<p>We are all over the world, we have our own ideas and opinions. We do not interact with each other on a meaningful daily basis. We aren&#39;t neighbours, coworkers or family. This may seem crule to point out; but the idea that we are responsible for each others actions is asinine. Lumping everyone into one group here is the key to discredit valid conspiracies, and most likely the only way to push censorship. </p>

<p>The admin merely needs a reason to do anything.  When people participate within a thread like this one it shows them there is so many that neglected their rules by posting peoples info in a witch hunt. </p>

<p>You talk of zero proof well that&#39;s what the entire series of threads was. Zero proof. If you feel like fucking with people do it somewhere else that isnt associated with this community. Get over yourself and realize it isnt about you its about the rest of the community preserving itself.</p>

<p>Admin dont have to follow your idea of rules. You know why. Cause they run shit. They dont have shareholders....yet.  So technically they dont owe us a damn thing. Now luckily we get to use reddit unhindered for the most part till it runs the risk of putting the name of reddit in a bad light. Then you guessed it they remove the toys from said sandbox. </p>

<p>This is a sub about conspiracy. We discuss without proof all the time. </p>

<p>Is it really that difficult to see the issue with holding the sub accountable for the real world actions of nutjobs? There&#39;s no controlling body outside of this site to prevent nutters from being nutters. Moreover, there are assholes who despise with all their worthless being this sub and the people in it. What&#39;s stopping them from doing disgusting shit and blaming r/conspiracy for it?</p>

<p>Think that&#39;s outlandish? Well, choke it down, because that&#39;s the set of keys you and the other authoritarians just handed over to a pack of frothing hyenas. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the &quot;do not dox people&quot; rule. Anyone that does is a feckless idiot. I DO disagree with the censorship of public record on this sub. It&#39;s a slippery slope greased with the &quot;ya me too&#39;s&quot; of people like you. </p>

<p>100% I agree, and I can understand why they did what they did, it&#39;s just bullshit all around.  Knowledge is power and know everything about your enemy before you conduct any action.  What happened to the whole &quot;study it out, people!&quot; mentality?  Where was this restraint while myself and others tried to decipher the enigma around this shipping container?

<p>But, if it was something more subversive, more organized, the actors would definitely NOT want anyone stirring up the attention to bringing in law enforcement. Especially painful to them if it&#39;s the exactly right branch/division of law enforcement to bring the heat.</p>

<p>If this was some sort of smuggling ring, it&#39;s a toss up between CBP and ATF (guns), DEA (drugs), or ??? if it&#39;s something else. But calling out CBP gets the wheels turning, and that&#39;s exactly what someone did not want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  If it was nothing, then it wouldn&#39;t have been shut down across various sites.  All this would have gotten back to the daycare eventually and the owners of the place would have enlisted the police or whoever to make it all stop.  Instead, it&#39;s just shut down and people are told not to talk about it?  Wut?</p>

Hell, by your flawed and immature logic, the White Pages or Google could be sued for harassment simply because someone used that publicly accessible information to commit a crime.

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. You&#39;re so simple minded. I&#39;m not gonna waste my time explaining this to you.  I fully understand what you&#39;re saying, but people weren&#39;t just posting public records. You can sue for fucking anything in this country and reddit isn&#39;t gonna waste money fighting some shit like this when they can just remove it.</p>

<p>Again you come off just as much of a fool as those in conspiratard. Does that frustrate you? It&#39;d frustrate you. I&#39;m not saying this is fact bud, I&#39;m just saying this is completely plausible. Denying that just makes you look like a close minded fool shutting out anything that challenges the narrative you constructed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, using the same flawed logic and petty argument.  Sure, anyone can be sued.  For any reason.  Look at the big brain on Brett.  </p>

<p>Reddit clearly has a team of lawyers.  This story was not censored because of claimed harassment.  It was not censored because of unlikely but potential legal risk. The reason why it was silenced across reddit AND other forums is incredibly clear.  Keep trying to make your point.  Because as yet, you&#39;ve said absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s exactly what everyone does with public information, right?  They use and abuse it EVERY...SINGLE...TIME.  JUST THINK OF THE KIDS!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Better call the authorities.  The phone book allows trolls to make prank calls and ruin innocent people&#39;s lives.  Gotta censor that Google and Yahoo.  Those corrupt privacy destroyers allow anyone to find other public records in their name.  Hell, we better shutter the division of public records now.  You&#39;re actually telling me anyone can simply walk in, and without ID, gather all public information about every single small and large businesses in the State?  What about people rights???</p>

But no where does it really seem do they admit that it is much more important and condusive to a free society thst the People are to be protected from its Government above all else...</p>

<p>I dont know what info was shared inbthe thread that got removed by the admins, and i dont care. But i suspect it falls under PII according to the law, and thus, was more than likely against reddits TOS, regardless of how easy it is to get that info, and regardless of whether or not thst info was in public records. If its PII, its protected.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a business and <strong>required</strong> by most states to supply the name and address of a registered agent who will act as a legal contact for your business. This is public information and for good reason. If you want privacy in this regard, you can pay for services who act as your registered agent.</p>

<p>Same issue with domain registration. You put in contact information for your domain in case someone needs to get in touch with you. Again, services can be paid for that provide a layer of privacy and abstraction.</p>

<p>Public record is such. If you don&#39;t like having public records then think twice about opening a company and how you do such. Don&#39;t want a paper trail? Don&#39;t put your home address down as the registered agent. Don&#39;t put your name and email down for domain services, register a company email.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying or warranting any type of harassment, but querying the true actions of a shady business is hardly classified as harassment. This is not a witchhunt but rather a public inquiry of a business which appears to be hiding something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me a lot of the shit storm that Reddit as a whole got from the mainstream media after the Boston Marathon Bombings. </p>

<p>Then, just like now, the site admins removed some pretty amazing amateur investigation work.  The site admins also apologized profusely for the actions of hundreds of Redditors who were merely trying to help find the Boston Bombers.</p>

<p>This is actually the first time I had ever seen or heard of Reddit, 
and I was instantly hooked for this very reason, the ability of a group of like minded people to collaborate on <strong>publicly available information</strong> to make a real world change for the better. </p>

<p>I will say unabashedly that the posts on Reddit during the Boston Marathon, literally changed my life forever.  I poured through all of the information posted, looking at all the pictures, videos, thoughts and ideas, and came to my own conclusion about what really happened that day. I realized that the entire event was completely fake, and was perpetrated by criminal elements of a supposedly &quot;friendly&quot; foreign government, facilitated by an equally corrupt &quot;news&quot; media.  This really shook me and my previous beliefs to the core.</p>

<p>It really changed my entire perspective on life, and I will always revere Reddit, and particularly this sub for that experience.</p>

<p>This exposure of truth had to have played a large part in the negative press which Reddit received in the aftermath of BMB.  I can only imagine how alarmed the MSM and the criminals involved in this hoax were when their lies and deceptions were being exposed while their story line was literally still unfolding. </p>

<p>They absolutely had to demonize and vilify Reddit, to ensure the majority of people wouldn&#39;t find the truth, and reject the false reality they were trying to impose.  The news media then attacked Reddit en masse, due to a few idiots who posted personal details of an innocent bystander.   </p>

<p>It seems logical to me that the same people being exposed, would have a huge motive to post these personal details in order to discredit those who exposed them. I wonder,  is that what happened here with the &quot;daycare&quot;?  There was already a play book on how you get Reddit to remove damaging evidence uncovered by Internet sleuths, just post personal information about people in the same thread,  and voila, all the dirt you don&#39;t want people to see is gone!   A False Flag.  Ok, maybe I&#39;m being a little too conspiratorial, but I know now if there&#39;s ever a post about something I don&#39;t like or want to cover up, the exact strategy to employ to get reddit to censor it.</p>

<p>It seems to be that this sub once again came VERY VERY close to exposing some pretty nefarious things by some powerful people at this daycare.   </p>

<p>I look forward to continuing this conversation with you all in a more 1st Amendment friendly, free speech zone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As OP of the re-cap/container post, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised it was removed.  I am surprised it was done with no explanation from the sites admins, and that I had apparently been shadowbanned/un-shadownbanned (possible a few times) with no explanation save for a PM from a mod saying, basically, sorry dude, but apparently you&#39;ve been shadowbanned.</p>

<p>I do feel it should be noted, I had contacted Customs (as per a suggestion from a commenter in my thread) about this container in question.  I felt there was enough information that dubiously registered companies were involved in something not right.  I talked to two different people, sent links (not reddit links, source links) to them with the information gathered.  I go about the rest of my work day and come to find this happened.  Coincidence?  Nope.  Nefarious?  I&#39;ll put it at 60-40.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is why I have been a lurker on this site &amp; sub.  Why discuss anything when someone, on their whim, can just say &quot;no, I don&#39;t like that&quot;.  </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who tried to help dig.  I plan to continue to dig, and discuss this off-site.  If you are interested, feel free to PM me so I can keep you in the loop and let you know where shop get&#39;s set up once it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this today and am a tad bit disappointed.  I saw no evidence of Doxxing, althought I did see a great deal of imagination in the thread.  I&#39;m pretty sure that the entire thread could have been curtailed with a single, authenticated response from the business ownership to any social media stream.  </p>

<p>The disappointment I feel at the moment stems from the Admins&#39; double standard in this regard.  This site is willing to let large firms such as Comcast be desicccated to the point where they have entire sub-Reddits posting entire recorded conversations with the business, but when a business such as this is called into question, the ban-hammer is pulled out of the closet.  I find this double-standard questionable and disappointing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear  Conde Naste: Doxxing is when you release the PII of a person IN THE THREAD. Public information is public information. If one owns a company and registers with a name and address to the state / federal government, that isn&#39;t PII, that&#39;s PUBLIC INFORMATION.</p>

<p>I have been following this thing since yesterday, and the only names/addresses I&#39;ve seen were pulled from said public information. As the government is wot to say, </p>

<p>YOU HAVE NO REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IF IT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THIS INCLUDES DEEDS, TITLES, TAX RECORDS, CORPORATE DOCUMENTATION OR CRIMINAL RECORDS. </p>

<p>Reddit is not non-biased. They obviously   have an agenda, and it has nothing to do with protecting PII.</p>

<p>Reddit is a great way for groups of people to discuss about something but terrible when hundreds of people call a day care because of the conspiracy theories. Its harassment plain and simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NO. A conversation cannot be held responsible for what people decide to do on their own. Nobody linked to someone&#39;s personal facebook profile, or posted the phone number to the daycare center. To the contrary, the handful of people who claimed to try contacting said daycare all reported failure. It was only random newly created accounts that started crying &quot;harassment.&quot; </p>

<p>If I told you that my local Pizza Hut had a habit of denying service to black people, at what point does it go from public info to doxxing? Is it when I tell you which Pizza Hut it is? Or is it when someone looks up who the manager is? What if someone posts the name of the owner of that particular franchise? All of it is public information. But the context matters as well. Would Conde Naste be so quick to delete entire threads if it was a story about some Indian woman getting denied service at a Denny&#39;s?</p>

<p>Nothing was obtained illegally in this case,no databases were broken into. We didn&#39;t trace a username to a facebook profile set to private, dictionary hack the password, do a paid background and credit check based on that information , get the names of relatives and friends,  obtain a social security number off the credit report and then use that ss # to obtain cell phone and banking information by way of social engineering. That my friend is doxing. This was the equivalent of walking into your local tax assessor&#39;s office and saying &quot;can you tell me who owns the property at 1234 any street&quot; writing a check for $3.00 and getting the report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so people know, the discussion on ATS has been nuked as well as of about 10 minutes or so ago.  I just signed up today for it simply to post my thoughts and as I clicked &quot;post&quot; for my commentary to be posted, the site gave me a 404 page.  That would mean that the thread was killed while I was typing my comments out.</p>

<p>The thread spanned three days and over 21 pages and I didn&#39;t even get the chance to go through most of them before this happened.  I don&#39;t really buy this explanation that the main post here is giving.  Everyone knew we were not trying to harass some random daycare.  Connections were made with the owners doing shady business and we focused our efforts towards that, not stalking kids for Christ&#39;s sake, and kept digging.  </p>

<p>Why, at that point, do we need to be sanctioned away from discussing this entire thing?  I really want to know the rationale for this because honestly I get the feeling that someone had been instructed at some point to can these threads entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it okay for police to investigate people and ruin their lives (even those of innocent people), but citizens cannot contribute to justice in any meaningful way because it&#39;s considered &quot;harassment?&quot; </p>

<p>We should be allowed to have the authority of law enforcement because there is no monetary incentive for the work we do, but we can&#39;t because of reddit &quot;rules,&quot; and must instead resort to shitty 4chan-esque imageboards to collaborate and bring anonymous justice to fruition.</p>

<p>Maybe  an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod can create a new home for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> somewhere else, such as an imageboard. This new site can be permanently stickied/greenposted and all new submissions to this sub disabled, to encourage the migration (because reddit sucks). I feel like any original, groundbreaking or meaningful information on reddit gets hijacked by higher-ups such as admins. We&#39;re being held hostage here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just shadowbanned off of a 2+ year account with 40K karma, 10 gift exchanges, over a year of gold (with months remaining), and a history of NOT BEING A TROLL.....all for posting the phone number of a business which was posted in various PUBLIC places.  </p>

<p>Not doxxing a human being, but posting a business&#39; phone number that you could get out of the yellow pages.</p>

<p>There was no warning...no Mod/Admin explanation...I was just not being seen when I posted and Reddit thought that would be the most respectable way of showing me that I might have broken one of the rules.</p>

<p>I got in touch with an Admin who asked me why I thought it was OK to post &quot;personal information&quot;....and that was the extent of my dealings with Reddit&#39;s &quot;customer service team&quot; before every other venue was ignored.</p>

<p>Reddit Admins DEFINITELY use their own political agendas to weed out people they dont agree with.  There is no recourse and no respect from Reddit&#39;s side...and you really dont have to break the letter or intent of the rule for them to take ACTUAL MONEY from you by denying access to a profile and its features that you have paid money for.</p>

<p>As I have said before....at least Comcast will accept your phone calls after they take your money (by error or otherwise).  Reddit Admin gave me a SJW &quot;fuck you&quot; and then went back to acting transparent while everybody she disagrees with is shadowbanned.</p>

<p>This situation is actually &quot;Reddit by design&quot;.  Look for a Reddit &quot;customer service line&quot; or for <a href="/u/gekokujo">/u/gekokujo</a> if you disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that. Reddit can be a great platform. As long as there&#39;s not an SJW in charge. That&#39;s the same with many forums though. I&#39;m following this situation on 8ch now; do the reddit admins really think that just by banning the topic on their own website, it won&#39;t be discussed elsewhere? That just makes the topic even more scintillating. </p>

<p>&quot;Personal information being used to harass a business.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ridiculous. You know, if you had ever owned a business there is good and bad publicity and it&#39;s a natural part of owning one. Harassment is subjective to a certain extent hard to define. There is certainly no harassment involved in wondering what a local business does in the area. Which is a perfectly valid question. And this thread is an opinion an incredibly lowly excuse for censorship.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a publicly registered business venue with a publicly registered adress. There is absolutely nothing wrong with posting that. Typical SJW admin failures, are you mod&#39;s stupid enough to think people don&#39;t know what&#39;s right or wrong here?</p>

<pre><code>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

<p>In analyzing the availability of the immunity offered by this provision, courts generally apply a three-prong test. A defendant must satisfy each of the three prongs to gain the benefit of the immunity:</p>

<pre><code>The defendant must be a &quot;provider or user&quot; of an &quot;interactive computer service.&quot;
The cause of action asserted by the plaintiff must treat the defendant as the &quot;publisher or speaker&quot; of the harmful information at issue.
The information must be &quot;provided by another information content provider,&quot; i.e., the defendant must not be the &quot;information content provider&quot; of the harmful information at issue.

    <div class="md"><p>what would that mean if reddit was not even allowed to have an r/conspiracy....like that is the only word in the english language you can&#39;t start a subreddit with.</p>

<p>&#39;Find who and what you cannot mock and learn, then you will know who rules you and how they do it&#39; - me(based on something voltaire said)</p>

<p>Another quote by Mark Twain comes to mind, &#39;If voting made any difference, it would be illegal&#39; </p>

<p>Like I have said many times, the form of reddit is the basis of a replacement for all voting systems as we know them and is as such is inherently subversive.  As such I only expect issues like this to become more and more frequent as the status quo chafes against the future.  Oh and it may result in a lot of us having to go to jail or the ministry of love or whatever they call it now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, just as a strategy to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and all those who question things look stupid, and possibly as a means of justifying censorship, people here should be using common sense. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how &quot;they&quot; could set this up as a trap for us &quot;nutters&quot;:</p>

<p>Create a website or create fake data showing lots of strange activity for a somewhat innocuous business, post something to reddit and encourage people in the area to &quot;investigate&quot;.  Depend on how badly those &quot;investigating&quot; act, use it as justification to censor real covert operations under the guise that those &quot;conspiracy nuts&quot; are getting out of hand again.  If the actions are super bad, draft a law and introduce it to congress.</p>

<p>Again, people reading these things have to use common sense or it simply justifies censorship, or worse.  The people who work these dark allies of control and manipulation will use all sorts of dirty tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im deleting my account and my other account <a href="/u/derriere_hole">/u/derriere_hole</a>. Ive realized that anyone born after 1989 is now in the job market and in positions of power and control. It didnt take long but they reprogrammed almost everyone. Tptb started to notice that they couldnt accomplish it with anyone pre 89. They started retraining society to adhere to the new standards that would allow them to continue working on whatever they are doing to bring 1984 into reality. There&#39;s a story on the front page right now about a rape joke on the xx chromosomes sub. Everyone is going to say rape isnt funny...where&#39;s your sense of humor? There&#39;s comedy clubs people pay money to get into. There&#39;s a default joke sub. Its a joke, but because 1 woman disagreed with the content her story is upvoted. This definitely pushes some type of agenda. Instead of having a sitewide vote the admins assign default subs. Where&#39;s the default yx sub? Arent we all about equality now? They know men wont make a fuss. Men dont care. What happened to atheism and politics sub? Godless critics arent allowed to express opinions or thoughts. The past 2 weeks theres been 2 stories about japanese crimes in ww2 that have made it to the front page. Why? What are they planning against the japanese? Why are they trying to lift guilt from the german atrocities in ww2. Why the same story make it twice to the top? Remember the matad crucible? Seemed legit too until they threw in a screen cap to from  an insurance commercial to discredit it. All comments were deleted. Younger kids are easier to program. Thats why we&#39;ll never have a charlie hebdo type rally. Thats why we werent present as a country at the rally. They wouldnt want to give us the wrong impression...we stand and are alone. Every single one of us. You older peeps have been cool but time to stop wasting my time on this site with panty wearing bitches that easily get offended...programed into this position. This 4chan shit seems legit for now. Btw im a truck driver and get to choose my loads from my dispatcher so il be requesting a load to SLC and I will be parking my ass in front of this place...im going to magically break down. Not safe to disclose but if you dont see my pics or videos from my stay there over at 4chan then you guys know what happened and if something nefarious is truly going on here. By now im sure everyones hands are clean. Thats if I actually get to make it there. You know why immigration will never be reformed in this country? Because those people havent been to our schools, havent watched our tv and havent consumed our food. The border isnt designed to keep people out....it designed to keep people inside. The right type of people. Were too stupid to see that the government tells us everything theyre up to. Disguised as entertainment through tv and movies. Im bringing along my manhole cover lift from my utility days to see whats underground. See ya guys on the other side... its been fun!</p>

<p>&#39;Find who and what you cannot mock and learn, then you will know who rules you and how they do it&#39; - me(based on something voltaire said)</p>

<p>Another quote by Mark Twain comes to mind, &#39;If voting made any difference, it would be illegal&#39;</p>

<p>Like I have said many times, the form of reddit is the basis of a replacement for all voting systems as we know them and is as such is inherently subversive. As such I only expect issues like this to become more and more frequent as the status quo chafes against the future. Oh and it may result in a lot of us having to go to jail or the ministry of love or whatever they call it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but i&#39;m having trouble understanding the limits to that. What&#39;s the difference between a local McDonalds making front page(or any PUBLIC BUILDING) and this? In both examples, someone can easily figure out where the place is at and walk up to &quot;observe&quot; or take pictures. The whole &quot;They probably got harassed or something&quot; explanation is non-consistent and implies that any public building can request something to be taken out of Reddit because they were &quot;harassed,&quot; which is a possible outcome for <strong>any public building that reaches Reddit.</strong> This introduces the classic &quot;Well, where do you draw the line?&quot; Using what we know, this would mean that there is an underlying variable that isn&#39;t being discussed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no clue. I&#39;m the last person to jump in on conspiracy theories, but this whole thing just doesn&#39;t add up logically to me. From a mathematical standpoint, solving a math problem, in general, involves finding the relevant variables and placing them onto their respective sides, but what happens when you get the sqrt(negative number)? You use imaginary numbers to represent it. Back in the day, imaginary numbers were regarded as fictional because little was known about them(where the name came from), but now we accept them to be real. The unknown &quot;variable&quot; that i&#39;m referring to in this discussion can be thought of as an imaginary number from back in the day, and until more information is given - the equation doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. I&#39;ve been following this for a day or so now and I&#39;m still on the fence about whether or not to believe the whole thing. Part of me thinks that maybe all of this shit is true. The evidence that has been pulled up by various redditors is quite convincing to say the least. Then again there&#39;s another part of me that puts this in the same category as all other whacked out theories. Well, I hope that if it is a child sex trafficking ring it gets shut down....and if it&#39;s just an old lady who wants to stay busy during the day, well then then I&#39;d like that even better</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USSC has ruled similar cases that people in their homes have an expected right to privacy.  </p>

<p>Concerning business their rulings have been defined pretty narrowly in terms of defining that &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; clause.  I can&#39;t remember the specific legalese, but it ran to the effect of a) if you&#39;re on their property (outside) without consent exterior shots and &#39;close-ups&#39; (see: legalease) are legal without owner consent.  b) Interiors require consent.  Schools, religious facilities, gov&#39;t buildings, military bases all have their own individual nuances in definition of property lines and and &#39;close-up&#39;.  Parking lots, parks, and even some open spaces continue to be brought before the court for various reasons.</p>

<p>In this particular instance, the pictures that show an individual inside the building would probably be ruled illegal.  While the filming did take place outside, the fact it clearly showed the interiors of a business would destroy any argument.  Considering it may even be classified as a school, you&#39;re cooked (see: jail time).</p>

<p>I was in video production for a long time filming communities.  Considering I was working on behalf of the town I was filming, most places didn&#39;t care as I just carried around a letter from the mayor, a few did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were a legit and normal business I feel they would have made a public statement or called local police (which we would probably know about). Or a legit business would have talked to a redditor that has dropped by and there would be a clearer explanation. </p>

<p>People are peeking in to graves and posting pics of it on reddit. They even told what cemetary they did it in, but mods ignored the requests by locals asking for it to be removed. Apples to oranges, i know..maybe those mods just didnt respect the dead. Either way, saying discussion can&#39;t happen will make people dig further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just happened to stumble across this thread. For the record, I can see why people were concerned about the rather mysterious air about this daycare but then again, that photo of the two little girls entering said daycare? Too close to crossing the personal invasion line for my tastes.</p>

<p>If it was (is?) a legitimate day care operation and I had a bunch of random redditors bandying photos of my daughters around, I&#39;d be pissed. You may have the ability to take photos of anyone on the street under current laws, but does that make it right? Especially if the subject of the photos are two unsuspecting little girls? I dunno. It gives me the heebie-jeebies.</p>

<p>Just my $.02 worth as an interested bystander to this thread.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a nice platitude, but if I post someone&#39;s personal information on Reddit and they become harassed as a result, saying &quot;the free flow of information ensures the ultimate welfare of the people&quot; doesn&#39;t change the fact that real people are being hurt. It is, like I said, putting some admiral but nebulous political ideal over real life results.</p>

<p>So far as we know, innocent people are being harassed with phone calls, trespassing, <em>strangers taking pictures in their windows</em> and now even their purchases are being scrutinized and people are attempting to get law enforcement agency (Customs) involved. The highest moral concern should be for the real human beings that are being affected. The &quot;ultimate welfare of the people&quot; is not being helped here at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No “platitude” is involved in anything I’ve said.  In the long term, the free flow of information absolutely ensures the ultimate welfare of everyone.  First and foremost, no one was posting personal information in that OP.  It was all publicly available.  Secondly, ensuring the ultimate welfare of everyone does not mean that “no one will ever get inconvenienced or even injured.”  Shit happens.  This <em>is</em> a fucked up planet.  However, all you have to have is a modicum of common sense to realize that if everyone had access to a free flow level of information, then no sooner would someone get harassed than the person doing the harassing would themselves be FOUND OUT - effectively undercutting any ultimate harassment efforts in the future.  Why?  Because all information is available - including that of the harassers.</p>

<p>Duh.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No.  Actually, so far as we know, there is a place that seems to be sketchy as all hell and has all the earmarks of possibly having some underground, shady shit going on.  There is EVIDENCE that the place being talked about in the SLC thread is NOT on the “up and up”.  This isn’t a case where something is being made out of nothing.  If it indeed WERE nothing, then threads wouldn’t be getting shut down without enough critical analysis taking place and that SLC place would have pretty quickly been found out as “just another daycare center”.</p>

<p>That hasn’t happened, however.  There are a lot of different things that would be happening - a lot of tale tell signs (kids, parents, cars, activity, etc…and not just the occasional scant knock on the door by a lonely child or two) - if that place were in fact a day care center that actually AREN’T happening…and <em>that</em> deserves a bit of scrutiny.  The fact that a bit of inquiry into the place’s public records has been shut down so quickly really does make one wonder wtf is going on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The highest moral concern should be for the real human beings that are being affected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly - like the thousands of children that have been PROVEN to be abducted and molested across the globe by clandestine operations not all that dissimilar to the one in question.</p>

<p>Think about what you’re saying for a moment.  Just <em>think</em> about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ultimate welfare of the people&quot; is not being helped here at all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It’s absolutely not.  And you know why?  Because, like I said, further inquiry into wtf this place in reality is has been shut the fuck down by the administrators of this PTB-controlled website.</p>

<p>So yeah.  You’re right.  The ultimate welfare of the people ISN’T being helped here at all.</p>

<p>That’s part of the point.  It NEEDS to be.</p>

<p>I don’t quite think you understand that though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The removal of the discussion is asinine on every level.  Everything was public record.  Hell, I ran a company (now defunct) about ten years ago.  All my old information is still out there and floating about in the ether, do I like that?  Not in the slightest, but it was part of the risk of running a business and risk is <em>the</em> nature of running a business.  The whole point of the public record is to have a record available to the public.  People say there&#39;s some imaginary line where it&#39;s not ok to post public information, and they&#39;re wrong.  States require there be a public record of ownership. Ask yourself why that would be, if they didn&#39;t expect the public to, at some point, review and disseminate that record.  </p>

<p>If Buisness X is given multiple citations over the years for failure to comply to regulatory standards, where would you think a reporter would find the information on who owns Business X?  The public record.  Would they let people know who owns Business X or would they tip-toe around names and addresses for fear of the owners harassment?  What if you, as a person, find that Business X has multiple citations over the years for failure to comply to regulatory standards?  By this &#39;thin-line&#39; logic then, I&#39;m not supposed to tell other people who owns this business?  That&#39;s absurd on every level.</p>

<p>Educate yourself as a user of the system in which you are engaged.  If you want to run a business, but don&#39;t&#39; want people to know it&#39;s you who owns it, then don&#39;t run a business or have someone else organize your articles of incorporation, or list some guy who has been dead since 1945 and hope no one ever catches on.  If you don&#39;t like that states keep public records of business owners because &#39;the devils on the internet can see it and give it to people&quot; then contact your local legislators and try to do something about it.  Don&#39;t cry foul because we use it as it&#39;s supposed to be used.  Did people do really dumb shit with that information?  Yes.  People do dumb shit all the fucking time, everywhere, every day.  This is as absurd as the whole &quot;caution, your coffee is hot&quot;.  Just because people can&#39;t exhibit common sense, everyone shall suffer and everything will be (and arguably is) programmed to accommodate to the least common denominator.
