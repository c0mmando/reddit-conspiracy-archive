<blockquote>
<p>Those who are observant have noticed a dangerous trend in the United States, as well as worldwide, and that is the resorting of various governments at different levels to mandating forced vaccination upon the public at large. </p>

<p>My State of Mississippi has one of the most-restrictive vaccine-exemption laws in the United States, where exemptions are allowed only upon medical recommendation. </p>

<p>Ironically, this is only on paper, as many have had as many as three physicians, some experts in neurological damage caused by vaccines, provide written calls for exemption, only to be turned down by the State’s public-health officer.</p>

<p>Worse are the States, such as Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland, where forced vaccinations have either been mandated by the courts, the state legislature, or have such legislation pending. </p>

<p>All of such policies strongly resemble those policies found in National Socialist empires, Stalinist countries, or Communist China.</p>

<p>When public-health officers are asked for the legal justification for such draconian measures as forcing people to accept vaccines that they deem either a clear and present danger to themselves and their loved ones or have had personal experience with serious adverse reactions to such vaccines, they usually resort to the need to protect the public.</p>

<p>One quickly concludes that if the vaccines are as effective as being touted by the public-health officials, then why should one fear the unvaccinated? Obviously the vaccinated would have at least 95% protection. </p>

<p>This question puts them in a very difficult position. Their usual response is that a “small” percentage of the vaccinated will not have sufficient protection and would still be at risk. Now, if they admit what the literature shows, that vaccine failure rates are much higher than the 5% they claim, they must face the next obvious question – then why should anyone take the vaccine if there is a significant chance it will not protect?</p>

<p>When pressed further, they then resort to their favorite justification, the Holy Grail of the vaccine proponents – herd immunity. This concept is based upon the idea that 95% (and some now say 100%) of the population must be vaccinated to prevent an epidemic. </p>

<p>The percentages needing vaccination grows progressively. I pondered this question for some time before the answer hit me. Herd immunity is mostly a myth and applies only to natural immunity – that is, contracting the infection itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Is Herd Immunity Real?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason for this is that naturally-acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. </p>

<p>The vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But, there was one major problem – vaccine-induced immunity lasted for only a relatively short period, from 2 to 10 years at most, and then this applies only to humoral immunity. </p>

<p>This is why they began, silently, to suggest boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.</p>

<p>Then they discovered an even greater problem, the boosters were lasting for only 2 years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those which they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. </p>

<p>The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.</p>

<p>That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. </p>

<p>It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. </p>

<p>In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.</p>

<p>If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection. </p>

<p>That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.</p>

<p>When we examine the scientific literature, we find that for many of the vaccines protective immunity was 30 to 40%, meaning that 70% to 60% of the public has been without vaccine protection. </p>

<p>Again, this would mean that with a 30% to 40% vaccine-effectiveness rate combined with the fact that most people lost their immune protection within 2 to 10 year of being vaccinated, most of us were without the magical 95% number needed for herd immunity. This is why vaccine defenders insist the vaccines have 95% effectiveness rates.</p>

<p>Without the mantra of herd immunity, these public-health officials would not be able to justify forced mass vaccinations. I usually give the physicians who question my statement that herd immunity is a myth a simple example. </p>

<p>When I was a medical student almost 40 years ago, it was taught that the tetanus vaccine would last a lifetime. Then 30 years after it had been mandated, we discovered that its protection lasted no more than 10 years. Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus? Most have not. </p>

<p>I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections – one sees no rise in tetanus cases. The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections. It was, and still is, all a myth.</p>

<p>The entire case for forced mass vaccination rest upon this myth and it is important that we demonstrate the falsity of this idea. Neil Z. Miller, in his latest book The Vaccine Information Manual, provides compelling evidence that herd immunity is a myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Those pushing mandatory vaccination for an ever-growing list of diseases are a mixed bag. Some are quite sincere and truly want to improve the health of the United States. They believe the vaccine-induced herd immunity myth and likewise believe that vaccines are basically effective and safe. These are not the evil people.</p>

<p>A growing number are made of those with a collectivist worldview and see themselves as a core of elite wise men and women who should tell the rest of us what we should do in all aspects of our lives. </p>

<p>They see us as ignorant cattle, who are unable to understand the virtues of their plan for America and the World. Like children, we must be made to take our medicine – since, in their view, we have no concept of the true benefit of the bad-tasting medicine we are to be fed.</p>

<p>I have also found that a small number of people in the regulatory agencies and public health departments would like to speak out but are so intimidated and threatened with dismissal or destruction of their careers, that they remain silent. As for the media, they are absolutely clueless.</p>

<p>I have found that “reporters” (we have few real journalists these days) rarely understand what they are reporting on and always trust and rely upon people in positions of official power, even if those people are unqualified to speak on the subject. </p>

<p>Most of the time they run to the Centers for Disease Control or medical university to seek answers. I cannot count the number of times I have seen university department heads interviewed when it was obvious they had no clue as to the subject being discussed. Few such professors will pass up an opportunity to appear on camera or be quoted in a newspaper.</p>

<p>One must also appreciate that such reporters and editors are under an enormous economic strain, as vaccine manufacturers are major advertisers in all media outlets and for an obvious reason – it controls content. </p>

<p>A number of excellent stories on such medical subjects are spiked every day. That means we will always be relegated to the “fringe media” as our media outlets are called. Despite the high quality of the journalism in many of the “fringe” outlets, they have a much smaller audience. And despite this we are having an enormous effect on the debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>As the Public Awakens, the Collectivist Becomes Desperate</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>John Jewkes, in his book Ordeal by Planning, observed that as the British collectivists began to see opposition rise to their grandiose plans, they became more desperate and aggressive in their reaction. </p>

<p>They then initiated a campaign of smearing their opponents and blaming every failure on the unwillingness of the people to accept the planner’s dictates without question. </p>

<p>We certainly have seen this in this debate –opponents to forced vaccinations are referred to as fringe scientists, kooks, uneducated, confused, and enemies of public safety – reminiscent of Stalin’s favorite phrase, “enemy of the people.”</p>

<p>This desperation is based upon their fear that the public might soon catch on to the fact that the entire vaccine program is based upon nonsense, fear, and concocted fairy tales. </p>

<p>One special fear of theirs is that the public might discover the fact that most vaccines are contaminated with a number of known and yet-to-be discovered viruses, bacteria, viral fragments, and DNA/RNA fragments. And, further, that our science demonstrates that these contaminants could lead to a number of slowly-developing degenerative diseases, including degenerative diseases of the brain. </p>

<p>This is rarely discussed but is of major importance in this debate.</p>

<p>I understand your concern from your point of view though.</p>

<p>And my answer is no, I would not vaccinate my child.  Not much coming from me though, as I have no children or hope of having one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And to tell you the truth, I would probably vaccinate (mind you minimally and spaces far apart against the highest risk ) if there were no harmful preservatives in the shot. I would in fact pay big $$ for a &quot;clean&quot; immunization. I think the theory behind  vaccination o be both fascinating and genius. I just think our current vaccines ez are sketchy as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what I mean, don&#39;t divert what I am saying: I mean without the harmful preservative. Vaccines ultimately work by allowing our immune system to combat the gimped virus. I am sure there are better ways to disable the virus and preserve it. But I could be wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>And as I said, they have this knowledge and should be taking precautions. These people have many bugs out to kill them. (Even bugs that have no vaccine) It is up to them to be safe. I should not have to be force medicated because another person is sick. Do you really think their death is inevitable? I have known people who are old and sick and dying. I recently lost a good friend to cancer. She was going to die weather I gave her the flu or not. I was sure never to visit with her if I felt a sickness comig on, and I made sure never to have close contact with her that would allow any possible bug get to her.  What if people just knew how to be sanitary and considerate? It should apply to any virus. There are so many that vaccination does not even touch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about autism. I have issue injecting thimerosol and aluminum into a small child. I also have issue injecting said substances into myself for boosters or flu shots. </p>

<p>I understand that children have died from various diseases. Children die for many reasons. To me, the statistics are not &quot;scary&quot; enough or convincing enough to justify this. </p>

<p>The &quot;facts&quot; from both sides of this debate are subject to interpretation, both sides with massive amounts of propahanda. I think its fine as it is currently. A personal choice to vaccinate. No forcible shit.</p>

<p>I do not want a government who would force something upon me. That could be more of a reason for concern than a slightly lower &quot;herd immunity&quot; caused by the minority of &quot;antivaxers&quot;. But that is just my opinion/theory.</p>

And the style of this sub isn&#39;t exactly sympathetic to mainstream science. What the hell do you expect?</p>

<p>I mean, I could post this: </p>

<p><a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/7/911.full">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/7/911.full</a></p>

<p>But are any of us qualified to argue at that level? And by level, I don&#39;t just mean that summarized article, but the 40 additional articles that it is created from. And the countless further cited articles that require an IDSA membership to even look at?</p>

<p>I would say, if you want the discussion to happen on Reddit, and involve people who are educated on the subject, then post to <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not a place for scientific debate. Never has been, never will be. For the reason I wouldn&#39;t ask questions about physics, or music theory. And I wouldn&#39;t go to <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> asking for an unbiased and decent discussion about atheism or Hinduism. Personally I come here for occasionally interesting discussions about strange goings on in politics, media, etc. But I don&#39;t come here for a bunch of unqualified and emotional driven and hugely biased discussions on science.</p>

<p>You are exactly right. This is the main problem.  </p>

<p>My experience is that science corrupts itself by building believe-systems for each specialization instead of adaptive models. The scientific method and the &quot;peer&quot;-review system emphasizes this.<br/>
The specialists that are &quot;authorities&quot; in their field tend to be conservative in their models, even when new evidence for other models are presented. And these specialists encourage the development of models (and believe-systems) that strengthen their own believes. These do not need verification.  </p>

<p>One of the reasons I started <a href="/r/corruptscience">/r/corruptscience</a>  </p>

<p>I am not a specialist in the immune system, but I sometimes know more than the specialists in the field themselves.  </p>

<p>Did you know that too [b]little[/b] exposure to pathogens can damage the immune system? The immune system must do a certain amount of work, and if it can&#39;t attack something else, it can attack the body itself. And this can lead to all kinds of auto-immune problems.</p>

<p>But there is no money to be earned with this knowledge, so this kind of research is not done much and forgotten by many &quot;authorities&quot;.  </p>

<p>I think a partial solution to the problem would be to create a patent free health care system, where companies can not earn money with their &quot;special invention&quot; that everyone &quot;needs&quot;. And where &quot;authorities&quot; get pay from these companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Einstein quote simply applies to explaining complicated subjects to a layperson. But it doesn&#39;t mean that that layperson will now be able to go on and refute / challenge those ideas based on a simple understanding. To do that would require much more effort, education, specialization. I mean, I somewhat understand his relativity theory, but if someone asked me challenge it, or discuss it any kind of meaningful way, I would probably go hide in a closet.</p>

<p>What the OP is asking for is a discussion of very high level epidemiology / bio-medicine. This is an area where the discussion does require the involvement of specialized individuals. You cannot avoid &#39;appeal to authority&#39; when it comes to MANY issues - particularly hard core science. Herd immunity is a complex scientific concept, so it needs to be discussed in a scientific context by people at least fairly well educated on the subject. I&#39;m really averse to this idea of laypeople usurping very complex issues, and then claiming their own authority / equal voice with even less credibility then the person they usurped it from. It&#39;s craziness. This isn&#39;t to say things shouldn&#39;t be questioned - it&#39;s saying that if you&#39;re going to question something, at least be even slightly aware (and humble) regarding complexities of the issue. </p>

<p>As for your last point - even though it seems simple, I have really no idea if that&#39;s really the case. I would like to hear someone specialized to explain it in more detail. There is possibly more complicated issues at work that aren&#39;t being considered (which wouldn&#39;t be surprising).</p>
