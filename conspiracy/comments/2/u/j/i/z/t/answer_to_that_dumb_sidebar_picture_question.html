       Unvaccinated children are a risk to vaccinated children because the diseases that the unvaccinated children get infected with can/will evolve if enough people become infected.  That is how diseases work.  Once the disease mutates/evolves into a new strain, the vaccinated people are no longer immune to the disease.  There is also no vaccination for any new strains of the Measles (for example) since no new strain currently exists and therefor no vaccination has been made.  Thus, vaccinated children are now in harms way because some idiot thinks Jenny McCarthy knows more about vaccines than medical professionals do.

       What? Whose side are you on, you muppet!? You must never, ever admit that vaccines might be ineffective. Why not go full retard and suggest that some vaccines have been known to cause adverse side-effects?

       It's true that vaccines aren't 100%. Some might, a lot aren't. It may also depend on the person. Back to effectiveness, take the flu for example: the yearly vaccine is only for the a few strains that are predicted to be most prominent for that season. Apparently this gives you only 60% chance of not getting flu. Another good example is the hep b vaccine, which many people have had to get revaccinated years later because their first vaccine didn't work.

       You guys ever consider that maybe "the cabal" wants people to think the vaccines are bad so they don't take them then these disease outbreaks happen and thin the population out? IMO it is much easier to pay one person to disagree with the consensus than it does to pay a bunch of people to agree to a consensus. Just a different take, if you believe these things come from TPTB

       Think a few more moves ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabal wants to be able to inject you and your family with whatever they want. If they want to sterilize you, they will sterilize you. If they want you to develop cancer, they will give you cancer. The vaccine is the perfect vehicle for them to put X substance into your body. But there's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people have figured this out. Solution: Hire a dimwit like Jenny McCarthy to "represent" the anti-vaccine movement and make them all look stupid. The mainstream will then associate anybody who questions vaccines with Jenny McCarthy and not even bother to examine the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       To continue the process, they then hire social media shills to magnify the impression that anti-vaxxers are anti-science, insane, etc. Which brings us to this post.

       Meanwhile, measles were nearly non-existent in the United States because that evil "cabal" wanted kids not to die of the measles?
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that people aren't vaccinating because they are ignorant of history, measles (and the resulting deaths) are back. That's the "evidence" you want people to watch out for?

       Yeah, because the government sends out labeled vaccines to make sure the right person gets cancer. No. That is not accurate. PCPs give out vaccines, for the most part. How would the government get the right vaccine to the right person without causing suspicion to PCPs. Your theory does not work.

       I'm not thinking about the cabal doing anything.  I'm assuming that there is no conspiracy on this one and that the vaccines have been working pretty god damn great as a few horrible diseases are all but eradicated if not for the people who don't get vaccinated.  Look at our average life span since vaccinations.  Look at the instances of crippling Polio and Small Pox deaths and Measles deaths and Diphtheria deaths.  If this is a conspiracy it is a conspiracy to keep people alive/healthier longer.

       So Polio is running rampant in America as we speak?  I guess Small Pox is probably killing thousands of people a year too?  I see that you have a big long presentation there but where are all the current cases of Polio?  I can walk around and see that it is gone.  That might not fit the anti-vax narrative you are pulling for but that's the reality.

       Educating yourself isn't just reading the stuff that agrees with your opinion and ignoring the stuff that doesn't.  That is confirmation bias.  It's the opposite of educating yourself.  It is reinforcing bad ideas.  Where is small pox?  If the vaccine made it worse why is it gone now?  The disease should still be evolving and ravaging the population.  Why did it die off if the vaccines had the opposite effect?  How do you explain this stuff?  Miracles?

       You can cite shit to bad sources.  But that doesn't even matter.  Where is Polio now?  Where is Small Pox?  Where is Diphtheria?  Where is Measles (until some unvaccinated person began spreading it at Disney)?  If these vaccines are having an inverse effect and actually making the diseases worse why did they go away and why are we living longer?  Why can't you just look around at what is currently going on and realize that vaccination works.  In the early 50s before the Salk vaccine there were over 50,000 cases of Polio a year.  Now (after the vaccinations) there are 0.  Are you saying this is just a coincidence that the disease went away after the vaccinations started?

       As mentioned in the linked post, the classification of polio was changed the same year the polio vaccine was introduced. The numbers you are using are incorrect. The classification did more to decrease the numbers of reported cases of polio than the vaccination. Seriously, read the post (if not you then anyone reading this thread and thinking kgt5003 has a leg to stand on.) The sources are legitimate.

       Welp, I'm a convert. Keep up the good fight, if not for who you are arguing with, then for who is reading the argument. I was legitimately on the fence about the efficacy of vaccines, but now I'm not. It's one more control vector. I wonder if a connection can be made between the pro-choice position and vaccine resistance? It seems that it comes back to body sovereignty and who has the ultimate right to determine intervention. I can see an early contention in children's rights to vaccine access, but maybe there would be a way to get ahead of the argument.

       I get that the classification changed (which incidentally is also why cases of Autism have gone up recently - more people are being diagnosed under the umbrella of Autism) but Polio is easy to see.  In a good amount of instances a person will get high fever and won't recover for months and will end up wheelchair bound.  Where is that happening now?  It isn't.  If Polio was still rampant you'd see a couple hundred instances of this happening every year.

       Your question is answered within the first few paragraphs of the linked post. Its stunning, all you have to do is click the link. 1 in 1000 people develop mild paralysis that resolves within a couple of weeks. If paralytic polio isn't counted until past 20 days of paralysis, then there wouldn't be any reported cases of paralytic polio! Further in the link, the connection is made between a poor diet and polio susceptibility.

       It feels as though your asking me to do some sort of book report for you. Every question you have asked is discussed at length in the post that axolotl linked you. Every single one.

       Right.. I did read that.. but there are 0 cases of permanent paralysis since vaccinations have eradicated Polio.  There would be some.  It wasn't common but it did occur.  This is something people would notice if Polio was still happening.  Every year there would be a couple of cases where the person doesn't recover and is permanently paralyzed in some limbs.  It has been decades and this has happened 0 times since the vaccinations.  According to what the person who made this link said, the vaccinations actually made things worse so you would think you'd see this happening more frequently instead of not at all.

       How did they blow their public trust?  The Western medical workers, that is?  By ending polio and diphtheria and Small Pox with vaccinations?  People are living to be 80 instead of 60.  If there are evil doctors doing the bidding of these "parasites" why the hell are more people living longer healthier lives instead of dying off?  Seems like modern medicine (vaccines included in this) is actually keeping people alive....

       So now you are saying that vaccines are the cause of Cancer and Altzheimers and diabetes?  Even if that were true (which it isn't) it would still be safer for everyone to get vaccinated than it would be for everyone not to.  Your chances of living longer would still be greater (especially since such a small percentage of people actually end up getting these diseases compared to the total population).  Also my great grandfather (who was not vaccinated for anything) got Altzheimers and I have another grandfather who was not vaccinated who died of colon cancer that spread thru his body.  So I guess some people just get these diseases naturally and others have it injected into them thru the vaccines?  So by getting vaccinated you can get Cancer, Altzhemers, diabetes, etc (but at least you wont get MMR, polio, diphtheria, small pox, etc.).. but if you don't get vaccinated you can still get Cancer, Altzheimers, diabetes, etc... but now you can also get the diseases you are protected from thru vaccination... Soooo you should still get vaccinated.

       Stop pretending that you have inside information.  You are just guessing at shit.  A lot of it doesn't hold water and a lot of it can be disproven if you would read the other side of the argument and actually listen to it.

       So you want to die sooner?  I feel sorry for you.  I have a good life and I enjoy it.  I have friends and family who I love.  I have a job that I don't mind going to every day that pays me pretty well.  I have hobbies that I like to do and sports I like to play.  Why shouldn't I want to live longer?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes.. modern medicine is a key factor in living longer.  If you get sick you should take antibiotics that can help you not be sick.  If you need surgery you should get surgery so you will be better.  If you have asthma you should get an inhaler.  If you have diabetes you should monitor your blood sugar level.  What is so scary about modern medicine?  You should just let yourself die in these situations?

       Also, with all of the side effects with taking everything from toothpaste to nail polish remover to everyday cleaning products, i think a person will have to be overly trusting, willfully ignorant or an astro-turfer to deny the possibility that vaccines aren't as safe as they‘re claimed to be.

       We've been using them for decades and the average lifespan has gotten longer and the cases of diseases that vaccines fight against have gone down and in some cases been completely eradicated.  The proof is available to see.

       No, granted, we may be living longer but we are also facing more chronic disease, that shows a rise in cancer from the 70‘s to the 90‘s.  Hey man, keep those blinders on all you want. Have a nice day

       Right and you are saying that is from vaccines?  Maybe it's from fake sugar?  Maybe it's from cell phones?  There are countless things you can attribute that to.  Trying to tie it to vaccines doesn't work because people who don't get vaccinated still get cancer (as my grandfather did).

       Sooooo?  What are you getting at?  Why are people living longer healthier lives with vaccines?  We can expect to live until 80 now instead of 50 or 60.  Why aren't these evil vaccines killing people?

       Also.. it has everything to do with biology... You can watch a disease under a microscope evolve right before your eyes.  This is provable science.  This isn't any sort of conjecture.  You can see this happen for yourself.  Biology quite literally in action.

       It's true that vaccines aren't 100%. Some might, a lot aren't. It may also depend on the person. Back to effectiveness, take the flu for example: the yearly vaccine is only for the a few strains that are predicted to be most prominent for that season. Apparently this gives you only 60% chance of not getting flu. Another good example is the hep b vaccine, which many people have had to get revaccinated years later because their first vaccine didn't work.
