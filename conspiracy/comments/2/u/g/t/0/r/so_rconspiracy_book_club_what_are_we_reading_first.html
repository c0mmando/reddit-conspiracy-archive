       Thats why you dont understand. There are so many things in RL that this kind of perspective parallels.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the good always took control instead of the evil, then r/conspiracy would never have existed in the first place. For some reason, evil things tend to take control during pivotal moments of human history. I believe one of orwells purposes was to highlight why it is important to be able to identify these pivotal moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       That maybe in the future, the dogs will win instead of the pigs.

       I'm cool with almost anything by Crowley or Sutton, TBH, but just looked bad my past Amazon purchases lately instead of watching the commercials last night and wanted to get the ball rolling.

       I didn't want this to get too big, but if we were gonna put out a syllabus-type of thing these books would definitely be on the

       I disagree with some of his conclusions, but I understand where he's coming from and agree with his motivations. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. As long as you're able to maintain an intellectual distance I think it's a fabulous read.

       Lol thanks for keeping up with this, miss. To be honest, i had forgotten about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, the first thing should be nominations. But, i ran into an issue immediately when thinking about this..
      </p>
      <p>
       PDF vs Bound
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is better? Personally, i much prefer to read bound books, as i write notes and shit all over the place in between paragraphs and pages. This way, i can refer back again and make connecetions to other places or marks or even different books that i wouldnt have been able to do otherwise. PDFs dont really offer this as efficiently. But, bound books have a price.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find most PDFs for free, if you know where to look. So this should probably come into consideration for those of us who want to participate, but would rsther not invest any money (i know most books are around $20, but even that can sometimes be cumbersome to those of us who are wage slaves and must budget even for a $20 book).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, maybe we can have two different, threads?, of books. One for bound books, one for pdfs, just so we can garner as much participation as possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just a thought, whatever we do, at least we should discuss this. Maybe its not even an issue? (Im not worried about it now that i have a new job, but i know some folks might be in the kind of situation i was in not too long ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, would we be doing "checkpoints"? Like, after x amount of chapters we get back with everybody to discuss?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few thoughts i had. Im glad youre keeping up with this, and im excited to see whst happens!

        The Franklin Cover-Up
       </a>
       .

      <p>
       <em>
        The shut-down of Omaha, Nebraska's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, raided by federal agencies in November 1988, sent shock waves all the way to Washington, D.C. $40 million was missing. The credit union's manager: Republican Party activist Lawrence E. "Larry" King, Jr., behind whose rise to fame and riches stood powerful figures in Nebraska politics and business, and in the nation's capital.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In the face of opposition from local and state law enforcement, from the FBI, and from the powerful Omaha World-Herald newspaper, a special Franklin committee of the Nebraska Legislature launched its own probe. What looked like a financial swindle, soon exploded into a hideous tale of drugs, Iran-Contra money-laundering, a nationwide child abuse ring, and ritual murder.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Nineteen months later, the legislative committee's chief investigator died - suddenly, and violently, like more than a dozen other people linked to the Franklin case. Author John DeCamp knows the Franklin scandal from the inside. In 1990, his "DeCamp memo" first publicly named the alleged high-ranking abusers. Today, he is attorney for two of the abuse victims. Using documentation never before made public, DeCamp lays bare not only the crimes, but the cover-up - a textbook case of how dangerous the corruption of institutions of government, and the press, can be. In its sweep and in what it portends for the nation, the Franklin cover-up followed the ugly precedent of the Warren Commission.

       I prefer both, and I'll tell you why: A digital copy, whether PDF, mobi or epub, affords one the opportunity to read the book more conveniently on one's computer, e-book reader or mobile device, and can generally be more practical for purposes of casual research, if it is read only once, or if used only once or twice for purposes of reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm particularly fond of a certain book or author, I will likely procure a bound copy to add to my collection.

       There's a really interesting interview she gave on this book.  So funny you mentioned it as I have been thinking of it for a few days.. I am not sure if this is the exact one I watched years ago, there's a few up there for anyone interested.  It's certainly an interesting story.  I was heavily into the JFK assassination a few years back.

       Political ponerology by Andrzej Łobaczewski
      </p>
      <p>
       from wikipedia:
Łobaczewski adopted the term ponerology, which is derived from the Greek word poneros, from the branch of theology dealing with the study of evil. According to Łobaczewski, all societies vacillate between "happy times" and "unhappy times." During happy times, societies enjoy prosperity and suppress advanced psychological knowledge of psychopathological influence in the corridors of power. Though happy, these times are not necessarily morally advanced as the society's prosperity or happiness may be premised on the oppression of a target group. During unhappy times, the intelligentsia and society at large can recover this specialized knowledge to resolve the social order along mentally healthier lines.
A form of government interesting to ponerologists is one they have called pathocracy, in which individuals with personality disorders (especially psychopathy) occupy positions of power and influence. The result is a totalitarian system characterized by a government turned against its own people. A pathocracy may emerge when a society is insufficiently guarded against the typical and inevitable minority of such abnormal pathology, which Łobaczewski asserts is caused by biology or genetics. He argues that in such cases these individuals infiltrate an institution or state, prevailing moral values are perverted into their opposite, and a coded language like Orwell's doublethink circulates into the mainstream, using paralogic and paramoralism in place of genuine logic and morality.
There are various identifiable stages of pathocracy described by Łobaczewski. Ultimately, each pathocracy is foredoomed because the root of healthy social morality, according to Łobaczewski, is contained in the congenital instinctive infrastructure in the vast majority of the population. While some in the normal population are more susceptible to pathocratic influence, and become its lackeys, the majority instinctively resist.

        Language in thought and Action
       </a>
       by S. I. Hayakawa
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Renowned professor and former U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa discusses the role of language in human life, the many functions of language, and how language—sometimes without our knowing—shapes our thinking in this engaging and highly respected book. Provocative and erudite, it examines the relationship between language and racial and religious prejudice; the nature and dangers of advertising from a linguistic point of view; and, in an additional chapter called “The Empty Eye,” the content, form, and hidden message of television, from situation comedies to news coverage to political advertising.

       i recently read this book.  it was an absolute headtrip.  almost seems too ridiculous to not be disinfo, but is too crazy to be fiction.  it was an interesting read.  read up on Laura knight kazikstan or whatev her name is.  ive heard conflicting things.   if you liked it, you should def read sinister forces trilogy by peter lavenda.(which is amazingly sourced)

        Professor A. R. Butz was the first (and so far the only) writer to treat the entire Holocaust complex from the Revisionist perspective, in a precise scientific manner. This book exhibits the overwhelming force of historical and logical arguments which Revisionism had accumulated by the middle of the 70s. This new edition comes with several supplements adding new information.

       There's a really interesting interview she gave on this book.  So funny you mentioned it as I have been thinking of it for a few days.. I am not sure if this is the exact one I watched years ago, there's a few up there for anyone interested.  It's certainly an interesting story.  I was heavily into the JFK assassination a few years back.

       I prefer both, and I'll tell you why: A digital copy, whether PDF, mobi or epub, affords one the opportunity to read the book more conveniently on one's computer, e-book reader or mobile device, and can generally be more practical for purposes of casual research, if it is read only once, or if used only once or twice for purposes of reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm particularly fond of a certain book or author, I will likely procure a bound copy to add to my collection.
