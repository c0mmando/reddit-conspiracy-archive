<p>The Bank of Canada used to be a government lending institution, creating near interest free loans that built much of Canada’s infrastructure during the 50’s and 60’s. In 1974 at the Bank of International Settlements in Basel Switzerland, Trudeau Sr. was convinced by fellow Bilderberg attendees to dismantle this crucial function of the Bank of Canada, and since then we’ve lost sovereign control of our monetary policies and money supply and government debt at all levels has risen dramatically.This court case challenges the disuse of the Bank of Canada to create money for the public good.</p>

<p>The Federal Court of Canada has ruled against private central banking. Meanwhile, the Harper Govrenment<sup>TM</sup> has ordered a media black out on this court case. Lets help spread the word!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really important for the world, as every country is now run under a high interest pseudo-public debt-money banking system.</p>

<p>These central banks are all private, and it&#39;s all a big scam. If this happens in Canada, it will spread like wildfire throughout the world. Which is why I am almost positive this will be taken to the Supreme Court, there is no way the government will just let this happen.</p>

<p>Edit: By government letting this happen, I mean government letting the public find out about their big scam.</p>

<p>Funny enough I&#39;m not sure about the Judges in Canada&#39;s Supreme Court, but the fact that something like this could even get through to the Supreme Court is a good sign.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel too bad, we have Obama doing that for us. After all he is a British subject, born in Kenya. Every time I see William and Kate on US magazine covers I want to vomit. Why the fuck should America care about royal weddings? My once proud country now panders to inbred aristocrats that don&#39;t even wipe their own asses in a foreign country that we could easily dominate with very little effort. When I see Obama bowing to her majesty, I just think shouldn&#39;t she be bowing to us for being so kind as to not depose her and take over her country. We so good at dominating the rest of the world, why not go after someone who actually deserves it. </p>

<p>It did make me feel a little better when the petition to deport Piers Morgan gained so much traction after he tried to cheerlead an effort for the government to take our guns. We told him to go back to the country where they took the guns if you don&#39;t like it. At least the spirit of rebellion is still alive in the hearts of some of my countrymen although half are just sheep.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Have you not witnessed what the US has done to other countries most recently in the last 10 years and in the last century?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and I opposed all the wars in the middle east. I condemn the US for killing a million Iraqis (mostly women and children) with bombs and sanctions in the mid to late 90s which was part of the motivation for the attack on 9/11. I also condemn the US unwavering support for the terrorist state of Israel. The Brits share in our culpability in this matter. It was British soldiers dressed as Arabs that were driving around shooting Iraqi police. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but you&#39;re also so quick to apply military force to other countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not really. I wasn&#39;t talking about going crazy, just a light carpet bombing of Buckingham Palace. They aren&#39;t even British, they are German. Why should the royal family be respected? They are all products of incest; many have been born handicapped or deformed and then hidden away from the public&#39;s sight. In the south we call that humping cousins, hillbillies don&#39;t get much respect for that, why should the royals?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the queen really has no influence in Canada</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha, that&#39;s why you have to ask her for permission to shut down her government. The reason the Brits haven&#39;t deposed her is because she is their claim to your country. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s nothing more than a symbollic figure to us.</p>

<p>She is symbolic of Canada&#39;s cowardice to declare real independence. Face it Canada, you are all British subjects. </p>

<p>After publishing a report on systematic incest within the British Royal Family, a genetics researcher from Canada has released additional details, including the shocking allegation that Queen Elizabeth&#39;s parents were King George VI and his sister, Princess Mary, the Princess Royal.</p>

<p>While a single act of incest that results in a child being born to family members is enough to make most of us feel ill, one genetics researcher is now claiming that there is a system behind the breeding of British Royals, and it appears to have as its goal getting away with the closest family members possible producing children without the public catching on.</p>

<p>Royal families of the past, like the Hapsburgs, got into trouble when they bred for a single type of face. The resulting royals all looked virtually identical and finally grew horrifyingly deformed, as in the case of Charles II of Spain. But the modern royals in Britain seem to have gotten away with breeding brothers and sisters together, simply by choosing different face types, says a genetics researcher from British Columbia.</p>

<p>Susan Maureen Brandt says that it continually astounds her how, just when she thinks she has uncovered the worst act of incest breeding among royals, she realizes that there is an even worse case hiding next to it. After uncovering the secret bloodlines of Princess Diana and Kate Middleton (Diana was born to her known mother but fathered with the preserved semen of the deceased King George VI, while Kate was born to her known father and Catherine Ingrid Guinness, the granddaughter of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson - however, in both cases, their known parent is hiding amazing secret connections of their own: Diana&#39;s mother was secretly the child of Queen Elizabeth&#39;s uncle George and his wife Marina, and Kate&#39;s father is secretly related to actor James Mason, Winston Churchill, the Mitfords, and Empress Sisi), Brandt realized she was making a mistake to assume Elizabeth Bowes Lyon was Queen Elizabeth&#39;s biological mother.</p>

<p>The following set of photos, found by googling the persons involved, show the amazing resemblance between Queen Elizabeth, her sister Princess Margaret, and the woman Brandt says was clearly their real biological mother, Princess Mary, their father&#39;s sister. &quot;Even as a small child looking at a book about the British royals, I remember being surprised by the looks of Elizabeth Bowes Lyon. She didn&#39;t fit. But I never questioned that she wasn&#39;t their mother, because unless you&#39;re familiar with how often it&#39;s done amongst the rich and famous, and how successful baby-switching can be, it just doesn&#39;t cross a normal person&#39;s mind that a mother may not be the mother of her children.&quot;</p>

<p>Brandt also found supporting evidence in the lack of photos online of Elizabeth and Margaret with their Aunt Mary, and Mary refused to attend Elizabeth&#39;s wedding. Elizabeth Bowes Lyon&#39;s first royal event was the wedding of her friend, Princess Mary, in 1922. She married Princess Mary&#39;s brother the following year, but did not have a child for three years, when Mary had already produced two sons with her husband. It does indeed seem that Mary, who was married to a much older and much less attractive man, was being allowed to have two children of her own, then produced the two children with her brother, for him and his new wife, her friend, to raise. Brandt says it &quot;fits emotionally that Mary would have found it too upsetting to sit through the wedding of the daughter she had not been allowed to raise as her own.&quot;</p>

<p>There is one photo Brandt found online of Mary sitting next to the daughters she conceived with her brother. &quot;It&#39;s rather amazing, but sad too. I have no idea what it&#39;s like to live within a family like this, but obviously we&#39;ve been fooled to believe incest leads to deformities. Apparently it not only led to Hollywood [Brandt&#39;s other line of research] but it led to the Queen of England herself.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, America is an extremely warlike nation, even our national anthem is about war. If we are going to stop attacking the middle east, we need to find a new enemy or the US government will find one for us. I never liked the royals so it just makes good sense to me, besides as many countries as they have attacked its justified. It&#39;s either Buckingham or Israel. Our industry has been gutted and so war is the only thing that America is superior to the rest of the world so we lead with our strongest foot forward.   </p>

<p>Or the beginning of wars and major destructive chaos throughout the world. The same people that own/control central banking also have major control over governments, industry and infrastructure across most of the globe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some real truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again. However, take that power away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But if you wish to remain the slaves of Bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.” – Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, 1920s</p>

<p>“Once a nation parts with control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation’s laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.” – Mackenzie King, Canada’s 10th Prime Minister, 1938</p>

<p>One reason might be that this case doesn&#39;t seem to have actually resulted in the kind of decision people are claiming.  One of the lines in the order is this:</p>

<p>&quot;As this motion has only been partially successful no costs are awarded to either side.&quot;</p>

<p>This &quot;case&quot; is actually a motion appealing an order to strike an amended statement of claim.

<p>Yes, pretty much. Probably around WWI the government in Canada and the US figured out how to use fear to get the people to do what they want. They&#39;ve controlled more and more of the message since then... but we have to draw the line at telling the media what they can and can&#39;t say.</p>

<p>Not sure exactly what this lawsuit is about. But what we need to do is put the power of printing/lending money back into the hands of the bank of Canada, which is owned by the people of Canada... so there would be little to no interest on the borrowed money. </p>

<p>You can easily Google a phone number or email address for your MP. You should ask them why we are currently borrowing money from the private bank with interest when the constitution clearly gives The Bank of Canada the ability to control the money printed and lent. </p>

<p>Remember that it is those who are in control of the money that are actually in control of everything. That power should belong to the people and not to a money hungry corporation.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feed into the false choice which is the NDP, Liberal, or Conservative parties. All their policy resolutions lean towards more power, and more taxation to varying degrees. It&#39;s at it&#39;s worst when the bankers get in control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes.… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” – Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, 1815</p>

<p>“Once a nation parts with control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation’s laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.” – Mackenzie King, Canada’s 10th Prime Minister, 1938</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it will only get worse as time goes on, no matter which party is in power. This is why I immediately turn political conversations away from party ideologues. It&#39;s always interesting the responses I get from people when I ask them if they even really trust the government structure in the first place. Most people don&#39;t even realise income tax was illegal in the U.S. and Canada up until the early 1900s, and that it wasn&#39;t taken directly off your pay cheque until WWII.</p>

<p>You have formally studied economics AND law which I have to respect, although I tend to be sceptical of mainstream economic schools of thought. From my point of view income tax is essentially economic slavery, and a truly free market would have a government run on consumption taxes. Income tax on corporations makes sense, but not without regard to operating costs. In the U.S. the lack of consideration for operating costs in the corporate income tax structure has actually created a breeding ground for oligopolies. Corporate mergers and downsizing makes sense only when the tax structure punishes your company for growing larger. </p>

<p>I feel income tax punishes productivity, and low consumption taxes promote consumerism. I also believe the world needs to have a decentralized reserve currency, because the petrodollar system has given the U.S. too much power to sanction other countries.</p>

<p>I believe the decentralized world reserve currency will be the carrot dangled in front of us when world leaders push for their &quot;new world order&quot; bullshit. It won&#39;t be a real decentralized currency, it will be as centralized and as easily manipulated as the EURO is to the IMF.</p>

I guess if you had to minimize my philosophies to one school, it would be likely closest to the Austrian school... However, I dont believe that one can entirely and fully buy into any particular economic philosophy without taking aspects of another as additional truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following the work of an independent by the name of Martin Armstrong, and I know there are many Austrian economists who have been interviewing him. I&#39;d be interested to know what you think of him. Most people dismiss him because his model is based cycles, and apparently that makes him a &quot;nut job&quot;. With that said, most people also don&#39;t understand what chaos theory has been telling us. Almost everything else in the universe is cyclical in nature, therefore I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s such a stretch to believe the global economy could have a heartbeat.</p>

<p>He says politicians are arrogant, and their belief that they can manipulate and control the economy only serves to create dangerous periods of volatility like we saw in 2008. I can&#39;t help but remember what Einstein said about intelligent people being perceived as &quot;crazy&quot; by everyone else. </p>

The more I listened to him though, the more I bought into a lot of what he had to say.  Im not entirely bought in to his confidence waves theory, although it appears to have great merit.  I very much agree though with his view of geopolitics.  Has that movie about him came out yet?</p>

I know for sure the US government will do whatever they can to prevent it from being shown in North America.
