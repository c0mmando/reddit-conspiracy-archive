    <div class="md"><p>I submitted my question to him, read below :)</p>

<p>Wanted to hear your research, thoughts and opinions on a society (like TZM / TVP / Communalism / Anarcho Syndacalism / Ubuntu / etc) that Abolishes the Monetary System (any means of exchange) and government (any means of horizontally structured control of power away from the people). A society that promotes; automation and mechanization instead of human physical labor, cooperation and collaboration instead of competition, efficiency of labor and production instead of inefficiency, sustainability instead of consumption for profiteering, opensourcing and open sharing of all technology instead of patentship and private ownership of private technology, access to most forms of private property instead of ownership.</p>

<p>And a follow up;  If you do not agree with a more efficienc society, would you promote a transitional type of society.  A capitalist society that promotes Sustainability (Collaborative Commons or Stead State Economy) mixed in with some equality initiatives like guaranteed Basic Income, or an abolishment of all taxes to be replaced with only one tax based on 1% tax charge on every transaction (to evade tax dodging by mega wealthy individuals and corporations)?</p>

<p>Well, realize that these forms of society are not any form of system that NECESSARILY takes &quot;power away from the people&quot;.  In no way is that necessarily the case.  They, of course, CAN take away power from the people if controlled incorrectly or negatively, but so can and do most systems - capitalism being <em>zero</em> exception.  All the forms that you mentioned can, in fact, actually EMPOWER the people immensely if they are implemented correctly.</p>

<p>Okay...Wait a minute.  Perhaps you might have just worded things incorrectly - or I made a mistake in interpretation - but this above statement on your part is, of course, a GOOD thing; something which goes directly against the interpretation I made of your previous statement that the aforementioned systems taker &quot;power away from the people&quot;.  These systems, again, don&#39;t NECESSARILY do that - which, it seemed, you were saying or implying that they <em>do</em>...And yet, your next statement goes on to list many <em>good</em> and positive things that could come out of such societies and systems...so...I&#39;m a bit confused at this point here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my mistake, I meant to say &quot;any means of structure where the power is spread vertically amongst the people and not horizontally creating a pyramid / means of control &amp; slavery&quot;.</p>

<p>This is coming from the context that generally when there is more centralized power in a vertical session, there is more more inequality / tyranny / means of control over everyone else.  This is as opposed to de-centralized forms of socio-economic structures, where the power is spread amongst the people and people are not controlled / restricted / extorted.</p>

<p>It is money and control that often prevents a worker from being more efficient, so take those factors away and you have a much more productive and happier society.  Of course you cant extort or manipulate people so people cant take advantage from people that way.</p>

<p>The problem with the monetary system specifically is that it brings out the worst kinds of behaviorism from humanity.  You are creating an environment where we are all competing against each other, this has immense adverse effects where each transaction that takes place is a struggle / fight.  The person that coerces, cheats, steals, manipulates, beats, kills, lies, or wins through any means available better then the other person can comes out as the &#39;successful&#39; person in society.  </p>

<p>Any person that shows empathy / caring / kindness / help / etc etc is automatically the weaker trait and that person will get extorted, manipulated / abused where as the person that was willing to do anything to win is rewarded despite the other persons misery because he got the upper hand over him. </p>

<p>Soo in essence, you can never have a just society under a monetary society (any means of exchange really) because so long as you promote all the wrong behaviors and suppress all the good ones, you cannot realistically expect anything else in society but those behaviors you promote.  </p>

<p>You can never see kindness, because those people in capitalism lose every time.  Often they end up going homeless, or simply are forced to live in poverty, as opposed to the worst scumbags, the worst psychopaths, the worst abusers, those successful people. they benefit from a system that rewards those behaviors and we elevate them to the top for us all to look up to as role models in capitalism (again, any means of exchange).</p>

<p>The next step evolution for humanity can only come about when we can all live in Cooperation and collaboration, and not in competition.  Competition, fucks with us all, it ruins our environment for all.  Under cooperation/collaboration, we are capable of far better technological advances, productivity and coexisting with each other.. It is the best way forward for humanity and the natural ecosystems.</p>

<p>Hell this is almost a total inevitability when you structure things in this manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay now we&#39;ve got a party of 2 then, 7.5 billion more to invite :D</p>

<p>btw, if you are interested in economics (thee most important topic for creating a just society), have you been following greece? </p>

<p>Funny, the ~10 sources of international political media/information I go to to get information, none of them advertised that Syriza (the newly elected greek government party) is actually socialist in nature.. my mind exploded at that moment, was shocked. I feel like very few people know this.. I mean, why wouldn&#39;t all those stations advertise this is a socialist government and their attempt at kicking out the capitalists.</p>

<p>I am curious where this will go though, I will have to remain skeptic given our recent past. Will they repeat the mistakes of socialist governments like in USSR / poland / ukraine / China / etc by implementing another heavily centralised form of government, or will they achieve a true de-centralized society where all or preferably almost all of the labor is owned by the workers in a collaborative framework (like in Catalonia, the only anarchist society that existed before it was killed by communists &amp; stalin)?  Will they be stupid enough to repeat the mistakes of the past socialist governments and try to centralize all that power and labor into the hands of the state to be controlled by tyrants? I keep going back and forth on this, it&#39;s a big deal..  If they succeed, they could pave the way for more capitalist countries to convert?</p>

<p>Again, a communist / socialist society that has de-centralised power amongst the people is still going to be handicapped if it goes with a monetary system, but it will be a big improvement over typical corporatocracy or capitalism.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it seems to me that most if not all governments on this planet are ruled and controlled by some overarching global power that is NOT interested in helping the people/citizenry get better.  Whether &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;socialist&quot;, &quot;capitalist&quot; or whatever...they all end up fucking over the people.  Every government in this civilization, it seems, <em>fucks</em> the people regardless sooner or later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>soalist = socialist.</p>

<p>Socialist (the idea of a state + monetary system) is suppose to be the stepping stone to communism (a stateless as in no state society, with no monetary system).  In essence, we never in history ever had a true communist country because they were all tyrannical forms of heavily centralized socialism, far worse then capitalism because the state (government) took ownership of ALL the workers production / manufacturing / Resources / Labor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are familiar with matters of essoteric / arcane knowledge you almost must be aware of the influence that masons played with the communist state in Russia.  The communist state, as was lead by the Bulsheviks/ was actually predominantly overrun by jewish people as they composed 80-85% of that group.  In essence, this government that the freemasons (in American at the time) helped create and overtake in Russia ended up killing 40 million people or so throughout all the years...  My theories are that they tried to exterminate as many people as possible to possibly create an Israeli state in the USSR, but having failed they instead made a deal with U.K. / U.N. for Palestine. So yes, if the socialist / communist is not organized or composed of zionists, perhaps they stand a chance in Greece.  Only time will tell?</p>

<p>I do not disagree with this one bit, sir.  I think it is an education that definitely includes, but is by no means whatsoever limited to just economics, however.  I know you yourself aren&#39;t disagreeing with this, but I tend to place a bit more of my investigative emphasis on philosophy and more esoteric subject matter than on economic ones.  I think that economics is certainly important, but I also think that more arcane subjects are no less significant in the building of effective societies, civilizations, and people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree, I&#39;ve put a lot of emphasis on learning about freemasonry and philosophy myself. After a few years and avoiding economics, I decided to take the plunge and learn economics, best decision ever! Once you pick up on it, it really opens a lot of doors to new understandings. Of course all the other interesting topics along with econmics all compliments eachother, but I am at a point finally that feels like I have that sense of possessing that magical key that unlocks all.</p>

<p>Of course I cant say i know it all, because in reality after the many breakthroughs, I have to say I know very little compared to whats out there.. however, I can now see a million new un-opened doors, doors that I can unlock with the key. </p>

<p>Sounds a bit cheezy eh lol, but it&#39;s a pretty accurate depiction of my thoughts.</p>

<p>I had experiences when young that <em>many</em> years later I discovered had many parallels with what other contactees have also described.</p>

<p>Since discovering this, I developed particular interest in the investigation of the subject and have researched quite a bit in the area of disclosure projects, whistleblowers, government and PTB coverups, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that.  There is much, MUCH disinformation and misinformation run amok on this planet.  It confuses and muddies the waters of truth, which is what TPTB want.  It makes things all the more difficult to effectively investigate.  We’re all likely wrong about <em>some</em> specific aspects of the extraterrestrial dynamic.  Ultimately, however, 1) the dynamic is real, 2) I would say that some races <em>have</em> contacted certain humans on this planet, and 3) I’d even say that they some ETs are <em>currently</em> here and have been for quite some time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, the specifics in terms of WHICH races there are may be erred here and there.  The general, broad strokes, however, in terms of our being contacted <em>period</em> are likely entirely accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This whole idea of the galactic federation, although sounds pleasants, could very well be all disinfo. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The GENERAL idea of a grouping of races that have cooperated with one another for the mutual benefit of all members in the group, I would say, does not seem a very far-fetched idea in the least to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have any credible sources let me know</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the real question here, however, is “who and what is a credible source”?</p>

<p>I, for example, have been doing pretty extensive research into <a href="http://www.earthcitizenconsulting.org/">an individual</a> who seems to be a Captain in a special top secret “black” project of the Marines and his information, data, and testimony seems to be amongst some of the most compelling I’ve come across to date.  Does this mean he can’t be lying?  No.  He seems to have all the earmarks of truth as far as I can discern, however.</p>

<p>Steven Greer’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">Disclosure Project</a> seems to provide pretty substantial - if not definitive - indication of ET presence on this planet also, as well as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUCDHofEho">Citizen Hearing On Disclosure</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, and again, specifics may be difficult to effectively ascertain.  The broad strokes, however, pretty directly point toward the truth of ET existence on and around planet Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My history of debunking people have lead me to believe half the &#39;alternative media&#39; movement are agents..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And many may be.  Doesn’t keep the general truth from still being the case, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given 95% of the UFO videos are hoaxes / fakes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that many.  Over half not being genuine is likely true.  Not as many as 95%, however.</p>

<p>He pretty much admits, that him pairing up with known hoaxers or people with no credibility, does not bother him.  So when he makes an appearance infront of national t.v., and people have a look at the people he teams up with, the fact that he gives credibility to people that can be debunked so easily will give and has given people motive to discredit the whole phenomenom as crazy.

<p>Yeah, well, that’s why you don’t sweat the small stuff - the particulars - like specific names/what it’s called or the stories about them.  The words “Galactic Federation” are human, terrestrial, English language words anyway.  It is EXTREMELY likely that the members of this galactic consortium don’t call it “The Galactic Federation” themsleves.  The names are nothing that one should get too hung up on at all.</p>

<p>One has to understand what the final goal is here.  The final goal is to show/prove/give evidence for the ET reality on and around this planet.  If someone associates with 10 people and 7 of them are frauds, but 3 of them end up showing proof of ET life, then I’d say that person ended up on the right track ultimately.  One shouldn’t expect someone to be right A HUNDRED percent of the time - especially on a planet like this one with so much disinformation and misinformation.  Everyone’s going to get fooled to some extent.  People’s overall intent and track record seems more important, it seems to me, and individuals shouldn’t be too quick to discard or discredit individuals who don’t get “100% of the information correct 100% of the time <em>or else</em>”.  Uncovering the truth of hidden information on this planet is a process wrought with missteps and mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Steven Greer has done more for the popular dissemination of serious ET dialogue in recent times than most people.  Being associated with the Rockerfeller family shouldn’t be any sort of immediate cancellation of a person’s credibility since that family’s influence is so ubiquitous over the entire planet in the first place.  It’s kind of hard NOT to be associated with them if one deals with big projects in one form or another.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that Greer has had SO MANY credible witnesses means that regardless of whether Greer himself is compromised or not (which I don’t think he, for the most part, is) doesn’t mean that any of the many people that have been involved with his Disclosure Project are themselves compromised.  One thing does not necessarily equate to the other.</p>

<p>Same with Stephen Bassett.  He’s hosted dozens of people in his Citizens’ Hearing.  If even ONE of those individuals is credible, then that goes a ways in helping the cause…and a LOT more than just one individuals involved in his Citizens’ Hearing was credible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>greer himself is a Fraud in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve heard this from many, yet not once have I ever heard an actual valid reason as to why people feel this way.  It’s strange really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought into greer&#39;s promises just like stevens basettes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that was your first mistake right there then.  Don’t buy into ANYONE’S <em>anything</em>.  Just listen to the information and assess it on its own merit.  Don’t believe anyone.  Don’t champion anyone’s cause.  Just go where the information and evidence leads regardless of who says it with the understanding that you may end up having to back track on that lead in the future.  It’s not about any one person or “believing” them one way or the other.  It’s about the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>both have fucked over their communities many times</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I have yet to see how this has happened.  I <em>have</em> heard people say things like this, but I haven’t actually seen anyone produce any actual real information in terms of HOW they did it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do hold a personal grudge against them. I&#39;ve done my research on those two individuals many years ago and am more certain of them being agents as time goes, and for that I cannot let myself be fooled again by those guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, one should simply just go with the information presented.  Some of it is valid.  Some of it is likely not valid.  NO ONE on this planet, it seems to me, has the “whole” story.  Everyone is going to be erred about the data to SOME extent or another.  It is erroneous to fault someone for being erred alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also suspect they are exposing whistleblowers and real threatening initiatives of disclosure to the government or shadow government, so that we never get there, or at least not anytime soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying that Steven Greer’s and Stephen Bassett’s disclosure projects were really designed to single out and expose real whistleblowers to TPTB so that they could be tracked down and taken out?</p>

<p>…?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well if cointelpro agents exist (or whatever new name/operation they might be operating under), it would only make sense they would report any real threats to their handlers.  You have to understand that the best way to control the opposition, is to lead it. Also the most effective leaders are the ones that are at the Fore-Front.

<p>Also the problem of giving credibility to people with ludicrous claims is that those people can then be used to taint the original goal or rest of the team.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  Will give a listen.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Having listened to the podcast, I’d say Stephen Bassett is on the up and up.  I might not agree with everything 100% he’s said, but he’s a legitimate researcher that doesn’t seem to be 
into disinformation.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, it doesn’t really matter whether he is or isn’t “legitimate” (although, again, he does appear to be legitimate to me), as ET existence is REAL.  I personally don’t worry too much about the minutia or who is or isn’t “real” because I have a pretty strong understanding myself and on my own - independent of any other external individual - that regardless of what anyone says, the existence of ETs on and around planet Earth is in fact a reality.  Outside information doesn&#39;t validate or invalidate it one way or the other because I’ve had personal experiences that give me a good idea about the bigger picture in general.  Do some people have a closer idea than others?  Sure.  Of course.  Do I put people like Stephen Bassett and Steven Greer in the realm of “disinformation agents”?  Not at all, and there hasn’t been as far as I’ve seen any good, justifiable real reason for people to see them as that.</p>

<p>I can say there is a strong enough of an evidence to say yes, we are being visited for a long time, with good evidence of that the last century, but I cannot confirm the authenticity of the information of actual ET races/names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the specifics in terms of WHICH races there are may be erred here and there.  The general, broad strokes, however, in terms of our being contacted <em>period</em> are likely entirely accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This whole idea of the galactic federation, although sounds pleasants, could very well be all disinfo. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The GENERAL idea of a grouping of races that have cooperated with one another for the mutual benefit of all members in the group, I would say, does not seem a very far-fetched idea in the least to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have any credible sources let me know</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the real question here, however, is “who and what is a credible source”?</p>

<p>I, for example, have been doing pretty extensive research into <a href="http://www.earthcitizenconsulting.org/">an individual</a> who seems to be a Captain in a special top secret “black” project of the Marines and his information, data, and testimony seems to be amongst some of the most compelling I’ve come across to date.  Does this mean he can’t be lying?  No.  He seems to have all the earmarks of truth as far as I can discern, however.</p>

<p>Steven Greer’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">Disclosure Project</a> seems to provide pretty substantial - if not definitive - indication of ET presence on this planet also, as well as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUCDHofEho">Citizen Hearing On Disclosure</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, and again, specifics may be difficult to effectively ascertain.  The broad strokes, however, pretty directly point toward the truth of ET existence on and around planet Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My history of debunking people have lead me to believe half the &#39;alternative media&#39; movement are agents..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And many may be.  Doesn’t keep the general truth from still being the case, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given 95% of the UFO videos are hoaxes / fakes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that many.  Over half not being genuine is likely true.  Not as many as 95%, however.</p>
