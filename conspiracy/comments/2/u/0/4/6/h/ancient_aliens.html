These guys can&#39;t explain some explosion then conclude it must be from some secret underground alien anti aircraft weapon. WTF? Can you say psudoscience? Then the Mayan sacrafices were because aliens wanted human blood. Then they talk about vampires like they are real. Then they talk about dead people rising from the grave snd living in a giant gold spaceship. These people literally take every ridiculous religous folklore and try to explain it away with alien intervention. They also deny evolution and claim ancient aliens made people. </p>

<p>I love this show. The people on it are so stupid.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t passing these statements as fact they are just saying you could look at it in a way that Aliens did it. It&#39;s just another theory contrary to widely accepted theories. </p>

<p>Evolution is a theory and has not been proven as fact just correlative evidence makes it the most widely accepted and believable theory. The Ancient Alien Astronaut theory is just another theory which has evidence but isn&#39;t as widely accepted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because bad ideas deserve to be treated with ridicule and contempt. Because I prefer truth over falsehood. The only thing preventing bad ideas from becoming pervasive is social pressure.  If you take these people seriously you are only legitimizing their view point. Pseudo science doesn&#39;t deserve any legitimacy. I don&#39;t want to live in a society where pseudo science is given legitimacy. Why would you want to legitimize pseudo science? Why would not care if completely irrational thought becomes pervasive? Because you are worried about someone&#39;s feelings? I don&#39;t want to live in a world where people take stone carvings as irrefutable evidence of aliens. If that becomes the standard for evidence you kiss technological advancement goodbye. It&#39;s an incredibly destructive way of thinking.</p>
