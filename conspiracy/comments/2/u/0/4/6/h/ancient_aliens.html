       Anybody seen this? These guys are absolutely insane. Season one epidode 9, Aliens and the Undead. These guys can't explain some explosion then conclude it must be from some secret underground alien anti aircraft weapon. WTF? Can you say psudoscience? Then the Mayan sacrafices were because aliens wanted human blood. Then they talk about vampires like they are real. Then they talk about dead people rising from the grave snd living in a giant gold spaceship. These people literally take every ridiculous religous folklore and try to explain it away with alien intervention. They also deny evolution and claim ancient aliens made people.

       They aren't stupid, not by a long shot. If you watched the whole series and listen to them closely they say words like "Could it be...", "It may..." and "I believe"
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't passing these statements as fact they are just saying you could look at it in a way that Aliens did it. It's just another theory contrary to widely accepted theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a theory and has not been proven as fact just correlative evidence makes it the most widely accepted and believable theory. The Ancient Alien Astronaut theory is just another theory which has evidence but isn't as widely accepted.

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_fact_and_theory">
        Evolution is both fact and theory. This has more to do on terminology (scientific theory, observation, fact) than actual doubt (colloquial usage for theory).

       As for the Ancient Alien Astronaut, there is absolutely no facts supporting this "theory",

       I'm not discrediting their existence, just the interpretation that they refer to any non-terrestrial entity. Because under this prism, we might as well accept the bible as actually god speaking to moses from a burning bush, and other nonsenses.

       Dude, it just came out on Netflix. I'm on episode 10. You can't look at some carving into a rock, assume it's a guy in a spaceship, claim this is evidence for acient aliens and expect not to be mocked. You can literally "prove" anything you want this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person 2000 years in the future could find a plastic smurf, assume somebody from the past saw smurfs walking around and made this figurine. Then you caim it's proof of smurfs from a different world that visited earth and were worshiped like gods.

       Sceintific theory and theory are two different things. If you are going to use words you should learn what they mean first.

       Never at one point did they say "It was" they said "Could it be evidence of..." or "It may be...." and even "I believe..." you can't devalue their  theory.

       That guy from the meme was on Joe Rogan's podcast and he actually sounded fairly bright. I think he is just way too enthusiastic and way too quick to call aliens on everything, but he still seems like a good guy. His look definitely does not help his cause though! haha

       Right and I'm saying why personally attack them? Their work is what you have a problem with. Attacking somebody, especially somebody you have never met, is evidence of insecurity. Also, why are you so angry? It's sad.

       Because bad ideas deserve to be treated with ridicule and contempt. Because I prefer truth over falsehood. The only thing preventing bad ideas from becoming pervasive is social pressure.  If you take these people seriously you are only legitimizing their view point. Pseudo science doesn't deserve any legitimacy. I don't want to live in a society where pseudo science is given legitimacy. Why would you want to legitimize pseudo science? Why would not care if completely irrational thought becomes pervasive? Because you are worried about someone's feelings? I don't want to live in a world where people take stone carvings as irrefutable evidence of aliens. If that becomes the standard for evidence you kiss technological advancement goodbye. It's an incredibly destructive way of thinking.

       If you are into reading there is a book call Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Handcock which is what this series is loosely based off of. Very good read and not once does he say for sure that it is fact just that over his 30 years of investigative study and research that this is how it presented itself to him

       Its a blast of a show to watch.  At the very least they present some very interesting things that don't have easy explanations.  But then sometimes you get some gold that you weren't expecting that you just have to grin really big and keep watching.

       yeah great show some of the evidence and examples they provide is really thought provoking as others had pointed out....as you said though, the conclusions they draw are sometimes ridiculous and deserve mocking

       I believe a component of the ancient aliens psy op is to belittle the abilities of ancient man. Ultimately man is far older than modern history or anthropology wants to admit. To me the power of slave labor and authoritarian systems is undermined in what they call a theory.

        Evolution is both fact and theory. This has more to do on terminology (scientific theory, observation, fact) than actual doubt (colloquial usage for theory).

       As for the Ancient Alien Astronaut, there is absolutely no facts supporting this "theory",
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronaut_hypothesis">

       Dude, it just came out on Netflix. I'm on episode 10. You can't look at some carving into a rock, assume it's a guy in a spaceship, claim this is evidence for acient aliens and expect not to be mocked. You can literally "prove" anything you want this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person 2000 years in the future could find a plastic smurf, assume somebody from the past saw smurfs walking around and made this figurine. Then you caim it's proof of smurfs from a different world that visited earth and were worshiped like gods.
      </p>

       Sceintific theory and theory are two different things. If you are going to use words you should learn what they mean first.
