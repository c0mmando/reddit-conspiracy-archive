<p>How is it Israel&#39;s fault that Israel ethnically cleansed nearly a million Muslim/Christian Palestinians from their homes, and turned them into refugees?</p>

<p>How is it Israel&#39;s fault that they turned Gaza into the &quot;largest open air prison&quot;, strangle the economy and population to the point of, &quot;a humanitarian disaster&quot;? </p>

<p>How is it Israel&#39;s fault that they routinely &quot;confiscate&quot; Palestinian land for Jewish-only settlements, then imprison/kill those who resist? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude chill, seriously. I don&#39;t dispute any of those things, but just because Israel&#39;s been taking liberties with its borders doesn&#39;t make it an evil empire. It just means it&#39;s following international norms. Talk to India and Pakistan about Kashmir. Talk to Russia and Ukraine about Crimea. Talk to China and Japan about the Senkaku Islands (seriously watch that place, there&#39;s a very good chance it&#39;s going to get hot soon and HOLY FUCK when it does). Talk to Morocco and Mauritania about Western Sahara. </p>

<p>Yes, Israel has been a dick lately. So what. There&#39;s plenty of dicks to go around.</p>

<p>Its about Israel ethnically cleansing nearly a million natives from their land, to create an ethnic-religious supremacist state. Its about a system of apartheid that&#39;s been enforced upon the Palestinians for decades. None of the examples you gave approach that level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is a form of fascism -- a war-seeking cult based on delusions of ethnic supremacy.  </p>

<p>Fascism is the ideology of national suicide -- suicidal bellicosity, suicidal ignorance and arrogance.  </p>

<p>The cult of war is a death cult, a narcissistic quest for a global &quot;Masada&quot;.  We put our faith in death and destruction, and death and destruction is what we get. </p>

<p>❧</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sublimated Zionist desire to be hated is the fuel of Israel&#39;s unity and self-righteousness. <a href="#b1red">This self-destructive nature</a>, concealed as a desire for self defence, comes from deep and ancient forces of which Zionism is merely a symptom and a hint. That which preserves these self-destructive forces ensures that the eternal victims&#39; apartheid nationalistic project will be a fleeting phenomenon. When arrested in mere nationalism, primordial victim mentality self preserves by generating <a href="#b1red">collective suicide</a> of that nationalistic project. The self-defence of suicide points out the uniqueness of the Israeli apartheid. Both the no-choice and the self-defence rhetoric contain a chilling chronicle of suicide foretold. Despite its military might, Israel is a weak and dying state that desires to destroy itself. The most powerful nations in the world assist this suicidal process and this fact calls for urgent contemplation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not countless. The number killed number less than 150,000 in the entirety of the conflict, of over 100 years (if we go back to the start of political Zionism in 1897, even if we just go back to the first war in 1948 same thing). That&#39;s fewer than 4 years in Syria.</p>

<p>Put that into perspective.</p>

<p>If Israel wanted to kill every last Palestinian, and IDF soldiers were that bloodthirsty, it could&#39;ve and would&#39;ve been done long ago. Rwanda&#39;s Hutus killed 700,000 Tutsis in their genocide, at the very least, and with mostly less-than-advanced weapons: light arms, machetes, and gardening tools. Most of the dead were killed in the first three weeks. If Israel decided to turn the Palestinian homes and territories into a single, gigantic, flattened wasteland, it could do it. It just won&#39;t. Because it&#39;s not the bloodthirsty monster you make it out to be.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a sad human being to categorize an entirety of 180,000 conscripted soldiers at any given moment as evil pricks. Fuck you and your dehumanizing logic.</p>
