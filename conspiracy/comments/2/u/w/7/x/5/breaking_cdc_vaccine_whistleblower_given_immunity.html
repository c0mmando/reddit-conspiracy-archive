<h2>William Thompson free to describe vaccine-autism fraud at CDC to Congress</h2>

<h2>Vaccine wars heat up</h2>

<h2>Sold-out media line up to defend vaccines</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Howley (twitter) at The Daily Caller reports that William Thompson, CDC whistleblower, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/03/obama-admin-grants-immunity-to-cdc-scientist-that-fudged-vaccine-report-whistleblower-plans-to-testify-before-congress/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">has been given immunity from prosecution, by the federal government, to testify before Congress about vaccine fraud at the CDC.</a></p>

<p>Cautionary note: so far, The Daily Caller is the sole source on this story.</p>

<p>On August 27, 2014, Thompson, a long-time researcher at the CDC, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-big-one-cdc-whistleblower-goes-public-now/">published a statement</a> through his lawyer, Rick Morgan, admitting that he and colleagues at the CDC violated the protocol in a study on the MMR vaccine’s connection to autism.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">The study,</a> which was published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, exonerated the vaccine, when in fact <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128611/">the study omitted vital data</a> on a group of black babies who showed an increased risk for autism after receiving the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.</p>

<p>Since he released his August 27 statement, whistleblower Thompson has maintained silence and has refused to talk to reporters.</p>

<p>Now it appears he’s ready to step into the light—if there is a Congressional hearing. That’s a big if.</p>

<p>Thompson is working with Florida Congressman William Posey. Posey serves on the House Science Subcommittee on Oversight.</p>

<p>A Congressional hearing could be explosive, if members of the Committee ask Thompson the right questions, probe deeply, and find out exactly how an arrangement was made, inside the CDC, to cover up the MMR vaccine’s connection to autism.</p>

<p>The study in question had several authors, two of whom—Frank Destafano and Coleen Boyle—are now high-ranking CDC executives in the area of vaccine safety.</p>

<p>If Thompson convincingly shows they were in on the fix, the whole business would explode and the CDC would be exposed as rank liars and threats to human health before the public.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if this is a one-day hearing, at which the testimony devolves into a boring he-said she-said proposition, and if the press barely takes notice, the outcome (and the truth) will rest entirely in the hands of alternative media.</p>

<p>No Congressional hearing has thus far been scheduled.</p>

<p>Another major CDC figure in this scandal: Dr. Julie Gerberding, former head of the CDC in 2004. Would she be subpoenaed to testify?</p>

<p>In 2004, whistleblower <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/09/10/cdc-whistleblower-this-is-the-real-smoking-gun/">Thompson wrote her a letter,</a> in which he warned her that he had sensitive and troubling data about the MMR vaccine’s connection to autism. He was shortly due to present the data at a major vaccine/autism conference.</p>

<p>Apparently, Gerberding didn’t answer the letter, and Thompson’s presentation was canceled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>After Gerberding left the CDC in 2009, she ascended to the position of president of Merck Vaccines.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Merck manufactures the MMR vaccine. Get the picture?</p>

<p>Interestingly, in December of 2014, Merck removed Gerberding from her august position and placed her in a new role, a role that never existed within the company before: executive vice-president for “strategic communications, global public policy and population health.”</p>

<p>Did Merck make this move to shield Gerberding, to protect her from a possible scandal tying her to the 2004 MMR-autism fraud at the CDC? If there is a Congressional hearing, will Gerberding be conveniently unavailable because she is overseas tending to her new international duties at Merck?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as these developments play out, there is a political battle taking place re mandatory vaccination vs. parents’ right to choose whether to vaccinate their children.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/fox-host-on-mandatory-vaccines-some-things-require-big-brother/">Presidential candidates Chris Christie and Rand Paul</a> have made statements supporting, to one degree or another, parents’ right to choose. The “medical experts” have invaded television news to slam these statements as grossly irresponsible.</p>

<p>These are the same experts who always answer the call when some element of the medical cartel is under threat of exposure. Their job is to provide cover, sound authoritative, and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/blaming-anti-vax-parents-for-mickey-mouse-measles/">make medical critics</a> into “dangerous people.” (see also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLrBFKaw7Ro">Joe Biggs’s update.</a>)</p>

<p>As I’ve documented over the years, these professional experts are actually sitting on a powder keg that threatens to blow the whole medical system sky-high. The issue, which must never be revealed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Medically caused death and human destruction.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Here are a few citations and facts which remain state secrets, as far as major news outlets are concerned. Reading them, think about how much credibility the “medical experts” really have whenever they open their mouths about public health in ANY form:</p>

<p>Citation: <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e3989">BMJ June 7, 2012 (BMJ 2012:344:e3989). Author, Jeanne Lenzer.</a></p>

<p>Lenzer refers to a report by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It calculated that in 2011 prescription drugs were associated with two to four million people in the US experiencing ‘serious, disabling, or fatal injuries, including 128,000 deaths.’”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The report called this “one of the most significant perils to humans resulting from human activity.”</p>

<p>And here is the final dagger. The report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the FDA’s own database of “serious adverse [medical-drug] events.”</p>

<p>Therefore, to say the FDA isn’t aware of this finding would be absurd. The FDA knows. The FDA knows and it isn’t saying anything about it, because the FDA certifies, as safe and effective, all the medical drugs that are routinely maiming and killing Americans.</p>

<p>Previously, I have documented that the FDA knows; because the FDA has a page on its own website that admits—without taking blame— 100,000 people are killed every year by medical drugs, and two million more people are severely injured by the drugs. (Go to startpage.com <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm114848.htm">and search for</a> “FDA Why Learn About Adverse Drug Reactions”)</p>

<p>And for the past five years or so, I have been writing about and <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/the-starfield-revelations/">citing a published report</a> by the late Dr. Barbara Starfield that indicates 106,000 people in the US are killed by medical drugs every year. </p>

<p>Until her death in 2011, Dr. Starfield worked at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Her report, “Is US health really the best in the world?”, was published in the Journal of American Medical Association on July 26, 2000.</p>

<p>Do an extrapolation: 106,000 people killed every year in the US by medical drugs=a MILLION deaths per decade.</p>

<p>Starfield didn’t stop there. She also attributed 119,000 deaths per year to mistreatment and medical errors in hospitals—bringing the annual total of US medically caused deaths to 225,000.</p>

<p><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187436">Here’s another study:</a> April 15, 1998, Journal of the American Medical Association, “Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients.” It, too, is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>The authors, led by Jason Lazarou, culled 39 previous studies on patients in hospitals. These patients, who received drugs in hospitals, or were admitted to hospitals because they were suffering from the drugs doctors had given them, met the following fate:</p>

<p>In a given year, in the US, 106,000 hospitalized patients die as a direct result of the drugs. Beyond that, 2.2 million hospitalized patients experience serious adverse reactions to the drugs.</p>

<p>The authors write:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“…Our study on ADRs [Adverse Drug Reactions], which excludes medication errors, had a different objective: to show that there are a large number of ADRs even when the drugs are properly prescribed and administered.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roughly 1.5 million American soldiers have died in all wars in US history.</p>

<p>In any given 10 years of modern medical treatment? 2.25 million deaths (Starfield).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Consider how much suppression is necessary to keep the medical death-numbers under wraps.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Now think about these “medical experts” who appear on television news programs and assure the public that modern medicine is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>When they blithely state that vaccines only rarely cause problems of any kind, and when they state that vaccines have absolutely no connection to neurological damage in children, what is their level of credibility?</p>

<p>It may interest you to know that the US system of reporting severe adverse effects of vaccines is broken. There are no reliable numbers. That’s because the reporting is done by patients or doctors.</p>

<p>Barbara Loe Fisher, of the private National Vaccine Information Center, <a href="http://www.whale.to/a/moth.html">has put together a reasonable estimate:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“But how many children have [adverse] vaccine reactions every year? Is it really only one in 110,000 or one in a million who are left permanently disabled after vaccination? Former FDA Commissioner David Kessler observed in 1993 that less than 1 percent of doctors report adverse events following prescription drug use. [See DA Kessler, ‘Introducing MEDWatch,’ JAMA, June 2, 1993: 2765-2768]</p>

<p>“There have been estimates that perhaps less than 5 or 10 percent of doctors report hospitalizations, injuries, deaths, or other serious health problems following vaccination. The 1986 Vaccine Injury Act contained no legal sanctions for not reporting [via VAERS]; doctors can refuse to report and suffer no consequences.</p>

<p>“Even so, each year about 12,000 reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS]; parents as well as doctors can make those reports. [See RT Chen, B. Hibbs, ‘Vaccine safety,’ Pediatric Annals, July 1998: 445-458]</p>

<p>“However, if that number represents only 10 percent of what is actually occurring, then the actual number may be 120,000 vaccine-adverse events. If doctors report vaccine reactions as infrequently as Dr. Kessler said they report prescription-drug reactions, and the number 12,000 is only 1 percent of the actual total, then the real number may be 1.2 million vaccine-adverse events annually.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you have the background to assess what CDC whistleblower William Thompson may say if there is a Congressional hearing on CDC vaccine-autism fraud.</p>

<p>Thompson states that he was part of egregious lying in a published study.</p>

<p>Well, how in the world do you suppose the medically caused death-and-damage I’ve cited in this article is suppressed and covered up and papered over?</p>

<p>Every single medical drug and vaccine that creates the death and damage has been written about AND CALLED SAFE in at least one study published in a “reputable” medical journal.</p>

<p>Get it?</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/faking-medical-reality/">Rank fraud in published medical studies is everywhere.</a> All the time.</p>

<p>Indeed, here is a devastating statement, from a doctor who has examined more published medical studies than any expert who shows up on television and spouts off about our perfectly safe medical system.</p>

<p>For two decades, she was the editor of one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” —Marcia Angell, MD ([“Drug Companies and Doctors: A story of Corruption.”](<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/</a>) NY Review of Books, Jan. 15, 2009.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. This is by no means the end of the story.  I can imagine this can take months if not years before he is heard, and even them don&#39;t hold your breath for any regulatory changes.</p>

<p>BigPharma is a very important part of the American Economy, I don&#39;t think Govt. can afford to screw up their operation. Corporations have a LOT of leverage on politicians. </p>

<p>We can expect some laws will be passed to grant special immunity or no-fault clauses to big Pharma if this ever goes to a real trial.</p>

<p>The best I can expect is that regulations will be put in place that will  oblige more testing, comparative studies and other such measure to refine the product.  I do not expect bigPharma to be fined or have their reputation tarnished too much.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a personal opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a large volume of garbage hyperbole to sift through, no one really wants to do that.</p>

<p>Edit: I wound up deciding to see if any of this garbage held any weight and looked at Thompson&#39;s statement regarding the CDC. This was the third paragraph in his statement, how the fuck can anyone possibly construe his statement as anti-vax? All he wants is the CDC to be more transparent in their analyses, which is a completely reasonable, but separate argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue  to save countless lives.  I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated  with their administration are vastly outweighed  by their individual and societal benefits.</p>

<p>Believe it.</p>

<p>Lack of conscience seem to be a prerequisite to work for them. It&#39;s practically in the job description.</p>

<p>And the report was never released after it was censored. Perhaps Thompson will share it with Congress when he testifies. </p>

<p>Maybe we should ask Julie Gerberding, the woman who censored it.</p>

<p>Oh that&#39;s right, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2gdrhy/cdc_whistleblower_this_is_the_real_smoking_gun/">she works for Merck now, the maker of the vaccine that Thompson was questioning!</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to have informed and nuanced discussions when people base their stance on hyperbole. No one who&#39;s an informed proponent for vaccines would ever want untested vaccinations, and never insinuate that vaccines are without risk.

<p>The CDC didn&#39;t lie or conceal information, they published the subgroup along with the rest of the study. It didn&#39;t affect the outcome of their findings since it was a subgroup with a small amount of subjects (young male African-Americans). Wakefield used an incorrect statistical analysis to alter the p-value of the sub group. Thompson wanted a retest on the subgroup to ensure that nothing was actually happening there, he felt guilty that the subgroup may actually be vulnerable to the vaccine.</p>

<p>Ebola was a special case as the death rate is so significant that it eclipsed the risk of utilizing an untested vaccination.</p>

<p>Wait a second, 106,000 deaths a year? That means, that the six leading cause of death—is actually doctors! - <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187436">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187436</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is disconnected is equating two things that aren&#39;t the same issue.</p>

<p>And while we are at it, vaccination and medicine in general are both bigger and more nuanced issues than the companies that make them.</p>

<p>One thing you conveniently ignore from the fact that medications kill people sometimes (duh) is how many of those people would have died anyways without the medication? How many would have a much lower quality of life?</p>

<p>Not all of them for sure, but im sure there is a percentage of that big scary number you posted.</p>

<p>Now, on top of that, there&#39;s the big picture to look at. Since what you seem most interested in is the overall number of deaths from the drugs, how many lives are saved or extended or improved by prescription drugs every year?</p>

<p>You know that number is far larger than the one you posted. Thats where your disconnect is. </p>

<p>The reality is that you are looking for anything you can throw at this vaccination argument right now, and coming up empty handed leaves you scraping for something...anything to make this about big evil bad nasty corporations, when in fact the issue is much bigger than big pharma. It is the health of the public. </p>

<p>Measles killed more people globally than that number you posted in 2013, and if it weren&#39;t for vaccination it would kill a lot more. That&#39;s just one disease. </p>

<p>I have also worked at one of the biggest Pharmaceutical Companies in the world.</p>

<p>Never before have I seen such levels of security, secrecy and paranoia over getting access to documents at big pharma than all of the banks and government combined. </p>

<p>It was truly staggering the levels of security you had to go through to access documents detailing the whole lifecycle of a drug - which would have included clinical trials et-al. 
(i.e fully audited document access using workflow but any access had to be &#39;ink signed&#39; for by multiple people and higher ups, which was then uploaded for posterity. </p>

<p>It always fathomed me as to this secrecy. </p>

<p>In banks you either have access or not and this access is controlled by one person  and they usually just grant it if you have a semi valid business case.</p>

<p>You always hear of banking details being leaked - but never big pharma details being leaked.</p>

<p>If the OP &#39;s post is true this would give reason for the high level of paranoia at big pharma because that information behind the biggest digital safe in the world (in my humble opinion) would reveal the whole truth to back up OP&#39;s story (if true) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still reading through your long post but I see a huge problem right off the bat and I just have to ask...</p>

<p>The paper about African Americans being more susceptible to Autism after being immunized was ...retracted by the journal it was published in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Editor and Publisher regretfully retract the article [1] as there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author which compromised the peer review process. Furthermore, post-publication peer review raised concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis, therefore the Editors no longer have confidence in the soundness of the findings. We apologise to all affected parties for the inconvenience caused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So....this looks like a bust. I mean ...</p>

<p>Okay to put that simply....</p>

<p>Someone had a conflict of interest on the peer review (that they concealed funnily enough, get on that conspiracy theorists)...then they did another review and found the methods to be invalid.</p>

<p>Still no proof that vaccines cause autism.</p>

<p>So what we have is this &quot;whistleblower&quot; saying that the CDC ignored evidence, from a paper that happened AFTER the CDC published that was also retracted.</p>

<p>They ignored the bad data from a paper that hadn&#39;t even been published yet?</p>

<p>Is that what this is about? Because if it isn&#39;t, I am missing something here. Please educate me if I am wrong about that. </p>

<p>CDC published in Feb 2014. The autism in black people paper published in Aug and was retracted in October.....</p>

<p>The retracted paper claims that black people that vaccinate get diagnosed with autism higher than white people who vaccinate, BUT it still doesn&#39;t prove a causal link between vaccines and autism. </p>

<p>On top of that, their methods were shown to be suspect upon a second peer review, which was done because of the original conflict of interest. </p>

<p>Basically, that paper of as much scientific value as if I had scribbled some random junk on a napkin at McDonalds. </p>
