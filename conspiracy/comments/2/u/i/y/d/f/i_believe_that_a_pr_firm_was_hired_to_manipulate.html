    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately for you, they do cause autism.  If you haven&#39;t come to this conclusion then you probably haven&#39;t done much research.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12849883">Here&#39;s the first study you need to see.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534">Here&#39;s the next one.</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10707922">Here&#39;s another one on an older, extremely dangerous MMR still being used in the third world with an extremely high incidence of asceptic meningitis</a>  </p>

<p><a href="http://benswann.com/truth-in-media-vaccine-court-and-autism/">Here is a great report by Ben Swann on the creation of the National Childhood Vaccination Information Act</a>.  It completely insulated vaccine manufacturers from litigation.  All injury claims must now go through the VICP, a &quot;court&quot; that decides whether one has enough evidence to prove vaccine induced injury.  One of the main problems is they throw out cases based on a presupposition that the injury couldn&#39;t have been caused by a vaccine based on current data.  Recently they threw out over 5000 cases of autistic regression from vaccines based on an omnibus autism proceeding that deemed &quot;they didn&#39;t believe there was evidence linking vaccines to autism.&quot;  The people are powerless, they can&#39;t build legal precedence against a manufacturer and it is very hard to bring possible new injuries to light because of preconceived notions.  The whole thing wreaks of bureaucracy and corporate influence.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the vaccine court has now awarded compensation to over 200 cases of children suffering encephalopathy (a fairly common vaccine injury) leading to an autistic spectrum disorder diagnosis!  Tell this to any idiot who claims there is no link to autism; there certainly is a link!  These people had to provide such an overwhelming amount of evidence that the court had no choice but to compensate them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get a clue buddy.  Do you know what measles death rate is in first world countries?  It is essentially 0.  Measles outbreaks have occurred despite vaccination and literally nobody has died in over 12 years with over 100,000 reported cases.  Same with mumps, the death rate usually hovers around 0-5 deaths per 10 million people in first world countries and has been in this margin long before the mumps vaccine came out.  Not to mention the only people who die from these diseases are people already on their deathbed or severely immunocompromised children.  So no, in no way is nobody dying better than autism rates increasing from 1 in 150 to a projected 1 in 60 people in 15 years.  Of course vaccines aren&#39;t the sole culprit in the increasing incidence, but they do play a role.  In this same timeframe there have been 108 reports of death from MMR on the VAERS system from otherwise healthy individuals.  Of course these families won&#39;t likely be compensated for the trauma they&#39;ve suffered and it is estimated that only 1 in 10 people report vaccine injuries because gullible people have been convinced that sudden infant death syndrome is actually real.  </p>

<p>Lets take into account that the authorities claim that around 1 in 100,000 people suffer severe adverse health consequences from Measles (severely overinflated number) and around 1 in 100,000 suffer severe consequences from a vaccine (severely underinflated number, especially considering they don&#39;t even consider autism) and there are nearly 40 injections in the current vaccination schedule, and even if these diseases were allowed to circulate again you still wouldn&#39;t have a 100% chance of catching it; there is AT LEAST a 40-fold increased risk of being severely injured from a vaccine than from measles.  </p>

<p>Of course, if the MMR vaccine was reformulated and actually proven to be safe by rigorous independent studies around the world (currently, independent researchers are not even allowed to study the vaccines themselves, they must infer their conclusions from statistics and other studies, making it almost impossible to prove anything other correlation) I would be all for it.  Some vaccines like the current Polio vax are very effective and should be continued (all vaccines need to be reformulated with safer ingredients, though.  The current ingredients in vaccines are horrifying and unsafe).  The problem isn&#39;t the science of vaccination which should be pursued, it is the horrendous greed and contempt for human life that the pharmaceutical manufacturers have repeatedly demonstrated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have not been any deaths from measles in USA and Canada in over 12 years so the fatality rate you linked is outdated and wrong.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t real. SIDS, by definition, doesn&#39;t have a known cause but according to the wikipedia article: &quot;A triple-risk model states that SIDS occurs when an infant with an underlying, biological vulnerability who is at a critical developmental age is exposed to an external trigger.&quot;  What I&#39;m saying is vaccines are often that trigger and a very likely cause of some SIDS deaths.  </p>

<p>The MMR deaths are from the VAERS database.  </p>

<p>Your &quot;diagnostic&quot; argument for autism has truth but isn&#39;t entirely right.  The author of the latest report by the National Epidemiologic Database for the Study of Autism in Canada has stated &quot;&quot;a third of the observed increase in the prevalence of autistic disorder between 1996 and 2004 could not be explained by increased diagnosis alone.&quot;  If it could be simply explained away, the CDC would be all over it just to take some pressure off the MMR.  Anybody who has researched the subject knows a tripling of incidence in 15 years can&#39;t be explained purely by diagnostic criteria, especially considering mounting evidence of environmental factors playing a large role in onset of autism.  The change they made to Aspergers is they added it to the &quot;ASD spectrum.&quot;</p>

<p>The concerns are actively downplayed and minimized by the industry and regulators. The most common vaccines (like MMR) are very harmful and they <em>are</em> linked to autism in certain groups, a fact which the CDC covered up. </p>

Like, really, guys, I want to find out what&#39;s new in the field, not read some hysteric spitting and cursing about some 1% of the population that doesn&#39;t affect anything. </p>

<p>If they cared at all about it for real, they&#39;d talk about how to get boosters, where to get them, how much they cost, how many are in stock, who&#39;s stocking up - but no, it&#39;s &quot;this segment of the population should go to jail/be killed&quot; and they don&#39;t even KNOW anyone who&#39;s an anti-vaxxer. </p>

<p>I mean, for crap&#39;s sake, you threaten people with jail for not getting their kids immunized, but we have a shortage of the vaccine anyway? Or it&#39;s only 85% effective or less? Give me a break, this simplistic approach we&#39;re seeing from people is embarrassing.</p>

<p>You are right that it&#39;s a PR push - it&#39;s smoke and mirrors to hide efficacy issues with the vaccine. But it&#39;s been happening for longer than the last few days. If these PR folks and useful lemminglike tools cared about human health and kids&#39; health, they&#39;d push boosters for real...vaccinated adults are catching and spreading the disease the same way kids are - and most kids are vaccinated, there&#39;s only like a 1-2% opt-out rate across the US for school-aged kids. Tiny. They need to get their act together, because if Mumps comes back, that&#39;s hardcore bad as the Mumps part of the MMR apparently only works for 2 years...</p>

<p>Good point. People like to act like everyone who is cautious about vaccines is a straight &#39;anti-vaxxer&#39;, when in reality most people talking about vaccines just want to be careful and take the ones that are necessary only when they are necessary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to what happens if you try to question any aspect of the holocaust. It could be the tiniest detail but if you question it you&#39;re a full blown holocaust denier.</p>

<p>Exactly. Vaccinating for childhood diseases and the flu is unnecessary and harmful. Most affluent parents do not vaccinate their kids because they are educated and scientifically literate (thanks to private schooling); those that do vaccinate their kids opt for quarter doses or several injections over a period of time. It is the ignorant masses who are supposed to inject their babies with the MMR vaccine all at once. </p>

<p>Vaccination should be reserved for special cases, like polio when traveling or tetanus when injured. The MMR and flu vaccine is a con aimed at stupid, ignorant poor people. </p>

<p>For now they don&#39;t affect much, but in areas where they are a majority it is legitimately less safe for all children, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/27/californias-epidemic-of-vaccine-denial-mapped/">the numbers of unvaccinated are unevenly distributed and growing</a>.  </p>

<p>The point of a vaccine is not to be 100% effective, it is to be effective enough that a disease cannot sustainably spread in a population and thus prevent and large-scale outbreaks.  If more than around 4/5ths of the population is vaccinated (depending on the disease), epidemics cannot occur or are at least much less likely.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how does the hysterical abuse and non-scientific bullying (pro-vax folks are outright lying for some unknown reason in many comment sections I read - there was an article by the Verge yesterday, I didn&#39;t count more than one comment that was scientifically correct, it was nuts) get those 1-3% hesitant parents to vaccinate? Answer is, it doesn&#39;t. And if those crowing really cared about human health, they&#39;d educate and act civilly.</p>

<p>Happy to see both Scientific American and the New York Times sound the voice of reason tonight: both posted editorials asking for a less idiocracy-reminiscent and abusive responses from media (aka pharma PR) and medical authorities, stressing how absolutely counterproductive the current onslaught is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know - check out that Verge article from yesterday - that&#39;s not an Internet comment, it&#39;s a full and pretty nasty article. And the USA Today article from a few days back. And more - many mainstream news sources in on the pummeling and passing off &quot;facts&quot; that actually aren&#39;t even true. We&#39;re getting bombarded with fever-pitch vilification of a tiny segment of society, a massive onslaught. I don&#39;t know any &quot;anti-vax&quot; people in real life, but I know plenty of people who are like, &quot;WTF is going on with this propaganda? Is there something more about vaccines I don&#39;t know about?&quot; And NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING about adults getting checked out to make sure they&#39;re still protected, where to get their MMR re-upped, how much it costs, who&#39;s got it and who&#39;s short, clinics set up for kids that may not have gotten theirs on time (pediatricians are always packed), and so on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cool to finally see some mainstream sources wise up, and I do wonder if whoever the source is will get caught out in it as it&#39;s so blatant and it&#39;s actively hurting human health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t kept up very closely, and I&#39;ll admit that you may be correct.  However, my default assumption would be what I see as the more simple explanation; that something (that leukemia kid maybe) started off a lot of anger among some people (it is an emotional story that makes the issue seem pretty one-sided) and the media bandwaggoned on (clicks=money and right now, vaccines=clicks) causing a positive feedback loop that will probably burn itself out because, like you say, it is counterproductive and stupid.<br/>
It seems to me that this kind of thing happens quite a lot in the media, and the media probably spurs it on when they can (especially the less reputable networks and websites), so outside money and influence isn&#39;t really needed to start this kind of thing and it certainly isn&#39;t needed once it&#39;s going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an antivaxxer. But I do question the ethics of the manufacturers and some of the standards used by <em>some</em> of those certified to dispense inoculations. </p>

<p>I&#39;m peripherally attached to the industry. Just close enough to see with my own two eyes the practices involved with pharma reps pitching their latest and greatest. The lack of ethics involved sometimes is hard to believe, such as pharmacology not due to hit the market for <em>years</em>, formulas not even out of peer review yet being pitched to Drs and RNs. If it happens with drugs, it happens with everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. This is so obvious to me. &#39;Pay for comments&#39;, &#39;pay for content&#39; or &#39;pay for votes&#39; is not discussed in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement">reddit user agreement</a>. My assumption is that means it is all allowed and generally assumed that it happens. The FTC only bans posting/commenting in support of specific products without disclosure. For issues like vaccines, a PR firm is completely within the law to post/comment/vote on any website without disclosing they are being hired to do so (as long as they are promoting vaccines in general and not a specific product).</p>

<p>How do we keep this from happening?</p>

<p>1) urge reddit to strictly ban &quot;pay for comments&#39; in their next user agreement update. Might not help, but at the very least it acknowledges that it is an issue. </p>

<p>2) record and sort data of hot button issues that are ripe for outside corporate influence. Seems tricky, is even possible?</p>

To hide this, a giant PR onslaught is occurring, blaming parents of the 1-3% unvaccinated children for everything so that we don&#39;t realize something might be up with efficacy of the vaccine/whether measles is changing/any other number of issues that would involve Merck doing something that would cost them money or impact the litigation in a negative way for them.</p>
