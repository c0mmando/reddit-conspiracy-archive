    <div class="md"><p>Look at the actual data on men abusers and female abusers with regards to each other and their children.  </p>

<p>The story we are told on the MSM about men and women is not reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a 2010 national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Department of Justice, in the last 12 months more men than women were victims of intimate partner physical violence and over 40% of severe physical violence was directed at men. Men were also more often the victim of psychological aggression and control over sexual or reproductive health. Despite this, few services are available to male victims of intimate partner violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of the 2012 child abuse cases, 45.3% of the perpetrators were male and 53.5% were female.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to villify or glorify one group, but this constant meme of trying to &quot;fix&quot; men while we ignore women is not helping.  Until we can have a conversation about how <strong>everyone</strong> affects each other and their children, these one-sided misrepresentations will only server to further skew the perception of men from reality.</p>

<p>This is laughable at best.  Every TV show follows the same formula:  Nice enough guy dad who is foolish and often incompetent and the house would fall apart if it weren&#39;t for the strong woman holding things together at their side.</p>

<p>Have you not seen the lifetime channel?  If a man cheats, it&#39;s his fault because he is selfish and doesn&#39;t appreciate his woman.  If a woman cheats, it&#39;s his fault because he is selfish and doesn&#39;t appreciate his woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know damn well neither you nor most people hold that mindset about cheating, everyone knows cheating is the fault of the cheater, but that&#39;s besides the point. You&#39;re acting like entertainment (not commercials) is meant to influence society instead of reflect it. Not everyone is pushing an agenda. For every example you give of men being made to look bad I can counter with 5 of men being made to look superior. Where are the shows and movies about female geniuses? Look at entertainment - House, Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad. The women in these shows are always used for relationships and caretaking, stereotypical female roles, while men are prodigies and masterminds. Men as a whole in entertainment have always been the center, they&#39;re the characters being developed, while the women are simply supporting, replaceable characters. Doctor Who for instance, crazy awesome alien space genius, a man for 50 years of television despite it being canon that each time he dies he&#39;s regenerated as a random race, gender, and everything, but it&#39;s always a white man and his companion is (almost) always an attractive female. I&#39;m a man and I&#39;m simply not blind to this reality, I don&#39;t personally care to do anything about it, but I won&#39;t ignore that it&#39;s there, you&#39;re just operating on a form of confirmation bias, anything that you find to be against you you instantly take note of and internalise while you ignore the far more plentiful contrary. And I&#39;ll tell you why you&#39;re like this too, because up until recently women haven&#39;t tried to be vocal and active about this problem, but now they are, and you&#39;re not used to it, so going from male dominated commercials and entertainment to a big more about of an even playing field to you creates the illusion it&#39;s women dominating it all now, because they were literally silent in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>House - Competent female doctors all around.  House&#39;s boss was a woman.</p>

<p>Big Bang Theory -  Well, you know guys that are scientists are all socially retarded and need a girl around them to keep them grounded!</p>

<p>Breaking Bad - The wife did some things that would hurt the antihero of the story.  Walter was a bad guy.  His wife actually did the right thing in the series by trying to put a stop to the criminal activity.  If you hated Skyler, then you were cheering for an antihero.</p>

<p>Those aren&#39;t exactly stellar examples that you have used in your argument.  </p>

<p>You need to consider things from the perspective of the growing number of single-parent households where the child is being raised by the mother.  Where do you think they will form their opinions of how men are and should be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to U.S. Census Bureau,3 out of 12 million single parent families in 2013, more than 80% were headed by single mothers.</p>

<p>You must watch a lot of man-hating shows because you clearly take issue with anyone pointing out the relevant facts and data that show women to be more abusive than men.  If you deny this, then that is just further proof that you are a delusional man-hater.  See how that works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whining about it? That sub is so depressing. How does watching little girls run and throw baseballs demoralize men? I don&#39;t even get how it would demoralize boys! I just don&#39;t get it. These guys need real men in their lives. Or to watch some John Wayne movies or something. It&#39;s depressing (and kind of embarrassing) as shit to have to observe all that self-pity spewed all over the Internet, it&#39;s like all the world&#39;s a support group. Maybe we need more closed support groups for young men or something, and obviously a solution to the overmedication issue, which I think is the source of a lot of the pathology...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you are making the claim that I must currently watch the lifetime channel and in my nearly 40 years on the planet I have never been around or seen the programming on that channel.  Do you have any proof of that claim or is you making up a stories all that you need?</p>

<p>You must watch a lot of man-hating shows because you clearly take issue with anyone pointing out the relevant facts and data that show women to be more abusive than men.  If you deny this, then that is just further proof that you are a delusional man-hater.  See how that works?</p>

<p>Now stop making up stories about people you know nothing about so you can feel better about yourself.</p>
