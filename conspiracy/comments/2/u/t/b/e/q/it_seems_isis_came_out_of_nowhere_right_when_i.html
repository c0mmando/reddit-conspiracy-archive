<p>Osama Bin Laden, according to Bhutto died in Dec. 2001, was buried in an unmarked grave. Others, close to him were there and a <em>death notice</em> or <em>obituary</em> was posted in local papers and aired on Faux news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I do not, but its kind of irrelevant to OP&#39;s point.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been &quot;dead&quot; or otherwise off the grid. The fact that OP forgot about him around the same time that ISIS got big seems super coincidental, which is what he asked about. Especially since when he &quot;began to forget about&quot; him has more to do with him than the general public, who probably moved on well before this summer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even talking about Osama and what he is or isn&#39;t. OP asks if its a coincidence that he forgot about him when ISIS started showing up. It is a coincidence. There&#39;s been plenty of other stuff to focus on between the two. To connect the dot between the two and leave out all the dots between is stupid.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you guys are bombarding me with Osama being alive and a sleeper agent. The question wasn&#39;t about that and neither was my answer. You guys just moved the goal posts on me.</p>

<p>So Osama is killed in some place they magically found after searching in some place where he wasn&#39;t after all those years, and then they dump his body at sea because all of a sudden Islamic Tradition is of the utmost importance.

<p>Because the question was completely subjective! Look at OP&#39;s question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems ISIS came out of nowhere right when I began to forget about Osama Bin Ladin. That can&#39;t be a coincidence, right? </p>

<p>When he forgets Osama is not the same as when everyone else forgot about him. If I&#39;m to believe OP just started forgetting about him this summer, when ISIS started making headlines, then I&#39;m calling that a coincidence. The general public forgot about him Osama shortly after he was &quot;killed&quot;.</p>

<p>What racket? The &quot;Islamic Tradition is important racket&quot;? Or &quot;the public needs someone to be mad at racket&quot;? Cause there have been plenty of things to get pissy about since Osama&#39;s death. That could &quot;distract&quot; the public or do whatever it is you&#39;re trying to say is happening.</p>

<p>My entire point, since the beginning has been that OP forgetting about Osama and noticing ISIS around the same time are purely coincidental. </p>

<p>There have been plenty of bogeyman in between Osama and ISIS. Between Benghazi, the Boston Bombings, Turkish rebellions, Russia invading Ukraine, and more, there has been an endless array of &quot;bad guys&quot;. If OP is only noticing Osama and ISIS then he&#39;s not paying attention.</p>

<p>You and the guy that originally responded to me ignored my sentiment and started spouting off Osama and Islamic tradition, when I never said jack about either. My original point, and the one that I&#39;ve made consistently, is that it is a pure coincidence that OP forgot Osama and shortly after noticed ISIS and ignored literally everything in between. We&#39;re talking about completely different things.</p>
