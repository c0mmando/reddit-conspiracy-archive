<p>A girl visited my sister&#39;s class in 2001 (little kids) in the DC suburbs.  She was house-hunting with her parents and was from California.  She would be attending this class after they moved in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Her return flight was &quot;the one&quot;, and she died when it &quot;hit the Pentagon&quot;.  My sister was especially traumatized by 911 for this reason.</p>

<p>So, if the thing that hit the P-gon was a missile, what happened to the plane full of people?  I believe a prominent political figure&#39;s wife died in the plane as well.</p>

<p>I suppose it could have been intercepted, assigned a new call sign, then landed anonymously during the airspace chaos in some remote place.  But then, the people?  Was it like &quot;the Event&quot; show?</p>

<p>See what I mean.  If the thing was a missile, and your argument is &quot;those people weren&#39;t real&quot;.  Well, I have reason to believe they were real.  So what happened to them if their plane did not hit the P-gon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <em>&#39;What about the passengers?&#39;</em> issue when considering the possibility of having switched the civilian aircraft for hardened, remote-controlled drones/missiles has been considered since day one. If one, after all the suspicious aspects of the whole disaster are considered, can accept that the whole operation was a slaughter of civilians designed to traumatize a whole country and set into motion a global campaign of wars were more civilian casualties became the norm, then it&#39;s not such a stretch to consider, as many have done, that a few passengers would be <em>acceptable collateral damage</em>, as grisly and inhuman as this might sound. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there are theories speculating over the fate of people on those planes and specifically <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article163908.html">the curiously high number of those involved in the military industry in that one flight.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All she did was show up to class, and say hi.</p>

<p>A few days after Sept.11 the teachers found out (maybe from relatives I presume, don&#39;t know that detail) that this girl actually had perished in the crash and wouldn&#39;t be attending and the kids would somehow have to know.</p>

<p>It is fishy.  I have heard of young kids showing up to class during house hunting to be introduced to their new school-to-be, but most of the time they don&#39;t do that.  I have to ask my sister about the official victims list.  You can stage something like this, but if there are only X kids on the plane, then that&#39;s only X schools to visit.  And you can&#39;t double up - unless of course this girl did visit other schools on the pretense that she was house and school hunting.  But the impression I got was that this girl <em>would</em> be attending <em>that</em> school.</p>

<p>Seems complex and minimally impactful for such an op.  I would imagine that the easiest thing to do would have been to fly the jet into the sea or something if a missile was to be used.  Regular passengers on a regularly scheduled flight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people on the planes were real.  They were probably dropped off at another location just like <a href="http://www.rense.com/general68/says.htm">flights 93 and 175 in Cleveland</a>.</p>

<p>Now the problem with your question OP is that it assumes that if the people were real, then the US gov must have taken them somewhere safe to live out their days on some island utopia somewhere, because the us gov would never be this barbaric to its own people.  Right?  Most likely, they were all escorted into some room one by one never to see the light of day again.  Any witnesses anywhere on this planet would be bad for business.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, no, that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m not doubting the skeptical case, I&#39;m just asking about the process.</p>

<p>For example, if the people on the planes were murdered on the ground, who did it?</p>

<p>I doubt regular military, maybe regular CIA.</p>

<p>Maybe the 9/11 planes were <em>all</em> landed somewhere by the &quot;hijackers&quot; who were then - unknown in the grand scheme to them - killed.  Maybe they thought it would be a hostage situation.  Then, the planes rendezvoused with remotes filled with explosives instead of passengers, which are the planes that actually &quot;hit&quot;.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m getting at.  Because - and I have to check the &quot;official&quot; victim list - but I&#39;m fairly sure that this girl was really killed on sept11.  Or, in other words, that it wasn&#39;t made up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for coming! </p>

<p>Obviously, your sister didn&#39;t know the girl well.</p>

<p>The entire visit could have been a decoy to create stories for the media exactly like yours, &#39;she was such a cute girl&#39;, etc.</p>

<p>As other have posted, about half the people on the flight were known military or ex military. This girl and her parents are possibly living under different identities in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>The other possibility is that all passengers were not in on it, and were flown to a military base and killed.</p>

<p>Maybe the aircraft were remote controlled out to sea and driven full speed into the ocean so as to create no wreckage? MH370 shows aircraft can disappear without a trace.</p>

<p>Fact is, we dont have an answer for this. Maybe the plane did hit the pentagon. But then...why dont the FBI release footage? How is this footage important to national security?</p>

<p>In the grainy footage we do have, the object has been shown to be missile - not 757 sized.</p>

<p>The fact that anything can hit the most protected building in the world is the main component of the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ll ask my sister who directly met this girl if she remembers her name or anything.  </p>

<p>Maybe she was kidnapped by a parent and they used the Sept11 story as smoke screen.  And yet, maybe her name is on the &quot;official&quot; list.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that a real live girl <em>did</em> meet with my sister&#39;s class in suburban Maryland.  It&#39;s not hearsay. obviously you don&#39;t know me, but I&#39;m trying to sort this out for myself.</p>

<p>Sick if they killed this person outside of even just a plane crash.  Maybe the MK Ultra/Springmeier stuff is true.  That whole story always disturbed me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so my first question would be &quot;who the hell decided to traumatized these little kids by telling them their future classmate splattered into a building?&quot;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine any reason to tell the children <em>anything</em> of the sort!</p>

<p>Have you considered that your sister may have imagined the scenario after the fact in order to explain why the girl didn&#39;t attend class?  </p>

<p>I&#39;d probably lynch the faculty member who exposed my young child to such horrors, has your family done anything about this unwarranted information sharing with children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like, the girl actually showed up to class to say hi during their house hunting.  I remember this, I remember this being discussed before sept 11.  It was after sept 11 that we found out this girl wouldn&#39;t be attending.  The teachers had to tell the kids something about why this kid would not be attending.</p>

<p>In any event, we were not a big suburb of DC, far from the Pentagon too.  I can&#39;t understand why this would be &#39;staged&#39;.  If anything, the girl was on the plane that allegedly crashed into the Pentagon.  I believe that the plane may as well have actually crashed there, mostly I&#39;m inclined to think that the hijackers were Saudi, and had materiel support from the Saudi royal family for the purposes of staging a propaganda event.  I&#39;m even inclined to believe in the possibility that thermite, remote control airplane controls, etc. might have been involved all around. Maybe there were explosives on the plane?  Who knows.  </p>

<p>What I was asking here was: if we assume this girl was real, and the plane involved really disappeared, assuming it was a missile that hit the P-gon, what happened to the plane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a lame theory by attention seekers.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the plane was never intercepted while it was heading towards arguably the most vital building of the government.  The undoctored footage is still kept private and every other camera filming the scene literally was capturing at 1-2 frame per second. And they don&#39;t want to share anything about the black boxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea the whole &quot;pentagon missle&quot; thing is generally accepted by the more extreme theorists. </p>

<p>Personally, i think the 9/11 conspiracy had more to do with logistics and criminal neglect of duties rather than substituting planes or shooting missles...</p>

<p>With that said, have you heard of &quot;Operation Northwoods&quot;? In it, the american government actually devised a plan to blame cuba (IIRC) for shooting down a plane, by secretly switching the passengers in a secretly planned layover, and then shooting the plane down themselves. This never occured, but there were plans for this. </p>

<p>This is one of those reasons why those more extreme people may have come to the conclusion of the passenger swap, or rather relocating those passengers and keeping them in hiding and then substituting the plane for a missle. I personally dont buy this line, but i csn understand why folks might be skeptical at first.</p>

<p>Even though everybody has their price, and i believe people can be bought to keep this a secret (if it was a thing), there still is the greater possibility thst someone would say something. People have good reason to believe that a plane crashed and passengers died, just likr you have reasons to believe this. This is one of those big issues with the &quot;missle&quot; theory thst makes me think the missle theory wont stand the test of time...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call the missile theory extreme at all.</p>

<p>You think an aircraft could punch a dead straight hole through 3 layers of the pentagon like <a href="http://jpdesm.pagesperso-orange.fr/pentagon/missile/trajectoire.jpg">this</a>?</p>

<p>Why no aircraft wreckage? Why a small turbine that is far too small for a 757?</p>

<p>Why have the FBI not released any of the multiple videos that should show a clear picture of a plane hitting the pentagon?</p>

<p>Why does the blurry grainy series of pictures that they did release, show an object that has been proven to scale to be far too small for a 757?</p>

<p>Im no expert, but I would suggest something like <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol/911_90_28.jpg">this</a> hit the pentagon.</p>

<p>I would say its far from an extreme theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the arguments for what you believe happened. But there are arguments against, as well. Like, what happened to the passengers? Like this little girl OP mentioned? (Assuming he isnt BSing us). </p>

<p>See, i dont just look at the questions whose answers are supportive of ones claims. I also check out the questions thst are against said claim. And so far, i am just not convinced that all the questions have been answered satisfactorily for either position. So i make my own judgement, until further notice.</p>

<p>This is what i meant by &quot;more extreme.&quot; There are degrees to which one subscribes themself to any particular theory. For the 9/11 theories, substituting a plane amd its passengers with a missle is more on the extreme side of the scale, compared to all the others who are theorizing about what had happened that day. Thats what i meant. No offense intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, this is what holds me back. First, these seem like good arguments. Lets take the &quot;broken glass&quot; thing as an example. Yea, some panes of glass did not shatter. In normal circumstances, one would expect all the windows to have shattered. But, do we know what kind of windows these are? If they are normal house windows, sure, this would be a good argument. But, if they are a bullet proof polymer type glass, one which could possibly be used in a building thst houses some of the highest brass and some of the most top secret informstion in our military, then we cant really use this as an argument, because we do not know the physical characteristics if thst particular type of glass.</p>

<p>If your cited source had questioned that, and looked into it, then thatd be nice. But they dont. None of them do. They pick certain details thst upon face value seem convincing, but when further investigsting, critical questions are always unasked.</p>

<p>I dont buy the missle theory. Not at this moment, at least. Its okay if you do. Its good to be skeptical. Id just advise you took look for these kinds of things, and try to search for the answers. </p>

<p>Start with what kind of glass made up the windows at the pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For people who were awake on 9/11, the fact that no plane impacted the Pentagon is <em>patently obvious from all evidence available</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as a single piece of evidence that supports there having been a plane crashed there surfaces, I&#39;ll consider that scenario.</p>

<p>But it never has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my ex-girlfriends&#39; kid sister&#39;s cousin knew a guy who heard from his brother that....  no seriously... that one of the brother&#39;s teacher&#39;s roommates... no seriously... lemme finish... that she had a friend who told her PERSONALLY that she knew someone who saw the plane hit the Pentagon with her own EYES!!!! </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to believe... but... please believe the official 9/11 story because it&#39;s troooooooooof that the mooooooslims did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I mean, this was my little sister going to school at the time, I personally knew her teacher and my mother was involved as well.  A little girl did show up to class before sept 11 to say hi she would be attending in a couple of weeks.  My sister was excited because they got along.  I couldn&#39;t get closer to this unless I saw the girl myself.</p>

<p>Then, she never showed and the reason was the P-gon airplane.  I mean, there are many explanations, but weird enough as it is.  </p>
