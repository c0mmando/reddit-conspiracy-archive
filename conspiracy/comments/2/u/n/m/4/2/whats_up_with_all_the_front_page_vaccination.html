<p>Just watch, there is going to be a huge gov&#39;t push (bill/legistlation) to mandate vaccinations.  It&#39;s either going to be, You WILL NOT have a choice; or its going to be, if you choose not to vaccinate, then your child can&#39;t go to public school.  I&#39;m going to guess and say its going to be the former.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see more and more threads.  We&#39;re going to start seeing more and more stories on the news about kids  suffering because of the evil parents that don&#39;t vaccinate their kids.  More stories showing a montage of kids laughing/smiling, video from their birthday parties eating cake and ice cream, or running thru a park playing with their dog, with cut scenes to their parents with their child in a hospital bed.  Then another cut scene to an evil hateable asshole looking parent that&#39;s condescending so that everyone will hate all parents that don&#39;t vaccinate their children.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ll see ridicule/mocking/bullying on forums/threads/twitter/facebook for people that even just QUESTION vaccinations, and masses that will come with all their studies and claim that the opposing studies are all bullshit.  You&#39;ll be told to get your tinfoil hat on, you&#39;ll be told you&#39;re also a 9/11 truther, you&#39;ll be told that you believe in every conspiracy theory out there, you&#39;ll be told that you&#39;re a nutjob and that you watch too much Alex Jones, or some other conspiracy theorist.  Getchur popcorn ready.</p>

<p>What&#39;s sad is that the majority of people fall for this type of propaganda and media manipulation.  People like my mother see this basic manipulation on the news, they see Obama (or any other president) talking about it, they see the sad pictures/videos of dying children and they jump on that circlejerk gravytrain and spew the same buzzwords like god damn muppets.  I guarantee I&#39;ll probably get a phone call from my mother, and the topic will come up  in conversation, as I have a feeling this vaccination bullshit is going to be top news on several channels in the coming months. </p>

<p>I&#39;m ready for all your sweet sweet downvotes to the trolls that monitor this thread and have &quot;vaccination&quot; as a thread alert to your inbox. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so upsetting to see how blindly people just follow, even smart educated people, people who on one hand are against GMOs &quot;not necessarily because &quot;GMO&quot; bad, but because of the pesticides used and what these organisms are actually being modified to do and resist&quot;, just like any issue in our society, one must dig in a bit further than the black and white that the media &quot;media that everyone by now should know is completely privately owned&quot; is always trying to make these issues make out to me. </p>

<p>Just like GMOs, vaccines are inherently for our benefit, the problem is that those in charge of both of these are privately run and hardly regulated, if regulated, most times it is done so by bias interest groups who have been bough out.</p>

<p>I mean for the love of this Earth, how can someone at the top of the FDA be an ex Monsanto board member.   How can we just stand by and let that happen, but what&#39;s worse is that not only does this happen, but we actually then trust these people to do &quot;what is right&quot; for the people. HA! Special interest groups and lobbying have COMPLETELY taken over any fairness and justice in our society. It is upsetting because this is happening in all aspects of our life, but it&#39;s so much easier for everyone to just go with i rather than stop, educate themselves and then take action. </p>

<p>We might as well be eating shit considering what passes for &quot;food&quot; these days &quot;GMOs in everything=roundup and other pesticides, SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR, processed foods, we breath in polluted air, tap water in most parts of the world is polluted with all sorts of additives, we are told to just shut up and believe those doctors and scientists who recite the same shit they read in some book, listen, not saying I don&#39;t respect doctors, I&#39;m just saying that sometimes there are many variables that aren&#39;t always tough to these &quot;people&quot;, because at the end of the day that&#39;s all we are no matter our title. </p>

<p>This massive &quot;pro vaccines&quot; push going on online currently really worries me. The front page of Reddit is always plastered with propaganda, usually it&#39;s pro-military, pro-vaccines, pro-police... But in the last few weeks it&#39;s non-stop anti vaccinations, and if you actually go in and read any of the comments, they are just as one sided and ignorant. Everything must always be black and white, but how can that be when this issue is so complex, when so many variables are in play? Everyone&#39;s body is different, everyone has different allergies and reactions, everyone has different levels of resistance. Mercury and aluminum aren&#39;t good for us, in fact Mercury can kill a person quite easily, yet these are okay once they are part of a vaccine? Okay, fair enough, it is a very small dose. But it&#39;s a small dose for a 200 pound adult, or a small dose for a 6 month old child? Now, if we take this vaccine which contains safe levels of xxxxx, and give a child 3 or more of these vaccines at once, are still within &quot;safe&quot; levels of poison? </p>

<p>Why does Europe not vaccinate children as early and frequently as North America? How can a &quot;free&quot; country consider itself free if it takes away basic rights from its citizens? I am not an &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; as apparently some people out there actually believe that ALL vaccines are bad, well that&#39;s just as ignorant as the opposite blanket statement that all vaccines are good. </p>

<p>The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Do your own research. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen enough not to trust big pharma and I don&#39;t see how that will change any time soon.</p>

<p>When this all comes to a head I&#39;m not sure what I will do. Vaccine science at its core might be perfectly fine but trusting someone to safely inject my daughter with an unknown substance is totally different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccinations are important though. I actually like the idea of not allowing un-vaccinated children into public school. Disease is a very serious issue. Spreading smallpox or Measles isn&#39;t a good thing. There&#39;s obviously an issue with children getting too many vaccinations in a short amount of time. There is also issues with contaminated vaccines, but I think we should be focusing on ensuring vaccine safety and not whether or not you should get vaccines in the first place. Not getting a Tetnis vaccine for instance is just dumb. However, things like cold and flu shots are also dumb and should be gotten rid of. They aren&#39;t doing anything but accelerating the evolution of the virus and making it stronger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely with this. I think some harm reduction is all that is needed. Everyone is scared that they&#39;re either not getting what the doctor says is in the shot or they think the government will eventually force people to take them.</p>

<p>I definitely don&#39;t agree with people being ridiculed for not vaccinating since everyone can do what they want with their own body and as long as you go and get vaccinated then you have nothing to worry about. </p>

<p>Has there been a recent rise in disease that is making scientists want more people to be vaccinated? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair it is a credible study and did link vaccines to something. I&#39;m gonna be honest, I read a breakdown of the study and found the paper from a link on the website. Funny how they can talk up a small difference in type I diabetes rates into a clear correlation. 54/100000 case difference is not worth reporting on. I agree, my sited evidence is not very strong.</p>

<p>The problem with that is while some vaccines could maybe have negative side effects the rate at which they occur is so astronomically low there&#39;s no way to know if it&#39;s the vaccine or something else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like brushing your teeth, getting cancer 5 years later and then saying it was the toothpaste.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think literally every vaccine should be forced on people, but they should at the very least need them to attend public schools or go to crowded places.</p>

<p>They&#39;re putting a lot of people at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I think once people on BOTH sides can come off their high horses and cut the elitist, egotistical bullshit of &quot;I&#39;m right cause I believe the information I have is right, so fuck you&quot; and have civil, understanding and calm discussions about not just vaccines, but anything really, we have a start.</p>

<p>Secondly, along that road, a lot of information we have is skewed in either direction for one reason or another. Big Pharma and Big Organic paying for results favorable to them, because they stand to lose money if people go too hard to either side. We&#39;re doing their work for them. Divide and conquer. There&#39;s no real independent research done to conclusively say anything either way, and if you look at what&#39;s been done in terms of studies, you&#39;ll find alot have attachments to ether Big Pharma or Big Organics. Also, I&#39;m wondering if the registry of people harmed by vaccines has ever been looked into and vetted, to see if those names come back to real people. We can&#39;t trust anything because of the world we live in. Too much payola.</p>

<p>We have to come to grips with the fact people have the right to exercise free will, and that companies and government have the right to exercise polices they enact, and that when those lines cross, there might be consequences. Take hospitals requiring nurses to get flu shots in order to remain employed. They&#39;re not being forced, they can quit or be fired if they don&#39;t wanna get one, or get one and remain employed where they work. If you work at a place around people who have compromised immune systems, and where communicable diseases grow like on a peat re dish, then there&#39;s a reason you get a flu shot (Regardless of how you feel they work/if at all). They&#39;re required so that A: You don&#39;t bring them in, and B: Don&#39;t take them to the outside world. Flu shots work by injecting a deactivated version of the virus into your system, so your immune response is boosted so you&#39;re more likely to fight it off quicker should you get it, and reduce your chances of actually getting it. In a hospital where people who are very old, very young, or have an immune disease are supposed to be protected from things like the flu, a nurse getting the flu, without the vaccine, and still coming to work means life or death that day to those people, as well as acting as an incubator for it and allowing it to mutate, and spreading it to others outside the hospital. </p>

<p>My opinion? Should people be harassed and made fun of because they don&#39;t vax because they believe they might be dangerous? No. Should people be forced to get them? No. Should places like schools and hospitals where mass gatherings of people who have suppressed, growing, or weak immune systems be able to require parents to vaccinate their children/make them part of the requirement of employment? Absolutely. </p>

<p>Shots can be very beneficial. We&#39;ve eradicated polio, mumps, measles (Until recently) and other diseases in the US, and elsewhere by having them, and have cut down on those effected by the flu, something people pre vaccinations used to die from. Do we need to look at them and see what dangers lie in each one, and what side effects they can have? Sure. We need to to keep them safe for use in everyone. However I do believe that they have a role to play in diseases like Autism, not because they cause them, but because they expose the underlying fame work people may have for it in genetic predisposition. I believe some ingredients could trigger genes to turn on, and get that response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im speaking for myself here, and not all the subscribers of r/conspiracy that your comment is apparently addressing (ineptly).  It&#39;s not that I believe &quot;vaccines are bad.&quot;  It&#39;s that I&#39;m highly skeptical of the necessity for for a fair amount of them, especially the flu vaccine, as doctors diagnose flu without ever actually getting a positive test for flu virus over 90% of the time (that&#39;s being generous). I&#39;ve read that in some circumstances we aren&#39;t permitted to know what&#39;s in them, and even you must concede that, in the past week especially, msm is really pushing them and pushing fear of not getting them.  This push, in the context of an &quot;Ebola outbreak&quot; I questioned the legitimacy of or just whether or not it came about naturally, is reason enough for us to at least raise an eyebrow at the prospect of any kind of mandatory vaccination.  Did I adequately answer your condescending, assuming question?     Edit:  forgot to mention that vaccines are a huge source of income for big pharma, this is obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, there probably really is some kind of link between ingredients in some vaccines, and autism.  Your phrasing is really horrible.  When you say &quot;we know they don&#39;t cause autism/that that idea was stupid from the very beginning&quot; I think what you really mean is, &quot;I&#39;m believing what the CDC says&quot; and participating in the circlejerk/alienation of &#39;you guys&#39;.  Watch this daily show interview and see if you still feel as sure about your assertions.

What concerns me is the treatment of the whole thing like a black and white issue. accines do a lot of good, but people acting like they&#39;re risk free aren&#39;t right. Sure, for most vaccines, the benefits outweigh the risks. There are some, such as the Hib vaccine that have real risks of developing autoimmune disorders such as type I diabetes</p>
