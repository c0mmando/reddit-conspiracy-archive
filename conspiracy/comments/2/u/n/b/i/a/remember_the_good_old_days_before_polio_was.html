<p>I basically check the front page now just for these gems. </p>

<p>That post should read:</p>

<p>&quot;Remember the days when we sprayed the entire population with DDT, causing symptoms that were almost indistinguishable from polio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember when breast feeding was considering inappropriate and the vast majority of children were denied the <em>best</em> protection from disease that nature provides?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember when the first polio vaccine gave thousands of children <em>actual</em> polio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember when Bill Gates&#39; polio program gave 50,000 children polio in India?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember when the polio vaccine was contaminated with a cancer-causing monkey virus that is currently responsible for the massive epidemic of soft-tissue cancer among baby boomers?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, I wonder if it&#39;s because those countries still have high levels of DDT and other poisons in the environment?</p>

<p>Interesting that DDT poisoning is almost <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/036290_polio_DDT_pesticide_exposure.html">indistinguishable from polio.</a></p>

<p>And hey look! <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/paki.html">78 percent of Pakistani children with polio were given polio vaccines</a>!</p>

<p>And wow, look at this!</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/28/polio-eradication-campaign.aspx">India’s Polio Eradication Campaign in 2011 Caused 47,500 Cases of Vaccine-Induced Polio Paralysis</a></p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf">defy you to read this.</a></p>

<p>But let&#39;s just call those 50,000 cases in India &quot;aseptic meningitis&quot; and we can pretend polio was eradicated! And people will buy it! Yay!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/index.php/ijme/article/view/110/1065">This article</a>, published in the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, should&#39;ve made headlines around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to examine this claim, because it’s an interesting one but not one that should be taken at face value. The above commenter made a simple correlation: The three countries that have polio epidemics, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, all happen to be the three countries with large numbers of people unvaccinated for Polio.</p>

<p>You responded by saying that no, Afghan, Pakistani, and Nigerian children don’t have Polio, they just have DDT poisoning. Well, I did some research on this, and here’s what I found:</p>

<p>Eritria, Ethiopia, India, North Korea, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801202/table/t1-ehp-117-1656/">all still use DDT.</a> Curiously, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria are left off of that table, but I’ll ignore that for the sake of throwing you a bone. </p>

<p>So this raises the inevitable question: Where are the Polio cases in South Africa, India, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (the largest DDT users.) Why did Afghans, Pakistanis, and Nigerians mysteriously start suffering from Polio at the same time that vaccine programs were halted, yet Ethiopia has not seen a rise of Polio cases (or even any cases) to correlate with their increased DDT usage. If your hypothesis is correct, then the Polio outbreaks would be ongoing throughout sub-saharan Africa, not just Nigeria. Where are these outbreaks?</p>

<p>There’s a simple answer: You’re grasping at straws because you are desperate to promote a worldview which is out of line with reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty low-grade to make those statements about other countries when the OP was speaking about different situations.  The US diseases cases could still be what they were, without demanding that subsequent countries suffer the same.  Disease induction in the US could have been learned from, and produced better safer vaccines that were then used by other countries.  You really went off the wall to invent an attack</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. Polio cases have skyrocketed in areas like India, and this is directly linked to the administration of the oral polio vaccine. </p>

<p>Bill Gates&#39; polio vaccine program caused 50,000 cases of polio in India. </p>

<p>However, they changed the classification of polio in the 50&#39;s when they realized the vaccine was making things <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>So now they call &quot;polio&quot; aseptic meningitis and scores of other conditions.</p>

<p>It was a diabolically sneaky move on their part, ostensibly to prevent the public from losing faith in the vaccine paradigm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop selling bullshit. Polio is a virus, and virusses do not miraculously come from poisons. You cannot treat virusinfections, other than keeping the patient stable. You can, however, prevent infection by vaccinations. These are safe and reliable. They have eradicated some dangerous diseases. Everyone that has sees people being crippled by polio will be happy to vaccinate. Polio is nothing less than horrible. So stop your hippie crap and misinformation about vaccinations, and go talk to people who lost relatives or survived polio.</p>

<p>Yes polio is a virus, the polio vaccine doesn&#39;t always work and in a lot of proven cases makes things worse.</p>

<p>So rather than admit that they just changed what the cause was .. its not POLIO (because vaccines!) .. its aseptic meningitis, or this other thing, or this other thing .. not polio, .. no can&#39;t be polio</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER EDIT</strong>: I have been banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for this series of posts. I also did not delete my comment below, it&#39;s been censored as well. So much for being &quot;The last bastion of free speech&quot;.</p>

<p>This post is garbage and the mods of this sub are slowly working to subvert its credibility. </p>

<p><a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> all you do is vomit pages upon pages of tangentially related information, and expect people to somehow bother reading it. If nothing else, you are terrible at presenting and arguing a point of view, or inviting a questioning reader to think about the information you present, while I may agree with at least some of that info. More likely, your motive is to drive people away from actually researching by barraging them with too much to handle, some bullshit, some true, impossible to really sort through either way. &quot;If a mod is this crazy, what about the subs?&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that other mods and typical <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> agent provacateurs are commenting here acting like this opinion of black and white anti-vax is popular amongst people like us is cause alone to question their motives. Notice, dear readers, how it is exactly the opposite of the black and white pro-vax on the front page. Again, this post and many more are nothing more than attempts to polarize an issue and marginalize people with questions, such that no valuable discussion can ever really come. Very common propaganda technique, used for decades.</p>

<p>Axlotl and the rest of the bunch, let me just say this. You people are goddamned lucky I don&#39;t concern myself too much with the state of the world anymore, and stick to my yearly rants and enjoying what&#39;s left of my life. Else I&#39;d be a very big concern for you and your ilk, as I am very, very good at presenting the truth and reaching people on the fringe. The people you are trying to eject from the realm of rational thought and discussion. And as you know, the real truth cannot be stifled forever. I could certainly make a very big impact out there with my knack for speaking and writing if I so chose, and have a grand time exposing people like yourself and the clever little tricks you play. </p>

<p>On that note, back to enjoying my life instead ;)</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m also not sure why you people are brigading my comment down. Nobody is even reading this thread anymore, it&#39;s downvoted out of sight. Makes it pretty fucking obvious that you and cronies are targeting my comments in this particular thread with downvotes. Like I said, I would be way better at your job than you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, you are not the smartest boy in the room right now axolotl. You know that this has nothing to do with the points you&#39;re making, and everything to do with <em>how you are making them</em>. This has the added benefit of making you appear to be a conspiracy theorist yourself, such that someone like myself may have a hard time exposing you. </p>

<p>You know exactly the response an uncertain reader will have upon observing your &quot;points&quot; and your &quot;argument&quot; and your links to any number of alt-news sites with little credibility. That&#39;s precisely why you make them in the manner that you do. Go ahead and deny it for everybody else, but that does not change the fact that <strong>you know that I know the truth here</strong>. </p>

<p>Regardless of the content you post here, some of which is very true, your posting mannerisms and interests indicate an individual whose goal is to drive people here away from rational thought above all else, and to marginalize &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. The topics at hand are always secondary to that fundamental goal of promoting irrationality of thought in interested readers, and/or driving new/fringe readers away from rational thought. For if true rationality was more common, this world would be a very different place. Thus, the #1 goal must be to create and maintain an irrational populace as a means to retain absolute control.</p>

<p>That being said, I suggest not prodding me off further or I <strong>will</strong> make it my goal to ensure that everybody on this sub is acutely aware of exactly who and what you are. And believe me, if I set my mind to something, I will not stop until completion. </p>

<p>Oh, and sidenote, if I were an inherently evil or greedy person such as yourself... I would certainly be a lot better at your job than you are.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> My next comment was deleted by mods. Here it is in its entirety for anyone caring to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I wish you the best of luck on your deathbed.</p>

<p>Before you attempt to claim that as a threat, which it is not, I&#39;m referencing the fact that you will have many, many terrible things to think about when the time comes. Just to make myself crystal clear, such that my words can&#39;t be distorted here in the future. Though I&#39;m uncertain whether a sociopath of your calibre has any ability to experience something that even remotely resembles a human feeling about those things. It&#39;s not your fault that you can&#39;t, and you shouldn&#39;t feel bad about it (You also can&#39;t do that), but you are in the terms of this story we call life, a very unsavoury individual. But that&#39;s just the character you&#39;re meant to play here, so run with it, you immoral piece of shit ;)</p>

<p>Nope.  reddit specifically makes it impossible to determine who&#39;s doing the voting on posts and comments.  Even as a mod I have no ability to get any of that information, no way to see who&#39;s browsing the sub or voting.  But I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just an oversight on the part of reddit inc...</p>

<p>I know, it&#39;s terrible.  The voting system <em>was</em> what made reddit so great.  A content aggregator where the community decides what goes and what stays, what&#39;s relevant and what&#39;s old news.  And now to see this feature being manipulated so blatantly and so extensively, being used for the exact opposite purpose as what it was originally designed for, it&#39;s just disheartening.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to do that though it&#39;s not a terrible idea.  I check controversial pretty often too, seems like most of the good content on this sub winds up there these days.</p>

<p>Yes! A Rockefeller lab was responsible for the deadliest polio outbreak of the century in the 1910s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes again! High-sugar diets, combined with DDT and other poisons led to polio-like symptoms and higher rates!</p>

<p>Also, polio was redefined at the same time the vaccine was released to hide the fact that the vaccine was making it worse! We now call polio &quot;aseptic meningitis&quot; and a myriad of other terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I defy the vaccine apologists to <em>actually</em> refute the following information:</p>

<h2>Paralysis and the Politics of Polio</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio">Poliomyelitis</a>, or polio, is a contagious disease caused by a virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. </p>

<p>Fever, headache, sore throat, vomiting are some of the milder symptoms, and some victims develop neurological complications and paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases it can be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.</p>

<p>Some people mistakenly believe that polio usually leads to paralysis, but this isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus don&#39;t exhibit any symptoms, <em>even under epidemic conditions,</em> according to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Desk-Reference-2001-Pdr/dp/1563633752">Physicians&#39; Desk Reference 2001</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Natural_history_of_infectious_disease.html?id=ifQ3AAAAIAAJ">Natural History of Infectious Disease</a> by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet and David O. White.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio#cite_note-Sherris-3">The Wikipedia article on polio</a> initially cites the figure as 90%, but elsewhere on the page the “asymptomatic” outcome of poliovirus infection is listed as 90%-95%. According to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/polio.pdf">the source used for these statistics,</a> “Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymptomatic.”</p>

<p>About 5% of infected people will experience mild symptoms such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and fever—often diagnosed as a cold or flu. Muscular paralysis affects approximately one out of every 1,000 people who contract polio.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus. [Moskowitz, R. “Immunizations: the other side.” <em>Mothering</em> (Spring 1984):36]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually there is a full recovery from paralytic polio—it rarely is permanent. Only a small percentage of cases will experience residual paralysis.</p>

<p>There are many serious questions about what factors contribute to increasing an individual&#39;s susceptibility to serious adverse reactions to the polio virus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2993012-C/fulltext">Several studies</a> have demonstrated that injections, either for vaccines or antibiotics, increase susceptibility to polio. It&#39;s been known since the early 1900s that paralytic poliomyelitis can start at the site of an injection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed. This was documented in <em>Lancet</em> and other medical journals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McCloskey, BP. <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2850%2990549-6/fulltext">“The relation of prophylactic inoculations to the onset of poliomyelitis.”</a> <em>Lancet</em> (April 18, 1950):659-63</p>

<p>Geffen, DH <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=495472">“The incidence of paralysis occurring in London children within four weeks after immunization.”</a> <em>Med Officer</em> 1950;83:137-40</p>

<p>Martin, JK. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21032340">“Local paralysis in children after injections.”</a> <em>Arch Dis Child</em> 1950;25:1-14</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2993012-C/fulltext#back-BIB7">set up a committee</a> to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that individuals are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections; injections alter the distribution of paralysis; and it <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15426789">did not matter</a> whether the injections were subcutaneous or intramuscular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1992, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1538150">a study was published</a> in the <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> that again confirmed these results after documenting an outbreak of polio in Oman that was linked to the DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) shot. They concluded that “injections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1995, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199502233320804">published a study</a> showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections. </p>

<p>The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections...and with ten or more injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater than expected. </p>

<p>Why injections increase the risk of polio is unclear. Nevertheless, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2993012-C/fulltext#back-BIB7">these studies and others</a> indicate that “injections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis.” Health authorities believe that all “unnecessary” injections should be avoided as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1131622">A poor diet</a> has been shown to raise one&#39;s susceptibility to polio. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans&#39; Hospital, documented a link between polio and an excessive use of sugars and starches. </p>

<p>He compiled records showing that countries with the highest per capita consumption of sugar, such as the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person per year) had the greatest incidence of polio. In contrast, polio was practically unheard of in China (with its sugar use of only 3 pounds per person per year).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sandler claimed that sugars and starches lower blood sugar levels which leads to hypoglycemia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such food dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A serious calcium deficiency precedes polio. Researchers have always known that polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months. </p>

<p>Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream, soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In 1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their consumption of these products. </p>

<p>That summer, North Carolinians reduced their intake of sugar by 90%; polio decreased by the same amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases of polio in 1948 and 229 cases in 1949. [Data taken from North Carolina State Health Department figures]</p>

<p>One manufacturer shipped one million less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the publication of Dr. Sandler&#39;s anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down as well.</p>

<p>But powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business leaders and convinced the public that Sandler&#39;s findings were a myth and the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to “normal.” [<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Poisoned-Needle-Eleanora-McBean/dp/0787305944/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1398114507&amp;amp;sr=1-1">McBean, E.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Stuck-Against-Vaccinations-Injections/dp/0914532332">Allen, H.</a>]</p>

<p>As can be seen by <a href="http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg">this graph of United States polio rates</a>, polio epidemics became a serious problem in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although it never quite reached the levels of 1916 (when the epicenter of the epidemic was mere miles from a Rockefeller research lab that was experimenting with an extremely virulent strain of the polio virus). </p>

<p>By the early 1950s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk">Jonas Salk</a> began experimenting with a possible polio vaccine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to “kill” or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1955, the first polio immunization campaign was launched in the United States. Almost immediately, it became clear that something was very wrong with the vaccine. In the end, 70,000 school children became seriously ill from Salk&#39;s vaccine—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_incident#The_Cutter_incident">infamous “Cutter Incident.”</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mistake resulted in the production of 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live polio virus. Of the children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis. The Cutter incident was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The renowned surgeon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Ochsner">Alton Ochsner</a> even gave the vaccine to two of his grandchildren...one died and the other was paralyzed. “Apparently, Salk&#39;s killed-virus vaccine was not completely inactivated.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it was their eagerness to get the polio vaccine developed and distributed as quickly as possible, but unfortunately the NIH did receive dire warnings before the release of the vaccine...a warning from one of their own.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy">Dr. Bernice Eddy</a> and her research partner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Stewart_%28cancer_researcher%29">Dr. Sarah Stewart</a> are two of the most important scientists of the 20th century in the field of viral research. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stewart developed an interest in researching viral links to cancer in light of the pioneering research of Jonas Salk in developing a vaccine for the virus which caused polio. Stewart is credited with discovering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomavirus">Polyomavirus</a> in 1953. </p>

<p>She and research partner, Dr. Bernice Eddy, were successful in growing the virus in 1958 and the SE (Stewart-Eddy) polyoma virus is named after them. Stewart was the first to successfully demonstrate that viruses causing cancer could be spread from animal to animal.</p>

<p>The NIH Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Cutter polio vaccine, had received advance warnings of problems: in 1954, staff member Dr. Bernice Eddy had reported to her superiors that some of the inoculated monkeys had become paralyzed (pictures were sent as well). William Sebrell, the director of NIH wouldn&#39;t hear of such a thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps he should have listened, for a result, “The director of the microbiology institute lost his job, as did the equivalent of the assistant secretary for health. Dr Sebrell, the director of the NIH, resigned.”</p>

<p>Incredibly, instead of acknowledging Eddy for her validated concerns, they took her <em>off</em> polio research and instead ordered her to the influenza research division. Eddy continued her polio research on her own time, ultimately leading to one of the greatest medical conspiracies of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Following the Cutter Incident, the authorities acted quickly to alleviate the public&#39;s legitimate concerns about the safety of the recently developed polio vaccine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vaccine was redeveloped, and by August 1955 over 4 million doses were administered in the United States. By 1959, nearly 100 other countries were using Salk&#39;s vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1957 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sabin">Albert Sabin</a> developed an oral live-virus polio vaccine over concerns that Salk&#39;s killed-virus vaccine would be ineffective at preventing epidemics. Sabin&#39;s goal was to simulate a real-life infection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This meant using an attenuated or weakened form of the live virus. He experimented with thousands of monkeys and chimpanzees before isolating a rare type of polio virus that would reproduce in the intestinal tract without penetrating the central nervous system. </p>

<p>The initial human trials were conducted in foreign countries. In 1958, it was tested in the U.S. In 1963, Sabin&#39;s oral “sugar-cube” vaccine became available for general use.</p>

<p>However, it cannot be given to people with compromised immune systems. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_polio_vaccine#Iatrogenic_.28vaccine-induced.29_polio">Plus it is capable of causing polio in some recipients of the vaccine</a>, and in individuals with compromised immune systems who come into close contact with recently vaccinated children.</p>

<p>In 2000, the CDC “updated” its U.S. polio vaccine recommendations, reverting back to policies first implemented during the 1950s, namely the killed-virus shot. The oral polio vaccine should only be used in “special circumstances” (several countries still use the live-virus, oral vaccine).</p>

<p>However, a fact sheet on polio published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warns parents that the inactivated polio vaccine can cause “serious problems or even deaths.” <a href="http://products.sanofi.com.au/vaccines/IPOL_AUS_PI.pdf">One of the manufacturers of the IPV</a> also admits that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome">Guillain–Barré syndrome</a> has been “temporarily linked to administration of another IPV.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, despite these “danger alerts,” medical authorities continue to assure parents that the currently available inactivated polio vaccine is both safe and effective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we understand the dangers of Salk&#39;s early vaccine and the possibility of it actually <em>infecting</em> the recipient with serious cases of polio, it should come as no surprise that statistics confirm that the reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the killed-virus vaccine may have more than <em>doubled</em> in the U.S. as a whole. [McBean, E. &amp; Allen, H.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the one-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55 cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after mass inoculations)—a  266% increase.</p>

<p>Rhode Island reported 22 cases during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during the after inoculations period—a 454% increase. </p>

<p>In New Hampshire the figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to 276; and in Massachusetts they swelled 273 to 2027—a whopping 642% increase. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many NIH doctors and scientists at the NIH during the 1950s were aware that Salk&#39;s vaccine was causing polio. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some frankly stated that it was “worthless as a preventive and dangerous to take.” They refused to vaccinate their own children. Health departments banned the inoculations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Salk himself allegedly said: “When you inoculate children with a polio vaccine you don&#39;t sleep well for two or three weeks.” [As reported by Saul Pett in an Associated Press dispatch from Pittsburg (October 11, 1954)]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Idaho State Health Director angrily declared: “I hold the Salk vaccine and its manufacturers responsible” for a polio outbreak that killed several Idahoans and hospitalized dozens more.”  [McBean, E. <em>The Poisoned Needle</em> (Mokelumne Hill, CA: Health Research, 1957): pp. 140-44]</p>

<p>But the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and drug companies with large investments in the vaccine coerced the U.S. Public Health Service into falsely proclaiming the vaccine was safe and effective. [Ibid., pp. 142-45]</p>

<p>Salk continued to worry. Despite its regulatory and statistical ‘success’, the reputation of his vaccine was plummeting. <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/health/268596/polio_the_virus_and_the_vaccine.html">In June 1955</a> the British doctors’ union the Medical Practitioners’ Union wrote: “These misfortunes would be almost endurable if a whole new generation were to be rendered permanently immune to the disease. In fact, there is no evidence that any lasting immunity is achieved.”</p>

<p>The following month Canada suspended its distribution of Salk’s vaccine. By November all European countries had suspended distribution plans, apart from Denmark. By January 1957 17 US states had stopped distributing the vaccine. The same year The New York Times reported that nearly 50% of cases of infantile paralysis in children between the ages of five and 14 had occurred after vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1976, Salk even testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the “principal if not sole cause” of all reported cases of polio in the U.S. since the early 1960s. [<em>Washington Post,</em> September 24, 1976.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1992, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1554844">published an admission</a> that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although authorities claimed that the vaccine caused only 8 cases of polio each year, <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2012/03/the-polio-vaccine-part-2-2/">an independent study</a> “uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio vaccine. These reports included 6,364 hospital/emergency room visits and <em>540 deaths.</em>” [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS); OPV Vaccine Report—Document #14]</p>

<p>Eventually, after the public became increasingly aware of the dangers of the oral polio vaccine, it was  removed from immunization schedules.</p>

<p>There has been much speculation that the polio vaccine did little, if anything, to cause the virus to disappear. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Mendelsohn">Dr. Robert Mendelsohn</a>, a medical researcher and pediatrician, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raise-Healthy-Child-Spite-Doctor/dp/0345342763">claimed</a> that there was no scientific evidence this was the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1923 to 1953, <em>before</em> the Salk killed-virus vaccine was introduced, the polio death rate in the United States and England had already declined on its own by 47% and 55% respectively. Statistics show a similar decline in other European countries as well. [Alderson, M. <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4107744M/International_mortality_statistics"><em>International Mortality Statistics</em></a> (Washington, DC: Facts on File, 1981):177-8]</p>

<p>And when the vaccine did become available, many European countries questioned its effectiveness and refused to systematically inoculate their citizens. Yet, polio epidemics also ended in these countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason for the apparent decline in polio rates after the introduction of the vaccine, even while it was <em>infecting</em> many people with polio, was that polio was <em>redefined</em> at the same the vaccination program began. </p>

<p>The subject was controversial enough to be discussed during congressional hearings in 1962, when <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/phillips.html">Dr. Bernard Greenberg</a>, chairman of the Committee on Evaluation and Standards of the American Public Health Association, provided expert testimony documenting this important fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the vaccine the patient only had to exhibit paralytic symptoms for 24 hours. Laboratory confirmation and tests to determine residual paralysis were not required. </p>

<p>The new definition required the patient to exhibit paralytics symptoms <em>for at least 60 days,</em> and residual paralysis had to be confirmed twice during the course of the disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, cases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseptic_meningitis">aseptic meningitis</a>, a condition with many variations and causes, were formally distinguished from the polio vaccine after the vaccine was introduced, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackie_virus">coxsackie virus infections</a> (which can also lead to aseptic meningitis). </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;amp;address=115x10735">Both Guillain-Barré disease and aseptic meningitis were diagnosed as polio</a> during the US epidemics prior to 1957. If you use the pre-1957 definition, then there are many more cases of poliomyelitis occurring in the US today, than there were in 1952—at the height of the US polio epidemics.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/health/268596/polio_the_virus_and_the_vaccine.html">The Textbook of Child Neurology reported:</a> “Coxsackie virus and echoviruses can cause paralytic syndromes that are clinically indistinguishable from paralytic poliomyelitis.” This new requirement for doctors caused a vast drop in the number of cases registered as poliomyelitis—a drop that ever since has been credited solely to the vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Bernard Greenberg, who also was head of the Dept. of Biostatistics for the University of North Carolina School of Public Health, <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/phillips.html">“testified that</a> not only did the cases of polio increase substantially after mandatory vaccinations—a 50% increase from 1957 to 1958, and an 80% increase from 1958 to 1959—but that the statistics were <em>deliberately manipulated by the Public Health Service</em> to give the opposite impression.” According to Greenberg:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to 1954 any physician who reported paralytic poliomyelitis was doing his patient a service by way of subsidizing the cost of hospitalization....Two examinations at least 24 hours apart was all that was required....In 1955 the criteria were changed...residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset.</p>

<p>This change in definition meant that in 1955 we started reporting a new disease....Furthermore, diagnostic procedures have continued to be refined. Coxsackie virus infections and aseptic meningitis have been distinguished from poliomyelitis....Thus, simply by changes in diagnostic criteria, the number of paralytics cases was predetermined to decrease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some have speculated that approximately <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/phillips.html">90% of polio cases were eliminated from statistics</a> by health authorities’ redefinition of the disease when the vaccine was introduced. In reality, the Salk vaccine contributed to increased cases of polio in numerous countries at a time when there were no epidemics being caused by the wild virus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/polio1.html">Polio has not been eradicated by vaccination,</a> it is lurking behind a redefinition and new diagnostic names like viral or aseptic meningitis...there are some 30,000 to 50,000 cases of viral meningitis per year in the United States alone. That&#39;s where all those 30,000 to 50,000 cases of polio disappeared after the introduction of mass vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/polio1.html">proponents of this claim,</a> polio now “hides” behind the following conditions: acute flaccid paralysis, transverse myelitis, viral or aseptic meningitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Chinese paralytic syndrome, spinal meningitis, inhibitory palsy, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/health/268596/polio_the_virus_and_the_vaccine.html">The Los Angeles County health authorities stated:</a> “Most cases reported prior to July 1, 1958 of non-paralytic poliomyelitis are now reported as viral or aseptic meningitis.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://currenthealthscenario.blogspot.com/2012/08/polio-vaccine-neil-z-miller-part-2.html">In July 1955,</a> before the new polio definition was introduced, there were 273 reported cases of polio in Los Angeles County, as compared to 50 reported cases of aseptic meningitis. </p>

<p>In July 1961, <em>after</em> the new definition was introduced, there were 65 cases of polio and 161 cases of aseptic meningitis. In September 1966, there were only 5 reported cases of polio, and <em>256</em> reported cases of aseptic meningitis. [Los Angeles County Health Index: Morbidity and Mortality, Reportable Diseases.]</p>

<p>The incidence of meningitis skyrocketed as “official” polio cases declined, <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/health/268596/polio_the_virus_and_the_vaccine.html">as the following data,</a> compiled from national surveillance reports, shows. </p>

<p>Non-paralytic polio cases vs. aseptic meningitis cases: </p>

<p>1961-1982: 589 - 102,999</p>

<p>1983-1992: 0 - 117,366</p>

    <div class="md"><h2><a href="http://iseethics.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ddt-is-good-for-me.jpg">DDT is good for me-e-e!</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddt">DDT</a> may have played a significant role in the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 50s. By the early 1960s, it finally became understood that DDT was having a devastating impact on the environment and possibly human health.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/ddt_spraying.html">DDT spraying</a> and <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/typhus_pic.html">DDT delousing</a> were both extremely, and terrifyingly, common before this realization. </p>

<p>In 1953, Morton S. Biskind <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02883493">published</a> a damning report called “Public health aspects of the new insecticides.” A decade before Rachel Carson would release her groundbreaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring"><em>Silent Spring,</em></a> Biskind was desperately trying to sound the alarm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was even known by 1945 that DDT is stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in the milk. With this foreknowledge the series of catastrophic events that followed the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history, should not have surprised the experts. </p>

<p>Yet, far from admitting a causal relationship so obvious that in any other field of biology it would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite, the overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.</p>

<p>Dr. Biskind <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/west5a.html">had the composure to argue</a> what he thought was the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: Central nervous system diseases (CNS) such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world&#39;s populace with central nervous system poisons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biskind emphasized physiological evidence of DDT poisoning that resembled polio physiology:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Particularly relevant to recent aspects of this problem are neglected studies by Lillie and his collaborators of the National Institutes of Health, published in 1944 and 1947 respectively, which showed that DDT may produce degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord in animals. These changes do not occur regularly in exposed animals any more than they do in human beings, but they do appear often enough to be significant.</p>

<p>He continues, bearing his exasperation in trying to make the obvious plain. “When the population is exposed to a chemical agent known to produce in animals lesions in the spinal cord resembling those in human polio, and thereafter the latter disease increases sharply in incidence and maintains its epidemic character year after year, is it unreasonable to suspect an etiologic relationship?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Physiological_investigations_into_the_ac.html?id=1xkUAQAAIAAJ">A German study</a> of the physiology of acute DDT poisoning confirmed that DDT often causes polio-like physiology.</p>

<p>Biskind&#39;s views fell into disfavor after the introduction of the polio vaccine, which “proved” to most that the majority of polio cases were caused by a virus. By 1955, Biskind, whose works had been published in established medical journals and who testified before the Senate on the dangers of pesticides, was forced self-publish his writings.</p>

<h2>The Present Polio Predicament</h2>

<p>Problems with the polio vaccine continue today, for in February of 2014, a study was published <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/polio-like-illness-in-five-vaccinated.html">identifying a “polio-like” illness</a> in five California children. “All children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset...All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the Abstract authors may not know is that <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/05/08/bill-gates-polio-vaccine-program-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-death/">47,500 cases of vaccine-induced polio paralysis followed an oral polio vaccination campaign</a> conducted by the GAVI Alliance, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in India in 2011.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incredibly, the oral polio vaccine was given to Indian children, despite the fact that in the U.S., the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf"><em>because it was causing polio.</em></a></p>

<p>According to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication <em>it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.</em> </p>

<p>This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vashisht and Puliyel <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/index.php/ijme/article/view/110/1065">published their findings</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> and <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/28/polio-eradication-campaign.aspx">“should have made headlines around the globe.”</a> They determined:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. </p>

<p><em>Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received.</em> Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated.

    <div class="md"><h2>SV40</h2>

<p>We return to 1959 and the pioneering work of Dr. Bernice Eddy, whose previous warnings about the Salk polio vaccine went unheeded, resulting in many deaths. For her efforts, she was removed from polio research at the NIH. </p>

<p>For a complete account of Eddy and her story, <a href="http://www.vaksinite.info/The%20Virus%20and%20the%20Vaccine.html">read The Virus and the Vaccine: Contaminated Vaccine, Deadly Cancers, and Government Neglect</a>.</p>

<p>History, as they say, is doomed to repeat herself, for Eddy would yet again discover something was wrong with the polio vaccine. This time, however, the ramifications would be far more catastrophic, and her subsequent silencing was much more profound.</p>

<p>Dr. Eddy was fresh from her research into viral causes of cancer and her pioneering work in first describing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomaviridae">the polyoma virus</a>. However, she soon would earn the dubious honor of being the first to identify what we now call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40">SV40</a> (Simian virus 40), an infectious agent capable of causing cancer. </p>

<p>SV40 had widely contaminated the polio vaccine, and Eddy desperately tried to sound the alarm. Even though her previous warnings, if heeded, would have prevented the tragic Cutter Incident, she yet again was met with astonishing opposition.</p>

<p>What happened next was tragic not only for Eddy herself, but it precipitated one of the worst medical blunders/conspiracies of the 20th century.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Health-Century-Edward-Shorter-Ph-D/dp/0385242360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1397771618&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=edward+shorter+health+century">The Health Century</a> by Edward Shorter offers the following account of <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html">this story:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy&#39;s discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time.</p>

<p>At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. “I did things on the side which I wasn&#39;t assigned to do,”  Eddy said. One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier.</p>

<p>In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscope—the kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companies—Eddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause. </p>

<p>She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Edward_Smadel">Joseph Smadel,</a> that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.</p>

<p>The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as “lumps.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eddy tried every possible means to alert her peers to the danger, and ultimately decided she would “surprise” a meeting of the Cancer Society with her findings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel&#39;s desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown. </p>

<p>Smadel hit the roof. “Smadel called me up,” Eddy said, “and if there was anything in the English language—any awful name—that he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad.” Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.</p>

<p>Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether. </p>

<p>Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernice Eddy came to a shocking conclusion: an entire generation had been given cancer-causing monkey viruses. Using this knowledge, she predicted a future epidemic of cancer.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Hilleman">Maurice Hilleman</a> and Benjamin Sweet came to similar conclusions. Sweet and Hilleman were pharmaceutical researchers for Merck and are credited with first identifying the virus as SV40, the 40th such simian virus discovered until that point. According to Hilleman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The discovery of this new virus...raises the important question of the existence of other such viruses...As shown in this report, all three types of Sabin&#39;s live poliovirus vaccine, now fed to millions of persons of all ages, were contaminated with SV40.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hilleman and Sweet noted the possibility that it <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13774265">might cause cancer,</a> “especially when administered to human babies.” <a href="http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/June2001/PolioVaxSV40.htm">According to Sweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a frightening discovery because, back then, it was not possible to detect the virus with the testing procedures we had....We had no idea of what this virus would do. First, we knew that SV40 had oncogenic (cancer-causing) properties in hamsters, which was bad news. Secondly, we found out that it hybridized with certain DNA viruses...such that [they] would then have SV40 genes attached [to them]....</p>

<p>When we started growing the vaccines, we just couldn&#39;t get rid of the SV40-contaminated virus. We tried to neutralize it, but couldn&#39;t....Now, with the theoretical links to HIV and cancer, it just blows my mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/174424">Further research</a> uncovered even more disturbing information. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This cancer-causing virus was not only ingested via Sabin&#39;s contaminated oral sugar-cube vaccine, but was directly injected into people&#39;s bloodstreams as well. Apparently, <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">SV40 survived the formaldehyde Salk used</a> to kill microbes that defiles his injectable vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experts have estimated that up to 100 million Americans and at least 100 millions others throughout the world were exposed to SV40 through the polio vaccine. [Bookchin, D., et al. “Tainted polio vaccine still carries its threat 40 years later. <em>The Boston Globe</em> (January 26, 1997)]</p>

<p>Even though SV40 is universally acknowledged to cause cancer in animal models, strangely enough its role in causing cancer in humans is still debated. As Wikipedia explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research. Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear. </p>

<p>As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131333">some arguing</a> that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483871">others arguing</a> that some cancers <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626046">may involve</a> SV40. </p>

<p>However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, “substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the Wikipedia article points out, this is in contrast to a <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10534&amp;amp;page=66">2002 study</a> conducted by The National Academy of Sciences Immunization Safety Review committee that declared, “The committee concludes that the biological evidence is moderate that SV40 exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions.”</p>

<p>One of the most important researchers and authorities on SV40 is a molecular pathologist at Chicago&#39;s Loyola University Medical Center named Michael Carbone. From the Wikipedia page of American physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner">Herbert Ratner</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. </p>

<p>Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet &amp; Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. </p>

<p>The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. </p>

<p>In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. </p>

<p>Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is SV40 showing up in brain tumors and leukemia, but according to research conducted by Carbone and others, SV40 is being detected in 38% of patients with bone cancer and in 58% of those with mesothelioma, a deadly type of lung cancer. Carbone&#39;s pioneering work indicates that SV40 blocks an important protein that normally protects cells from becoming malignant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2001, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> published a story called <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">“Rogue virus in the vaccine: Early polio vaccine harbored virus now feared to cause cancer in humans,”</a> stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The discovery of SV40 in human tumors has generated intense debate within the scientific community, pitting a handful of government health officials, who believe that the virus is harmless, against researchers from Boston to China who now suspect SV40 may be a human carcinogen. At stake are millions of research dollars and potential medical treatments for those afflicted with the cancers SV40 may be causing. </p>

<p>“I believe that SV40 is carcinogenic (in humans),” said Dr. Michele Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. “We need to be creating therapies for people who have these cancers, and now we may be able to because we have a target—SV40.”</p>

<p>But scientists at the National Cancer Institute say their studies show almost no SV40 in human tumors and no cancer increase in people who received the contaminated vaccine. “No one would dispute there&#39;s been a widespread, very scary exposure to the population of potentially cancer-causing virus,” said Dr. Howard Strickler, NCI&#39;s chief investigator. “But none of our studies and other major analyses have shown an inkling of an effect on the population.”</p>

<p>Critics charge, however, that the few studies done by the government are scientifically flawed and that health officials have downplayed the potential risks posed by SV40 ever since they learned in 1961 that the virus contaminated the polio vaccine and caused tumors in rodents. </p>

<p>“How long can the government ignore this?” asked Dr. Adi Gazdar, a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center cancer researcher. “The government has not sponsored any real research. Here&#39;s something possibly affecting millions of Americans, and they&#39;re indifferent. Maybe they don&#39;t want to find out.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1998, after a national cancer database was analyzed, it was determined that among those exposed to SV40 from the polio vaccine, there were 17% more bone cancers, 20% more brain cancers, and <em>178%</em> more mesotheliomas. <a href="http://www.nccn.net/%7Ewwithin/polio.htm">Researchers also found</a> 10 times more osteosarcoma rates.</p>

<p>Even more alarming, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835679">some research suggests</a> that SV40 can be passed from human to human and form mother to child. <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">A study of nearly 60,000 women</a> found that children of mothers who received the Salk vaccine in the early 1960s had brain tumors at a rate 13 times greater than mothers who didn&#39;t receive the shot.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8841004">a 1996 study</a> published in the journal <em>Cancer Research</em> found SV40 in 23% of blood samples and 45% of semen taken from healthy subjects. Mauro Tognon, one of the authors of this study, believes this might explain why brain, bone, and lung cancers are on the rise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite official denials of any correlation between SV40-contaminated polio vaccines and increased cancer rates, by April 2001, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">62 papers from 30 laboratories</a> around the world had reported SV40 in human tissues and tumors. Even the National Cancer Institute issued a statement that SV40 “may be associated with human cancer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the uncertainty? Why the obfuscation? Why the silence? In his book <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html">The Health Century,</a> Edward Shorter asks these questions and quotes an extraordinary statement made by Albert Sabin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was this silence merely the incompetence of the press in the face of a complex scientific question, or was there a deliberate effort to keep a lid on the story? Albert Sabin was asked thirty years later why the silence? “I think to release certain information prematurely,” he said, “is not a public service. There&#39;s too much scaring the public unnecessarily. Oh, your children were injected with a cancer virus and all that. That&#39;s not very good.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation">the SV40 Cancer Foundation</a> is devoted to raising awareness about a potential link between the simian virus and human cancer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SV40 Cancer Foundation was founded by Raphaele and Michael Horwin. The Horwin&#39;s son Alexander Horwin was born on June 7, 1996 and was given the oral polio vaccine in November 1997. Alexander was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a malignant brain cancer, leading to his death on January 31, 1999. </p>

<p>The Horwins contend that the polio vaccine their son ingested was contaminated with SV40, leading to his death. Four independent PCR tests performed at four separate research institutes on Alexander&#39;s brain tissue demonstrated the presence of the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The Virus and the Vaccine</em> documents the incredible saga of the Horwin family. The vaccine manufacturer unsuccessfully tried to argue in court that the SV40 contamination was the result of a trip to the zoo (!), but the Horwin family had overwhelming scientific evidence on their side. </p>

<p>Tragically, although the judge admitted the polio vaccine was the likely origin of the SV40 that was found in his tumor, the vaccine manufacturer was exonerated because their equipment was insufficient and unable to offer 100% certainty that the product would be SV40-free.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons this subject needs to be <em>thoroughly</em> studied is that traditional methods of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy <a href="http://www.sv40foundation.org/Treating.html">may make SV40-related cancers worse:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is well documented that SV40 binds with tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB. These genes and their proteins are needed to drive a damaged cell towards apoptosis—programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a critical cellular function that stops the growth of tumors in man.</p>

<p>Cell-killing or cytotoxic therapies like chemotherapy and radiation utilize apoptosis. These therapies cause cellular DNA damage such as point mutations, strand breaks, and other disturbances to a cell’s DNA. This DNA damage, in turn, triggers the apoptosis which leads to cell death. In this way, chemo and radiation kill cells (cancer cells and healthy cells). </p>

<p>However, when the large T antigen (Tag) of SV40 is present in a cancer cell it binds p53 and RB and stops these genes from working. There is no apoptosis. The result is that chemo and radiation kill healthy cells, <em>but the cancerous cells infected with SV40’s Tag live on with even more mutations.</em> </p>

<p><em>This means that standard cancer therapies may only make a SV40 cancer more abnormal and aggressive and less responsive to standard cytotoxic therapies.</em></p>

<p>Knowing this, you would think that a patient who is diagnosed with a cancer associated with SV40 (i.e. brain cancers, mesothelioma, bone cancers, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and thyroid cancers) would have their cancer tested for the presence of this virus. And, if the virus is present, the patient would be offered rational therapies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are no prospective tests or trials in which SV40 status is used in clinical decision-making. Instead, tumors are tested often after a patient has died to determine whether it contained SV40. At this point, there is no benefit to the patient.</p>

<p>SV40 is a problem that federal government authorities have not addressed responsibly because the government’s own vaccine programs are responsible for the spread of the virus throughout the western world. Federal authorities are so concerned about being blamed for unleashing a cancer-causing monkey virus that they would rather ignore its role in cancer than take the appropriate steps to develop rational therapies.</p>

<p>If the WHO&#39;s smallpox vaccination campaign triggered an AIDS epidemic in Africa, how did so many people get infected with HIV in the first place?</p>

<p>SV40 was just <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1993-06-06/news/25971165_1_polio-vaccine-oral-vaccine-polio-virus">one of many simian viruses</a> known to have <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13905660">contaminated polio vaccines.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski">Hilary Koprowski</a>, who is about to be featured heavily in this story, wrote a letter to the Congressional Health and Safety Subcommittee in 1961 saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As monkey kidney culture is host to innumerable simian viruses, the number found varying in relation to the amount of work expended to find them, the problem presented to the manufacturer is considerable, if not insuperable. As our technical methods improve we may find fewer and fewer lots of vaccine which can be called free from simian virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1996/12/01/218857/">According to Ronald Desrosier</a>, a professor at Harvard Medical School, growing polio vaccine in monkey kidneys is “a ticking time bomb.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Desrosier acknowledges that you can test monkeys before using their tissue and screen out those carrying harmful viruses. But he warns that you can test only for those viruses you know about—and that our knowledge is limited to perhaps “2% of existing monkey viruses.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the 1950s-70s, virus detection techniques were crude and unreliable. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">It wasn&#39;t until the 1980s</a> that more sophisticated testing procedures were developed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That was when researchers discovered that about 50% of all African green monkeys—the primate of choice for making polio vaccines—were infected with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus">simian immunodeficieny virus</a> (SIV), a virus closely related to human immunodeficieny virus (HIV), the infectious agent thought to precede AIDS.</p>

<p>From the last study: “We hypothesize that the AIDS pandemic may have originated with a contaminated polio vaccine that was administered to inhabitants of Equatorial Africa from 1957 to 1959.”</p>

<p>This has caused <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1571197">some researchers to wonder</a> if HIV may simply be SIV “residing in and adapting to a human host.” This led others to wonder if SIV mutated into HIV once introduced into the human population by way of contaminated polio vaccines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccine authorities were so concerned about the possibility that SIV was a precursor to HIV, and that polio vaccines were the means of transmission from monkey to human, that the World Health Organization convened two meetings of experts in 1985 to explore the data and consider their options. After all, SIV was very similar to HIV <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079">and occurred naturally in the monkey species</a> predominantly used by vaccine manufacturers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, WHO concluded the vaccines were safe enough and insisted the mass vaccination campaigns continue. By 1989, they recommended not making the polio vaccine using monkeys infected with SIV.</p>

<p>The following year, wild chimpanzees in Africa <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2188136">were found to be infected</a> with a strain of SIV that was almost identical to HIV.
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2342562">Some researchers</a> even referred to it as the “missing link” to the origins of HIV.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since chimpanzees were used to test viruses for potential use in vaccines, and were kept in captivity by research laboratories, they could have been a source of vaccine contamination.</p>

<p>Scientific concerns were also heightened when researchers found some West Africans who were infected with an SIV-like virus that was a fundamental twin to HIV. They called it HIV-2, and like the initial HIV subtype, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2867393">it was implicated</a> in the development of AIDS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">According to Robert Gallo</a>: “The monkey virus is the human virus. There are monkey viruses as close to isolates of HIV-2 as HIV-2 isolates are to each others.”</p>

<p>By 1991, as the result of improvements in virus-detection techniques, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2019773">researchers found SIV DNA</a> in the kidneys of infected monkeys. <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">Minced monkey kidneys</a> were, and still are, used to produce the live polio vaccine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SIV was also found in the cancer cells <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1717707">of an AIDS victim</a>, and in other people as well. To many researchers, this trail of evidence had become too persuasive to deny. Apparently, millions of people were infected with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1571197">monkey viruses capable of causing AIDS,</a> and this cross-species transfer very likely occurred by way of SIV-contaminated polio vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since most historians agree that AIDS originated in Africa, how could it be linked to the polio vaccine if Salk and Sabin&#39;s trials were conducted in the U.S., the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In March 1951, several years before Drs. Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin would scuffle over whose vaccine was the true prophylactic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski">Dr. Hilary Koprowski</a> announced at a medical conference that he had become the first doctor in history <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2096806/">to test polio vaccine on humans.</a> His “volunteers” included several institutionalized children with mental handicaps. They drank the vaccine in chocolate milk.</p>

<p>From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Zaire). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555313/">Called by drums,</a> rural natives traveled to local villages where they had a liquid vaccines squirted into their mouths. 98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. <a href="http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/94tld.html">The youngest children</a> received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Fury-Polio-Vaccine-Controversy/dp/0684129973/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1397858991&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=klein+trial+by+fury">WHO denied</a> sanctioning the large-scale trials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1959, Albert Sabin <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1993129/">published a study</a> that claimed that Koprowski&#39;s polio vaccine used in the African trials contained un “unidentified” and “unstable” cell-killing virus. Although he was quick to point out the flaws in the vaccine of Koprowski, his professional rival, unfortunately his ability to detect viruses in the polio vaccine fell short when it came to mass contamination of Sabin&#39;s <em>own</em> polio vaccine with SV-40.</p>

<p>In response to Sabin&#39;s claims of contamination, Koprowski simply scoffed at him and said he was just trying to discredit his work (as he would do again and again to anyone making this accusation). The virus allegedly detected by Sabin was never identified.</p>

<p>Until recently, <a href="http://www.popline.org/node/366900">the earliest known blood sample</a> containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville, one of the epicenters of the AIDS epidemic that would occur a decade later. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gerald Myers, a genetic sequencing expert with Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1549779">tracked the evolution of HIV</a> and confirmed that today&#39;s major subtypes of the AIDS virus in humans appear to have arisen as recently as 1960.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1689">this time period</a> is widely accepted by medical researchers, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/11/6588.short">more recent conflicting reports</a> suggest that the first HIV infection may have occurred years earlier. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of <em>when</em> the first HIV infection occurred, it would seem to be premature to dismiss the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis">OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) AIDS hypothesis</a> on this basis alone. The timing of the first HIV infection is irrelevant to the question of whether or not some doses of the experimental polio vaccine used in Africa in the late 1950s were contaminated, thus precipitating a future outbreak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Koprowski&#39;s vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi—the precise area where high levels of HIV infection <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3321361">were identified</a> by researcher 30 years later. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people&#39;s mouths.</p>

<p>Could squirting an HIV-contaminated polio vaccine into people&#39;s mouths cause AIDS? <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">According to Tom Folks</a>, chief retrovirologist at the CDC, “Any time a person has a lesion in his mouth, then there could be transmission” of the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Robert Bohannon of Baylor College of Medicine asserts that squiring polio vaccines into one&#39;s mouth would tend to aerosolize some of the liquid. Small drops could then go into the lungs, and from there to the blood cells susceptible to infection. This <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079">could be</a> an efficient mode of HIV transmission.</p>

<p>Experts believe that the average time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS is approximately 8-10 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the African polio vaccine was indeed contaminated with SIV/HIV, initial outbreaks of AIDS would have occurred from the mid-1960s to early 1970s. This period <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3423743">accurately coincides</a> with the emergence of AIDS in equatorial Africa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understandably, authorities are very reluctant to admit that there&#39;s even a possibility that scientists may have contributed to the AIDS pandemic by growing polio vaccines in virus-laden monkey kidneys.</p>

<p>In 1992, Tom Curtis <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">published a story</a> for <em>Rolling Stone</em> that created quite a stir.</p>

<p>Although dismissed by most experts, “a few scientists, notably the biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.D._Hamilton">W.D. Hamilton,</a> thought the hypothesis required serious investigation, but they received little support from the scientific community.”</p>

<p>William Haseltine, a professor at Harvard, believes that hypothesizing about the origin of AIDS is distracting and nonproductive, saying, “It&#39;s not relevant...I&#39;m not interested in discussing it.”  Dr. David Heymann, head of the WHO&#39;s Global Program of AIDS, stated that “the origin of the AIDS virus is of no importance to science today.”</p>

<p>Jonas Salk wouldn&#39;t comment on the possibility, as apparently he was too busy working on an AIDS vaccine, and Sabin&#39;s response was “you can&#39;t hang Koprowski with that.” Koprowski himself initially dismissed the idea with a laugh, and then later said that “this is a highly theoretical situation.”</p>

<p>His amusement must not have lasted long, because Koprowski sued Curtis and <em>Rolling Stone</em> for “...the destruction of (his) professional and personal reputation, for mental and emotional suffering, and for...humiliation and embarrassment.” As a result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis#Development_of_hypothesis">the magazine was ordered</a> to pay <em>$1</em> in damages. [<a href="http://biasco.ch/materiale/OdM/testo/SeedsOfDoom2006_10_05rev.pdf">See <em>The Seeds of Doom</em> by Christian Biasco</a>]</p>

<p>However, both Tom Folks of the CDC and Robert Gallo thought testing the seed stocks of polio might be a good idea. According to Folks, “any time we can learn more about the natural history [of AIDS], it helps us understand the pathogenesis and...the transmission.” </p>

<p>Gallo believes that questions like this “are of more than academic interest because answering them may help avoid future zoonitic catastrophes—that is, transmission of disease from lower animals to humans.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Responding to these concerns, some AIDS researchers formally requested samples of the original polio vaccine seed stocks. But the government would neither release nor test them because there are “only a small number of vials” of the material, and tests “might use it all up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by Curtis&#39; investigative report, a British writer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hooper">Edward Hooper</a> traveled in Africa, Europe, and the United States for seven years. As a result of his research, he published a book in 1999 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316371378/mongabay-20">The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS</a>.</p>

<p>Although the scientific community generally rejects the OPV AIDS hypothesis, Hooper “criticizes the research and conduct of many of the scientists involved in the investigation and alleges a &#39;very substantial cover-up&#39; took place to silence the hypothesis.”</p>

<p>One of the several arguments against the hypothesis was that Koprowski was not using chimpanzees in his experiments, and therefore HIV contamination didn&#39;t occur. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis#Development_of_hypothesis">eyewitness testimony</a> suggests otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2004, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm5AvCc5lzs">The Origins of AIDS</a>, a French TV documentary strongly supportive of the OPV hypothesis, appeared on several television stations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438938/">film</a> offers a convincing case for the hypothesis, and seriously challenges the questionable nature of the categorical denials by Koprowski and others that no chimpanzees were used in the development of his experimental vaccine. </p>

    <div class="md"><h2>AIDS in America</h2>

<p>Although Koprowski&#39;s experiment may have contributed to the rise of AIDS in Africa, what might have contributed to the spread of the disease to the homosexual community in America?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, clinics in New York and California began experimental treatments for gay men afflicted with herpes. <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/251529">Therapy consisted of</a> multiple doses of the live polio vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vaccine was produced in the kidneys of the African Green monkey, a known reservoir for SIV, a likely precursor to HIV. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in the early 1980s, simultaneous outbreaks of Kaposi sarcoma and serious opportunistic infections (later associated with AIDS) <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2990876-5/fulltext">were reported</a> among homosexual men, especially in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. This time span coincides with the average incubation period between HIV infections and the development of AIDS.</p>

<p>In 1982, the CDC concluded that such outbreaks “strongly suggests the occurrence of a single epidemic of underlying immunosuppression....” The next year, HIV was identified as the causative agent.</p>

<p>In 1992, <em>Lancet</em> (<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2990876-5/fulltext">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736%2892%2990876-5/fulltext</a>) published the first scientific explanation showing how repeated doses of SIV-contaminated polio vaccines may have seeded HIV among American homosexual men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 1980s, hundreds of people diagnosed with AIDS <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9407071381/new-aids-mystery">had no identified risk factor,</a> in other words, they didn&#39;t engage in risky behaviors associated with AIDS infection. Many children were listed as NIR. <a href="http://www.un.org/popin/popis/news/cdcaids/94_03/940308091545.html">Some parents</a> even claimed that HIV-contaminated polio vaccines infected their children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 12, 1994, Bruce Williams filed a civil suit against the American Cyanamid Company, claiming its polio vaccine caused his daughter&#39;s illness. The suit alleges that “the live oral poliovirus vaccine was produced, tested, and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration pursuant to measures inconsistent with accepted standards of medical practice.”</p>

<p>The lawsuit also asserts that “the product was FDA approved despite the known presence of contaminants, including retroviruses such as HIV.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Williams&#39; lawyer even identified the specific lots of vaccine the child received, but the CDC and federal health officials <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9407071381/new-aids-mystery">refused to test them.</a> According to their lawyer, “The CDC could disprove my entire hypothesis by testing the vaccines they have in their possession. The fact that they haven&#39;t done so is evidence there&#39;s something wrong with the vaccine.”</p>

<h2>How Now, Mad Cow</h2>

<p>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was first noticed in the mid-1980s. Mad cow disease is a progressive nerve disorder of cattle that&#39;s similar to scrapie, a disease that affects sheep. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Authorities believe it spread to cows from sheep when they were fed scrapie-infected bone meal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a> (CJD and vCJD (a newly discovered variant) are the human equivalents of mad cow disease. They cause a comparable wasting of the brain leading to muscle incoordination, sensory loss, and mental confusion. It is always fatal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mad cow disease and the newly discovered variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob may be caused by the same infectious agent. <a href="http://www.mad-cow.org/%7Etom/spont_monkey.html">A study published in <em>Nature</em></a> showed that monkeys injected with BSE developed very similar symptoms to vCJD. They also have similar molecular characteristics.</p>

<p>Mad cow disease can be passed from cows to humans if they ingest BSE-infected beef, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/21/nhs.bse"><em>or if they receive vaccines contaminated with BSE.</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>BSE-associated infectious agents are capable of contaminating polio vaccines because polio vaccines are not only grown in monkey kidneys, but in calf serum as well. In fact, many parts of the cow are used in vaccine production. Glycerol is derived from cow fat; gelatin and amino acids come from cow bones; and the growth medium for viruses and other microorganism may require cow skeletal muscle, enzymes, and blood.</p>

<p>Authorities knew that vaccines could be infected with BSE-associated transmissible agents as early as 1988. Yet, in England, <a href="http://www.mad-cow.org/00/may00_news.html">vaccine manufacturers waited months</a> before switching to cows less likely to be infected and refused to removed current stock off the shelves and out of doctor&#39;s offices until it was all sold, or expired five years later toward the end of 1993.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to one British legislator, “The Department of Health was potentially criminally negligent in not requiring the immediate withdrawal or cessation of use of vaccines from potentially contaminated sources. It is also beyond belief the Department should not even have monitored those who were injected, and is now trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, in October 2000, the Department of Health became so concerned about the likelihood of of children being infected with BSE-contaminated vaccines and falling prey to vCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease—dozens of people, including children, had already contracted it—that they <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/21/nhs.bse">issued a recall</a> of hundreds of thousands of polio vaccines made using fetal bovine serum extracted from British cows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the United States, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1843322">the FDA issued a “warning” to manufacturers</a> in 1996 instructing them to “take whatever steps are necessary to reduce potential risk of transmission of BSE agent.” By 2000, the FDA realized that its “recommendations” were being ignored, for vaccines were still being made in bovine materials from countries reporting BSE. These vaccines wouldn&#39;t be removed from the market until 2002, when all existing stock had been purchased.</p>

<p>Although cows in America don&#39;t exhibit “mad cow symptoms,” tens of thousands of cattle are severely incapacitated each year in what some have suggested may be related to BSE. These “downed” animals have not been ruled out of vaccine production by the FDA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Richard Marsh of the Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, <a href="http://www.mad-cow.org/%7Etom/marsh_milkfever.html">conducted research</a> providing evidence that down cattle in the U.S. may harbor a new variant of mad cow disease. He inoculated cows with TME, a variant of BSE. They became “downed” instead of “mad.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8133096">Other scientists</a> inoculated cows with scrapie from U.S. sheep. They, too, became “downed” instead of “mad.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Farm Sanctuary, a national non-profit organization dedicated to preventing irresponsible agricultural practices, “We are concerned that, like in Britain, there is a powerful economic incentive to ignore evidence that BSE, or a variant of BSE, exists in the U.S.”</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>More Malicious Microorganisms</h2>

<p>SV-40, SIV, and BSE aren&#39;t the only concern. Monkeys and cows, the preferred animals for making the polio vaccine, harbor thousands of viruses and potentially infectious microorganisms. <a href="http://www.sv40foundation.org/Chronology.html">Scientists have known</a> since 1955 that monkeys host the “B” virus, foamy agent virus, haemadsorption viruses, the LCM virus, arboviruses, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), and more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1956, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus">respiratory syncytial virus</a> (RSV) was <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13359460">discovered in chimpanzees.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-100-Years-Orthodox-Research/dp/064615124X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1397886547&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=viera+scheibner">According to the controversial researcher</a> Dr. Viera Scheibner, RSV viruses “formed prominent contaminants in polio vaccines, and were soon detected in children.” Allegedly, RSV caused “serious cold-like symptoms in small infants and babies who received the polio vaccine.”</p>

<p>By 1961, the link between RSV and respiratory tract illnesses became clear, as <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1954434/">the virus was found</a> in 57% of infants with bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and 12% of babies with a milder febrile respiratory disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infected babies babies remained ill for three to five months. RSV was also found to be contagious, and soon spread to adults where <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/9663325_Recovery_of_new_viruses_%28coryzavirus%29_from_cases_of_common_cold_in_human_adults">it has been linked</a> to the common cold. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the CDC, today RSV affects the majority of children by the age of two, and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among children under one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>RSV remains highly contagious and results in thousands of hospitalizations every year; many people die from it. Ironically, scientists are developing a vaccine to combat RSV—the infectious agent that very likely entered the human population by way of a vaccine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wikipedia page for RSV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus#Zoonotic_potential">ends with this</a> provocative statement: “The RSV is virtually the same as chimpanzee coryza virus and can be transmitted from monkeys to humans...the inactivated polio vaccine was reportedly contaminated with simian viruses, including Chimpanzee coryza, during 1955-1963.”</p>

<p>The two sources given for this statement are a <a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/191/7/1036.full">2005 study</a> and, in the category of other simian viruses, Wikipedia provides a link <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130522091608/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/updates/archive/polio_and_cancer_factsheet.htm">to the now-deleted CDC page on SV40 contamination of the polio vaccine.</a></p>

<p>In 1996, <a href="http://www.yardflex.com/archives/001324.html">at the Eighth Annual Houston Conference on AIDS</a>, a microbiologist named Dr. Howard B. Urnovitz revealed that as many as 26 monkey viruses may have been in the original Salk vaccines, including the simian equivalents of human echo virus, coxsackie, herpes (HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8), adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr, and cytomegalovirus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sparks-of-light.org/Uranovitz-contamvac-diseas.html">Urnovitz maintains</a> that contaminated Salk vaccines given to U.S. children between 1955 and 1961 likely set this generation up for immune system damage and neurological disorders. </p>

<p>He sees correlations between early polio vaccine campaigns and the sudden emergence of human T-cell leukemia, epidemic Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, Burkitt&#39;s lymphoma, herpes, Epstein-Barr and chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>

<p>Indeed, as early as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1957.tb46064.x/abstract">1957 it was known</a> that as many as eight “apparently new” viruses had contaminated the vaccine from using monkey-kindey tissue cultures. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.yardflex.com/archives/001324.html">Urnovitz challenged</a> medical science to prove wrong his theory that the human immunodeficiency virus Type-1 (HIV-1) is a monkey-human hybrid that was created after 300,000 Africans were injected between 1957 and 1959 with quantities of experimental live oral polio vaccines contaminated with different monkey viruses.</p>

<p>Urnovitz <a href="http://www.clinchem.org/content/45/9/1602.short">also discussed</a> “jumping genes”—normal genes that may recombine with viral fragments to form new hybrid viruses called chimeras. He believes that this is exactly what happened when monkey viruses and human genes were brought together during early polio vaccine campaigns.</p>

<p>And because the chimera “has the envelope of a normal human gene,” typical cures won&#39;t work. How do you develop a vaccine or other antidote against the body&#39;s own DNA?</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Manufacturing Mutation</h2>

<p>The World Health Organization launched its Global Polio Eradication Initiative will the goal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis_eradication">eliminating the disease</a> by 2000. </p>

<p>However, by 2000 it became clear that polio was still around, and <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Problems+with+eradicating+polio.-a067972178">new strains derived form the vaccine itself</a> were emerging.</p>

<p>In 1983, some researchers realized that a “vaccine-derived” polio virus had caused an outbreak in Egypt. [Reuters Health. <a href="http://www.medscape.com/infectiousdiseases%5D">“Polio outbreak in Dominican Republic and Haiti caused by vaccine-derived virus.”</a> <em>Reuters Medical News</em> (December 4, 2000)]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1993, Dr. Radu Crainic of the Pasteur Institute <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8102826">discovered that strains of the polio virus</a> have the ability to spontaneously recombine with themselves and create new strains. </p>

<p>Crainic showed that if you vaccinate a child with polio strains 1, 2, and 3, you can produce a new strain, strain 4, out of the child&#39;s stool. Crainic concluded that the polio vaccine creates favorable conditions contributing to the evolution of viral “recombinations.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2000, virologist Hiromy Yoshida <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11081527">found a new infectious polio virus</a> in Japanese rivers and sewages. The virus had mutated from the polio vaccine and regained much of its original virulence, as confirmed by genetic sequencing. According to Yoshida, this poses a “persistent environmental threat” and the live oral polio vaccine is to blame.</p>

<p>According to a 2000 <em>Reuters Medical News</em> article, a polio outbreak in Haiti and the Dominican Republic resulted in numerous cases of flaccid paralysis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laboratory examinations confirmed health authorities&#39; worst suspicions: the disease was caused by “an unusual viral derivative” of the polio vaccine. The virus demonstrates genetic similarity to the parent vaccine strain, “but it has assumed the neuro-virulence and transmissibility” of the wild polio virus. </p>

<p>Health officials are obviously concerned, “because a wild poliovirus has not circulated in the Western Hemisphere since 1991,” and if the newly mutated polio virus spreads, it could cause new epidemics of the disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People around the world continue to be stricken with vaccine-derived polio viruses (VDPVs), and the aforementioned case in India is just one example. Under certain circumstances, polio viruses within the vaccine <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540a3.htm">“regain both neuro-virulence and the capacity to circulate and cause outbreaks.”</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, from 2001 to 2005, there were several vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in the Philippines, Madagascar, China and Indonesia. In 2006, additional cases of vaccine-derived polio were recorded in Cambodia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19566">a study was published in Finland</a> with a title that just about says it all: “Highly divergent neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses of all three serotypes are recurrently detected in Finnish sewage.”</p>

<p>Although no cases of “suspected poliomyelitis” have reportedly occurred in Finland since 1985, “Since December 2008, 21 genetically highly divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) have been isolated from sewage in Tampere, Finland. While the source of the VDPV is unknown, characteristics of the viruses resemble those of strains isolated from immunodeficient, persistently infected persons.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, animal matter and questionable drugs are still used in making the polio vaccine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the polio vaccine&#39;s long history of causing polio, and the manufacturer&#39;s inability to protect the public from dangerous microorganisms that perpetually contaminate an ever expanding repertoire of “new and improved” products, the currently available inactivated, or “killed-virus” polio vaccine continues to be manufactured in much the same way as earlier versions.</p>

<p>In the United States, today&#39;s polio vaccine is a sterile suspensions of three types of poliovirus. The viruses are grown in cultures of “a continuous line of monkey kidney cells...supplemented with newborn calf serum...” The vaccine also contains two antibiotics (neomycin and streptomycin), in addition to formaldehyde as a preservative.</p>

<p>In Canada, the inactivated polio vaccine is made in “human diploid cells” instead of monkey kidneys. Some researchers believe this is a safer alternative. <a href="http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Polio-SV40/prpolio12798.aspx">According to Barbara Loe Fisher</a>, president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Virginia, “With mounting evidence that cross-species transfer of viruses can occur, the United States should no longer be using animal tissues to produce vaccines.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Arthur Levine of the NIH, however, <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;amp;dat=19970129&amp;amp;id=vJAiAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=560FAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=1389,5403613">believes that making polio vaccines</a> using human cells isn&#39;t risk-free either, “because they must be tested for human infections.”</p>

<p>Levine also worries that even discussing these issues will frighten parents, “We do a grave disservice to the public if we were now to question the safety of the current polio vaccines on the basis of SV40.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps this attitude that prompted the CDC to recently remove the section of their website devoted to SV40 information. However, how can this be justified when hundreds of studies have now been conducted linking SV40 to cancer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Barbara Loe Fisher would like to see changes in the way vaccine safety is governed. She believes that agencies like the FDA have an inherent conflict of interest because of their mandate to promote universal vaccination on one hand and regulate vaccine safety on the other. “Who&#39;s minding the store when the FDA has allowed drug companies to produce vaccines grown on contaminated monkey kidneys?”</p>

<p>Dr. Urnovitz is even more resolute in his convictions. He thinks that an extensive study of human exposure to simian microbes is long overdue. “Half of the people in this country are baby boomers who were born between 1941 and 1961 and are at high risk for having been exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with monkey viruses. Are we just a time bomb waiting to happen, waiting to develop lupus, Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s disease?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Urnovitz sums it up nicely, “You have to realize that if you mess around with nature, you&#39;re going to pay the price...”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to examine this claim, because it’s an interesting one but not one that should be taken at face value. The above commenter made a simple correlation: The three countries that have polio epidemics, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, all happen to be the three countries with large numbers of people unvaccinated for Polio.</p>

<p>You responded by saying that no, Afghan, Pakistani, and Nigerian children don’t have Polio, they just have DDT poisoning. Well, I did some research on this, and here’s what I found:</p>

<p>Eritria, Ethiopia, India, North Korea, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2801202/table/t1-ehp-117-1656/">all still use DDT.</a> Curiously, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria are left off of that table, but I’ll ignore that for the sake of throwing you a bone. </p>

<p>So this raises the inevitable question: Where are the Polio cases in South Africa, India, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (the largest DDT users.) Why did Afghans, Pakistanis, and Nigerians mysteriously start suffering from Polio at the same time that vaccine programs were halted, yet Ethiopia has not seen a rise of Polio cases (or even any cases) to correlate with their increased DDT usage. If your hypothesis is correct, then the Polio outbreaks would be ongoing throughout sub-saharan Africa, not just Nigeria. Where are these outbreaks?</p>

<p>There’s a simple answer: You’re grasping at straws because you are desperate to promote a worldview which is out of line with reality. </p>
