    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>SM is the censorship mod. He selectively removes posts that <em>he</em> doesn&#39;t agree with. In doing so he carefully controls what we are allowed to believe, and what we are not allowed to believe.</p>

<p>He will not let you speak about Israel, Aliens, Forbidden Archeology, etc etc</p>

<p>Up until recently, him and flytape have also been very involved with silencing the &quot;anti-vaxxers&#39;. Right up until recently when more of the community got on board.</p>

<p>They only want you to believe certain things. A very careful form of control. By allowing us to believe certain things and not others, they appear to be on &quot;our side&quot;, while preventing us from knowing the whole truth.</p>

<p>SM (and flytape) are cancerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SM is cancerous. Look at his comment history. Look at all the shit he censors here.</p>

<p>He selectively enforces rules to shape the thought process of this sub, and to steer it away from certain issues. Issues like Israel, Aliens, Forbidden Archeology, Mind Control, etc etc</p>

<p>Basically, the more important the topic is, the more likely he is to censor it.</p>

<p>The circlejerk shit, he allows to stay.</p>

<p>Up until recently, he was censoring all the &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; posts. He seems to have slowed down on that now that a larger group seems to be aware of the issue. They weren&#39;t aware before because he was censoring everything.</p>

<p>He&#39;s cancer. Him and Flytape need to be gone for good.</p>

<p>SM &quot;won&quot; the vote for new mods. He was vote brigaded, like everything else is around here. That should tell you plenty. People need to ask, how did he get voted in above everyone else, and why does Flytape keep getting unshadow banned? Who has <strong>ever</strong> been unshadowbanned besides him?

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Time to go. I hate to just let the scum here win, but they have taken this place over. This site. This sub. All of it. They control everything. So it&#39;s time to move on. Maybe some day people will get tired of running away and will stand up and fight. But that can&#39;t be done here because we are forced to follow the rules (thanks SM!) while the scum know no such limitations. </p>

<p>If we want to actually get the truth out, then we would have to fight fire with fire. We would have to raid places like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. We&#39;d have to get OUR mods onto their mod teams. We&#39;d have to actively censor all the bullshit propaganda so there&#39;s space for the truth on the front page.</p>

<p>One of the best ways they have controlled us is convincing us all that &quot;the right thing to do&quot; is to follow all <em>their</em> rules. &quot;Fight the good fight&quot; and all that. Because they know that we can&#39;t win that way. So when you have people like SM here who enforce all <em>their</em> rules, whether he realizes it or not, he is fighting for <em>them</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I agree that we should do as much good as possible, but sometimes the <em>better</em> good involves educating those individuals who already have at least a minimal clue as opposed to having to fight with those individuals that are obstinately stuck in a lie or - worse yet - trying to fight with individuals that are <em>knowingly</em> lying and actually have a definite interest in continuing the manipulative status quo that exists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we also need to fight to wake up the sheeple. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of a very important  lesson that I was given many years ago when undergoing lifeguard training:  If you jump in to save someone from drowning, and when you get to them, they are literally in <em>such</em> a panic that they actually grab on to <em>you</em> and start pulling you down with them, then what you are to do is actually <em>forcefully PUSH AWAY from them</em> and get yourself free from their undue influence.  It makes no sense if they drag you down with them too and drown you as you try to go in and save them.  You can go back in for another attempt after, but don’t let anyone you’re trying to save cause more harm to you than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>In other words, make sure that YOU’RE okay first.  Don’t let anybody else drag you down and sink you in the process of your trying to come in and “save” them or help them.  As I said above, there are some people in here that AREN’T “lost”.  They’re not “lost”.  What they are are actually shills that KNOW what they’re doing and are here purposely to disrupt the dialogue and flow of information.  Those types you will <em>not</em> “save” because they’re not “lost”.  They don’t “need saving” in their eyes.  They know <em>exactly</em> what they’re doing.  It just happens to be the case that what they’re doing is perpetuating the negative status quo of this civilization.  You’re not going to save them.  They’re doing what they’re doing KNOWLEDGEABLE of their deceit.</p>

<p>Not everyone is lost in that manner, of course.  Some are genuine in their ignorance.  However, those individuals that really DON’T know and that AREN’T a shill, but that also have a lot of arrogance and hubris in what they <em>think</em> they know?  If those types fight too hard and too vehemently to protect their ignorance, then I just as well let them keep their ignorance.  I just leave them alone and let them keep living in their convenient bubble.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v3x3y/my_compiled_info_from_years_of_debating_vaccines/coecu6a">Case in point</a>.</p>

<p>Fuck’em.  I’m not here to save the world.  I’m here to save <em>myself</em>.  If others want to come along for the ride, then I will <em>more</em> than oblige them, but I’m not gonna walk around trying to “save” people - especially if they’re fucking assholes in the process.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>From the looks of the ignorance in this and other areas of this website then, it looks like they’re doing a not horrible job.  I’d rather be in a smaller group of people that are all trying to investigate and get a better picture of the world we live in than to associate with a big ass website that is pretty heavily compromised already.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Unless it’s NOT invalid.  You see what you’re doing in this statement?  You’re pining to the “group think” dynamic.  Who cares about that?  It’s not about the majority.  It’s about WHAT’S RIGHT regardless of what the group thinks one way or the other.  I’d rather belong to a marginalized group that’s RIGHT than a big majority that is wrong and pining to a world view that is actually causing more harm than not.  I know things aren’t that black and white, but the general point still applies here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. You are coming from a point of &quot;I&#39;m looking for information and the truth&quot;. I am coming from a point of &quot;I want to spread the truth to as many people as I can, in order to effect a positive change in the world&quot; </p>

<p>(Not that you aren&#39;t trying to make a positive change, but as you said, you are trying to save you. I am trying to save the world.)</p>

<p>Voat sounds perfect for you. It will be where I come to for information, and hopefully I&#39;ll be able to share what info I have with open ears and minds.</p>

<p>But as a part of my service to others, I am trying my best to free their minds, in whatever way I can.</p>

<p>I know most of them are a part of the system and will do whatever they can to defend that system, consciously or subconsciously. But, for every one I can reach, is one more for fighting on our side.</p>

<p>But there are various ways to do that - and trying to TALK to someone about what you think that truth is is not always the best way.  Sometimes the absolute best way you can influence people is by simply BEING the change you want to see in others.  Just walk the walk.  Be a good, truthful, loving, honest person, and others that are ready to see it and be influenced by it <em>will</em> be.  Sometimes if you set out to try to “educate” people, it will sometimes have the opposite effect - especially if you don’t know the full story on the subject you’re trying to educate others on.</p>

<p>And considering how complicated and voluminous things are in existence - and how little we humans generally know about it - it seems to me that there is a <em>lot</em> we do not know about…hardly enough to try to go around and “educate” anyone on.</p>

<p>Not saying <em>you</em> don’t know what you’re talking about on any one subject at all.  I’m just saying that the idea of setting out to “go out and educate others who don’t know as much as I do” seems to set itself up for some possible difficulties right off the bat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are trying to save you. I am trying to save the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how can you save the world when YOU YOURSELF are floundering?  Again, it goes back to the lifeguard analogy I made above.  I’m (again) not saying you don’t know anything at all.  I’m just saying that we’re humans - and, as such, there is a LOT more that we don’t know about what’s really going on in the world than there is that we do.  I think that setting out to try to educate others when we don’t know entirely what’s really going on ourselves is almost like putting the cart before the horse.</p>

<p>We should, perhaps, try to help one another with the little things that we know here and there - pass on any information we have, as it were - but that, I feel, is quite a bit different than setting out to “try to save the world”.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well…Godspeed and good luck on that (no backhanded well-wishing meant).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>every one I can reach, is one more for fighting on our side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel that every extra iota of knowledge and every extra level of development and wisdom that I can accrue does the same and helps the whole since, as an integral part of the whole, my evolution is everyone’s evolution.</p>
