    <div class="md"><p>I finally sat down and ordered my thoughts on this for some of my people to read and understand.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>I began to notice it right around the first of the year - a strange trend of people posting memes in social media about anti-vax people being morons. &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; I thought. As far as I was concerned that was proven and resolved a year or two ago, and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out why it was cropping up everywhere. At first it was every fifth post in my feed, then every third. When it got to every other post, I began to grow concerned.</p>

<p>See, I understand what the purpose of social media is. It&#39;s free for a reason. Trends and marketing are assembled, deep-fried, and sold to the MSM here, and on other social media outlets. CNN, once a proud bastion of journalistic integrity (it would have you believe), now has pretty newsreaders quoting Twitter 5 times an hour. Social Media is an always on focus group, aided by people liking their favorite movies, bands, and political stances.</p>

<p>So when something begins to trend out of no where, seemingly with no corresponding news item or personal interest story - it&#39;s not out of the pale to conclude that an interest group is <em>shaping</em> the opinion of the public through social media. (For more on this, look into the HB Gary scandal)</p>

<p>I noted the trend, and people rolled their eyes (He&#39;s so paranoid) and everyone mostly forgot about it. THEN, about a week later, the Disneyland Measles outbreak started. And everyone lost their fucking minds.</p>

<p>The anti-anti-vax agitprop exploded (and continues to) from every internet orifice. The pump had been properly primed, and the &quot;me too&#39;s&quot; who think they&#39;re very clever people for parroting memes and pre-formed talking points vomited on every unsuspecting passerby, goading them into joining the fight against... what exactly? Does anyone really know at this point? Because a lot of you seem confused to me.</p>

<p>Even at it&#39;s height, the anti-vax movement was roundly and soundly shunned by the public at large for being uninformed twats. The first time I even heard about the anti-vax movement, it was someone saying &quot;who are these nutbars?&quot; It effectively put McCarthy&#39;s career in a coffin, and perhaps rightly so. The public coverage died down and people went on about their business. To the point where A 2014 OHIO OUTBREAK OF MEASLES, THE LARGEST SINCE 1996 came and went largely unnoticed by social media and the public at large. The unvaccinated Amish were determined to be responsible, and everyone learned some important lessons.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing as a standard interaction now that special interests have taken a shine to promoting a divide: Someone throws up the latest anti-anti-vax meme <em>claiming to be an advocate of science</em>. Standard wording is IF YOU DON&#39;T SUPPORT VACCINES YOU SHOULD BE LYNCHED IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. Now, (and this part is crucial) anyone who deviates from the most emotional and non-scientific representation of that ideology is <em>automatically and unrepentantly</em> lumped in with anti-vax crunchy hippy nutters. Conversation over, you are a non-person, get your heathen ass up on this bundle of sticks because you&#39;re gonna burn tonight.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve found most interesting is that when I attempt to approach people about their emotional and non-scientific dogma, I find that they default to the stance that MMR&#39;s are non-negotiable.</p>

<p>I AGREE.</p>

<p>See that there? That&#39;s probably where most of you are going to stop reading. You&#39;re not interested in anything more nuanced than that. Because you are &quot;pro-science&quot; in bandwagon only. In this narrow polarized view, MMR&#39;s are the only vaccine. These people say &#39;vaccine&#39; all the time, but they mean &#39;MMR&#39;. Many, many Americans are very careless with their words. This is a &quot;positive effect&quot; of programming.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where it gets difficult for the incurious and the thick to follow: There is NOTHING scientific about attempting to force others into groupthink. The best science in the world is done while spitting in the face of standing convention.</p>

<p>Most of the scientists that you read about now in history books, lauded as changing the world and visionary, were considered wrong-headed freaks and enemies of the state while they were alive. I see a lot of people arguing that they are &quot;pro-science&quot; and anyone who disagrees with them is not. These people would make horrible scientists. What kind of results do you think you get from a trial when you start off with not even previous data, but the editorialized conclusions drawn from that data?</p>

<p>Again, some of you are reading this and beginning to assume I am leading up to saying all vaccines are bad. This is because you have been programmed by professionals, they are very good at what they do. Binary thinking isn&#39;t just a tactic, it&#39;s perhaps the best single indicator that a body is reflexively repeating someone else&#39;s opinion, and have not let the topic thoroughly marinate in their brainpan so that it can become a three dimensional concept. Hell, I had to tell one woman THREE times I was not arguing in favor of anti-vax people, and she still felt the need to make a snarky post declaring that she had slain yet another anti-vaxxer with her propaganda sword and false intellectual shield. This needs to stop, in the name of the science you claim to defend.</p>

<p>Why do you think this issue is being so decidedly polarized where previously there was very little to no polarization? Why now? I&#39;ve heard far FAR more from the anti-anti-vax crowd in the past thirty days than I have in a lifetime of anti-vax people. And it shows no sign of stopping. Reddit is glutted with it, no discussion allowed. It&#39;s all Facebook talks about when they can&#39;t find another remix of Uptown Funk to share. I don&#39;t even venture into Twitterland, because I&#39;m not that cool. But I hear it&#39;s an endemic in need of a vaccine. (Ha!) These outlets have entire firms dedicated to shaping and analyzing traffic. Believe it. And right now, the hot button is anti-anti-vax agitprop. Why?</p>

<p>Here is my point. SOMEONE is paying for this massive ad blitz. No one needed to be told anti-vax people are nut jobs before the 1st of the year, and the fact that it started shortly BEFORE the Mickey Measles outbreak should raise a LOT of red flags for anyone paying attention. I am NOT anti-vax, I DO agree that MMR&#39;s are necessary, and I have been vaccinated myself. However, blind support of ALL VACCINATIONS AND SCHEDULING has the potential to be very very dangerous. And frankly, the attendant whispers of forced immunization are terrifying, and should have people who claim to be scientific gently applying the brakes.</p>

<p>Forced immunization brings a lot of potential demons to the table that should be obvious, but civility and clear-headedness about this topic have been long abandoned. Not all vaccines are created and tested equally, and those who are scientific should be advocating a multi-spectrum approach to improving standards and regulation <em>while also</em> encouraging those who may be on the fence or concerned about vaccinating their child with ACTUAL INFORMATION <em>NOT</em> MEMES. A sure sign you are talking to an Anti-Anti-Vax zealot is that they will claim to champion science without understanding that science or demonstrating even a working knowledge other than HAIL SAGAN HERETIC SCUM. There is no desire to educate, only to hate and make ugly internet threats to those who do not fall in line.</p>

<p>Some of ya&#39;ll have become the Spanish Inquisition of the Internet, and you&#39;re too busy being high on the fumes of self-righteousness to even allow someone to have this conversation in your presence. But I will not stoop to your level; instead of condemning you, I invite discussion.</p>

<p>EDIT: Many thanks for the gold!</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve never been more confused than when I started seeing anti-vax headlines everywhere. The reddit userbase seems to believe that anti-vaxxers are taking over the world, when as far as I can tell it&#39;s a fringe movement that peaked in the late 90s and has been dwindling in numbers ever since. Current vaccination rates are higher than at any point in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point taken, but do we know for sure (beyond the media&#39;s blanket pronouncements) that these low rates are specifically tied to the anti-vaxxer movement? The articles I found suggest that researchers are still working out the reasons behind the measles outbreak. For instance, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/us/measles-cases-linked-to-disneyland-rise-and-debate-over-vaccinations-intensifies.html">here&#39;s</a> a more recent NY Times articles stating: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, the California figure can be deceiving ... California has long been viewed as particularly prone to this kind of outbreak because of its population size and the number of people arriving from overseas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s premature to blame the increase in reports of measles on the unvaccinated when we don’t have all the facts yet,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group raising concerns about inoculations. “I do know this: Fifty-seven cases of measles coming out of Disneyland in a country with a population of 317 million people is not a lot of cases. We should all take a deep breath and wait to see and get more information.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not really. And here&#39;s why. With forced vaccinations, they get a little bit of money from EVERYONE.  In an &quot;epidemic&quot; of say measles, let&#39;s say as many as 100,000 get it (fucking MSM and gov shills are flipping out over 100 people getting it, essentially a rounding error in a country of 300 million). So without the vaccine, they can sell maybe something like Tamiflu to 100,000 people. No, they make WAY more money with the universal vaccines. </p>

<p>I notice a trend of horror stories always precedes a &quot;solution&quot; in the main stream media. In my city, they started pushing a steady stream of news stories across the board about how traffic accidents were such a deadly concern (even though there were no more accidents than usual for the time). All of a sudden, it was all anybody could talk about. </p>

<p>Next thing you know, the mayor is on TV announcing a photo-enforcement program for our city. Because &quot;safety&quot; is the number one concern. And everyone applauded. &quot;It&#39;s about time somebody did something about all those crazy drivers!&quot;</p>

<p>A few months later, there&#39;s all kinds of stories in the news about little kids being lured by predators online (though, once again, there was no more activity than usual in this area). Suddenly, the government is announcing a Cyber-Security bill that removes all kinds of privacy and freedom from the internet. </p>

<p>And then one day I saw them talking about how horrible cervical cancer is. For weeks, that was all you heard about. Then one day, Boom. The story is announced that all teenage girls are getting the HPV vaccine Gardasil for free at school. &quot;Hooray! They&#39;re saving the children!&quot;</p>

<p>So now I watch the main stream media, not for news, but as a predictor about what they&#39;re going to try to force on us next. And when I see vaccines being glorified as the savoir of all humanity, it makes me very worried. When I see people talking about how the unvaccinated will be segregated and ostracized, denied education and healthcare, I begin to wonder if the next move is simply loading them onto cattle trucks and shipping them off to concentration camps to be thrown into ovens, an idea i&#39;m sure many redditors would mindlessly applaud.</p>

Perhaps they are a good idea, I don&#39;t know... but it is my opinion that it should be a decision of parents regarding the substances they add to their child&#39;s body. It is a philosophical discussion... Especially since the child has no say in the matter. So it really just comes down to your opinion on the matter. Sort of like abortion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no way of arguing this point logically as I have insufficient statistical data to do so. But as it is, my opinion remains unchanged (due to my philosophy). It is matter of opinion. That is the way in which it is like abortion. ( I&#39;m not literally comparing it to the act of aborting a baby)</p>

<p>My opinion arises from the forced medication vs rights of parents. I see forced medication as an indication of an overbearing government. This is not a nice thing to live under. Further, I am made suspicious by the fact that they would want to enforce this, but would allow cigarette smoke, pesticides, and other pollutants to continue. </p>

<p>I think education is the key. Provide solid, clear stats for vaccine safety relative to virus safety in a 1st world and controlled setting and more people will listen. But I still have my choice!</p>

But as it goes with freedom of speech and some of the other freedoms we have, those freedoms cannot come at the expense of others. Which is why this is different than abortion.

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to inform yourself, the data is very accessible and makes it apparent that vaccinations are necessary for a healthier world.  It&#39;s your choice whether you want to take the step to educate yourself and have a more informed opinion.  We&#39;re in the year 2015 and the average life expectancy in 1st world countries for both genders is ~80.  This is because of medical advancements.</p>

<p>A better parallel that your looking for is seat belt laws.  It&#39;s not really an attack on freedom to require seat belts, because that law does actually save lives.</p>

<p>As for your point on people wanting to enforce vaccinations but allow cigarette smoke...you aren&#39;t really making any sense.  People want to enforce vaccinations, reduce pollutants, and reduce smoking in public places.  Cigarettes are product produced by private companies and have existed for awhile.  In fact, in most public places now, you cannot smoke.  Pesticides and other pollutants produced from factories have dramatically decreased because of environmental protection and regulation.  The world has only gotten better in these areas.</p>

<p>OP is pointing out a lot of the brainless pro-vax sentiment not because he&#39;s necessarily so skeptical of vaccines but because, well, it&#39;s brainless.  Fine, point taken--brainless sentiment parroted by lots of people is worthy of skepticism.  But at least it&#39;s on the side of medical evidence.  When I see anti-vax people mindlessly reporting anecdotal information about vaccines and problems that might result from them without even referencing a high-school understanding of biology/immunology...well, I feel like that&#39;s even more brainless and worthy of skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While mutation is possible (as <a href="/u/virgule">/u/virgule</a> said), the main concern is that vaccines are not a guaranteed success. Different vaccines have different success rates, but they&#39;re almost always upwards of 90%. So if you have been vaccinated there&#39;s still a small chance that you&#39;re still vulnerable to the disease. Furthermore, some people can&#39;t be vaccinated due to a medical condition, like a compromised immune system or a bird allergy. </p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">herd immunity</a> comes into play. Herd immunity is when enough of a population is immune to a disease that even non-immune individuals have an extremely low chance of contracting the disease. </p>

<p>Everything is fine until people start not vaccinating all together for no valid medical reason. Then there&#39;s no longer enough vaccinated people for herd immunity and non-immune individuals are once more at risk.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had long conversations with people on a tuesday about the logic behind my stance (basically what I posted above), and we come to an agreement. Then on wednesday, they&#39;re right back to talking to me like I&#39;m an anti-vaxxer. </p>

<p>It&#39;s mass madness. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s the point, I think. Because I&#39;ve watched it happen with other topics already - The USG has already decided it&#39;s going to do mandatory vaccinations. Right now, there&#39;s an effort on to polarize people so much that they can&#39;t even talk about it because it causes disharmonious living conditions for both sides if they do. Then, once we&#39;ve moved two or three media crisis events down the road, they will quietly announce a mandatory vaccination pogrom to the public. The segment that (legitimately) gets vocal and argues against it will be swatted down (Oh God, here comes ocket again with his <strong>anti-vaxxer</strong> bullshit... <em>cue laugh track</em>) by the public without any need for intervention from USG enforcers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite brilliant from the efficiency standpoint, but it&#39;s being used to potentially trick us into receiving something other than just proven and effective vaccines. And that&#39;s what I worry about the most. </p>

<p>When THEY that have all the power and no rules are running the &quot;show&quot; and do what ever they want while the rest just talk, talk, talk... and wait for things to get better, to be saved, stay idle or even WORSE join the &quot;show&quot;. How do you think things will turn out for the most if this continues ?! Not good ! Also some would say &quot;Hope for the best and expect the worst&quot; well i say &quot;Do the best and prevent the worst&quot;.</p>

<p>I understand that not all on The Net (Planet) are not like that but unfortunately MOST are but those numbers are getting smaller and smaller which is good yet time waits for no one and THEY know it, so THEY use fear, lies or any other tactic to get results... fast !</p>

<p>... and i&#39;m not talking ONLY about vaccines or usa, actually all of this about vaccines could be just another distraction.</p>

<p>&quot;The time for talk is at its end and there might not be enough time to act so react now before its too late or face of your misguided future&quot;</p>

<p>-I think i read that quote on YouTube comments few years ago not sure if 100% might be missing few words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, and exactly what I&#39;ve been saying as well about forced memes. But I&#39;ll give you something to chew on. The reason this is really being ratched up so quickly is because a lot of truth is on the cusp of finally being exposed. Obama granting whistle-blower status to Dr. Thompson the other day is going to expose a whole lot of lies and manipulated data about MMR and autism, and it&#39;s going to get ugly.</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccineimpact.com/2015/obama-grants-immunity-to-cdc-whistleblower-on-measles-vaccine-link-to-autism/">http://vaccineimpact.com/2015/obama-grants-immunity-to-cdc-whistleblower-on-measles-vaccine-link-to-autism/</a></p>

<p>Just spend 10 minutes and watch the video in the page. </p>

<p>When we can finally get some good information in front us, we&#39;ll be able to make informed good decisions. Right now, we&#39;re being lied to, and it is a conspiracy. There are people conspiring to mislead you for profits, and it&#39;s not really all that whacky. It happens all of the time. </p>

<p>We won&#39;t get to truth until we think beyond A + B = C. If you think vaccines work 90% of the time, umm... good, must take. And you&#39;re aren&#39;t thinking about the other health consequences, even the fact that some diseases we need constant exposure to like chicken pox, or it comes back stronger and earlier as shingles, then we&#39;ll just continue to pop the pills, and inject ourselves, because well.. everyone&#39;s doing it right? </p>

<p>The truth is that ALL of these major diseases were near eradication or on massive decline well before vaccines were introduced. The reason people feared these diseases so much was because DEATH and other major adverse side effects were HIGHLY probable 100 YEARS AGO. In a time when disease could spread like wildfire because of a lack of clean water, access to good medicine, vitamins and shelters, it was high problematic. However now, most of these diseases are non-life threatening and the adverse reaction to vaccination versus natural contraction in a lot of cases is MUCH higher. In some cases, over 100x more likely. So why don&#39;t we have a discussion about that? We don&#39;t because none of this information is presented through the media, the primary way people get their information, even though most of it is right on the CDC website itself. </p>

<p>Swine flue, avian flu, ebola... be afraid! It&#39;s a scary world. But what happenes when the people claiming to protect you are actually the ones knowingly injuring you? What then? </p>

<p>The entire anti-vax movement is either based off of a falsified research paper by a British doctor that linked autism to vaccinations, or from religious parents who feel that vaccinations are too &quot;invasive&quot; or some other irrational reason.</p>

<p>If anyone does even an ounce of research, it&#39;s incredibly obvious that vaccinations have saved the lives of millions, that unvaccinated children have a significantly higher death rate to disease, and that vaccinations help to eliminate diseases entirely.  People post memes ridiculing anti-vaxxers because anti-vaxxers base their entire argument on complete irrationality.  And so, they are ridiculed.  No one is paying for an &quot;ad blitz&quot;.

<p>No. It is much, much more than that. Pro-vaxxers always dumb things down to &quot;vaccines have not been linked to autism&quot;,  do some research on the matter, and you will realise the issue has many, many more implications than just the &#39;autism&#39;.  Altough, in my view, 1 in 68 child detected with autism sure is scare. This is the real epidemic people should be concerned with and the medias should be talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how it all starts, man. It&#39;s like watching a terrible horror movie unravel that inevitably leads to total disaster. Mocking is the first step, dehumanizing and penalties, fines, jail next. Then we&#39;re looking at segregating and slaughtering many for questioning the vaccination industry in any capacity. I&#39;ve seen it said many times already and when people are afraid enough, they&#39;d allow horrific things to happen if it gave them the idea that they&#39;re now safe.</p>

You can&#39;t even say, &quot;maybe let&#39;s space them out further apart to lessen the burden on the child&#39;s immune system&quot; or they freak out at you...not for any scientific reason...(though some will throw in some random web links) just because they MUST FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE!!  WTF?  I am not concerned that vaccines cause autism. I am concerned about overloading a little kid&#39;s immune system with the world&#39;s worst pathogens all at once.  Although this may be fine for most kids - we don&#39;t know if a small % can develop problems...and we&#39;re not all the same (certainly, we don&#39;t all react the same way to the flu shot even).</p>

<p>Also, I questioned people why Hep B is SO necessary for babies - when it&#39;s really just an STD based on how it&#39;s transmitted.  And, the vaccine wears off after 10-15 years, anyway - by the time the child WILL be sexually active, potentially (mine did &amp; I had to get it again). ... but did I get an intelligent response?  No.  Just hysterics &amp; propaganda craziness.  </p>

<p>I agree with everything you have said before this. What I do not necessarily agree with is that everybody who uses those tactics are what you described in the quoted text.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s easy to think that is the case but I think that anybody can have trouble accepting an opinion that threatens one&#39;s belief structure. It&#39;s human nature. In fact humans are even likely to double down on their beliefs when faced with information that threatens their beliefs. It&#39;s silly but part of our psychology.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not just the person that got their asses beat in real life...it could just as well be the person who beat their ass.</p>

Click on that, and you can tag each individual user with whatever you would like to tag them as. I&#39;ve been tagging people in here that I respect the opinion of so I can spot them outside of this sub, but you could also go to conspiritard and tag the shills. I haven&#39;t actually bothered to do this yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be honest, i dont believe the vaccines cause autism debacle. partly becuse the percentages are so low. however i would definitly be intrested in a study done on various forms of vaccine storage, and sterilization techniques. has it occurred to anyone that maybe the 7% of kids that suffer lifestyle altering illnesses had something other then getting vaccines in common? correlation does not imply causation 100% of the time, maybe there is something relating to the metal in the needle, some change in storage practices, or the iodine sometimes used to sterilize injection sites.</p>

<p>arguing that 7% chance of lifestyle altering illnesses with low risk of mortality  is some how worse then 20% risk of infection with something that can kill you is what boggles my mind.</p>

<p>there needs to be a study done on more then just the vaccines so we can get to the root of the increase in autism recently. i mean during vaccination you are exposed to</p>

<p>the vaccine - mostly proven NOT to be the source</p>

<p>the metal in the needle</p>

<p>immune system stress due to close time frame of vaccine administrations</p>

<p>the plastic in the syringe</p>

<p>whatever they used to sterilize your injection site.</p>

<p>heck maybe theres a brand name of syringe that got used in ALL the documented autism cases. </p>

<p>its always possible something got overlooked and it is a scientists job to leave no stone unturned and examine every possibility. science is meshing with politics nowadays and i think thats giving us some issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is it&#39;s the cumulative effect of aluminum being ingested and deposited in the brain, not only through vaccines but various other external sources as well. Which could be why isolated studies determine no direct cause from vaccines if it&#39;s just the tipping point.</p>

<p>It just so happens that certain vaccines have an incredibly high concentration of aluminum salts injected directly, bypassing the bodies&#39; natural filters. It&#39;s a common adjuvant. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, you&#39;ll find loads of aluminum salts in antacids (300-600mg!) and soy based baby formulas. Great for expectant mothers with heartburn. After following a standard vaccination schedule (some 20 or so over two years) a child is exposed to quite a bit aluminum in their first few years of life.</p>

<p>Autism is often determined when a child is around 3 years old. I haven&#39;t culled through all the vaccination ingredients to determine how much Aluminum is used, but it&#39;s not nothing.</p>

<p>Aluminum is agreed upon as being neuro-toxic, but really hasn&#39;t been adequately studied, excluding its role in possibly causing Alzheimer&#39;s. Since there are studies going both ways, I&#39;d take the middle ground and say it&#39;s still inconclusive.</p>

<p>For some light reading, here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp22-c1.pdf">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry&#39;s Statement on Aluminum</a> I used as a quick reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link says I eat 8mg of aluminium a day, and that any that makes it into my blood is quickly filtered out of my body.  It also says an antacid contains ~150mg of aluminium and a vaccine contains less than 1mg.  </p>

<p>Even assuming it can somehow &quot;bypass the body&#39;s filters&quot; by being injected(this medically and scientifically has no basis, but we&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so that&#39;s to be expected) and assuming &quot;the body&#39;s filters&quot; can get 99.9% of the aluminium ingested by other means(despite the fact that aluminium absorbed through the skin literally &quot;bypasses the body&#39;s filters&quot; by the same definition as an injection), I&#39;m still getting more aluminium in my brain from antacids than anyone ever will from a vaccine.  </p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve probably stopped reading by now, because I&#39;m obviously a sheeple, but in case you ARE still reading, I have a simple question of logic for you-  We have been making aluminium for over 160 years.  If I believed it contributed to autism/asd/asperger/whatever I would just pull up the medical records for any of the MANY major aluminium manufacturing facilities employees and have a quick look, since anyone working in one of these plants is virtually guaranteed to have MUCH higher amounts of aluminium absorbed daily then there should be easy to spot trends of vastly increased autism cases for kids born to mothers that work in aluminium plants.  </p>

<p>The fact that this easy to check/nearly impossible to hide metric exists and hasn&#39;t been used to support the argument that aluminium causes a specific disorder or group of disorders shows there is little truth to this idea, if any.  </p>

<p>Then again, maybe the hundreds of world governments over the past 150 years has colluded on this one single thing to collectively hide the truth from the people of the world..  Yeah that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... it&#39;s just a guess, no need to go volatile. Sorry I&#39;m slacking on the response time, I&#39;m not much of a keyboard commando these days.</p>

<p>To some degree, dermal absorption of particles could end up in your lymph system, or directly to the blood vessels depending on the pathway. A study I found back from the aluminum antiperspirant wars found that out of 84mg of Aluminium chlorohydrate applied to the skin, about 0.012% aluminum entered the blood stream. (~10mcg if I did the math right.) Your skin acts as the filter in this scenario.</p>

<p>Medical records would be great, but they typically fall under doc-patient confidentiality. I wonder the statistic of women working in the aluminum industry with direct exposure to aluminum, and in relation to those, working while pregnant. </p>

<p>I also read up that autism may possibly be caused as a result of encephalitis, an unfortunate side effect that can occur after administering vaccines. Could be a legit source, too.</p>

<p>I truly believe (not guess this time) that intense scrutiny and more testing needs to be done on vaccines. It would make sense, at the very least, for titer tests (test to check antibodies vs virus/pathogen) to be offered prior to any vaccine treatment to determine if the person even needs it. Wouldn&#39;t personalized immunization plans be far more effective (and less risky) than the current carpet-bomb approach?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not anti-vax, I&#39;d much rather prefer vaccines that don&#39;t have a host of auto-immune diseases as their side-effects and unnecessary toxic chemicals. Also, ones not made from pharma companies currently under lawsuit for reporting fraudulent effectiveness rates. (Looking at you, Merck)</p>

<p>Calculation for the 7.5% and the 20% was done by getting an average of the mortality rates. Etc. I don&#39;t think I know how to properly phrase that. And I might have used the wrong calculation. The other percentages posted were simply copied from the source of the information. Regardless 2 out of 100 kids getting autism is still better then most of the fatality rates I see.</p>

<p>If you can improve my maths here or show me how a 2% chance of developing autism is somehow worse then developing liver cancer that will kill you in 5 years 90% of the time if you contract hepatitis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a matter of calculating risk and it seems MORE risky to avoid all vaccines, even taking the information provided by antivaxers as fact into account.</p>

<p>Could you provide a study or a document that is more specific about vaccine related injuries? </p>

<p>There is definitely a need to do more research into vaccines due to the  correlation between increased vaccine use and autism rates. However correlation does not always mean causation.

<p>Sure, you are missing a variable:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &#39;all&#39; but I am not close minded.</p>

<p>The hpv vaccine has been connected to injuries and obviously there is a correlation between Vaccines and autism rates. Now someone smarter then me has to figure out the why. Hell maybe it&#39;s not the vaccines at all, but the iodine some places use to sterilize Injection sites. Or maybe it&#39;s a specific type of vaccination, or maybe just that we have them so close together in a childs development.</p>

<p>I think some vaccines should be required, but others are unnecessary, influenza is one example as long as I&#39;m fit and healthy. But saying that the risk of vaccinations causing developmental disabilities is somehow worse then potential fatalities is dishonest to the facts if you don&#39;t also say which vaccines one should avoid. Because that way I can calculate risk on a per vaccine basis instead of having to go all or nothing, more studies need to be done, period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be a requirement to vaccinate against things such as polio, tetanus, hepatitis, and other highly contagious, lethal or debilitating illnesses.</p>

<p>Things such as the flu (at least in healthy individuals), Rotavirus and other non life threatening non debilitating illnesses should be at parent discretion, as they generally are rarely lethal if treated properly.  </p>

<p>After all we are talking about things that contain mercury and aluminum salts, And while one shot might not do it, it could be the volume of the shots in a certain timeframe plus environmental factors that lead to autism. So therefore if we could avoid unnecessary shots, we could conceivably compare patients who got all the shots vs patients who got maybe 70% of the shots offered vs patients who only got the minimum requirements all at the same period of time. And then we would have a more educated way of knowing if in fact vaccines are involved in causing autism. if that was the case then you would expect to find more autism cases percentage wize in the population that got all the shots then you would find in the population that got the bare minimum requirements during the same time frame. If that is done and we don&#39;t see that split, it would be safe to say that vaccinations are not involved. If we do, then we have to look deeper to figure out what precisely is doing it, how it is doing it, and how we can both have the vaccine AND avoid the risk of developmental disabilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But these things are not highly contagious, highly lethal, or likely debilitating.  They are contagious, potentially lethal, and potentially debilitating, but not to the degree you may think.</p>

<p>Polio is usually spread by infected fecal matter entering the mouth.  It is not airborne or readily transferred by blood (that doesn&#39;t enter the mouth).  Increased sanitation has reduced the risk tremendously.</p>

<p>Second, it&#39;s not very lethal or debilitating.  Fewer than .02% (2% of 1%) develop paralytic polio, which is generally temporary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html</a></p>

<p>Tetanus is just plain non-contagious.  No argument for herd immunity to be made here and since the onset is visible (open wound) and preventable (no dirty knives for baby) as well as treatable and fully recoverable &quot;lethal and debilitating&quot;, while still possible, is not a likely scenario.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf</a></p>

<p>Onto hepatitis.  As a fun fact, the first recorded instance was thought to be related to a smallpox vaccine in Germany don&#39;t take my word for it :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/hepb.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/hepb.pdf</a></p>

<p>Hepatitis is only contagious through semen and saliva-into-blood action, hardly the sort of thing your child needs to worry about for their first 15 years (after which the vaccine has worn off).  Children also tend to be asymptomatic as opposed to adults who contract the illness (similar to how chicken pox is worse as an adult).  Infants are most likely to contract chronic hepatitis in the womb, which is currently unpreventable. </p>

<p>According to the CDC, the vaccine has been unsuccessful because those who are actually at risk are avoiding the vaccine (those with multiple partners, homosexual men, IV drug users: your typical 14 year old stuff, right?)</p>

<p>This vaccine is recommended before the child first leaves the hospital and carries the same exact dosage for a newborn as an 11 year old child.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So why should these vaccines be required?</p>

<p>And how do you feel about your previous maths being more aware of missing variables like rate of infection, contagion, progression, and lethality?  You basically had a starting point where everyone was infected and some where everyone had an advanced case.</p>

<p>obviously there is a correlation between Vaccines and autism rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the part you&#39;re gonna need a source on, because this is the part conspiracy folks keep repeating but have not managed to back up short of one flawed retracted study.  </p>

<p>Now, if I were a scientist and believed that something in vaccines caused autism or increased it&#39;s frequency I would start with a logical search- I&#39;d get a list of the ingredients in vaccines, then one by one I would look up these ingredients manufacturing methods.  Why?  Because every single ingredient has at one point or another been made in a way that humans are exposed to it in larger doses than the general public.  What does this mean?  This means that if any of it DOES cause autism, then whichever ingredient does would leave behind a clear trail of evidence in the medical records of the employees at the facilities making the substances.  Think about it, if the aluminium salts caused autism then just go back to the time around the world wars and look at the medical records of the women who primarily staffed manufacturing plants, you would see a clearly increased level of autism in their kids.  Do we?  Obviously not or anti-vaxxers wouldn&#39;t still be relying on the retracted Wakefield study.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Untrue... I used to be on both sides of this issue at one time or the other. I think the main problem is both sides are wrong to some degree. Vaccines can&#39;t cause autism. Autism is a psychological disorder and one that has DNA roots. So the argument stops there with scientist and medical doctors when you say vaccines cause autism. It can&#39;t. But what it can do is cause autism like problems. And I think if we changed our perspective to one of a medical epidemic happening with our kids, and we put together some of the good research that has been done on this, we&#39;ll be close to a solution. The problem is there&#39;s been so much fraud and deception occurring, it&#39;s hard to sort through and find good information. Just read and watch this 10 minute video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue (im fairly anti-vaccine) with anti-vaxxers is some of them just give the rest of us a bad name..  Think about the autism thing logically.  That is a disorder that affects the human biological system...which is INSANELY complex.  No ONE thing can be the sole cause of autism.  There are dozens of factors. Genetics...what nutrition the mother had during pregnancy...what nutrition baby had at and after birth...yes, then vaccines play a role, i believe.  It has substances in it that have no place in a human body. Sure, small amounts. Aluminum, formaldehyde etc.  most of the ones with mercury have been phased out.  But a baby gets up to 7 or so on the FIRST DAY of its life, and many boosters after 6 months etc. these are the prime years of brain development.
Then you factor in tons of other shit. Pollution, air quality, toxins the kid might be exposed to in his environment... There are so many goddamn factors that all coalesce into a disorder...you canNOT fucking pin it on one thing. Be reasonable. Human biological systems are way too complicated and complex to start popping disorders from something that is arguably bad for you but insignificant. Bodies are pretty resilient and evolution has designed us to withstand a shitload of situations.  I have my theory and it needs an organic chemist to verify, probably other experts that will never work on it as well. I gave up trying to talk to people about it.</p>

<p>That all being said, i still dont like vaccines, but i dont care if others want them. It should be treated like any other medical procedure. You get it if you want it, you dont if you dont.  Informed consent.  I feel the same way about fluoridated water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a definitive answer to that, according to wikipedia it&#39;s a &quot;delusional belief that (you) are infested with disease-causing agents described as things like insects, parasites, hairs or fibers, while in reality no such things are present&quot;.  This is blatantly false, <em>at least some</em> sufferers are not delusional at all.  You can see the condition with your own two eyes.</p>

<p>Check out a few of the images of it in a google search, like <a href="http://airlats.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Deb-K-Morgellons-021-1024x768.jpg">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.morgellons-research.org/morgellons/pics/morgellons-skin7.jpg">this one.</a>  There are also quite a few compilation videos/interviews/documentaries about it on youtube if you&#39;re interested in looking into a bit further.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf7QqOm7eG4">Here&#39;s one of the ones I&#39;ve personally watched.</a></p>

<p>The speculation is that it&#39;s somehow related to chemtrails and/or nanotechnology.  Either way, it&#39;s really sketchy and anyone who suggests that there may be more to it than meets the eye, and that maybe the people claiming to suffer from it aren&#39;t totally full of shit and crazy, is immediately denigrated as a lunatic conspiracy theorist and idiot - a telltale sign that they&#39;re probably onto something.</p>

<p>What &quot;dogma&quot; are you referring to? Common ancestry? That&#39;s pretty much undeniable at this point. Natural selection as the most significant cause of evolution? That is at least closer to dogma than common ancestry. Many reputable evoutionary biologists (See the book <em>Evolution, the Extended Synthesis</em>) have argued for a less central role for natural selection due to things like epigenetics, developmental plasticity, genetic assimilation, etc. But really, common ancestry is as close to certain as anything can be in science.</p>

<p>The simple fact is if you are anti vax you are fucked. You basically HAVE to do it. Look at the anger it already generates. They have well and truly won this war. Every year they get better at manipulating the masses and we sit here at our computers, me included. </p>

<p>We are fucked because we did nothing, and neither did previous generations, maybe its testament to the fact we truly are sheep. </p>

I&#39;m not making this decision because I&#39;m afraid of the reaction, it&#39;s just the best decision I can make with the information available. I would be very comfortable not getting vaccinated if I thought it was actually the best decision. Millions of pro-vaxxers don&#39;t sway me in the least. They can go fuck themselves if they disagree with any choice I make for my children. </p>

<p>I may be pro-vaxx but I&#39;m willing to look at all of the information, even if it challenges common beliefs - which is something most people aren&#39;t interested in. I come here specifically so I can get both sides of one-sided issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to feel like you guys are just counterculture sheep instead of the critical thinkers that I thought you were.</p>

<p>Same for us anti vax people. This is why we come here. For the discussion, well some of us, but every comment is either totally dismissive of the others views or trying to belittle. Even you have just talked about the fact you are pro vax, and stating no evidence just tried to belittle people. Prime example. Where is the discussion?

<p>That&#39;s the best we can do, probably, most of us.

    <div class="md"><p>I would kindly recommend a thorough reading of the CDC&#39;s Pinkbook to help you decide how and when to vaccinate your child.</p>

<p>Several scheduled vaccines are unnecessary and a couple are downright silly.  Informed decision making is your best friend here, don&#39;t just let a stranger make a decision that affects your child&#39;s entire life.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html</a></p>

<p>Learn. Do it for your child.</p>

<p>Edit:  Since you mentioned it further down, I&#39;d recommend polio as a good starting point for your reading.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Fewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid paralysis. Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days after prodromal symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal.</p>

<p>The death-to-case ratio for paralytic polio [<em>which are one percent of all polio cases</em>] is generally 2%–5% among children </p>

<p>The duration of immunity with IPV is not known with certainty, although it probably provides protection for many years after a complete series.</p>

<p>From 1980 through 1998, 152 cases of paralytic polio were reported in the United States; 144 (95%) of these cases were VAPP [Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis
], and the remaining eight were in persons who acquired documented or presumed wild-virus polio outside the United States.</p>

Before being treated he had to keep everything that touched his mouth or could have blood on it in a container and heavily sanitized (razors, forks, knives, toothbrushes, floss). </p>

<p>Thing is, he wasn&#39;t diagnosed for many many years. Me and my sister, whom has downs and is immune deficient, could have contracted it at any point during this period. Luckily, me and her had both been vaccinated for it very early in our lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It boggles their minds that people cannot see the incredibly simple steps that could be taken to prove that something in a vaccine causes autism if such a link existed.  </p>

<p>Example?  Lets say you think thiomersal&#39;s ethylmercury causes autism.  Ok well a quick check tells us it was used as a preservative in tattoo inks for a period, all we&#39;ve got to do is a single study looking at the birth records of kids born to parents that got tattoos during a certain time frame, if there&#39;s any science to it at all we will see clearly elevated levels of autism in these kids.  </p>

<p>Think it&#39;s the aluminium salts?  Well then lets pull up medical records from women employed at the plants producing it during the world wars, they will definitely have elevated levels of it in their system and there should be a clear indication of increased autism in kids born to those women.  </p>

<p>See how easy it would be to find some better evidence than a retracted study by Wakefield?  </p>

<p>In short, what is the point of a motive or even looking for one if nobody can even show us evidence that a problem exists?  I can spend 3 minutes thinking about it and already I&#39;ve come up with ways to show a possible link if there is one, why haven&#39;t anti-vaxxers managed this feat in the past 30 years?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>correlation doesn&#39;t imply causation, but i do think a study should be done on these vaccines to see if the rate of autism is effected by how close a timeframe the vaccines are administered. im also interested in a study done on the containers and storage methods of said vaccines. maybe the scientific community is over looking an effect possibly caused by certain storage methods or the type of needle/plastic used in the syringes. heck maybe the iodine often used to sterilize the injection site has something to do with this. has anyone looked into THAT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that Hepatitis B is more likely to be transmitted through sexually intercourse. While that is a major means of transmission, it is not the only one. Hep B can be spread from infected mothers to their infant at birth. The Hep B Vax given within 12 hours of birth helps to prevent it being spread to the infant.</p>

<p>Of course the mother should and is usually tested for Hep B during her pregnancy as many people can have Hep B and not know it.</p>

<p>Also, the immunologic memory of the today&#39;s Hep B Vax remains intact for at least 20 years. This information is based on studies of children who have received the Hep B Vax from 6 months and up. More long-term studies still need to be completed before the gains from vaccination at birth will be known.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for questioning why the government says we should be putting certain chemicals in our bodies. Though you might want to think what would be more beneficial for the government, sick citizens dying off or healthy citizens working and paying taxes?</p>

<p>Science is about admitting what you don&#39;t know and the OP is absolutely correct in that its a &quot;with us or against us&quot; mentality.  I find that to be keenly distressing.</p>

<p>Humans have made it this far promoting science as a tool with openess, transparency and not forcing itself on anyone as if it were dogma.  This epic push to herd opinions online is striking because I don&#39;t know anyone in reality that doesn&#39;t do major vaccinations anyways.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me make a correction. Hep B is a blood-borne disease that infects through blood and bodily fluids. It is NOT &quot;just&quot; an STD. In fact, Perinatal infection (infection at birth from the mother) is a very common way to get it. Additionally, the people who get infected before the age of 5 have a significant chance to develop the chronic version of the illness which has a mortality rate of 15% to 25%.</p>

<p>People think of it as &quot;just an STD&quot; because of widespread use of the vaccine. You said it yourself, the vaccine wears off after 15 years, and that&#39;s when people start becoming sexually active. It&#39;s only because of the effectiveness of the vaccine that the disease is rare. </p>

<p>You think of it as an STD because that&#39;s the most common way to get it in a population that has been immunized through vaccination. I suggest you do a little research on the disease itself and the vaccine for it before you go sprouting nonsense in the future. Below are a few links that might help educate you:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean <em>spouting</em> nonsense...not &quot;sprouting&quot; nonsense.  (And thanks).</p>

<p>And, your links do not support many of your comments at all (just like the vaccine squad - how meta..).  </p>

<p>And, I said &quot;really just&quot; and STD - but not &quot;PURELY AN STD&quot;.  Combined with your &quot;sprouting (sic) nonsense&quot; comment, I can only assume your reading comprehension isn&#39;t that great.    &quot;Really just&quot; = &quot;is typically&quot; or &quot;acts like&quot; or &quot;has similarities to&quot;.  &quot;Really just&quot; does NOT = &quot;just&quot;, which is how you quoted me.  Though, perhaps some of the fault is mine - and I apologize for my slightly imprecise language on reddit confused you. </p>

<p>Anyway, Hep B is transmitted through the same vectors that HIV is transmitted through.  We don&#39;t have an HIV vaccine.  How many babies get HIV randomly?  The only exception is contaminated food... in HEP A - and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t say Hep A, deliberately (because I am edumacated on these diseases, believe it or not!). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s only because of the effectiveness of the vaccine that the disease is rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No - that is not why.  It&#39;s rare because it&#39;s hard to transmit. Before 1982 (the vaccine introduction date) - there were no mass hepatitis epidemics in children - unlike smallpox, polio, measles, etc... because it&#39;s not airborne &amp; doesn&#39;t linger in the atmosphere for 2 hours like measles virus in cough droplets.  I did not get the shot at birth (nor did anyone born when I was, in the 80s).  I got it in 1995...and again in 2010.  In the 80s and 90s, they didn&#39;t enforce giving it at birth, but Merck &amp; friends successfully convinced the AAP to do so.  From the WHO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is extremely rare to have &quot;contaminated&quot; medical / blood products in the USA.  So, that option is out.  So, we&#39;re left with the mother, as you said.  So, why not just give the mother a hepatitis test rather than vaccinating EVERY baby?  Less money for Merck, but more common sense.  And, don&#39;t use the baby rape argument please, because if you do the math on how many babies are raped &amp; the ones that are raped by Hep B+ people, that will be extraordinarily low...not justifying 100% population vaccination for something that happens 0.0001% of the time.  And in the rare rare rare case that a child gets Hep B, we have far more treatments now (antivirals and interferon) than 1982 (and funny that it&#39;s pushed so more now than 1982).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, the disease is rare, but it&#39;s still a lot more common than the 0.0001% you mentioned. It&#39;s actually closer to 1% of the population. </p>

<p>The vaccine is a cheap, reliable way to prevent the disease, that has next to no lasting side effects. In addition, it will protect the child from the rare chance that they will be infected by the disease when they grow up (unlikely, but increasingly likely given the increased globalization of the world, since the disease is very common in less developed parts of the world). </p>

<p>Also, treatments for Hep B consists of mostly supportive therapy. Antivirals are approved for it, but the effectiveness of them are still nowhere near the effectiveness of the vaccines.</p>

<p>Besides, in regards to your previous posts, there are no studies that have shown that spacing vaccines out have any benefits compared to taking them all at the recommended time. In fact, you only increase the risk of infection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some vaccines. Some. Whatever man lol.</p>

<p>Edit : been a part of this community for years now under various monikers, one of which is approved for nolibswatch, I find it amusing you think I am a troll.</p>

<p>Double edit : actually whether or not environmental factors are playing a role in the rise of autism is pretty critical to determining any links with vaccines, because if they are a source it may be either masking or being conflated with autism from vaccinations.  Shit, it could be a combination of all of those factors, and vaccines only cause it in those who have been compromised from anti biotic and other things before the immune response or other from the shot tips the balance.  If you want to encourage critical thinking than be critical in your own thinking.  IMO with this issue we ate likely at worst dealing with a soft conspiracy of well meaning group think combined with incomplete data. If the link was as strong as some people act like it must be it would be easy to suss it out with a study or statistically, the link must be weaker than that or rely on other additional factors.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being pro Vax,  I&#39;m being pro logic.  Just like this sub doesn&#39;t really get into lizard people usually, I choose to not get into &#39;&#39;vaccines are here to reduce the population&#39;&#39; because I just don&#39;t see how such a conspiracy could reasonably reach fruition without someone noticing.</p>

<p>They&#39;re spreading all types of disease under the guise of vaccinations.</p>

<p>Who is to say if these kids are even getting &quot;vaccines&quot; it could be something else entirely. The whole point is, we are being forced to allow the government to stick a needle in our arm every month, and no one has any real clue what is going on. What IS very clear, is that diseases like cancer, autism and ADHD are skyrocketing. There have also been whistleblowers exposing the CDC&#39;s attempts to <strong>cover-up</strong> these links.</p>

<p>People need to quit with this &quot;Science says this, and the other science was disproven&quot;. That is not addressing the actual issue. If there is nothing to cover up, why is there a cover-up?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t &quot;literally&quot; say that at all - or you could scroll up and it would literally say that.  Where do I say &quot;why should it exist now&quot;? </p>

<p>Following from my original post - above, I&#39;ve been talking about doing more research to understand the (potential) danger of injecting 25 pathogens into an infant because it has not been done before &amp; there were inherent dangers from the very first vaccine ever created. </p>

<p>I did not say that we shouldn&#39;t vaccinate because it hasn&#39;t been done before (and we should go back to caves...which, like I said, is a false equivalence).  </p>

<p>If you want to make an actual analogy, you can say &quot;then why don&#39;t we do a study on every modern innovation then, from the effects of watching TV to GMO foods&quot; - and that would be an analogy that would actually make sense.  </p>

<p>The reason I said this is that there is a lot about the immune system we don&#39;t know (specifically, autoimmune diseases still have unknown causes).  There&#39;s a lot less research needed to determine the safety of  &quot;moving around by methods not of our own creation&quot;.  </p>

Whenever I hear that word I am just full of goodwill and cheer and naturally assume that we should continue the course regardless of the <strong>implications.</strong></p>

<p>In all seriousness, you implied heavily that we should not be vaccinating because of untold <strong>implications</strong> - well here are some implications for you. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox</a></p>

<p>Go look at those pictures. Then look back to Vaccines. Then look to those pictures. Of children. Children dying at up to a 50% mortality rate. Then look back to Vaccines. <strong>Implications</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you know how many billions of dollars are spent researching, producing and manufacturing vaccines each year? Each decade? Do you think if they were worse than the alternative, we would be using them? Even if - and this is not true - but even if Vaccinations caused Autism in 1 in a million children that would be <strong>completely acceptable</strong> because the alternative is that child, and a load more, would be dead from diseases that we could prevent. </p>

<p>We do need to continue doing more research, but we understand that vaccinations are not hurting people - we use literally millions of doses of them each year and 99%+ of us are completely unaffected by them. What possible more research would we need to prove on them? What hidden side effect do you foresee that a generation of use hasn&#39;t uncovered? </p>

<p>This has always been my line of reasoning as well.  By forcing or threatening to force, you play right into what these people fear and they become defensive. It&#39;s not a good place for the debate to be.  I would argue that it&#39;s going to drive suspicious people further away from vaccines and make the anti-vax people more likely to dig their heels in, thus hurting vaccination rates.</p>

<p>Redditors and people like them will have no one to thank but themselves.  Vaccination rates were still extremely high before all of this bullshit propaganda, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the people who are negative on vaccines use this as an opportunity to gather more followers and thus lower vaccine uptake.  </p>

Nice attempt to somehow discredit me by associating me with Fox news and acting like me being aware of Fox&#39;s position is somehow relevant or that Fox&#39;s position lends any evidence to either side. You just keep on coming with ad hominems and distractions. The fact you think it is at all relevant shows you don&#39;t have a grasp on the actual issue at all and you fail to come up with any criticism of any vaccines based on what chemicals they contain.

Well since you know vaccines have a total volume of about .5ml. When eating fish the recommended limit is up to about 1 mg per kilogram.

    <div class="md"><p>No.  It would have been chicken pox, which isn&#39;t even that severe.  What that guy went through was 100x worse than chicken pox.  Also, with the chicken pox vaccine, even if it &quot;works&quot; it wears off after like 20 years, and chicken pox is far worse on an adult than a child.  So it makes no sense to even vaccinate against chicken pox.  let the kids get it naturally and then they&#39;re immune for life.  The only reason we have a chicken pox vaccine is that some drug company saw dollar signs, and now they&#39;ve made a shitload of money from it because it&#39;s &quot;mandatory.&quot;  My kids were not vaccinated against chicken pox and they&#39;ve each gotten it &quot;naturally&quot; and so they&#39;re immune for life.  </p>

<p>Because if you are taking pills you are already paying for them, and have decided they are necessary for you.  Regardless of what BigPharma PR attempts to mandate, you can go through life without getting vaccinated, and so can your children.  That hurts the bottom line, and we can&#39;t have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on at least trying to make people think in at least one of them. I&#39;ve just been trying to present rational ideas, nothing more. Should anyone like to read through my history, I feel like focusing on this type of insightful and reasonable presentation of an idea is a very good way to reach people. </p>

<p>We cannot just be diving in screaming &quot;lol fuckin shills <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is leaking&quot; and expect to reach anyone, though I&#39;m sure many of these commenters are shills who exist to discredit us. We need to be reasonable and informed in what we say. </p>

<p>I feel like the best way to do this, is simply to point out how irrational it is to polarize the issue so hard. I am for some vaccines, and have questions about others. That does not rationally translate into me wanting babies to die, nor can you label me &quot;Anti-vaxxer&quot;. Get people to ask why they&#39;re saying it does. Get people to ask why there can be no discussion or question about the topic.</p>

<p>If they make claims about the government always wanting to look out for our health and prevent disease, so vaccines must all be good, get them to ask themselves why cigarettes are legal. Make people think. Don&#39;t tell people what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not true. I for one am tired of seeing people bombard 10 links and excerpts from assorted alt-news sites as a contribution to the discussion or a rebuttal. Fucking please, learn to formulate your own thoughts and opinions, without vomiting links at people to support your claim. Support your statements with irrefutable logic that <em>makes people think for themselves</em>. If more people would start doing that, things would change.</p>

<p>Maybe only a couple people see it and start to think about it when we comment. But that&#39;s a couple people more than yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best comment I&#39;ve read in a long time. Well said, and thank you for the important contribution. The entire vaccine &quot;debate&quot; (more like debacle) boils down to mankind&#39;s fundamental irrationality and need to defend oneself. We defend ourselves instinctively whenever we perceive there to be a threat to our status as a loving and caring parent, similar to how we would defend ourselves against a perceived threat to our survival (the act of self-defense would be very different in the two scenarios, of course).</p>

<p>We all want to believe we are so smart and well informed, but an honest look to our own individual pasts will reveal a lifetime of misunderstandings and ignorance. Why do we believe we are above all that now? In 20 years, we&#39;ll all be looking back at our collective insanity and we&#39;ll think to ourselves &quot;times sure have changed, we&#39;ll never fall for that trap again&quot; and yet we will indeed fall into the next trap that lies in wait...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Great advice.  I have been trying lately to avoid references to external alt sites, and keep it down to plain old common-sense. This technique, if done correctly ( with great calm and confidence ) may not seem to work at the moment, but sometimes you sow a seed in a person&#39;s head, and that seed will grow.</p>

<p>People have to think it out for themselves. Convince someone to agree with you by force, and he will return to his initial belief the minute you turn around.</p>

Here in Arkansas we are lucky to have a Federal judge who about 12 years ago held that forcing vaccinations to go to school violated kids fundamental freedoms over their body, a la Roe v. Wade.

<p>I&#39;m not saying that vaccines can&#39;t have bad side effects, that&#39;s just stupid. I&#39;m saying that they have enough of a positive effect that considering mandatory immunization for the greater good (medical reasons excluded of course) isn&#39;t such a wild idea. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s problems with the studies. That&#39;s why there needs to be more done. But where does the evidence conclusively point?</p>

<p>I agree with this - in that I see the same crap...but the thing is, people have been saying this about gun control too (after every public / school shooting) - and nothing ever changes with that.  Maybe this is easier to sway people on...but so far, it seems similar to the &quot;omg we just had a huge disaster, everyone has to get vaccinated / get a more detailed bg check before buying guns&quot; and then it just gets voted down by enough of congress (or state/local government) to make it die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is on a whole &#39;nother level. I got downvoted just for suggesting that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2umut9/you_suddenly_have_the_power_to_cancel_one_show_on/coahxgl?context=10000">a healthy diet can help to prevent disease</a>. I mean, it honestly makes me uncomfortable being on this site, like under the fluffy kittens are a group of mad circle jerkers just looking for a good &#39;ol witch hunt against whoever it is that isn&#39;t currently on board with &quot;the agenda of science&quot;. </p>

<p>The irony of the modern age is that the triumph of science was triumph over superstition and dogma, and happened because of critical thinkers who went against the vast majority of popular opinion. What the scientific age shows us is that this lesson has been largely lost, and people far prefer confirmation bias and sheep mentality to actually questioning the world around you. I mean, I get being miffed about creationism being taught in school, and stuff like that. While I think evolution has some holes in its theories, and that there is something else going on with the life process, I certainly don&#39;t believe that a magic man in the sky created all the birds and beasties in 7 days. But the magic of hivemind circlejerk parties is that they froth at the mouth and create the &quot;for us or against us&quot; mentality where it&#39;s either all correct, or all incorrect, and if you raise <em>any</em> questions, whether it be about vaccinations, the theory of evolution, or what have you, you are a caricature that they have prefabricated to defame you as a person. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly where all this come from, I feel like it&#39;s the same kind of thing where when you get on the road, all the social norms of politeness seem to fly out the window and people get super aggressive. The pent up urge for violence that society does not provide release for, and the urge to conform to the tribe... Regardless it is disturbing and whenever a massive circlejerk envelopes reddit I find myself retreating to here to find actual discussion. I haven&#39;t even posted in these vax threads, other than the one innocuous comment at the top. Why bother? They&#39;re looking for a witch and I&#39;m not interested, and also not informed enough to really weigh in while I see that certainly doesn&#39;t stop most of the rabid hordes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Whether you&#39;re pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, or fall somewhere in the middle, the questions you need to ask yourselves are as follows:</p>

<p>Do you want to live in a world, where you cannot freely refuse a medical procedure that carries risk of injury or death? I&#39;m not questioning your comfort level with today&#39;s vaccine schedule, because today&#39;s vaccine schedule will change. New vaccines and additional doses are added all the time. children today receive as many as 49 doses of 14 vaccines before they reach age six, which is roughly 12 times higher than the number of vaccines administered to children back in 1940. With more than 220 new vaccines in the developmental pipeline for children and adults...and no end in sight..the question you must ask yourself is ARE YOU CERTAIN you will be 100% comfortable with vaccines that are added to the mandated list in the future? If you say that yes, you&#39;re comfortable, then you&#39;re either a) not expecting to be a parent or grandparent, b) don&#39;t have to worry about it because your kids are grown and out of the house, or c) lying to prove a point. No critical thinker, no honest person, would ever sign off on the sight-unseen vaccine schedule of the future. And yet that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when you condemn the people who are fighting for your right to refuse. YOU have the right to refuse, should you ever choose to use it, because the very &quot;anti-vaccine&quot; people you demonize have been fighting for us all. 
Right now, the burden of &quot;herd immunity&quot; falls on small children, but that is changing. Vaccine manufacturers see an untapped market in adult vaccines and are coming for you next. What will you do if your state, your employer, or your insurance company forces you to get a vaccine that you simply don&#39;t want? It hasn&#39;t happened to you yet, but if the right to refuse is eroded, it will happen to you sooner than you might think. Who then will you turn to? Your legislators who get campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies? The CDC that has former pharma executives sitting on the board? Who will you turn to if you ever want to say no? There will be no one. 
Once we enter the slippery slope of removing and individual&#39;s right to refuse medical procedures that carry a risk of injury or death, once we remove an individual&#39;s right to speak for him/herself and his/her children, we open ourselves up to an insidious new era, where other drugs and other procedures can be mandated. I heard (on NPR, interestingly enough) that there are people who want to test for a gene marker that&#39;s been found in mass shooters in the hopes that they can put the carriers of that gene on medications in early childhood. Sounds great, right? But many of us carry genes that will never be expressed. You could be a carrier of that gene. Or your child could be a carrier. So if we follow the &quot;for the greater good&quot; mentality behind vaccines (or the Nazi&#39;s &quot;for the greater good&quot; mentality behind eugenics (breeding out illness), we are looking at forcing people who may never express a sociopathic gene to take antipsychotics, just in case. Because that&#39;s what forced vaccination does. It asks children who may never come into contact with a particular virus to accept a vaccine just in case. And that&#39;s what eugenics was all about. It sterilizes people who can pass on a genetic disease just in case. Forced vaccination is a human rights violation, and to support it when you know that the government&#39;s own Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System exists and lists people who have died as a result of vaccines is unethical at best, sociopathic at worst.
The ethical thing to do is to allow people their right to refuse and leave it up to doctors and big pharma (who have marketing budgets larger than the GDP of some countries) to do a better job of convincing parents that vaccines are safe. We can start by reversing the law that grants vaccine manufacturers total immunity from vaccine injury lawsuits. Because as it stands, you can&#39;t sue a vaccine manufacturer if your child is injured or killed by a vaccine, even in cases where they could&#39;ve made a safer vaccine and chose not to or when they failed to recall a contaminated lot# in a timely manner. Think about that. You can&#39;t sue the manufacturer. That immunity from liability does more to shake parents&#39; confidence in vaccines than anything else out there.&quot; --Magnolia Crawford. </p>

<p>Why do you think this? Do you have a qualification in the area? Would spacing the schedule out improve or worsen public health? I feel like they must&#39;ve tested this.</p>

<p>Considering there&#39;s little to no evidence of vaccines doing any harm, I dunno why we&#39;d do that. It would just up the cost and cause delays in treatment.</p>

<p>But yeah, if that&#39;s all anti-vaxxers were demanding, I think that even with a few negative health effects, the scientific community would take that deal any day. More rigourous testing and regulation is far better than a minority population that is denying modern medicine and slowly trying to turn their area into sub-saharan africa</p>

<p>I just explained why anti-vaxxers were bad, you may or may not be against vaccines. you&#39;re certainly not in a position to demand a change to the vaccine schedule when you have literally no qualifications or knowledge of vaccinology. and neither would I - that&#39;s why I don&#39;t. Removing anti-vaxxers or forcing them to vaccinate would definitely be something good for mankind though, I agree with that part. I don&#39;t really think I ahve much effect on it sadly, it&#39;s a change that will probably only come when we see the anti-vaxxers children start dying from preventable diseases, and then they&#39;ll realise why we have vaccines in the first place. It&#39;s been so long since anybody has died of whooping cough, but it wouldn&#39;t take too many cases to make people realise &quot;hey, maybe I SHOULDN&#39;T disagree with modern science at the risk of my childs and other childrens life&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping the situation gets better before it gets worse, in any case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We already do, the ingredients lists for vaccines are available, and none of the ingredients have been proven harmful except in extremely high and non-vaccine-like doses.</p>

<p>the fact is that people just don&#39;t understand that vaccines are about as well documented and proven as gravity. That&#39;s why it&#39;s kinda baffling to me that people want to change this or that or think it should be less or more - why would they get to make that decision, and not a trained professional?</p>

<p>I get the fear of seeing your baby stabbed with injections, that would feel horrible to witness. But that doens&#39;t relaly give you the right to deny all scientific reasoning. I don&#39;t really like the speed limits or the fact that I have to wear a seat belt constantly - it doesn&#39;t mean I get to take it off and feel opressed that people try to convince me it&#39;s a good idea to wear it.</p>

<p>Why? Personally I think it&#39;s become clear that not everyone is smart enough to vaccinate their kid.  I think it&#39;s the same as speed limits and seatbelts - if we&#39;re allowed to force people to do that, why not force them to vaccinate? Seeing as we both agree theres no downside.</p>

<p>This whole &quot;freedom&quot; thing is a state of mind, nobody is actually free.

With everything else we have limits and requirements of people to make sure they&#39;re not mistreating their children or effecting others. How come we can&#39;t apply the same logic to vaccines that we apply to say, car licences or speed limits?</p>

<p>If people being forced to take vaccines would increase peoples health and save lives, then I&#39;m all for it. I can&#39;t relaly think of an argument against it except giving someone an exercise in freedom in an otherwise not-free society.</p>

ll just bang it in as hard as it takes to go in. Oh, and if it breaks your car and it can only go 5mph because it has slightly incompatible parts, that&#39;s just the price of safety. You and the other unlucky car owners who own incompatible cars can just stay on the shoulder and watch everyone else pass you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes down to issuing an edict on safety, even IF vaccines caused health problems (which overwhelming scientific evidence indicates that it DOES NOT, and one whole doctor saying it might), even IF it caused 0.00001% of the population a bad side effect, giving the people the freedom to spread lethal, highly preventable diseases into the population based on the 0.00001% chance that something bad might happen is beyond irresponsible.</p>

<p>Already, there has been an outbreak of measles where people have died (starting with someone who was not vaccinated, too!).  Shall we cluck and shake our heads as we watch an outbreak turn into an epidemic (that we could have prevented) and chalk hundred of thousands of (preventable) deaths up to the cost of freedom?</p>

<p>There are cases where we give up personal freedoms for the cost of general public safety.  I do not have the freedom to slaughter people at will.  I do not have the freedom to shout fire in a movie theater.  I do not have the freedom to beat children or dogs. No matter how religiously I believe I have the right to do such things.</p>

<p>Like all of the other idiots and criminals above, anti-vaxxers should not have the freedom to infect the population by refusing to vaccinate their kids.  This is for the protection of everyone else and THEIR kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly.  Luckily I work in a field of science where I actually understand what they&#39;re saying, and I can tell you the author (of the article and the paper) has taken a paper that states some incredibly complex terminology and tries to tie it to a possible icrease in the possiblity of something like scizophrenia and autism based on the amounts of some neurotransmitted and inhibitory neurotransmitters in &quot;post-birth&quot; rats (What?  Such twisty terminology.  Even you and I are &quot;post birth&quot;).  The proper medical term is neonate.</p>

<p>What these guys did is examine some male adult rats&#39; brains and test them for neurotramsitters to get a baseline, then inject some younger rats with a modified endotoxin (which is what bacteria secrete that causes us &quot;illness&quot;).  Okay, so far, sound enough.</p>

<p>So they inject this endotoxin <strong>every day at 2mg/kg of modified endotoxin for a period of what looks like 90 straight days</strong>.  They then cut open the rats with the endotoxin, and they looked at their neurotransmitters and found a difference.</p>

<p>The study was not repeated or replicated in any way.</p>

<p>What&#39;s questionable about this? They used the same methods of testing that would be used in a pharmocological study to give large overdoses of a substance in order to determine the LD50 (at what points 50% of the test population dies).</p>

<p>They make the assumption that the stimulation of the immune system in a neonate is responsible for these &quot;changes in the neurotransmitters&quot;, and NOT the overdose of endotoxin they happened to be using to stimulate them with.</p>

<p>So to give you some medical background, overdosing someone with water will cause severe neurological signs and death due to electrolyte imbalances.  Let alone dosing someone with a bacterial endotoxin, which we know causes diseases.</p>

<p>Rats do not experience brain development the same way we do.  We give vaccines at a certain time for a reason, since science has determined (through repreated testing), which time is appropriate.  They fully admit that they give these rats the endotoxin at an inappropriate time frame of brain development to correlate to the same time frame where we even give vaccines.</p>

<p>The introductory sentence of the paper in question states that negative environmental circumstances can impact the development of the brain in regards to neurotransmitters.  Negative environmental influences are things like stress, malnutrition, improper cleanliness .....  let me repeat the stress part.  They&#39;ve taken a bunch of baby rats in a lab setting, admitted that things like stress tend to cause changes to the brain on a chemical level, then proceeded to perform extremely stressful testing on them.  Assuming that the levels of neurotransmitter alteration would not be attributed to the stress.</p>

<p>Despite all of this (and I could go on and on), they&#39;ve concluded that it was the early immune stimulation (not the endotoxin, not the stress, not the age of administration, not any of the many flaws in this experiment) that was the cause of the &quot;differences&quot; seen in neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>Differences that <strong>may</strong> contribute to neurological changes in people, like schizophrenia and autism.</p>

<p>And since the number of pirates in the sea has decreased remarkably similarly to the increase of the climate, it&#39;s likely they may be responsible for the recent changes we&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you can&#39;t see the extreme logical fallacies used in making all of these broad conclusions, (which were not even replciated in any other study), so I&#39;m not going to waste my finger-time any more than I already have.  But keep on preachin&#39;, bruh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emotionally driven is darn skippy, though I will apologize and state that it&#39;s not directed at you in particular (since I do not know you).  But anyone who is out there not vaccinating their kids is really taking some incredible license with the meaning of a scientific study that was done, then later thoroughly disproven. (For the life of me, I cannot fathom how they took a study that <em>at most</em> may have shown that vaccination too early was bad, then concluded that is shouldn&#39;t be done at all - I don&#39;t even know).</p>

<p>Initially, no amount of physical evidence and &quot;guys, this is not true and potentially dangerous&quot; that was provided could convince people of anything.  But now as a results of their actions, kids have died, adults have died, and other kids and other adults are at risk.</p>

<p>All because of &quot;the latest trend&quot; in safety, and alarmist behaviors.  This is sad, and contemptable.  It&#39;s even worse because it never needed to happen in the first place.  Of course I&#39;m angry.  Most of the scientific world is angry.</p>

<p>so what do you do about the fluoride in the water supply? Or the preservatives in your food? or medicine you take when you&#39;re sick (or do you just let yourself be sick)?</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty selfish.</p>

<p>The difference is that there&#39;s no medical consensus that circumcision is beneficial. It&#39;s a religious practice. However, vaccines are purely medicinal and are based on 100% science. The two things are not even remotely comparable.</p>

The more of us who start doing this, the more people will start to question the motives behind it. Posting a link to a website is not a counter-argument. Presenting a well-written idea that one can be for the polio vaccine, but have questions about the flu vaccine, is a valid counter-argument to the idea that this is a black and white issue.

    <div class="md"><p>This stuff is getting incredibly old.  It&#39;s not just Reddit either, it&#39;s all over every nook and cranny of the internet right now.  I&#39;ve been watching this issue for over a decade and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  I&#39;d have to spend 50 million dollars to get this much press for my perspective.  </p>

<p>Since this is the only sane place left that sees how ridiculous this circlejerk has become, I&#39;m going to outline some things about vaccines and vaccination policy that are relevant to the issue that the people, completely immersed in their circle jerk, refuse to discuss.  Perhaps if you find yourself in the wild and you want people to understand a more balanced argument you can use some of the below to make your case.</p>

<p>The vaccine discussion is not just about autism and the Wakefield study...it&#39;s just not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more concerned with a number of factors that should raise anyone&#39;s eyebrows. <strong>The FACT is that governments, not just in the US, have essentially made it impossible to sue vaccine manufacturers if their child has a legitimate reaction to their product is pretty damn shady. Accountability should be a thing, regardless of the industry. No exceptions.</strong></p>

<p>The relationship that pharmaceutical giants have with regulatory bodies like the CDC and the FDA <strong>EXISTS</strong> and it&#39;s highly suspect as well, especially when we live in a time where money influences policy so much and shit gets &quot;Classified&quot;, brushed under the rug, and fast-tracked all the time.  Money now completely and totally controls policy, these fucking people are not to be trusted and everyone knows it.  <strong>Yet when it comes to their precious vaccinations it&#39;s, all of  sudden, a sin to mention what is clearly corruption?</strong>  Fuck that.</p>

<p>While everyone is spending all of their time spinning their wheels discussing autism and Wakefield there are still some pretty serious questions about a number of other health problems that have cropped up in children and, <strong>for some reason, it&#39;s conveniently been labelled COMPLETELY INSANE to simply ask ask that long term, independent studies be done on vaccines and the vaccine schedule itself. Even doing a placebo controlled study of the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated and then monitoring health problems is considered &quot;unethical&quot;. It&#39;s fucking bullshit logic.</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve handed over our childrens health and safety to governments married to corporations while intelligent, highly educated people just keep on pounding away at the science as if there is NO FUCKING WAY that their precious science could ever become corrupted by financial interests.
It&#39;s nonsense. I&#39;m sick of seeing this circle jerk on Reddit day after day.</p>

<p>At this point, the scariest thing is all of the dickhead armchair scientists, doctors, skeptics, and soccer moms who think that <strong>FORCING PEOPLE, a complete and total violation of medical ethics, is the way to go.</strong>  </p>

<p>This is the attitude that needs to be pissed on.  It needs to be fought.  I will not let a hysterical mob of idiots who only understand one side of an issue tell me what I am required and not required to inject into my child.  I do not care how much faith they have in establishment medicine...it&#39;s not about them.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, my only hope here is that this jerk continues into the absurd and the bullshit piles so high that more reasonable reading this stuff start getting suspicious and pushing back.  I want them to star asking themselves <strong>&quot;Wait, this seems a little strange that we&#39;re hearing solutions that involve forcing medical procedures on people yet we&#39;re only hearing our own echoes and not hearing a single solitary word from the opposition.</strong> </p>

<p>Edit: The vote brigade is even strong in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Fuck, this website is about to jump the shark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post. I must admit, I initially fell in to the trap of buying in to this circlejerk. I am one of the rational people that you mentioned that noticed a massive pile of one topic being rammed down my throat - and started wanting to know more / the truth. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, for reasons that you mentioned, finding objective scientific studies on this is damn near impossible - which raises red flags. Even in this thread, there isn&#39;t much of a discussion on the issues of vaccinations. Where are all the posts that point to facts and evidence, rather than complain about being downvoted in other threads?</p>

<p>Either way - there seems to be a suppression of people who are asking legitimate questions and trying to get to the bottom of this, and that situation should ALWAYS alarm you - regardless of the subject matter. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2unbia/remember_the_good_old_days_before_polio_was/">I submitted this post 30 minutes ago</a> in response to the outrageous propaganda at the top of <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a>.</p>

<p>It had 6 points, with 100% upvotes, after only a few minutes.</p>

<p>99% of the time, whenever that happens, that means the post is destined for <em>at least</em> the top 5 positions on the sub.</p>

<p>However, since the topic is vaccines, it automatically attracts a certain &quot;element&quot; and it gets ruthlessly targeted.</p>

<p>I predicted that it would be hit hard, and sadly this predication came true.</p>

<p>After briefly surfacing on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, the downvotes came swiftly. It currently has 2 upvotes at around 50% upvoted.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the key part: there are <em>zero</em> skeptical comments. These are drive-by downvoters who specifically target certain topics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that certain discussions aren&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s getting worse every day, and I&#39;m starting to lose hope.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The argument has nothing to do with the life status of an unborn child.</p>

<p>The argument on both subjects, abortion and vaccination, is about a person&#39;s right to choose for them self.  Can one choose to have an abortion or not? Can one choose to have a vaccine or not?</p>

<p>The children dying in both scenarios are hypothetical children.  </p>

<p>The anti-abortion fanatics are standing on hypothetical dead children.</p>

<p>The pro-vaccine fanatics are standing on hypothetical dead children.</p>

<p>In reality, being forced by law to carry a child full term (the anti-abortion dream) is forcing the mother to put her body at risk to satisfy the wishes of people who don&#39;t share her risk.</p>

<p>Being forced by law to have all vaccines as scheduled by the government (the pro-vaccine dream) is forcing the recipients to put their bodies at risk to satisfy the wishes of people who don&#39;t share their risk.  Example is that some children can&#39;t be vaccinated because of compromised immune systems, so everyone else should be forced to vaccinate to reduce the risk of this immune-compromised child of getting ill.  Without regard to the risks now being forced onto the healthy children who are forced to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>Next time you wish to blurt out about someone being ignorant you may want to double check that you comprehend the comparison.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even attempted to discuss the &quot;when is a baby really alive&quot; debate.  Its unimportant in the context of this discussion, which is about living, walking people being able to decide for themselves if they want a medical procedure such as an abortion or a vaccine.</p>

<p>They are literally opposite thought processes. Anti-abortion is sacrificing the health of one for the life of one. Pro-abortion is sacrificing potential life for the health of one. Anti-vaccines are sacrificing the potential health of many for the potential health of one, and pro-vaccines are sacrificing the potential health of one for the potential health of many.</p>

<p>Your bias is so painfully obvious because of how you portray the opposing side. You want to believe that the opposing side is so obviously wrong that you have created a straw man to attack.</p>

<p>When he gets upset</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this sentence, upset is analogous with unintentionally pregnant.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when she gets unintentionally pregnant</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>he harms himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, we are using self-harm to represent the negative affects associated with pregnancy.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She suffers from unwanted pregnancy symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>John should murder people who upset him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is where we get into the bias of the argument. (I am using a biased argument because my argument is not for either side of the argument, but simply to show that the two arguments you are comparing are not the same)</p>

<p>Here, &quot;murder people who upset him&quot; compares to the act of terminating (murder) the pregnancy (people) that causes pregnancy symptoms (upset).</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman should terminate a pregnancy that causes pregnancy symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Bringing us to</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman is fertile. When the woman gets unintentionally  pregnant, she suffers unwanted pregnancy symptoms. She should terminate the pregnancy that causes unwanted pregnancy symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the second:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John has a mental disorder</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, John is any person, and the &quot;mental disorder&quot; is analogous with the ability to transmit diseases.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A person can transmit diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>He murders people who upset him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the bias of this sides argument; &quot;murders people&quot; represents transmitting the diseases, and &quot;people who upset him&quot; are people susceptible to the disease. (Which anyone pro-vaccine will say includes people with the vaccine because of &quot;herd immunity and other reasons. (Again, I&#39;m not stating my opinions, I&#39;m stating the opinions of people with the views I&#39;m describing))</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They spread diseases to people</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>John should be killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case &quot;killed&quot; is analogous with vaccinated. Which may make it sound anti-vaccine, but it isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They should be vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings us to the statement</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person can transmit disease. The spread diseases to other people. They should be vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say &quot;HAHA you got tricked into supporting vaccines,&quot; or &quot;HAHA I got you to support abortion,&quot; because you may not agree with the postulates. </p>

<p>However, Anti-abortion people view their opinion in the same way that you viewed our first scenario with John murdering people. Pro vaccine people view the situation the same was as you viewed our second scenario. </p>

<p>Anti-abortion thinks abortion is a crime</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be a crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and pro-vaccine thinks it would be justice</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be justice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are as opposite of opinions as the first two scenarios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parenting and pregnancy forums are FULL of vaccination propaganda, too.</p>

<p>In fact, many people actually post the topic, &quot;should I allow unvaccinated people into my home?&quot; As in, they actually want to request the vaccine papers and status of anyone stepping foot in their house. These people aren&#39;t even in California trying to preemptively quarantine their kids. Then, the rest of the comments are filled with, &quot;that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. Coming across as rude is no small price to pay if it means protecting my child.&quot; Others say how they&#39;ve refused to allow their best friends to come over, and how they&#39;ve lost relationships over the problem.</p>

<p>Just today, my spouse received an email from &quot;What to Expect&quot; (though interestingly, she opted out of their emails via the unsubscribe button). The content? &quot;Measles special report!&quot; With a link to 4 articles: </p>

<p>1) Measles outbreak: the time to check your little one&#39;s vaccinations is now</p>

<p>2) What happened when my infant was exposed to measles</p>

<p>3) 2015 Measles Outbreak: special coverage</p>

<p>4) And perhaps my favorite one of all: How doctors can win the vaccine debate with patients</p>

<p>It&#39;s astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I kind off get it that you vaccinate for polio and very dangerous deceases that are known to be preventable by vaccine.</p>

<p>But I once got downvoted to oblivion for stating that in my opinion, vaccinating for the children deceases (or even flu) is totally unnecessary.</p>

<p>Most of these children deceases are pretty harmless if you get them as a child and you become immune after you have had it.</p>

<p>However there were reports a few years ago of adults in holland getting these deceases, these guys/girls were vaccinated as children. 
I don&#39;t know if this is because the vaccine is ineffective or because you need booster shots to keep your immunity.
What I do know is that as an adult it is much more dangerous to get these diseases. </p>

<p>But as stated before in this thread its all black and white on reddit.
All anti vaxxers are bad and stupid, and all smart respectable people know that vaccines are the way to go...</p>

<p>They are trying to sway public opinion here by &quot;being a part of the team&quot; and then making it seem like &quot;the team&quot; actually supports vaccinations. This makes others who are actually critical thinkers wonder if they&#39;re missing something.

This shows that the injections do not keep people healthy. 
..The only benefit to getting a injection, is frequently becoming infected with a condition like
flu, measles, diabetes, autism, cancer etc.. If you are into those kind of benefits..
It is like trying find an example of some one on antidepressants that isn&#39;t still depressed, or significantly worse than they had been before starting their FDA encouraged drug .</p>

<p>It would have gone over better if the person in question had simply stated a stance and waited for reply instead of attempting to bait people into the response they were already prepared to argue against. </p>

<p>The MSM teaches the incurious that this is the proper way to engage debate, but they only wind up debating other incurious people. And actual debate gets drowned out in the ensuing fracas of shit flinging. Which was the actual point of this thread. </p>

<p>Now does it make sense?</p>

<p>Really interesting information they are finding out. Seems like the more shots you get, the less your immune system is able to handle infections and diseases. </p>

<p>See, this what drives scientists crazy.  The result you&#39;re describing is discussed in the literature and believed to be real so far since it&#39;s been replicated in laboratory animals.</p>

<p>But going from that to the conclusions that &quot;the more shots you get, the less your immune system is able to handle infections and diseases&quot; is a huge and kind of crazy jump.  It&#39;s speculation, but it&#39;s not <em>informed</em> speculation.  If you put it in context, it&#39;s difficult to imagine how &quot;vaccination burden&quot; could be a thing, considering that there are several million viruses in a given cubic meter of air so we probably inhale hundreds of thousands every minute. </p>

<p>Likely there&#39;s some population genetics/epitope specificity explanation related to how the flu virus is evolving, but there&#39;s no reason to generalize from this to other vaccines.</p>

<p>Increased risk of non-influenza respiratory virus infections associated with receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link!</p>

<p>So this paper actually points to something <em>much more interesting</em> and much less serious than the vaccine burden idea.  From the manuscript:
First, the full spectrum of possibilities</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The increased risk of <em>non‐influenza respiratory viruses</em> among TIV recipients could be an artefactual finding, for example measurement bias could have resulted if subjects were more likely to report their first ARI episode but less likely to report subsequent episodes, while there was no real difference in rhinovirus or other non‐influenza respiratory virus infections following the winter influenza season. The increased risk could also indicate a real effect. Receipt of TIV could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced
immunity to non‐influenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, what they <em>actually</em> think is going on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Alternatively, our results could be explained by temporary nonspecific immunity following influenza virus infection, through the cell‐mediated response or, more likely, the innate immune response to infection [21‐23]. Subjects who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened non‐specific immunity in the following weeks...The duration of any temporary non‐specific immunity remains uncertain [13] but could be <em>of the order of 2‐4 weeks based on these observations</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, with any infection you have an innate immune response (i.e. the way your cells individually fight off the virus) and your adaptive immune response (involving antibodies, the way your whole body fights off the infection).  </p>

<p>Vaccines affect, and ramp up, the adaptive response to infection, and this response is specific to the virus vaccinated against.  It&#39;s functionally the more important method of immunity to clear infections.  However, <em>any</em> viral antigen (live or dead) injected into the body will also trigger the innate immune response, which is a general antiviral response by the cells that come in contact with the virus.</p>

<p>The authors think that basically the viral antigens included in the vaccine might be temporarily soaking up the innate immune response (so to speak) leading the patients temporarily more susceptible to minor respiratory infections.  In the case of the flu virus, which is generally a severe respiratory infection, it&#39;s easy to say this is a reasonable price to pay.</p>

<p>I know reddit and most of the other social media is one huge paid for, bought and gamed platform aimed at dispersing propaganda, societal and cultural context. It&#39;s obvious. So when I see sites like reddit, which are completely bought out by the powers that be, have such a huge propaganda push to demonize me, it really gives meaning to the phrase &quot;To learn who rules over you...

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in my 3rd year of obsessive research relating to vaccines and I&#39;m not sure anymore that they even work. I think their preventative effects have been grossly exaggerated while harmful effects have been ignored; belief, diagnostic criteria changes and renaming of diseases can explain the statistics. My only question now is why? Surely money isn&#39;t the only factor. Not something I ever wanted to get involved with, but it found me after I had my own reaction to a vaccine and after no help from doctors I did my own research. Lets just say the history of vaccination has some skeletons you won&#39;t ever hear about in the mainstream media. What I have learnt they do to the body is what I believe to be a crime against humanity given there is no prior screening. &quot;Clearly, defining protective efficacy of an Ab molecule in a predictive fashion is currently beyond the state of immunological science and may not be possible with current reductionistic approaches to scientific problems.&quot; pg 30 <a href="https://www.einstein.yu.edu/uploadedfiles/casadevall/2006/8.pdf">https://www.einstein.yu.edu/uploadedfiles/casadevall/2006/8.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I kinda understand the &quot;those who don&#39;t think are steak on the table&quot; (or whatever the quote is), because if they don&#39;t think, they are weapons to be picked up and used against you.  Therefore, the logical thing to do with populations that don&#39;t think is to turn them against other populations that don&#39;t think, or else they&#39;ll be turned against you. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say I agree with the idea, but rather observing how fucking difficult and dangerous unthinking people are.  They&#39;re basically weapons that are left on the table, and it&#39;s a constant battle to think for them so they&#39;re not turned against you.  The obvious (although cruel) thing to do is to is to trick them into killing each other so they don&#39;t end up killing you... and that&#39;s probably exactly how those at the top of the pyramid feel and think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, perhaps the wrong place to say this but I am in favor of some vaccines, MMR vaccines are a must because everyone has it &#39;ass backwards&#39;, people who don&#39;t vaccinate should seek to ensure their children catch mumps and measles asap.  You can&#39;t live an entire lifetime and never catch these two and the older you get, the nastier both the diseases are.  So, yes vaccinate for MMR, also the risk of damage and death from those diseases outrun risks of autism.  However, other shots do seem a bit pointless.  TB has now mutated and vaccines are of no use, flu mutates fast so there&#39;s no point taking a flu shot, tetanus still happens whether you&#39;re vaccinated or not.  </p>

<p>I think prior to having a shot you should read as much as you can about the effectiveness of the shot at protecting you from the disease.  If you need a shot but you check online only to read hundreds of cases where people had the shot but still got the disease then find out why, see if the shot is worth having, how high a risk is it really?</p>

<p>Doctors are in the sales racket, they want to push their shit onto you, just as a dentist wants to find fault in your teeth.  That&#39;s another one, how many of you were told you had cavities when you were in your teens?  You got these fictitious cavities filled or root canaled right?  If you have children (and the money) book your child in to three different dentists for a check up, I guarantee at least two will find teeth with cavities, but they&#39;ll be in different teeth.  It&#39;s all a fucking con, and you are the medical profession&#39;s ATM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I think it&#39;s important to keep in mind that all medical treatments have potential risks. The choice may be pretty clear cut with measles, but it may be fuzzier with other diseases, and it might be a lot fuzzier for families with a history of bad reactions to vaccines. I hate the idea of sincere, intelligent anti-vaccine people being forced to give their kids shots. I think the people who ridicule the parents who have concerns are being jerks. </p>

<p>Second, I&#39;ve had all my shots, and my kid&#39;s had his shots. I&#39;d prefer that my kid be around other kids who&#39;ve had their shots. </p>

<p>But, finally: my feeling is that the anti-vaccination hysteria was amplified by some interest group that&#39;s scared its members sell products that actually do cause autism. Maybe, say, makers of a food additive, or a type of plastic. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m right, the group might be using vaccines to draw people&#39;s attention away from whatever it is that actually hurts kids&#39; brains. </p>

Can anyone link me some reputable sources to change my view on this subject? Until that happens I&#39;m going maintain my stance that people completely against vaccines are just jackasses making wild speculations.</p>

Rarely things are black or white, and in this particular case there could be good vaccines and bad or unnecessary vaccines. The discussion could be more uselful if it wasn&#39;t for all of this hate and propaganda, instead it&#39;s all about vaccine cause autism bullshit that few people anti-vaccine actually believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, i will be approaching this from a blank slate and an open mind like i do everything else. i will use public information and statistics from both sides to reach a verdict.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.nvic.org/CMSTemplates/NVIC/pdf/49-Doses-PosterB.pdf">This document</a> correlating effects of vaccines with disabilities claims the following. i will put calculated percentage risk in italics, as well as lethality of the illness.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 in every 50 kids develop autism <em>2%</em> (as of 2013) <em>non fatal</em></p></li>
<li><p>1 child in 9 develop asthma <em>11%</em> (as of 2013) <em>can be fatal if not treated, no figure available</em></p></li>
<li><p>1 in 6 develop learning disabilities <em>16%</em> (as of 2013) <em>not enough information on lethality due to vagueness on what this paper considers a learning disability. expected to be low</em></p></li>
<li><p>1 in 400 develop diabetes <em>less then 1%</em> (as of 2013) <em>lethal in time, early death possible. no rate i can find</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>so according to this paper:
 worst case 30% of kids can be negatively effected by vaccines,
 <strong>the average would be 7.5% since these illnesses can overlap.</strong> most would be quality of life reductions and early death without proper treatment.</p>

<p>now lets see the mortality rates for illnesses we are vaccinating against</p>

<ul>
<li><p>hepatitis B causes <strong>80%</strong> of all primary liver cancers. 500,000 people die each year from this lethal cancer. Currently, primary liver cancer has a <strong>5-year survival rate of only 10%</strong>. <a href="http://www.hepb.org/liver-cancer/hepb_and_liver_cancer.htm">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Diphtheria can be severe or fatal in unvaccinated persons; even with appropriate treatment, <strong>5%-10% of patients with diphtheria die.</strong> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5253a3.htm">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Tetanus, a disease characterized by painful muscular spasms that can lead to respiratory failure and, in up to <strong>40% of cases, death.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_tetani">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Pertussis also known as Whooping cough, about 1 out of 4 <strong>25%</strong> will get pneumonia and 1 or 2 out of 100 will die <strong>2% lethality</strong> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/deadly-disease-for-baby.html">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Polio: Between <strong>2% and 10%</strong> people who have paralysis from poliovirus infection <strong>die</strong> because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/">source</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>3%-6%</strong> of Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae Type b) cases in children are <strong>fatal</strong>. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/clinicians.html">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rotavirus: if treated properly, non fatal. <a href="http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Rotavirus.aspx">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>pneumococcal meningitis: About 1 out of 15. <strong>6%</strong> <strong>fatality rate</strong>. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/fs-parents.html">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Influenza: highly variable depending on the strain. will not include due to wide range of lethality</p></li>
<li><p>Measles : <strong>0.3%</strong> with proper care. <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/3/395.abstract">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Mumps: rarely fatal. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mumps/downloads/PL-dis-mumps-color-office.pdf">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rubella: rarely fatal <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/page2.htm">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Varicella (chicken pox) : <strong>0.7%</strong> lethality <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/preventchickenpox/">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Hepatitis A: rarely fatal <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/spring09/articles/spring09pg22-23.html">source</a></p></li>
<li><p>HPV - causes cancer, but the virus itself is not deadly if treated. too many strains to get an accurate number but depending on location of the cancer, may be fatal. not included n my calculations due to high variability. <strong>HPV VACCINES can however result in death in rare cases</strong> due to medical malpractice. mostly due to wrong injection site or unrelated complication. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/gardasil.asp">source</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>so, thats a worst case of more then 75% of children being infected with often fatal illness. on average it will be around 20% with DEADLY illnesses.</p>

<p><strong>7.5 % chance of life altering illness, rare chance of death if I DO vaccinate my kid, vs 20% chance of infection, high chance of death if I DONT.</strong> </p>

<p>ill take my chances with vaccines. im more scared of incompetent doctors and poor vaccine storage practices. perhaps theres another thing at work here other then these children being vaccinated? maybe the iodine?</p>

<p>am i afraid of the unvaccinated? no. why would i be, im vaccinated. and id be careful to make sure my kid is too. if they catch it because of someones kid not being vaccinated, tough luck for me that my kid caught it before he could be safely vaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no different than the Ebola panic created by the conservative media (that died down immediately after elections).  Except this one is driven mostly by liberal media.  Three weeks from now, they&#39;ll be on to the next manufactured panic.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m happily childfree, but if I had a kid they would get only the shots that prevent fatal or disfiguring diseases.  MMR, whooping cough and polio?  Yes.  Gardasil, chicken pox and annual flu shot?  Fuck no.  </p>

<p>Opinion time:  Some shots should be mandatory and others should not.  We don&#39;t need a resurgence of nasty diseases like polio or mumps.  If you are healthy enough to get the shots, you should get them before being allowed in public schools, daycares, etc.  However, shots that prevent routine illnesses like chicken pox--or those with a shitty success rate like the flu jab--should be totally optional.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and shingles is no joke.  But only about 1/3rd of people ever get it.  If someone wants to take that chance, that should be their option since they will be the ones having to live with the pain.

<p>I think I draw the line at vaccinating against things that &quot;could&quot; happen, especially if the possible disease is not fatal or disfiguring.  Personal opinion only.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but I still don&#39;t want to worry about catching them.  They&#39;re still not a fun or positive experience.  </p>

<p>Measles was <em>thisclose</em> to being eradicated in 2000, now it&#39;s back.  It&#39;s not that I think the disease is some huge plague, it&#39;s that it shouldn&#39;t exist at all if we can help it.  Most of the side effects people worry about with the MMR (encephalitis, fever, febrile seizures, etc) are even more severe when you catch the actual measles virus naturally.  Not for everyone, but for some.  </p>

<p>Well there you go, not only is that not the default skeptical position, but it is a passive state where you have ceased to seek out more knowledge. I wonder how you got there instead of the default skeptical position of requiring positive proof of safety and efficacy across populations for each individual vaccine.</p>

When Obama says everyone should be vaccinated, intelligent folks would interpret that as meaning everyone should to to the doctor to get vaccinated.  At which point your physician would point out any reasonable concerns regarding your individual person being vaccinated.</p>

<p>If President Obama read aloud a detailed explanation of all of the reasons for not getting a vaccine then he&#39;d lose his audience.  The short version is to just ask your doctor and do what he says.  The overwhelming problem here is people thinking they know better than scientists or their doctor and deciding they shouldn&#39;t get their kids vaccinated based on ignorant understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major issue is the idea of herd immunity though. Vaccines are much less likely to work as more individuals in the herd/society refuse vaccinations because of the increase in cases of illness. Measles had all but been eradicated before people started being afraid of vaccination. Just look up how many people use to die on a yearly basis from diseases such as polio and measles, which until recently we have rarely seen high numbers of cases. Vaccines may have negative impacts in some ways, but they have still saved far more lives than they have taken or destroyed. Which is why the government needs/ wants population control now. We have over come many of our natural risks of mortality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that is a valid point and not one that I really disagree with. based on how I interpret this though, correct me if I&#39;m misguided, but it does seem that vaccination helps in younger years. Even if the baby boomer population has been living with 50% vaccination in recent years, most of them were vaccinated as children, which is the most crucial time in regards of disease risk. So my point is, while vaccines may not help once a person is healthy and has a developed immune system, do they not help babies and young children survive the period of their life when most of these diseases are a risk? If we relied solely on natural development of the immune system, would we not experience the natural selection process again in that sense? Only genetics leading to a strong immune system would survive in the long run. I am just asking questions at this point, not trying to argue by any means. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Babies are <em>too</em> young for most vaccines.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, with <em>actual</em> regulation of vaccines and <em>actual</em> accountability of the pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines, this would be true for children, but only children who are malnourished and in extremely poor countries.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>far</em> more effective ways of treating certain disease than preventative vaccination. </p>

<p>For example, Vitamin A is <em>crucial</em> in preventing <em>and treating</em> measles. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much safer to make sure you&#39;re getting enough Vitamin A in the prevention of measles than to receive the vaccine.</p>

<p>Most vaccines are so poorly manufactured that they cause more problems than they fix. </p>

<p>Again, if the big pharma was <em>actually</em> held up to scrutiny, then things might be different.</p>

Which vaccines are &quot;many&quot;? Does this include the more dangerous diseases?   Is there any real sources for this besides &quot;learning in medical school&quot; because there are plenty of other people who have gone to medical school which contradict him.

    <div class="md"><p>This same logic would imply that the staunch, unwavering, black and white opposition to teaching &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; in public schools is really just evidence of some conspiracy to keep the country godless; or that the medical community&#39;s outright denunciation of homeopathy is evidence of some conspiracy to silence Big Pharma detractors; or that people laugh at moon landing hoaxers (I dunno what they call themselves) because the hoaxers are <em>actually</em> on to something!</p>

<p>It appears to be so black and white and oversimplified because people are tired of arguing with people who have no idea what they are talking about, people who would rather come up with post hoc rationalizations for their opposition (e.g., that somehow vaccines can <em>overload</em> an infant&#39;s immune system). No one is going to take the time to delve into the minute specifics (e.g., <strong><em>not everyone should get vaccines</em></strong>) when large chunks of the population are irredeemably wrong about vaccine science and efficacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the thing.  A lot of the anti-vax commentary is perfectly reasonable speculation.  But it&#39;s not <em>informed</em> speculation.  They&#39;re theories that people come with to explain a phenomenon they heard, but most of the time do not involve any attempt to rationalize that theory in terms of what we know about immunology.</p>

<p>You have people postulating about &quot;vaccine burden&quot; from getting too many shots causing immunosupression, recombinant vaccines giving people live illnesses, injection site reactions morphing into brain disorders...</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they get step 1 of the scientific method, but not the other parts.  Another important part involves choosing among hypotheses that are consistent with other evidence, and then explaining a theory in terms of what else is known in the field.  Vaccines are <em>extremely well studied</em> medical instruments, that are used on astoundingly large numbers of people (more than most medical agents) so we have very good medical data to suggest that the ones we commonly use are safe.  No, it&#39;s not a <em>common</em> feature of vaccines (note, the original oral polio vaccine gave people a mild version of the live illness at a rather low rate, and isn&#39;t used anymore), but the ones we use commonly have very good data.</p>

<p>In this situation, it takes more than just a feeling that &quot;we get too many vaccines and it burdens our immune system&quot; (especially when it doesn&#39;t jive with other existing medical evidence) to justify making carveouts to well-established public health policy.  It&#39;s like arguing that, because some people don&#39;t get lung cancer from smoking, the smoking bans should be overturned.</p>

<p>I notice that on wednesdays and fridays my computer overheats.  I don&#39;t postulate that there&#39;s some as-yet-undiscovered temporal deviation to the laws of E&amp;M, I look for explanations that make sense in terms of what we know affects electronics.  Maybe I tend to work late on those days because those are days with meetings, and the extended use causes my computer to overheat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched the anti-vax crowd completely back off the claim that vaccines cause autism after it got buttfucked into mythology. So the claims have weakened and have splintered. The most vague claims that I&#39;ve seen now is that &quot;vaccine burden&quot;, as you call it, causes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome">SIDS</a>. The goal posts have moved so far now that I also see parents concede that vaccines work and are safe, but fuck the government won&#39;t tell them what to do. I&#39;ve pretty much given up trying to reason with these types of people.   </p>

<p>FYI measles is an illness that can cause permanent brain damage or death. Most cases do not result in harm, but complications are common in about 30% of infections. Death occurs in 0.1 - 0.2% of infections (malnutrition can raise it as high as 10%).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Invoking the peer review process often subjects you to an invalid argument from authority. Unless we both mutually recognise the authority of the peers in question, peer review is useless. Even when we both agree on the validity of the authority of the peers, the peer review itself can come to its conclusions using poor science.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Example</em></strong></h1>

<p>Study 1 is peer-reviewed. It concludes that dietary cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease.  </p>

<p>Study 2 is peer-reviewed. It concludes that dietary cholesterol <strong><em>does not</em></strong> increase the risk of heart disease.  </p>

<p>Examples just like this happen all the time. They can&#39;t both be right about their conclusions. Maybe study 1 was funded by Big Pharma<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> ? Maybe study 2 was funded by Big Joe&#39;s Lard Imporium<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> ? It&#39;s not that black and white. Peer review doesn&#39;t automatically make something a fact.</p>

<p>Peer review can be useful. It&#39;s certainly not infallible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be honest, i dont believe the vaccines cause autism debacle. partly becuse the percentages are so low. however i would definitly be intrested in a study done on various forms of vaccine storage, and sterilization techniques. has it occurred to anyone that maybe the 7% of kids that suffer lifestyle altering illnesses had something other then getting vaccines in common? correlation does not imply causation 100% of the time, maybe there is something relating to the metal in the needle, some change in storage practices, or the iodine sometimes used to sterilize injection sites.</p>

<p>arguing that 7% chance of lifestyle altering illnesses with low risk of mortality  is some how worse then 20% risk of infection with something that can kill you is what boggles my mind.</p>

<p>there needs to be a study done on more then just the vaccines so we can get to the root of the increase in autism recently. i mean during vaccination you are exposed to</p>

<p>the vaccine - mostly proven NOT to be the source</p>

<p>the metal in the needle</p>

<p>immune system stress due to close time frame of vaccine administrations</p>

<p>the plastic in the syringe</p>

<p>whatever they used to sterilize your injection site.</p>

<p>heck maybe theres a brand name of syringe that got used in ALL the documented autism cases. </p>

<p>its always possible something got overlooked and it is a scientists job to leave no stone unturned and examine every possibility. science is meshing with politics nowadays and i think thats giving us some issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you here that more testing needs to be done, but that&#39;s kind of my point.  More testing <em>does</em> need to be done, more research, more transparency, less appeals to emotion, less appeals to authority, less Big Pharma influence, more independent study, less black and white &quot;you&#39;re either pro-vaxx or anti-vaxx, you either like science or you want to see children killed&quot;.</p>

<p>I by no means think that vaccines in their entirety are automatically bad or evil by default.  What I question is any subject that is so polarizing that the very mention that the truth may fall <em>somewhere</em> in the middle immediately leads to you being attacked and ridiculed and called a moron and babykiller.</p>

<p>These reactions should tell us something about this subject and the way it&#39;s being (and has been) framed in the public&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>And Big Pharma/the US gov. are proven corrupt liars at this point so their motives should always be questioned, regardless of the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  It would have been chicken pox, which isn&#39;t even that severe.  What that guy went through was 100x worse than chicken pox.  Also, with the chicken pox vaccine, even if it &quot;works&quot; it wears off after like 20 years, and chicken pox is far worse on an adult than a child.  So it makes no sense to even vaccinate against chicken pox.  let the kids get it naturally and then they&#39;re immune for life.  The only reason we have a chicken pox vaccine is that some drug company saw dollar signs, and now they&#39;ve made a shitload of money from it because it&#39;s &quot;mandatory.&quot;  My kids were not vaccinated against chicken pox and they&#39;ve each gotten it &quot;naturally&quot; and so they&#39;re immune for life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is it&#39;s the cumulative effect of aluminum being ingested and deposited in the brain, not only through vaccines but various other external sources as well. Which could be why isolated studies determine no direct cause from vaccines if it&#39;s just the tipping point.</p>

<p>It just so happens that certain vaccines have an incredibly high concentration of aluminum salts injected directly, bypassing the bodies&#39; natural filters. It&#39;s a common adjuvant. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, you&#39;ll find loads of aluminum salts in antacids (300-600mg!) and soy based baby formulas. Great for expectant mothers with heartburn. After following a standard vaccination schedule (some 20 or so over two years) a child is exposed to quite a bit aluminum in their first few years of life.</p>

<p>Autism is often determined when a child is around 3 years old. I haven&#39;t culled through all the vaccination ingredients to determine how much Aluminum is used, but it&#39;s not nothing.</p>

<p>Aluminum is agreed upon as being neuro-toxic, but really hasn&#39;t been adequately studied, excluding its role in possibly causing Alzheimer&#39;s. Since there are studies going both ways, I&#39;d take the middle ground and say it&#39;s still inconclusive.</p>

<p>For some light reading, here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp22-c1.pdf">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry&#39;s Statement on Aluminum</a> I used as a quick reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue (im fairly anti-vaccine) with anti-vaxxers is some of them just give the rest of us a bad name..  Think about the autism thing logically.  That is a disorder that affects the human biological system...which is INSANELY complex.  No ONE thing can be the sole cause of autism.  There are dozens of factors. Genetics...what nutrition the mother had during pregnancy...what nutrition baby had at and after birth...yes, then vaccines play a role, i believe.  It has substances in it that have no place in a human body. Sure, small amounts. Aluminum, formaldehyde etc.  most of the ones with mercury have been phased out.  But a baby gets up to 7 or so on the FIRST DAY of its life, and many boosters after 6 months etc. these are the prime years of brain development.
Then you factor in tons of other shit. Pollution, air quality, toxins the kid might be exposed to in his environment... There are so many goddamn factors that all coalesce into a disorder...you canNOT fucking pin it on one thing. Be reasonable. Human biological systems are way too complicated and complex to start popping disorders from something that is arguably bad for you but insignificant. Bodies are pretty resilient and evolution has designed us to withstand a shitload of situations.  I have my theory and it needs an organic chemist to verify, probably other experts that will never work on it as well. I gave up trying to talk to people about it.</p>

<p>That all being said, i still dont like vaccines, but i dont care if others want them. It should be treated like any other medical procedure. You get it if you want it, you dont if you dont.  Informed consent.  I feel the same way about fluoridated water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Untrue... I used to be on both sides of this issue at one time or the other. I think the main problem is both sides are wrong to some degree. Vaccines can&#39;t cause autism. Autism is a psychological disorder and one that has DNA roots. So the argument stops there with scientist and medical doctors when you say vaccines cause autism. It can&#39;t. But what it can do is cause autism like problems. And I think if we changed our perspective to one of a medical epidemic happening with our kids, and we put together some of the good research that has been done on this, we&#39;ll be close to a solution. The problem is there&#39;s been so much fraud and deception occurring, it&#39;s hard to sort through and find good information. Just read and watch this 10 minute video. </p>
