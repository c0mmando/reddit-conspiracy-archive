       I suspect the "Grey aliens" are us from a distant future. Humans that could no longer live on the earth that were able to escape to the past.
They have bigger heads and slimmer bodies because of the dependency on technology and less physical activity along with evolution, they are pale due to the underexposure to the sun and so on.

       I wasn't aware of Dolores Cannon, thank you for bringing her to my awareness. I've listened to a few excepts to get a feel and her message resonates very closely to my truths. I think Dolores would be a perfect character to introduce my mother to so she could have a good reference to the spiritual ideas I share with her.

       I have started to align myself with this theory. It's actually quite comforting to know that we are all one - kind of just looking at ourselves through little mirrors. We are one experiencing life from all angles so we understand what it means to BE.

       There really is nothing above or below oneself, you're
       <em>
        it
       </em>
       . No damnation to be found except the damnation you apply to yourself and no praise except the praise you give to yourself. No expectations what so ever of how you decide to live your life; there's very much still a purpose but it's up to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to remember what it is. 
It's the grandest sandbox that will ever be and we are creators.

       The universe is a virtual reality, and the reason why time slows down when you go fast is that it takes too much processing power to properly render the surroundings fast enough.  That also explains why the speed of light is so fast, but not instantaneous - they couldn't make anything faster without compromising the integrity of the OS.

       If the universe is computer simulation, that ties in perfectly with another one of my theories.
Reality glitches exist, we are unable to comprehend their existence because the universe rewrites itself to exclude the glitch but we are able to feel and sense the difference on a conscious level.

       And if this universe is indeed some sort of highly advanced computer simulation, then the more likely that the bat-shit reptilian theory is true, since it banks on this universe being a highly advanced computer simulation.

       Time is a construct of our minds. I don't think rendering power would be the issue considering just how much is being (in the case of a virtual reality) rendered/processed every single moment; every galaxy, every star, every planet, every peice of matter, every piece of life, every force exerted, every biological process. Every brain in the universe and all the ins and outs that comes with them crazy gizmos hah. I don't see how visual rendering would be the bottleneck of an intelligence with the ability to construct such a 'reality'.

       It would need to re-evaluate the new perspective of all those aforementioned bodies at every unit of distance.  And I think it would make sense if there was a limited amount of dedicated processing power granted to each thing in the universe.

       It's already doing so for every visible (just within our spectrum of vision) object. We don't actually have any idea what things would look like at the speed of light, we all have that image of stretched out white lines whooshing past but that's just what we
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       it would look like, concieved within a mind that can only percieve in three dimensional perspectives. Time is a very subjective thing and the phenomenon of time dilation can also happen for reasons unrelated to the observers speed; such as times of extreamly high stress during a near death experience or even being one of the symptoms of a condition called Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. I personally think we have no idea what would really happen visually at the speed of light. 
Another point I'd just like to mention is the out of body experience and the aparant ability of the person having the experience to teleport to any place they desire instantanously, foregoing the need for the universe to render anything during extreme speeds.

       There are three equally plausible scenarious for this universe that we are in:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every civilization destroys itself or faces mass extinction from an astroid or global volcanic eruptions that cause dust and ash to cover the entire planet, for at least long enough to make all its life extinct, or other fates that make them extinct.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every advanced species that is around long enough to have the capacity to make a simulation where it is just like a real universe decides not to make one, nor few, nor many.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This universe that us Humans are in may very well be some sort of highly advanced artificial computer simulation.

       I believe some events may have been very real such as the worldwide myths of a great flood which
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have been related to a cometary impact during the last ice age around 12000 years ago that caused a rapid melting of large glaciers and subsequently rapid sea level rise which became extremely distorted myth by the time they came to be recorded in any known scripture. But I also agree that a lot of the holy books have a huge amount of metaphorical filler.

       A comet impact wouldn't have even been necessary to cause a great flood around 12000 years ago. Towards the end of the last ice age, massive glacial lakes had formed after centuries of global warming. Then one day, the walls broke and raised the sea levels by &gt; 100 ft overnight.

       Yes that was actually the other aspect of the theory, that warming had begun melting the glaciers and large reservoirs had accumulated atop them and that eventually the banks broke. I recall the hudson bay area coming into discussion with this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, a comet wasn't necessarily involved as a catalyst to the final outcome. Either of which though still makes more sense than a pissed off god and a floating zoo of madness.

       You know the story of the Tower of Babel? I think that is what we're living right now and what we've been living through for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       To cut a long story short, the attempt of translating stories into different languages created the ludicrous societies we live in, most of which are based in religious teachings that are filled with elements missing in translation. For instance, Jesus walking over water could A) be a translation mistake of something like "Jesus traveled over water," meaning that he took a fucking boat; or B) be a metaphor meaning that Jesus could do exceptional things. As it happens in our daily life, things get exaggerated and people end up believing a human being actually walked on water, thus proving he was the incarnation of a god.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the whole "tasting areas of the tongue" thingy. I learned in school that different areas of the tongue perceive different tastes, and I think it's still being taught that way. Well, that was a translation mistake. There's no such thing as tasting areas in the tongue. The whole tongue is capable of perceiving all types of tastes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, it's too late to turn back time. There's billions of people buying into religion and their leaders already are some of the most powerful people on Earth.

       Water is symbolic of emotions in many of the ancient mystery schools, so "Jesus walked on water" could be something closer to "Jesus mastered the control of his emotions rather than being submerged by them".

       That life on earth spread by meteorites and comets carrying  single celled simple organisms, and that the source of these forms of life vary in even greater simplicity to a point far back in time when increasingly complex and unlikely chemical events paved the random path to life.
And that all of this points to the depressing fact that we are without purpose and hold the same value as the matter we stand upon.

       It's trite, but that expressing love is life's purpose. That loving unconditionally is what we're here to learn, even though it's the most difficult to master. And in loving others we love ourselves and vice versa, because they are fundamentally both the same thing. There is no "other."
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this, hating any entity, person, or thing runs contrary to our spiritual evolution. I think the point of reincarnation is to master love in different conditions, or to relearn things we couldn't master in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of why I view those who hate TPTB as ones who are missing the point--it's not that we should condone their actions, but to see that to hate them is to feed them. Not buying into them (literally, especially) is the best thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, I view our time on earth not all too different than playing a video game... except most people actually buy the premise that we are the holographic players and nothing more. I think once the game's up, we reconnect with the original player. And to those who think this places far too much importance on "us," whatever our stuff may be, this isn't to say we aren't a game within a game within a game within a game. We could be layers built atop the other with an object so gargantuan that it cannot be seen from just one vantage point. Our perception is minuscule but it's all we know. I don't know if when we die it's just one layer peeled back of many that still exist.

       There are three equally plausible scenarious for this universe that we are in:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every civilization destroys itself or faces mass extinction from an astroid or global volcanic eruptions that cause dust and ash to cover the entire planet, for at least long enough to make all its life extinct, or other fates that make them extinct.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every advanced species that is around long enough to have the capacity to make a simulation where it is just like a real universe decides not to make one, nor few, nor many.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This universe that us Humans are in may very well be some sort of highly advanced artificial computer simulation.

       That Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot who currently faces the threat of being deposed was acting deliberately badly during the first 16 months of his term (up till now) to distract from whatever weird things the government is doing right now and the plan is/was to have Julie Bishop (Foreign Minister) take his place as second female prime minister in Australia.

       Then you run into problems like beings capable of time travel showing flagrant disrespect for causality by mucking about in their own past.

       Ok, but I can say the opposite (causality becomes increasingly important to respect as it can delete you) with just as much (realistically, more) authority.  Just saying something you have no way of knowing while invalidating physics as we know it doesn't make it true.

      <p>
       Probably.  But even in mainstream accepted cosmology, my opinion is that we'll never find another naturally inhabitable planet (biology is too codependent).  Our highest aspiration becomes "moon base" technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was admitting this could lend itself to grey humans, but carries dark implications for our own future.

       I'm probably wrong or crazy, but I believe we as humans were created to be slaves for another alien race, probably the reptilians, to mine the minerals like gold for example. The Greys are part bio part mechanical creations by the reptilians as well, this is why they are never seen with reproductive organs / clothes / suit. Most human beings have been later freed by some alien beings (either of a different kind or some reptilian) and left by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, the reptilians decided they could still use the slaves for other purposes. Energy mining was decided. They then created another "human race" that is genetically different but close, to continue the exploitation of the humans. There is an ethnic group that believes they are THIS 'chosen people'. Their DNA only being able to be given by their mother. They want to continue exploiting the other humans as slaves, and they somehow believe that energy produced by sex / death / suffering can help them gain power/money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ritual murder of children, orgies with prostitutes and their subsequent execution, torture is believed to happen at certain dates to amplify the energy they can obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie and music industries are there to brainwash the humans. The music that's been produced lately contains a certain "beat / rhythm" that increases the hypnotic effect into obedience.
       <br/>
       Can't prove any of the shit I wrote above

       There are three equally plausible scenarious for this universe that we are in:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every civilization destroys itself or faces mass extinction from an astroid or global volcanic eruptions that cause dust and ash to cover the entire planet, for at least long enough to make all its life extinct, or other fates that make them extinct.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every advanced species that is around long enough to have the capacity to make a simulation where it is just like a real universe decides not to make one, nor few, nor many.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This universe that us Humans are in may very well be some sort of highly advanced artificial computer simulation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       More and a basic rundown on Simulation Theory / Simulation Hypoithesis:

        Camper Killer Commentary #10 "Is Reality Real?"
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And think about this: If this universe that we humans are in is some kind of highly advanced computer simulation, then the more likely that the bat-shit reptilian theory is true, since it banks on this universe being some kind of highly advanced computer simulation.

       I'm only vaguely familiar with Ickes reptilian theory. Does Icke claim this about the Greys?

       Whats ITT:?

      <p>
       Well i like youre idea. Ive come to similar thoughts, myself. Generally, when i speculate on such a thing as aliens, i try to not break any known laws of physics, as much as possible, that is. So my timeline for them comes from before us, not after.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have looked into chimpanzees and bonobos lately. They are two very closely related species. Chimps survive through competition, by getting ahead at the expense of others. They can be selfish, greedy, violent, vengeful, territorial. This works for them, and is how theyve evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonobos are different. Thry are peaceful. They survive by helping eachother out. They are thoughtful, kind, supportive, and giving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive always thought that the chimps sound awefully alot like humans, and thr bonobos seem to be very similar in personality to the gods of ancient times (thr nice ones).
      </p>
      <p>
       So why couldnt these "aliens" just be another branch off the hominid tree?

       Sounds like an even more extreme version of the breakaway civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Briefly: technologically advanced and philosophically similar humans began working together in secret for their progeny, more or less leaving normal humans behind.  With benevolent authoritarianism they have progressed over the years genetically and technologically.

       The current state of the world can be explained either by belief they are using mankind to their ends or attempting to save mankind from themselves.
