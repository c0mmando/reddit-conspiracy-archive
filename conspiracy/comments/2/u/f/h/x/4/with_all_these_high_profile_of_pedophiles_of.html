    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s nice you and <a href="/r/FutzBucket">/r/FutzBucket</a> seem concerned about Catholic kids, but the Mexican kids who disappear are very often prey for people who steal their body parts and AFAIK Catholics aren&#39;t known for doing this.  If you&#39;re referring to Catholic priests who have the reputation for molesting kids it would behoove you to expand your view of who pedophiles are.  They include: </p>

<p>child pornographers - some of the worst of which are Russian producers of child snuff films</p>

<p>politicians and the world elite</p>

<p>Boyscout and Girlscout leaders </p>

<p>Protestant clergy and youth pastors</p>

<p>Jewish rabbis</p>

<p>Orthodox/Hassidic Jewish school teachers</p>

<p>Big Brother and Big Sister volunteers</p>

<p>public school teachers - gym teachers</p>

<p>school nurses</p>

<p>pediatricians</p>

<p>child psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists</p>

<p>school guidance counselors</p>

<p>Hollywood studios/directors, producers and actors</p>

<p>child beauty pageant organizers and parents who enter their kids in these events</p>

<p>parents</p>

<p>aunts and uncles </p>

<p>Pedophiles are everywhere.  The Catholic priests were at fault for what they did but you don&#39;t see or hear much about the rest of them in the msn.  Why do you think that is?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet your comment suggests 1) the first ones to put the blame on are Catholics, and 2) from that assumption it&#39;s easy to infer you were implying <em>Catholic pedophile priests</em> are likely the guilty ones.  It&#39;s fashionable and easy to make snide jokes about pedophile priests that reflect anti-Catholic attitudes, yet expose a limited view of reality.  It&#39;s gotten tired and redundant and boring.</p>

<p>IMO, they don&#39;t need to hide it. The fact that they have indoctrinated people into believing everything they say as moral foundations for their society is more than enough.</p>
