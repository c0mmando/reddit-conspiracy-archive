       That is an average of 5.8 threads per hour continuously over the past week, or about 1 thread every 10 minutes.

       <strong>
        Limiting Factors:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit's searchability has "soft limits" meaning at a certain point it will refuse to return any additional results.  The first time I queried the site it returned 979 unique threads, when I tried again 2 minutes later it returned 986.  I suspect the actual amount is much higher but reddit will only serve a certain amount of results per search.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This only accounts for the word "vaccine" (or vaccines which contains the word vaccine within it), not vaccinate, vaccination, etc.

       <strong>
        Critical Questions:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Question of Quantity: Why is there such a massive push for pro-vaccination submissions on the site?  The extreme push for such content has seemingly appeared overnight about ~three weeks ago and due to no actual event that has recently occurred.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Question of Support: Why is it almost guaranteed that every day there will be a new vaccine-related submission to appear on the front page of
         <a href="/r/all">
          /r/all
         </a>
         ?  On a site that despises "reposts" with such vehement, who are the thousands of people supposedly upvoting these submissions multiple times every day, and why are those questioning it being downvoted?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Question of Timing:  Why did this all happen to begin just a week before the Disney measles outbreak, which has sparked nationwide outrage and fear, leading to
         <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/02/04/49657/state-lawmakers-propose-ditching-personal-vaccine/">

       You think any other generations were any better? People have been blindly believing whatever the news tells them for a long time. People in 1950 were just as gullible as they are now. It's just now with the wealth of communication nowadays it's much easier to see the whole picture (the reason gov approval ratings are so low)

       Can't have anyone questioning whether or not pharma corporations are ensuring vaccines are
       <em>
        truly safe
       </em>
       (hint, that's a negative, good buddy), or they might stumble onto these two very interesting recent pieces of news:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/merck-whistleblowers_b_5881914.html">
          Merck Commits Mass Fraud on MMR Vaccine Application
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">
          Federal Vaccine Court Awards Millions in Multiple Separate Cases of Vaccine-Linked Autism
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I suspect that these
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       just be a tad inconvenient for the "vaccines are 100% effective 100% of the time and have zero side effects ever" crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, if you point out that these pharma companies have been known, time and time again, to be criminally negligent at providing safe products, you're just a
       <em>
        crazy anti-vaxxer
       </em>
       (hurr durr).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I mostly object to corporate vaccines, since they are easily shown to not care about safety, to the point of defrauding the CDC to pass ineffective and unsafe vaccines. Obviously vaccines are useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blindly pretending that corporations who have been shown to commit mass fraud in order to pass unsafe and ineffective vaccines is pure insanity, and is absolutely the height of anti-science.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I posted the above in a response to another comment on a different thread, but I personally think that the current propaganda push about never questioning any vaccine or the corporations who make them (and commit fraud to pass their unsafe vaccines) is all about making sure people never see stories like the two I posted above.

       And you nailed it!  I love that all the attention is on the people who do or don't support vaccines and not on whether these companies are criminally liable for providing sub-par products to the public.  Propaganda indeed.

        I found this from today pretty interesting.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the key points:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Establishment media forces took the Fed’s message one step further, hitting Paul with some rather harsh and one sided pieces, always a sign that the shot fired is hitting the mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this fight takes place, Fed President Janet Yellen is deep in concentration as she attempts to unwind
       <strong>
        artificial stimulus, a program never before tried and tested that now has weak market forces apparently addicted to the high
       </strong>
       . Certain hedge fund market participants are closely watching to see if free markets can once again operate or if the patient is required to have an economic sedative ease him into a coma on a permanent basis.
       <strong>
        The concern is that this throws off the supply and demand balance and debilitates normal cross market correlations, resulting in an abrupt flash crash that very few can defend against
       </strong>
       . In other words, Yellen is attempting what is likely to be a major accomplishment and
       <strong>
        might not want the world watching the second by second details
       </strong>
       , which could include market manipulation techniques never before witnessed."

       Ever since that Disneyland outbreak it's become the hot button issue for politicians. The left is pushing the issue of vaccines into people's heads to discredit their opponents and get votes. Every election season has this shit that all of a sudden becomes the most important thing on voters minds (because if you get voters to focus on that they ignore the rest). You don't need the CIA to create propaganda, put some ideas in idiots heads and they create it for you.

        Why is there such a massive push for pro-vaccination submissions on the site? The extreme push for such content has seemingly appeared overnight about ~three weeks ago and due to no actual event that has recently occurred.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Easy. Unilateral action on immigration. Introduced threats to the native herd. That's it. Infectious disease don't just manifest in unvaccinated people, it's introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The threat vector from disease importation is going to expand greatly. Insurers need the PR push to hedge against claims from these new threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically a zoo would vaccinate and quarantine a new animal to make sure there was no infectious disease aboard that animal that would threaten the rest of the zoo animals. In the human world, illegals are not subject to such reasonable procedures and the native population must be prepped to reduce incidences (and claims for needed treatment) of disease due to transmission of infections from immigrants from every corner of the globe.

       There was a massive outbreak in Ohio last year, much bigger than the Disneyland one, but there was barely a mention in the news.  There was also a very large one in Quebec recently in a largely vaccinated population that only got some limited Canadian attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, this is not just a "current topic"  they've chosen to massively blow this outbreak out of proportion because initial reports suggest there was a decent number of unvaccinated people infected (they don't report the outbreaks of mostly vaccinated people) and the whole "fear factor" of a large public place like Disneyland.

       I recall the Ohio one, it didn't stay in the news cycle as long because it was pretty contained. Disneyland one, however, keeps getting into the news as new developments happen.

       If a group of people wanted to, ahem say fix this for the good guys, it wouldn't be hard to ff it by adding x2 or so reposts so it gets to the point that it would be so obvious that nobody could deny that it is happening. I highly do not recommend such actions, but it's definitely a counter.

       Could you explain why?  I'm just asking why this seems to all of a sudden be pushed down our throats on reddit on a daily basis, I'm not making any claims.  The Disneyland outbreak is not the cause as this daily front page vaccine thing started happening about a week before the outbreak.

       Reddit always goes through phases such is the nature of a community. Every one wants in on the bandwagon. Eventually something just picks up steam and it snowballs. We were on a vaccine kick about a year ago. It cycles around. If you've been on reddit long enough you'll realize this.
