<p><strong>Limiting Factors:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reddit&#39;s searchability has &quot;soft limits&quot; meaning at a certain point it will refuse to return any additional results.  The first time I queried the site it returned 979 unique threads, when I tried again 2 minutes later it returned 986.  I suspect the actual amount is much higher but reddit will only serve a certain amount of results per search.</p></li>
<li><p>This only accounts for the word &quot;vaccine&quot; (or vaccines which contains the word vaccine within it), not vaccinate, vaccination, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critical Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Question of Quantity: Why is there such a massive push for pro-vaccination submissions on the site?  The extreme push for such content has seemingly appeared overnight about ~three weeks ago and due to no actual event that has recently occurred.    </p></li>
<li><p>Question of Support: Why is it almost guaranteed that every day there will be a new vaccine-related submission to appear on the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>?  On a site that despises &quot;reposts&quot; with such vehement, who are the thousands of people supposedly upvoting these submissions multiple times every day, and why are those questioning it being downvoted?</p></li>
<li><p>Question of Timing:  Why did this all happen to begin just a week before the Disney measles outbreak, which has sparked nationwide outrage and fear, leading to <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/02/04/49657/state-lawmakers-propose-ditching-personal-vaccine/">stories such as this.</a></p></li>

<p>You think any other generations were any better? People have been blindly believing whatever the news tells them for a long time. People in 1950 were just as gullible as they are now. It&#39;s just now with the wealth of communication nowadays it&#39;s much easier to see the whole picture (the reason gov approval ratings are so low)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t have anyone questioning whether or not pharma corporations are ensuring vaccines are <em>truly safe</em> (hint, that&#39;s a negative, good buddy), or they might stumble onto these two very interesting recent pieces of news:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/merck-whistleblowers_b_5881914.html">Merck Commits Mass Fraud on MMR Vaccine Application</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">Federal Vaccine Court Awards Millions in Multiple Separate Cases of Vaccine-Linked Autism</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect that these <em>might</em> just be a tad inconvenient for the &quot;vaccines are 100% effective 100% of the time and have zero side effects ever&quot; crowd.</p>

<p>Of course, if you point out that these pharma companies have been known, time and time again, to be criminally negligent at providing safe products, you&#39;re just a <em>crazy anti-vaxxer</em> (hurr durr).</p>

<p>For the record, I mostly object to corporate vaccines, since they are easily shown to not care about safety, to the point of defrauding the CDC to pass ineffective and unsafe vaccines. Obviously vaccines are useful.</p>

<p>Blindly pretending that corporations who have been shown to commit mass fraud in order to pass unsafe and ineffective vaccines is pure insanity, and is absolutely the height of anti-science.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I posted the above in a response to another comment on a different thread, but I personally think that the current propaganda push about never questioning any vaccine or the corporations who make them (and commit fraud to pass their unsafe vaccines) is all about making sure people never see stories like the two I posted above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/fed-rand-paul/">I found this from today pretty interesting.</a></p>

<p>One of the key points:</p>

<p>&quot;Establishment media forces took the Fed’s message one step further, hitting Paul with some rather harsh and one sided pieces, always a sign that the shot fired is hitting the mark.</p>

<p>As this fight takes place, Fed President Janet Yellen is deep in concentration as she attempts to unwind <strong>artificial stimulus, a program never before tried and tested that now has weak market forces apparently addicted to the high</strong>. Certain hedge fund market participants are closely watching to see if free markets can once again operate or if the patient is required to have an economic sedative ease him into a coma on a permanent basis. <strong>The concern is that this throws off the supply and demand balance and debilitates normal cross market correlations, resulting in an abrupt flash crash that very few can defend against</strong>. In other words, Yellen is attempting what is likely to be a major accomplishment and <strong>might not want the world watching the second by second details</strong>, which could include market manipulation techniques never before witnessed.&quot;</p>

<p>...Hm?</p>

<p>Easy. Unilateral action on immigration. Introduced threats to the native herd. That&#39;s it. Infectious disease don&#39;t just manifest in unvaccinated people, it&#39;s introduced.</p>

<p>The threat vector from disease importation is going to expand greatly. Insurers need the PR push to hedge against claims from these new threats.</p>

<p>Typically a zoo would vaccinate and quarantine a new animal to make sure there was no infectious disease aboard that animal that would threaten the rest of the zoo animals. In the human world, illegals are not subject to such reasonable procedures and the native population must be prepped to reduce incidences (and claims for needed treatment) of disease due to transmission of infections from immigrants from every corner of the globe. </p>

<p>So no, this is not just a &quot;current topic&quot;  they&#39;ve chosen to massively blow this outbreak out of proportion because initial reports suggest there was a decent number of unvaccinated people infected (they don&#39;t report the outbreaks of mostly vaccinated people) and the whole &quot;fear factor&quot; of a large public place like Disneyland.</p>

<p>How many Ebola threads were there, when we had, what, <em>two</em> actual cases in the United States? Now you have a much bigger outbreak of a far more infectious disease - and one where we have a highly-effective vaccine (95%+) that <em>people refuse to take</em>.</p>
