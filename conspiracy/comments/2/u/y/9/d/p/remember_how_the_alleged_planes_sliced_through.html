       <strong>
        530 miles per hour.
       </strong>
       All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed."

      <p>
       <em>
        So, lets go on what we have. The last known altitude reported for AA77 was 7000 feet. And travelled 33 miles in 5 minutes. Thats 6.6 miles per minute or 396 knots (Update: FDR data shows 325 knots average airspeed. 9/11 Commission Report is inaccurate). Then the aircraft began a 330 degree spiraling dive, leveling at 2200 feet to accelerate to the Pentagon while continuing descent. He started the maneuver at 7000 feet, 396 knots, dove almost 5000 feet within a 330 degree turn and covered 5 miles in about 3 minutes. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the final impact speed was 530 mph.

       Planes may well have been involved, but the holes in the Trade towers that you saw on the television (fashioned to appear like aircraft silhouettes) were created by something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to popular belief, the laws of physics were not temporarily suspended on 9/11/2001, and flimsy aluminium plane wings could not have sliced clean through through those WTC structural steel girders on that day.

       The wings are triangular in shape.  The wings wouldn't all hit the building at the same time.  The part of the wings that would hit the building is the area nearest the fuselage.  Is it possible that this caused the wings to shear off backwards?  Seems entirely plausible to me.  In fact this seems far more plausible than thinking the wings are just going to stay on the plane.

       Show us reinforced steel being cut by lightweight aluminum plane parts.  While you're at it, show us damage that occurs far after the alleged impact.

       As an engineer id like to add a little bit here, steel will always cut through aluminium because of aluminium's physical properties
      </p>
      <p>
       *Density, ρ:kg m−3&gt; Alu = 2700 Steel = 7800
      </p>
      <p>
       *Young modulus, E:N mm−2&gt; Alu = 70000 Steel = 210000
      </p>
      <p>
       *Shear modulus, G:N mm−2&gt; Alu = 27000 Steel = 81000
      </p>
      <p>
       *Poisson ratio, ν&gt; Alu = 0.33 Steel = 0.3
      </p>
      <p>
       *Coefficient of linear thermal expansion, α:K−1&gt; Alu = 23 × 10−6 Steel = 12 × 10−6
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://aluminium.matter.org.uk/content/html/eng/default.asp?catid=217&amp;amp;pageid=2144417130">
        Source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats of interest is the shear modulus because this indicates when the metal is essentially cut and as you can see steel is three times as strong (although i doubt this was the case; Aircraft use some fancy aluminium alloys, still over twice as strong mind you)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with the aircraft being the moving body this is negated by newtons third law "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object." Therefore even if you were to calculate what was going to happen and mistakenly stated the building was flying at 450km/h you would still have the same result.
      </p>
      <p>
       inb4/ Obviously if you were to do that your value for inertia will be completely fucked
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: formatting/sorry if you dont like my correct spelling of Aluminium, hehe

       That's cool.  Steel IS stronger than aluminum.  I was just commenting because the previous poster was trying to make a case for aluminum being able to cut through steel if the planes are flying

       You wouldn't believe how many people don't understand this, including on this subreddit.

       When flying at 500mph even air resistance (at ground level) is enough to tear a Boeing's aluminium aircraft wings apart. Yet people here think those same wings would shear through massive steel support structures? Insane.

This guy was telling me to take what debunking911 says as the indiscriminate truth when I was linking to a factual data dump of the events and everything involved before and after; hell the link I used was to the information regarding the twin towers designed ability to be struck by cruise speed aircraft

       I feel like you're missing what I'm saying here. The wings wouldn't just stop. They would fold inwards, lowering the horizontal profile of the plane. They wouldn't just slice through because the Pentagon was made of much stronger materials.

       if you push hard enough they do post a pic of a body from the pentagon, the problem is people were indeed killed in those offices. i have never seen a picture of an aircraft seat, with or without a body, ever.

       I've seen pics of a plane engine and other plane debris in the pentagon. It made it a good ways in the building. The flight path could be done. Just not by a rookie pilot.

       I will admit they were not in their seats. I was mistaken there. Regardless, there is plenty of identifiable plane debris that matches the 757.

       Where are the wings tho? Wings fold upon entry into concrete pentagon, leave small entry hole. Wings slice right through steel beams tho...? People, OPEN YOUR MIND. You all want to complain about hive mind mentality with vaccines, yet you all wanna say right away "no plane theory is disinfo 101"
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you say that?! Don't be closed minded. I don't understand you guys. I think the pentagon was struck by a global hawk drone. The towers, I believe we're hit with two remotely controlled aircraft, however I am not so naive to push arguments and ideas to the side because "they are just too crazy". How do any of you KNOW there were planes. I believe there were... But I'd be stupid to close myself to the possibility that it wasn't actually planes

       There were several pieces of easily identifiable debris that matched the exact model of plane that crashed into the Pentagon. How would a hawk drone do that? On top of that, the crash doesn't remotely resemble an explosion or even a crash from such a small aircraft.

       So why didn't it cause the pentagon to cave in if it was such a large hole? Why were windows directly above the "entry hole" undamaged. How was a book visible right next to the gaping hole, yet were to believe that jet fuel vaporized rolls Royce engines body's and other plane materials, desks in the building, but not a book.

       No there wasn't.  Pentagon police officer roosevelt roberts proves this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google his name.  All the witnesses to the day prove that plane didnt hit the building.  A north side flyby of the gas station means you havent seen all the information.

       Not when all the witnesses say the same thing!  They cant all be wrong in the same way.  They all say and testified essentially....that the plane was north of the gas station.  They all drew on photographs where the plane went.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didnt even look.  I could say that two of the witnesses are pentagon police officers and it could be a lie!  You wouldnt know any better!  Doesnt bother you that i can manipulate/lie to you or others with this information and youre just too lazy to confirm for yourself?

       He is not a witness to the plane and where it flew.  He is not a witness to the North of Citgo flyby.
      </p>
      <p>
       The north flyby proves Lloyd couldn't been hit by a light pole.  The light poles are on the SOUTH side.  That doesn't fit the story.  He couldn't have been hit when all the other witnesses say the plane flew north......do you understand?

       If you know enough about LLoyd, you should know enough about the entire story.  You should know what Lloyd himself said about the event.  You're either playing dumb or you've heard it and don't want to mention it.

       how come most of your posts are nonsensical bullshit about northrup, but all of a sudden you become coherent when trying to say a plane hit the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       what little footage has been released shows a missile(like) object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people say its the fuselage without the wings, but its before impact (although since the speed at which the plane supposedly approached would have torn them off anyway), you can see how people MIGHT believe that, but they would be wrong) .. there were no wings on the ground
      </p>

       very little debris and none of it large enough to be from a crashed jetliner

       Because I'm trying to get the truth out without getting my head blown off. A plane hit the pentagon. It was flown by a computer guidence system without any human assistance. I don't care if you believe me either. Don't expect a reply if you're going to be rude again.

       If anyone honestly looks at all the available evidence in regards what happened at the Pentagon and still believes the government official conspiracy theory, then one would have to conclude that person is mentally deficient.

       There is of course going to be paid government ad men pushing the official fantasy story, that has to be believed on pure faith alone, this is to be expected, but a genuine person simply can not believe the US governments version of events.

       The simpletons who can't understand the impact into the towers/Pentagon imparts the same force and reaction to the planes standing still and being hit by the buildings at 500mph.  Swung just like a baseball bat.  Would all planes react identically in this fashion?  No reflected plane material outwards?  Absolutely none seen in any photographs or videos of any of the 3 alleged impacts.  Why is that?  The science doesn't jive bro.

       It's an absolutely fair comparison.  The alleged impacts that day went against the basic rules of motion.  Steel towers magically collapsed.  A plane, for th r first time ever, simply vaporized.  It allegedly struck steel light poles, didn't shear the wings off, they simply disappeared.  This should be discussed until the truth of this event is fully in the open.  We've been lied to for far too long.

       When the planes hit the buildings the wings damaged the aluminum sheeting and glass of the exterior of the buildings. What the wings did when they hit steel is a differnt conversation. The exterior damage of the Pentagon compared to the Towers is the discussion and why the wholes were different. 
Planes hit the towers. They weren't flown by human pilots and they didn't cause the pulverization of the towers or building 7.

       because wtc1 and 2 were an girder mesh/lattice and the pentagon was not? it helps if you use a smaller plane or a missile though. the trouble with the missile theory: is that pentagon big red fireball indicative of high explosive or of fuel? being inexperienced in such things i can't really say but if you look at this for example

       it is more of a greyish explosion. which leads me to what hit the pentagon being a plane, albeit a much smaller plane than we have been told.

       That's cool.  Steel IS stronger than aluminum.  I was just commenting because the previous poster was trying to make a case for aluminum being able to cut through steel if the planes are flying

       The wings are triangular in shape.  The wings wouldn't all hit the building at the same time.  The part of the wings that would hit the building is the area nearest the fuselage.  Is it possible that this caused the wings to shear off backwards?  Seems entirely plausible to me.  In fact this seems far more plausible than thinking the wings are just going to stay on the plane.

       When flying at 500mph even air resistance (at ground level) is enough to tear a Boeing's aluminium aircraft wings apart. Yet people here think those same wings would shear through massive steel support structures? Insane.

        So, lets go on what we have. The last known altitude reported for AA77 was 7000 feet. And travelled 33 miles in 5 minutes. Thats 6.6 miles per minute or 396 knots (Update: FDR data shows 325 knots average airspeed. 9/11 Commission Report is inaccurate). Then the aircraft began a 330 degree spiraling dive, leveling at 2200 feet to accelerate to the Pentagon while continuing descent. He started the maneuver at 7000 feet, 396 knots, dove almost 5000 feet within a 330 degree turn and covered 5 miles in about 3 minutes. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the final impact speed was 530 mph.

       When the planes hit the buildings the wings damaged the aluminum sheeting and glass of the exterior of the buildings. What the wings did when they hit steel is a differnt conversation. The exterior damage of the Pentagon compared to the Towers is the discussion and why the wholes were different. 
Planes hit the towers. They weren't flown by human pilots and they didn't cause the pulverization of the towers or building 7.
