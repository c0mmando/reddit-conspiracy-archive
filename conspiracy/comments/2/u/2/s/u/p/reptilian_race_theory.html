       Is David Icke just referring to the Zionists/Jews when he is referring to the Reptilian Race? Or does he literally believe that these people are Reptilians?

       Others here told me he was attacked for being anti-semitic, so he intentionally switched to the Reptilian label. I think he's being tongue-in-cheek about it, knowing it makes him look "crazy", while getting a dig at the "cold blooded".

       I read one of his books recently and while it did make a lot of sense it gave the impression that he's not just using reptile as a label. He actually says they are interdimensional creatures who shape shift etc.

       It may be, but the way he presented it very much gave the impression that it wasn't a metaphor. But maybe that's what he's doing to protect himself. He even goes into stories about epiphanies and astral projection and stuff like that.

       If you mean Icke in the last minute or so, I believe it looks awkward because he is holding a laser pointer or a pen in his hand.

       <em>
        Edited to add, but Icke has also stated in the past, that he has a crippled hand (I don't know if it is the left or the right) and has a problem to write on a keyboard.

       It's hard to say, he starts his book Children of the Matrix, by saying "if you cannot entertain the idea of aliens, other dimensions, or interplanetary travel, then this probably isn't the book for you" (obviously I'm paraphrasing).

       I believe that he believes. Who am I to judge. His back story shows how he went from sportscaster to where he is now. He didn't choose to become aware of what he believes to be the truth. Its a very interesting story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up his interview with Jimmy Church on Fade to Black last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think regardless of how right or wrong he is he has good intentions. He was definitely right about the pedo stuff. We may never find out if he is right about the reptilians or if he has just been misled by negative entities on a quest to discredit him.

       I think he is confused with his "visions" that he bases everything from. We all have a "reptilian" brain, it controls flight or fight response. It's what takes over in a blinding fit of rage and tells you to kill or be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that allow their reptilian brain to control their emotions seem to make it into positions of power, naturally. I think in a very convoluted way, that is what he is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that they are necessarily shape shifting reptilians, but allow their reptilian brain to control their decision making, which generally always is in one's own self interest.

       After watching hours and hours of his lectures on YouTube and reading thousands and thousands of words by him on the subject, I'd say he literally believes in the Reptilians/human hybrids/inter-dimensional beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has so much to say about that one subject and has done so much
       <em>
        research
       </em>
       on it. When David Icke refers to Zionist Israel, he is pretty open about it anyway, he doesn't pussy foot around much on the subject.

       No, it is not in reference to Hebrew Jewish Israelites nor is it in reference to Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists. In all likelihood he does not believe in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       His modus operandi is to propagate false information mixed with a bit of true information to gain a following; he works for someone - could be himself to the end of expanding his bank account or could be military intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides this utterly absurd reptile/annunaki disinformation (which by the way he largely ripped off from Zecharia Sitchin, whose translations of ancient Sumerian tablets are dismissed by all other experts on Sumerian language as being completely inaccurate), it is easy to tell Icke's work is disingenuous as is evidenced by his omission of the verifiable global rulers - the group that has historically been banned from over 80 countries, has fomented wars, assassinations and national subversion, founded the intelligence communities and the Bilderberg group and other roundtable groups, oversees presidents, prime ministers and heads of State, are masters of class warfare, control all economies and banks including the federal reserve, and control mainstream as well as much of the alternative media. There is no excuse for him to have a gap as big as that in his resume and the reptile disinformation only adds more confirmation that he is a charlatan.

       Pretty sure he believes it. He just throws conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory out there to cover all the bases. That way, when one turns out to be right, he can go "I called it!" and gain more viewers/readers/suckers.

       Isn't the earth flat? I'd say if people think evolution is our reason for existence , then look up into the sky &amp; use your freaking imagination . All the limitless possibilities &amp; potential out there, but we are content in following these fucks who hijacked truth &amp; manipulate humanity .
Stay safely inside your four walled world ,never question outside the box. Peace. sss..sss.sss

       Reptoids , why the hell not .
 If supposedly life here evolved from simple organisms &amp; today's man is the current peak of our said evolution . Who are you or any scientist to say how life would evolve under different circumstances throughout the universe . 
That's what.

       Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. (‭Revelation‬ ‭16‬:‭13‬ NIV)
      </p>
      <p>
       They are real. They are not a race. Yet again, satan and his followers attempt to deceive. They are in fact unclean spirits in people.

       It's hard to say, he starts his book Children of the Matrix, by saying "if you cannot entertain the idea of aliens, other dimensions, or interplanetary travel, then this probably isn't the book for you" (obviously I'm paraphrasing).

       I read one of his books recently and while it did make a lot of sense it gave the impression that he's not just using reptile as a label. He actually says they are interdimensional creatures who shape shift etc.
