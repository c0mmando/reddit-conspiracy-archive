They have been convinced that they would be one person. They have also been conditioned to associate conspiracy theorists as lone wolfs. </p>

<p>Its isolation that the masses fear. Its why there isnt much progress in any real theater of this mind set. Until something happens to them then its a fringe thing. </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the rational explanation is what is called a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. </p>

<p>I have no opinion on chemtrails. </p>

<p>I live in a country where tap water is not medicated, and I think it shouldn&#39;t be, people can take their medications when they need them. </p>

<p>When it comes to the Twins, however, simply stating - like the official account does - its collapse was natural and not helped along by a vast amount of energy as proven by the fact that it did collapse, is not a rational explanation. It must be explained why the &quot;virtual work&quot; keeping it up disappeared, vanished into thin air, allowing it to collapse straight down through and out of itself, offering only token resistance (&quot;friction&quot;). Explosives/cutter charges are the most rational explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or how about 2 planes knocking down 3 skyscrapers, all in a symmetric near-freefall collapse. Durrrrr!</p>

<p>It&#39;s because people generally don&#39;t trust their own reason. Rather, they are convinced <em>socially</em>. And when all your friends are laughing at the &quot;truthers&quot;, you&#39;re gonna laugh too... without ever examining the evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, it took my Russian friends laughing at CNN before I considered... &quot;Is it possible this is propaganda?&quot; Just that seed of doubt was enough; logic did the rest. I have a master&#39;s degree in mechanical engineering, and it still took that social element.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to take a stab at some of these:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you convince yourself that nothing is going on behind the scenes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t, I know there is plenty behind the scenes. That said, I need adequate evidence to be convinced of an specific thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When there is a magical bullet that kills the POTUS, how does that not draw your attention to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of my research indicates the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theorists are not taking into account specific factors in the assassination, specifically the seating arrangements in the car. I&#39;d expand more but it has been a while since I did much reading on the subject. I could be convinced something was up with the right evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the jet fuel is so hot that it melts 100+ stories of steel and is a molten pool for months later, yet they find the paper passport of the &quot;terrorist&quot; on the sidewalk, how do you stay asleep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is well tread territory, the steel didn&#39;t have to melt, just be weakened. I won&#39;t go into all the details of the theory most engineers have behind the collapse, as this is not the intent of my post, but I will say I have been given far more reason to believe the academic community then the conspiracy community regarding this. The fact that no one in the 9/11 truth has bothered constructing a model of the collapse is a red flag for me, expecially when AE911 truth brags about having 2000 engineers supporting them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every single president has been related to one another. Why doesn&#39;t this raise any suspicions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t know anything about this, but then again I&#39;m not American. Seem a little far-fetched/sensationalized. That said, I&#39;d like to see some evidence, I&#39;ve got no problem believing those in positions of power work to secure that power for generations to come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why it is that only some planes, sometimes, leave trails of cloud behind them on a clear day? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look up basic weather mechanics. Chemtrails are possibly the most laughable conspiracy out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are so many questions not allowed to be asked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one I have ever met, conspiracy believer or not, thinks this is the case. The problem I have, is that false information is hurtful to the truth, whether it is against the government or not. Chemtrail accusations hurt the cause of people who want to fight corruption of political offices, overbearing police forces or corporate violation of rights. The goal should be to ask questions, find the answers then ask more questions. Unfortunately, with many theories, people seem to ask questions, get answers, deny answers and then continue asking the same, already answered questions for decades. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I want to know is, how do none of these things wake you up? Explain to me how you can ignore them and go on with your life as if everything is OK?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am awake and everything is not O.K.. Fucked up shit is happening every day; corruption, human rights violation, restriction of personal freedoms, overbearing surveillance. Just because I don&#39;t think there is sufficient evidence for 9/11 being an inside job or chemtrails does not mean I sit here happily eating everything the government feeds me.</p>

<p>In fact, I would argue that my skepticism goes further than many here. I am skeptical not only of the government but of all sources of information, Including natural news, globalresearch, infowars and other conspiracy standbys. Their manipulation of information is just as obvious and shameless as those from Monsanto or the U.S. government. </p>

<p>I guarantee that no matter what I say, I&#39;ll attract the shill accusations because of my post history. But I thought I should at least throw down my input, as I felt your post was attacking an idea that doesn&#39;t really exist in the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a teenager who learned that there were alternate explanations to events that I had never heard. Someone showed me Loose Change (this was back shortly after it came out), and I believed it. Like many teenagers, I think the idea of knowing something that the majority of people didn&#39;t, (&quot;being awake&quot;) appealed to me. I found myself looking for me sources that confirmed what I had seen on loose change, and I tumbled down the rabbit hole a bit.</p>

<p>As I got older and learned more about the scientific method in late high school and early university, I found myself revisiting my initial beliefs and finding that they often weren&#39;t supported by much professional research. I read about what went into the analysis of 9/11 and things like vaccines and learned that my standards of evidence were biased toward the side I perceived as &quot;anti-authority&quot;. When I readjusted my perspective, I realized that the research being performed by scientific organizations and the information resulting from it was often far superior when compared to many conspiratorial sources. </p>

<p>Now, I still find myself very interested in conspiracies, although more out of interest rather than actual belief. I like challenging ideas because I believe it is important, and despite the near constant personal attacks and shill accusations I tend to get here, I think participating helps me to learn more and further explore my own beliefs and biases.</p>

<p>While we are on the topic of dishonesty, let&#39;s review your honesty in this thread:</p>

<p>1- You create a thread asking people who don&#39;t believe what you believe to explain themselves.</p>

<p>2- I respond with my own reasoning, remaining completely civil and trying to be understanding with those who challenge me. (until provoked of course, but you&#39;ll notice my intentions to remain civil to those who offered me the same courtesy)</p>

<p>3- You respond to my comments, which you specifically asked for, with insults and shill accusations.</p>

<p>You have effectively demonstrated your dishonesty. You lied about your intentions in creating this thread. You were not asking honest questions, you were throwing insults to an enemy you probably hoped would remain a figment of your imagination. When I actually appeared to defend my views, you became aggressive and condescending. </p>

<p>Your intention in creating the thread was obvious from the start. You were looking to punch a strawman while claiming to be asking honest questions.</p>

<p>You say I can manifest my own reality through sheer force of will. Okay that sounds awesome. But then, when I dig for more answers, that just seems to mean &quot;Work hard, plan well, organize a solid team, be sure your finances are straight, keep working hard, watch those sales numbers, cut expenses, put in a few all-nighters...&quot; which is not anything new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all. &quot;The New Age Movement&quot; was started by the government/CIA back in the 60s. So you can assume they probably mix in about 25% truth with 75% bullshit. (Listen to Stewart Swerdlow).</p>

<p>Second of all, no it&#39;s not just &quot;work hard, plan well, we create our own luck&quot;. </p>

<p>What it really boils down to is what you believe. If you truly believe things are going to happen and have no fear that they won&#39;t things will happen exactly how you believe they will. Your entire reality will unfold exactly in the way you believe it will. But believing something with every fiber of your being isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds. You have to arrange other aspects of your reality in such a way that it allows you to believe whatever it is you want to believe.</p>

<p>For instance, you can&#39;t just say &quot;I believe I can fly&quot;. Because your subconscious doesn&#39;t really  know how to put that together. In the back of your mind, you don&#39;t really believe you can fly because you have no idea how that would work. So you need to research some metaphysical shit so your brain can understand a way for you to believe what you want to believe.</p>

<p>So yes, some of it <strong>is</strong> work hard and plan well. But it&#39;s not just that.</p>

<p>&quot;Be the change you want to see in the world&quot;<br/>
&quot;The power of positive thinking&quot;<br/>
&quot;Where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re only limited by your imagination&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s all true.</p>

<p>The fact is, NIST&#39;s data has been reviewed and accepted by numerous reputable organizations, but the AE911 truth representatives don&#39;t want you to know that.

<p>Nevertheless, I did not intend to get into yet another NIST debate. I&#39;m happy the folks at AE911 truth are going to be putting their money where their mouth is after all these years. We&#39;ll see what they come up with and how it sits with the engineering community as a whole. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>But here is the thing. It is up to Purdue, Bazant and NIST to produce a model, because it is <em>their</em> theory about a &quot;new phenomenon&quot; that is being challenged by &quot;troofers&quot;. </p>

<p>What kind of model is AE911 supposed to produce? One that collapses? It would require additional energy to overcome W[p] from Bazant/Verdures &#39;07 equation 6. It would require a cleverly hidden mechanism, explosives, cutter charges, a huge weight on the roof, g forces way beyond 20 m/s² - otherwise, it would at worst topple, tip or tilt. Then it would be called a bad model, because it&#39;s &quot;not like the real thing&quot;.</p>

<p>One that does not, or if at all, only partially, collapse, which is what would normally have happened? Then it would be called a bad model as well, that they made it &quot;too strong&quot;, &quot;uneconomic&quot;, &quot;unrealistic&quot;, although, in reality, gravitational-driven progressive total top-down collapse <em>does not occur</em>, has never been observed, never been predicted or thought to be a possibility (except for Tolkien&#39;s Barad-Dûr), and caught engineers and architects world-wide unawares. </p>

<p>No, the way you try to set this up makes it impossible for AE911 to win (I&#39;m not a fan, really not, and I don&#39;t understand why they even try to make a model for these very reasons) the argument. </p>

<p>What <em>should</em> be a red flag for you is that the models NIST and Purdue offered are <em>unscientific</em> in the sense that they are black box. Their data is not open. It is like having a huge wire go from your wall socket to your &quot;free energy overunity machine&quot;, to, uh, &quot;take measurements&quot; or some such.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a skeptic for a long time, until I understood why it is that not even a house of cards progressively collapses from top to bottom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A domino chain reaction for example? Or the examples for building collapses given by the Weidlinger Associates&#39; book &quot;Why Buildings Fall Down&quot;, some of which Bazant also quotes (Ronan Point, IIRC)?</p>

<p>I thought you were done, what are you trying to do now, have the last word? </p>

<p>Or are you genuinely interested in a scientific debate? </p>

<p>Then let&#39;s cut the bullshit and get on topic. </p>

<p>Eq. (6) must be satisfied for the <em>whole</em> building, which means it must be - at the onset of the collapse - heavier (W[g]) than it can hold up (W[p]). Only then can the collapse <em>progress</em> after a one-floor free fall of the 58.000-ton Block C initiating the collapse (that Eq. (5) can be satisfied by <em>that</em> nobody can seriously doubt), as in Bazants &quot;Simple Analysis&quot; (&#39;01/02) model. Otherwise, if W[p] &gt; W[g], the impact energy is &quot;damped&quot; and distributed over the whole structure, resulting in the kind of failure to progress well known from building implosion fails. </p>

<p>And herein lies the problem. At some point W[g] &lt; W[p] had to &quot;switch&quot; to W[g] &gt; W[p]. Either it was a built-in mechanical feature, then it was a domino chain reaction -&gt; <strong>set-up</strong>, literally -&gt; <em>intent</em>. Or a &quot;vérinage&quot;, with hydraulic cylinders and ropes and a clever mechanism artificially keeping W[p] &gt; W[g] long enough to &quot;switch&quot; to W[g] &gt; W[p] -&gt; <em>intent</em>. </p>

<p>Good advice, you should try that out. (edit: also, your OP was a question literally posed to people like me. Now you chastise me for answering it? Are you broken?)</p>

<p>Um...what?</p>

<p>3 shots in 8.4 seconds, none of them any longer than 88 yards, the second shot moved in a straight line and caused 7 wounds on Kennedy and Connally because of the way they were seated in the car.</p>

<p>You actually just proved that you don&#39;t know anything about it at all.</p>

<p>Anyone claiming LHO is the lone assassin (or any assassin at all) is a complete clown, and has obviously never read anything but the official story which is so retarded that not even 50% of this nation of retards is willing to believe it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever witnessed anyone fail this hard. It&#39;s been kind of nice. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>That would be pretty sad if a 15-year old had a better understanding of how the world works than you.</p>

<p>Vapor pressure, temperature, altitude, humidity.  There are a lot of legit, messed up conspiracies out there.  And there are some legit chemtrail theories that may or may not be true.  But this is just basic physics.</p>
