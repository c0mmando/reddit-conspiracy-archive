       Why should I accept the word of health authorities on the safety of vaccines without a double blind placebo controlled study?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this technically even ethical? Is this why I have not seen any such study?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case then would a documented survey of health and medical records of a large number of vaccinated and non-vaccinate children be the next best candidate? (The vaccinated would have to be divided up into different groups depending on their received vaccines.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why have I not seen any such study from someone like the CDC? The statistics I have seen are subject to many uncontrolled factors. Also, any statistics that i have seen are presented in a way such that cherry picking of data is a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I am injecting a cocktail of mercury, msg, disabled virus/parts etc, directly into a child's bloodstream, should I be content in doing so without said survey?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it seems that I can be provided with statistics that show correlations of lowered incidences of measles etc with vaccination, but does not say anything about the safety of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I welcome anyone to provide me with clear data regarding the safety of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, as this debate goes, it really comes down to the heath of vaccinated children vs unvaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logical answers would be nice please. I've herd all the accusations and insults, and those are unscientific and have no effect on this conspiracy crowd.

       This subject is too polar. .. and it really shouldn't be.  corprorations should be taken out of the equation and all studies should be open and top priority.  There should be no shadiness and no doubts about any and all procedures... for example If mercury is a bad agent then we should invest billions into finding another solution and no person should make a single penny of profit in any aspect of this.  There are too many pockets being lined and too much Shadiness... when it comes to.my children that's not acceptable.

       You shouldn't. No one else should either.

       Merck and other vaccine manufacturers routinely commit mass fraud on their vaccine applications:

       Accepting the "word" of corporations (without ANY independent research) who have routinely committed mass fraud in their products' applications is extremely foolish and naive.

        A double blind study would not work, unless you forced subjects to come into contact with the disease. Uncaccinated people are protected by the fact that the disease is nowhere to be found in a civilized country (for now).
       </li>

        You realize a double blind study would mean killing some of the HUMAN subjects just to prove that vaccines work, right? I mean, you can hardly come up with a more questionable experiment.

         This is true of literally any randomized controlled trial of a potentially lifesaving drug. You can only say it's unethical if you already know that it works, and if that's the case then you don't need to do the study. But how can you say it works if you don't do the study?

       I'm not talking about effectiveness, I am talking about its safety and the health/death issues for vaccinated vs unvaccinated. How will we ever know if it is saving more people than it is hurting. There is no data to say. (At least that I have encountered).
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : I guess I am talking about effectiveness... Effectivness + any health detriment vs the possible health benefits of not having the vaccine + health detriment of not having it is a way to put it.

       The CDC will not allow a study to be done comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated, this is because they know what the result will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately for us researchers from Germany have done a survey with an ENORMOUS sample size of both vaccinated and unvaccinated children and the results are astounding.  Vaccinated children are FAR more prone to illness and disease than their unvaccinated counterparts.
       <a href="http://vactruth.com/2014/02/26/unvaccinated-children-healthier/">
        Here is an article on the subject
       </a>
       .  A similar study
       <a href="http://www.mednat.org/vaccini/dannivacc_study.pdf">
        was conducted in 1992  in New Zealand
       </a>
       with nearly the same results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having a hard time finding the survey but I believe a lot of results are posted at
       <a href="http://www.vaccineinjury.info">
        www.vaccineinjury.info
       </a>
       be aware this survey appears to be on-going and the scum of the earth like David Gorski (main writer of the horrendous shill website sciencebasedmedicine.org who, I kid you not, is currently performing trials for a cancer medicine developed by Sanofi to try and approve it as an autism medicine.  All the while vehemently denying any environmental causes of autism and going so far as to say that diet doesn't effect health and pharmaceuticals are the only cure for all illness.  I can't stress enough how much of a scumbag this guy is) and his minions are actively and admittedly sabotaging the results.

       A survey is not a scientific study. That New Zealand study was done by a group called Immunization Awareness Society, which is an anti vaccine propaganda group, and the survey was from their own members and it admits that it is inherently biased. That is about as unscientific as possible.

       I'll save you the trouble, one of the studies found an extra 52/100 THOUSAND.

       The rate was so low it couldn't possibly be linked to the vaccine, the same as every other one of these dumb anti-vaxxer propaganda studies.

       "The possibility of a link between hepatitis B vaccine [and type 1 diabetes] is an interesting research area and has been recognized as such by a number of investigators across the world," he tells WebMD. He says that at two recent meetings, researchers "were in unanimous agreement that there was no association. We need a monitoring system, so that if an association is found in the future, it can be promptly identified."

       What sort of thing would you look for in vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations? What exactly would you like to compare in the two groups (the incidence of what problem is your concern)?

       Well, I am no expert, but would it not be reasonable to obtain massive amounts of documented medical data, and sort the data into unvaccinated, and vaccinated. The vaccinated category would be split into all combinations of vaccinations given. The documented health issues of these individuals would then be tallied up. A comparison would then be allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could turn out to be something like: decrease your risk of one medical problem, but increase your risk of another ( in either direction). Or the study could favor one side or another in some or all cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the health problems would have to be categorized by severity level with a given reasonable measure. ( where of course death of an individual would carry a lot of weight) this would be the most subjective part
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said I am not an expert... Maybe the data could just be presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it would encourage production of safer vaccines, may e we would find out the risks of vaccines are fine. Maybe we would find d out the risk is too much. That would have to be addressed in an actuarial manner.

       That would be a monumental task. Also, I think the scope of this idea is too big. Doing this kind of huge trawl of data, you'd be bound to get some results which looked significant just by chance... most studies are reported on the basis that any result with a lower than 1 in 20 chance is significant i.e. we can say with high probablity that the result is due to an actual effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spreading your net this wide would lead to spurious results... you need to have a theory to investigate first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would make more sense to look at theories or claims which have been made about vaccine's (e.g. "flu vacc increases chance of dying from a stroke" - I just made that one up) and focus on that. Otherwise it's just too much data to get anything meaningful from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, with the kind of study you are suggesting, factoring in confounding variables would be an absolute nightmare.

       I suppose it would!
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if instead if this, a test for the subjects to measure their physical fitness, intellectual fitness, an social stuff (sanity, empathy, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       not ideal, but at least a seemingly reasonable task. Then you skip the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would this be feasible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said not an expert, just brainstorming. It sure would be nice to actually have something solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: after some thought, I have decided , yes it is a monumental task... But this is the "safety of the public".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another monumental task in the name of " safety of the public" is vaccinating more than 90% of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the harm in undertaking another monumental task? What is the harm in finding a next-best study if said monumental task is not at all feasible?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my concern is the lack of effort to find evidence highly suggestive of vaccine safety. the fact that nothing exists that is even attempting this.

       I'm not sure that is the case... there have been studies on many "vaccine X causes Y" hypotheses over the years.

       Yes it would generate false positives, I guess that's why it would rely on random large samples.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as these studies go on the vaccine x causing y, what data do they use? In the same sense could this not lead to the same false positives? Does this rely on reports from physicians, or an actual study on a trial of people? Something else? This is why I am asking these questions. Hoping to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really it is difficult to study this to conclusive point for reasons pointed out here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many factors and no possibility of a controlled situation without being unethical. One can only pull facts from here or there and hope for the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, my point is, I have every right to be confused about the issue. It comes down to opinions in the end. Which is not something I am not comfortable with I'm regard to my loved one's health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure if I had a kid you might be able to convince me to VAX for "serious" diseases, but I would be spreading those out way more than recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you would have a hard time convincing me to vaccinate for chicken pox, hep, flu. I could not take the risk with current data.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes down to me seeing that most people are just "fine" and they are vaccinated.

       So something could/could have be/been tested from blood? Antibodies, indicators for certain diseases etc? Would be interested in something like this too. But it would still have to have a way of measuring overall health in a way that can be compared to tests from unvaccinated subjects.

       I can tell! There were a lot of different leads in there to get into, at least for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, thanks to you, i now have to look into the history and development of
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       vaccines, from the inception of the idea for each particular virus to the current methodologies. Then ill have to look into antibiotics in a similar fashion. Cross referencing all of this should give a descent picture of
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts like yours makes it easier to do this. But at the same time, it perpetuates the investigations... Which is a good thing.

       That is not conclusive evidence of vaccine effectiveness nor is it evidence of vaccine safety. It certainly gives no way to call compare the benefits and detriments of different combinations of vaccines in an unbiased manner. As I said, this comparison is the only logical measure that would put this debate to rest. It might find that it is favorable to vaccinate in some cases but not others!

       You don't need a double blind study. You don't need any science. Look at the evidence. Kids don't die of these horrible diseases as much as they used to. The risk of being hurt by a vaccine is incredibly small. Aside from the individual stories (which may or may not be true), aside from the fears and worries, the evidence is there. Big numbers. Developing and using vaccines are, hands down, perhaps the most amazing things the human race has done for itself. Ever.

       You are missing my point. The studies provided are not " bullet proof" as they say. They merely state that there is a correlation between vaccines and viral disease lessening. Correlation is not causation. ..Unless you can provide a highly suggestive significantly controlled/ well document situation. There are too many factors at play here to judge the effectiveness vs safety of vaccines by these statistics you mention.

       Hygiene/soap and water have done more to get rid of most diseases than just about anything. I am not implying a bar of dial is a substitute for antibiotics, but for a historical bang-for-the-buck it probably had more of an impact.

       But again, you are missing my point. Yes these diseases have gone down, but how can you be sure that this correlation is causation with many uncontrolled factors involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would these studies even have a way to compare  the safety of using or not using vaccines? This is the ultimate statistic needed to convince any logical individual of the safety of vaccines. Anything else just shows a correlation with no solid reason for causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could manipulate the connotation of any such correlation: EXAMPLE FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT: since the industrial revolution, we have increased lifespan, therefore pollution is good for our health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying vaccines are bad, I'm saying that arguments used to deem vaccines as good are of the same type as the above example. Please try not to take my example literally.

How do we know that any number of non-viral diseases of today are not influenced by vaccination? How have vaccines changed? Are modern vaccines as effective? Could they be more or less harmful? Too many unanswerable questions. How does the average parent compare the risks?

       Semmek has a point. Malnutrition plays a pivotal role in deaths due to otherwise preventable diseases in africa. Hygienics play a pivotal role also. These are variables that should be controlled in such a study, if they were to be fair and ethical.

       "I guess my concern is the lack of effort to find evidence highly suggestive of vaccine safety. The fact that nothing exists that is even attempting this."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure that is the case... there have been studies on many "vaccine X causes Y" hypotheses over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said previously, what you are suggesting would generate false positives... you need to be testing a more specific link for this kind of data trawl to work.
