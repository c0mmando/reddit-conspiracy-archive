       Light-hearted &amp; serious responses are both welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I'm pretty sure luminosity and candy crush are somehow government surveillance-based.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I'm convinced the end of american chattel slavery was a guise to make slaves of all people regardless of race.  If people think the slave community is now a part of the free community, then its hard for people to see the free community slowly transform into the enslaved community. They know they aren't in chattel slavery or prison so they can't connect the dots and see this new and improved form of enslavement. Prisons are here to make us say "look at those guys... I'm glad I have my freedom." When, in actuality, we are largely a part of the biggest system of slavery the world has ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the structure of McDonald's. You have your cooks/cashiers (the field hands). Then you have the manager who has it a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       bit better (the overseer). This system is prevalent throughout all of society. What's more, even if you quit your job at McDonald's, you can't survive without going back to the system. Making some 1% wealthier than God. Living with the minimal accoutrements in general (minimal health care, no vacation time, shitty education). Fuck. Even if you go to college you end up in just in a more specialized version of McDonald's where they give you just enough to say "at least I'm not the McDonald's guy. He's trapped, I've got options." You're really just a house slave. Then you work until you're 65 and die 10 years after your usefulness has waned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: surely prison serves a us in a practical manner (locking up violent criminals), but America's overzealous and fucked-up-in-so-many-ways prison system is, when one steps back and takes a look, comically ridiculous... And we just kind of go along with it.

       Okay. If I was to publicly write a conspiracy theory, here is where I would go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trying to find out who owns Profectus Biosciences, the company awarded the ebola vaccine by our government during the ebola craze.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a guy name Joe Berardino. He is a board member of Profectus Biosciences and also their founding chairman/CEO. I would assume that he owns some of it due to his founding role, but ownership of the company is private.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to Profectus, he was the head of Arthur Anderson, mainly known for being the accountants and cooking the books for Enron and Worldcom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since he moved to only being a board member at Profectus, he became the managing driector of another new company, Alvarez &amp; Marsal. They received nearly $1 billion during the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the conspiracy is, but this guy has been at the center of three huge stories of the 21st century.

       Let's play a game of 'light-hearted or serious'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The web and virtually all media are commercial forms of 'bread n circuses' to keep the masses distracted and consuming to act as smoke and mirror cover screens for humongous wealth shifts to those less distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Dream is a manner of modern day share cropping the economy.

      <p>
       Hip-Hop, rap, country, and most pop music exists to keep the masses within structured stereotypes centered around consumerism and social divisions.

       Which would be incompatible with my suspicion Lady Gaga was likely born with a penis. That's not to say she can't

       In Louisiana all the glass bottle cokes are from Mexico. It's really good, but something about it tastes different. I think maybe they use slightly less carbonation, it's not as good as say a fountain coke from Whataburger or Sonic.

       It's more along the lines of certain Rosicrucian groups and remnants of the Knights Templar forming an alliance to destroy iron-grip of the crown and Vatican theocracy, first with supporting the formation and spread of Christian alternatives to Catholicism, followed by the Rosicrucian enlightenment and rise of hermeticism in Europe, then with the creation and promotion of Freemasonry to instill the framework necessary to foment revolution and promote the ideals of enlightenment, eventually infiltrating the Church to gradually destroy it from within. I have to say, aside from the rise of fascism in the 20th century, for the most part I approve of the results.

       I think the population of China is completely fabricated. They had had less then 500 million at the start of WWII. Then after a famine, a communist purge, and no immigration, and a draconian one child policy they doubled their population and then doubled it again?
      </p>
      <p>
       The population statistics are not independently derived but are released by a government that would have a motive to inflate its numbers for prestige and safety.

       Use by dates on products are put earlier than actual product expiary to pronote sales, consumption, or discarding of said products, all to sell more and make higher profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some get away with it by claiming Best Before date.  I have been working and discounting products for years and some shit doesnt seem like it goes off at the date indicated. Here in Australia its a law to not sell products past their dates. So I have to dump perfectly good products most of the time because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I am sure thats the case? Because over the years more products started coming in with UBDs much sooner than they were in the past.

       I'm a produce manager at Whole Foods. Use By is the date tub go by if the product is just unopened sitting on your shElf. Once opened, you have 7 days (really if meat is involved I'd go with 5) before you should throw it out.

       Am starting to think that the whole "we are being watched at all times" thing is a way to have us self-police ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying we're not being watched,it's just that there's sooo much new and old information exchanging hands, being passed back and forth between millions if not billions of people, that it's impossible to monitor it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the millions of hours of video that goes up on YouTube alone, everyday. No one could possibly sort through it all to "keep an eye on everyone". How do you think I watched Guardians of the Galaxy the other day on YT in 360p?
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that shouldn't be would want nothing more but for the people who disagree with their policies to be so very fearful of what they say and to who they say it to, or even in front of, to the point where they censor themselves

       I think the winning team of the superbowl tomorrow is likely pre-determined.  I think a lot of major sports are questionable.  That's a lot of speculation, but its not like we don't have evidence of game's thrown in the past, or steroids used, or balls deflated, what have you.   I think its all bull; I've even questioned e-sports.  Sometimes the biggest gaming tournaments feel untrue to me (although consuming esports is a vice of mine anyway).  I think we're exposed to a lot of commercial, professional competitions that the public views as legitimate, but in reality are just high-effort versions of pro-wrestling.  I think I'm probably both right and wrong on this, there is probably a lot of legitimate sport, but I think its highly likely that there's a lot of fakery too.

       They still use humans as ref/umpires.  That is a dead giveaway that the "smart money" needs a hand in determining the outcome of the game.  When a computer can report balls/strikes in an instant, there is absolutely no reason why there is still a guy standing behind the plate calling the game unless someone needs to have the game (or the odds that the game will) come out a certain way.  People love to pretend that basketball ref Tim Donaghy didn't name names, because god forbid their rosy view of "purity" in sports be shattered.  Some of the refs he implicated are still working games today.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture.

       I don't believe anything. I have knowledge or I'm ignorant and I know the driver shot jfk. While pouring Morton  kosher salt into soup for my family I noticed the ingredients listed yellow Prussiate of soda which is actually ferrocyanide in the shape of star of David but only releases the cyanide portion when it comes into contact with acid (stomach). Chipotle serves tons of this salt.

       It is not part of the 9/11 conspiracy that the buildings came down by controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we learned from that part of 9/11 is that ALL high rise buildings are pre-wired to self-demolish, in case of an emergency.
      </p>
      <p>
       People focus on what Larry Silverstein said about pulling the building, and what the fire chief said.  What is really interesting to me is what John Kerry said about building 7.
      </p>

       Or at least they are lobbying to stall the turn over of a new much modern system of traffic control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some systems out there utilising smart AI to determine when traffic should be let through to maximise flow through all intersections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I think thats false though: oil has been a huge main resource for modern world. There is always demand so doing that is pointless. People and everyone will buy petrol no matter what. What the traffic control system boils donw to is not enough funding to be able to i stall millions of cameras everywhere to watch all roads and determine traffic light co figuration on the fly. Some major cities have inplemented said systems in the city centers etc. But the most use would be had if it was everywhere with things like: you driving and noone is on a nother road. You are traveling on a minor road over the major. But since no traffic is present on the major the lights switch  before you have to break and you can keep going. Flawless. But that is expencive to roll out on all roads everywhere.

       Many if not most businesses in the US are not only for profit but also watch the public.  It's an insider's rigged game and if you're on the shit list or not in good standing with intelligence agencies your business will fail. Different strategies will be used to ensure that.

       Head shops/crystal/magic/sorcery/WICCA shops like George's Folly are places where the CIA does mind control research. George's Folly in Boston opened AFAIK when George Bush was head of the CIA and may be the source of the name.

       When your supermarket gives free food samples, taste testers on the corner ask your opinion of a sample of a food or drink, or booths at free food festivals offer you samples, they're serving as vectors for something you shouldn't put in your body.

       I don't believe in supervolcanos.
I don't believe in plate techtonics.
I don't believe in the Big Bang.
I believe light can change speeds. (I think this one was just proven, but people called me weird for it two months ago)
I think the magnetic field of earth is caused by the Van Allen belts, and not a terrestrial source.
I think the Sun and Jupiter are not gas.
I think the whole trial of Socrates was a setup.
Oil is just crushed hydrogen and carbon... not dinosaurs. (That part, I think, is becoming a mainstream belief)
This one isn't mine... but Stoyan Sarg has a really good explanation of the atom. Grand Unified Theory, maybe.

       Honestly, this is a pretty tough question for me. I mean, ive become familiar with many different kinds of theories out there, and ive even come up with many of my own...
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say i believe in any of those?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking hard, i kind of believe in the whole "law of attraction" thing. I mean, in some ways it seems bogus, but ive implemented it in my life and my life has improved tremendously, often exactly how i envisioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, i admit that no matter how fantastic circumstances may be, and no matter how amazingly things may correlate with other things, you can never

       negate the plausibility of coincidences.
