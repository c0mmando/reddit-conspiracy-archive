       And it really doesn't matter what a US politician's views or skills are if he or she does not fully support Israel because otherwise they will never have the positive media coverage or financial donations needed to run campaigns. You can call this line of thinking antisemitic if it makes you feel better. It won't change anything.

       But even though I'm a commie, not a democrat, I can see the "there's no difference between the democrats and republicans" scam is a republican ploy to try to get people to not vote at all. At the very least Obama stopped torture. Which your side embraced.

       Warren seems to be vaguely in favour of an actual future for humanity I'll grant you, which probably means the Bilderbergers will never allow her a fair chance of gaining power. If she actually gets in she'll be Obama'd the same day, you don't get to tell your masters how to run things because you're the President, you get told how to act or you get Kennedy'd. Hillary is a nasty piece of shit and might as well be a Bush, they're even related for fucks sake.

       How is your mind so hardened into the two option false paradigm? You make it out as if not supporting hillary automatically means you support bush. Believe it or not there is a none of the above option available and dosen't necessitate not voting. 3rd parties, fourth parties and nonaffiliated candidates are all options as well. Probably not on a national level... Yet... So start local or state wide. It may not be your cup of tea, but libertarianism is becoming more popular as an example. I don't expect the to win the presidency in the next election, but if they win a handful of seats at the state level I wouldn't be surprised.

       Yes. Half of the Germans were back to work a year after Hitler got into power. Something Obama can take a hint from. People on assistance has more then doubled since he's been in office. We need to throw out the bankers like Hitler did. Then will we have a strong economy.

       Hitler did get his public support by doing some good things. Unfortunately he used that support to push his crazy eugenic agenda. This guy isn't saying anything nazi-ish just that sacking the bankers was a good idea.

       He's correct about Hitler you know. The guy may have been an utter maniac, but he DID toss the bankers out, and he DID save the German economy and bring it back from the brink. Germany was in a banker-developed cycle of hyperinflation. Hitler ended this by kicking out the bankers, getting the country off of the debt-backed Deutschemark, and creating a currency backed by the labor of the German people instead of a currency backed by debt. These are not matters of opinion; these are matters of historical FACT.

       I'm not a Nazi, I'm a Democrat non-secular Jew. I have no wish to discuss Nazis. At all.

      <p>
       I suggest that YOU visit one of these subs, as stifling free speech is PRECISELY what the Nazis did. Stifling history FACT is so abhorrent that it was not even something that the Nazis did.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a problem with historical fact I suggest that you take a good luck at all of the good Hitler did for Germany before his syphillitic brain was eaten alive and turned him into a homicidal maniac who allowed terrible things to happen.

       They all do the bidding of their masters. Even
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       that you have a choice in the matter is ludicrous. In the last election graphs showed that RMoney and BHO were, politically, about the same. The only difference is that RMoney took $100 mil from Sheldon Adelson in exchange for a promise of war with Iran IF he won, which I believe he fully knew that he would not.

       Any one of us can become president, that includes Jeb.  Democracy coupled with the free market, is setup in such a way that hte person who spends the most amount of money in teh election generally wins, as has the record shown the last century.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, fuck the whole charades... let's be honest and transparent about this, instead of wasting everyones fucken time, the person with the highest budget for campaigning should just instantly be elected president.

       It has happened every election anyways, at least this way people are not wasting their time getting their hopes up.  These cock suckers want more for themselves, and less for everyone else, that is the very nature of a society that is specifically designed for competition and inequality (thanks to capitalism and the monetary system).

       They have to fix them so most people can accept the fix. But you're right. The plutocracy would have to think we were ready to take to the street and feed them to the guillotine before they would allow Bernie's election, and that would be just to placate and distract us.

       The stupid evil Bush presidents simply gave power to smart super-evil alter-egos.  Rove and Cheney, to be exact.  So a smart evil Bush president is just the same amount of scary as any other Bush president: Threat level 10 out of 10.

       Jeb is a joke candidate and can't possibly win and therefore will likely drop out during the primaries if not before. Rand Paul is GOP's only chance at the Presidency. I don't see Hillary as a candidate in 2016 either.

       George P Bush, young , half mexican, dynamic , good looking. The little boy who introduced his grandpa George H when he accepted the GOP candidacy. He's Obama 2.0 , on the other side of the coin.  He can bring the Hispanic, and youth votes back to the GOP. As luck would have it, the outgoing guy is granting amnesty to a bunch of people that will probably vote for him.

       Yes. It matters. While I consider Obama an ineffective disappointment, he stopped torture and instead of hundreds of thousands of people being killed, hundreds were killed. So yes. It makes a difference.

       Everyone conveniently forgets that Kennedy started the Vietnam war and sent about 16k military "advisors" to stir up the conflict and start a proxy war with Russia. This eventually led to us helping to popularize radical Islam in Afghanistan and the middle east to impede Soviet progress in those areas. This created the social climate that created the problems we're facing today. Based on that I'd say Kennedy was the deadliest president, soldiers are still dying based on the changes he brought to the world.

       Eisenhower started the Vietnam War. My uncle was shot down in a helicopter over Vietnam back in the 50s when few Americans knew the military-industrial complex was already gearing up for a major war there. Kennedy might have ended it or he might not. We'll never know. But he was a rich boy so fighting the communists who might take his money and give it to poor people probably seemed like a good idea to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any link to Afghanistan. Except through the whole anti-communist thing, using Muslim crazies as surrogate warriors to fight it.

       Kennedy was comparatively ineffective,, but hardly deadly.

       There was never a war declared so when it started is a matter of opinion. But in the 50s there were some American troops there in American helicopters and Viet Cong shooting at them.

       No, Admiral Morrison (Jims dad)  "started the Vietnam war" -- with plenty of help from Johnson.  All Kennedy did was to send in "advisors" to help the French.

       Semi-Islamic here, a life is a life to regardless of the numbers. He's still a murderer in my eyes. Obama hasn't done shit-all about torture. It's still happening. At the end of the day, these people in the White House are puppets. They make no difference. They offer no real hope for the American people. You will learn this the hard way, it seeseems.

       You may want to glance at a dictionary before mentioning torture again. You, quite frankly, sound to everyone that you know nothing of which you speak; and the massive down votes your idiotic comments have brought to you prove that more than a few people here agree with me.

       I said this in 2013 that I knew Bush would be put into the Whitehouse.  You would rarely hear his name here and there.  And I was like ohhh shit. Then it started being more and more and more.  Its gonna happen, ask George Zimmer.  Some say it doesn't matter, but it does.  Prepare for a huge war like we have with the other Bush's.  Then after he leaves in 8 yrs, it will be a democrat that pushed more handouts, local militarism, who knows.  Its a double edged sword on both sides.  They will both drive the debt, and the masses will still argue which side is better, argue about healthcare, abortion, handouts, etc etc.  Its all meant to divide and keep busy while either way, the banksters/MIC/corporations come out on top.

       W was an unholy combination of a hands-off overly trusting president, who was hijacked by the worst forces of the Reagan administration. Bush I succeeded in running a relatively fair term, focusing on realistic application of military power, long term strategic thinking, and unexceptional but functional economic policy.  He did this because he brought forward the more competent members of the Reagan administration, the ones who focused on governing and realistically-constrained conservative philosophy
      </p>
      <p>
       W was a trojan horse fo Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld, who were essentially insane egotists who thought that amy hairbrained scheme they cooked up was due to their omnipotent understanding of humanity, and not bloated power fantasies. The war in Iraq was essentially a dick-measuring contest for retarded neocons who think every war is WWII, and believe that they areunilaterally right. It's politics for children, and they blew away hundreds of thousands of lives trying to prove a talking point. W was merely a means to a far-right coup of cabinet members.

       I don't buy the "but they're both the same!!" bullshit line. Someone posted a voting record for various issues. There is a huge difference. The same lobbyists are at play, but I'm sorry, democrats are much closer in thought to what I think should be going on. Granted nothing is perfect. And if Hillary runs, she'll win. It's not the best choice ever, but better than these republican goons obsessed with religion and antiquated laws.

       When it comes to social issues sure, the two parties will attempt to differentiate themselves to appeal to voters with points like Pro Choice/Pro Life and contrived issues like that which only give them the appearance of being different.

       But when it comes to the important issues, like our foreign policy and the items I listed, they're the same.

       You just said if Hillary runs she'll win - A woman who differentiated herself from Obama a few months back by saying she would have went to Syria. (to be fair she said Obama got Syria "wrong" but, we all know what she meant)
