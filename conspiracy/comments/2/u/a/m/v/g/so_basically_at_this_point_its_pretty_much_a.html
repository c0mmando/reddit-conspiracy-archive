<p>Edit: I can&#39;t vouch for everyone on this site and there are crazy people in every community. If a crazy person does show up at a daycare and does something stupid. How do you think it will play out in the media? If this business looses clients due to this investigation by reddit, could there be a defamation lawsuit? If the children&#39;s safety is compromised because the owners are busy dealing with phone calls and other inquires who is liable? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely don&#39;t take any stalk in the trolls around here which I assume is most of the threats and some of the OPs with their obvious attempts at playing the game of cat an mouse that is conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>As for some crazy, well, we can&#39;t really be responsible for that. I&#39;d rather have access to information in the information age than not and let fear drive my pursuits.</p>

<p>The media is the media. They will blow everything out of proportion to get a story and they are all liars and manipulators. There&#39;s nothing we can do because apparently they represent the freedom of the press. But to me, the real freedom is being able to ask questions about a daycare and investigate it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I really don&#39;t care. I hope they sue reddit for millions and shut this site down. This site does more harm than good on a daily basis. It&#39;s a festering pot of whores and masters dictating conversation and adjusting thought. I don&#39;t care if reddit get sued.</p>

<p>The daycare since obviously they don&#39;t have enough staff to handle calls and take care of the children they promised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just begs to be a front for black budget government operations. </p>

<p>Judging from its past, it would have most likely been used for drug smuggling operations. This would have been done while it was a functioning daycare and shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to anyone on this sub. It is probably being used by squatters now; illegals tend to sell cheap things at flea markets. There is a real possibility that the house is still being used as a gateway for illicit trades of all sort.</p>

<p>My biggest fear concerns it being a safe house. There is a risk of blowing the anonymity by researching it. This is least likely of current scenarios, but still feasible. </p>

<p>No, they&#39;re not. All people are doing is pulling random misrepresented facts out of context and connecting dots that don&#39;t even exist. This is just like the time <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/">reddit thought they uncovered what would have been the worst radiation disaster in US history.</a> Tons of misrepresented, independent facts bundled and tied together to forward a totally made up narrative. </p>

<p>No posts are allowed because people were going to a daycare where children are and taking creepshot-esque photos through the windows and sending pizzas to their business. </p>

<p>There could be a conspiracy here though, but it&#39;s in the exact opposite of what ya&#39;ll are thinking. This seems to me that this has all the hallmarks of a false-flag. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the OP of the SLC thread and the ones who claimed to have seen no children there ever (without any evidence to back up said statements) are the same person who owns a rival daycare center. </p>

<p>Yeah, no fucking shit. Reddit&#39;s a business that needs to make money in order to stay in business, so it would only make sense that they delete things that could potentially harm them.

<p>Phone calls made to a business which makes their number public for the purpose of inquiring about their business is not harassment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there has been a treasure trove of photos including photos of the interior taking through the window of this daycare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If these photos are taken from public property, there is no issue and it&#39;s not trespassing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been some many harassing calls that their number now redirects to the local police department.</p>

<p>Really? I&#39;m tempted to call just to find out if that is true, but I have a feeling that may be the point of saying what you said.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t a dox when personal information is released to the public? e.g. phone numbers, address, real life shit. I think you might be getting mixed up with DOS&#39;ing (denial of service). Not trying to be a dick or call you out, just feel like you&#39;re genuinely mistaken. </p>

<p>Yeah, no fucking shit. Reddit&#39;s a business that needs to make money in order to stay in business, so it would only make sense that they delete things that could potentially harm them.
