<li><p>Old testament Times and magic. 
Back in OT days, people practiced magic, kabbalist magic. The dogma behind the magic was that God is everywhere, and you can tap into the force of God through rites and rituals, most of which include blood sacrifice. And the OT is all about blood sacrifice, as it was the only way of being forgiven from sin. </p></li>
<li><p>Jesus, a regular dude, teaching principles of spiritual liberation from sin and suffering, ie the teaching of the Buddha, became the Manchurian candidate for Rome&#39;s attempt at establishing a new religion. Mixing Rome&#39;s  Hellenistic ideology, with the blood sacrifice and messianic ideology of the OT, and topping it off with the &quot;worship and be saved&quot; ideology, we get Christianity. A filthy concoction and cover up for the magic practitioners of the OT, many of whom held positions of power, such as Solomon, or royalty of Egypt. Reading the messianic prophecies and then the Talmud, it is clear to see Christianity was for the good gentiles, while occult OT stuff was for the ones part of the inner circle.</p></li>
<li><p>Egyptian royalty settles what is now Britain, still holding the rites and rituals of magic, pleasing the evil forces that have corrupted their souls. Their bloodline spreads, and gains control of the world, as every president of the United states are blood relatives to each other, the queen, the Rothschilds, and the royal Egyptian bloodline.</p></li>
<li><p>Effectively, this close nit family of Egyptian royalty, controls the world bank, the UN, the world economy, politics, prices and wages, they have orchestrated western history for the past 300 years, and seek to control the world, so that they may once again bring this world back to the Times of the OT.</p></li>

<p>For the most part, the majority of the population would shy away from drinking blood, I&#39;m sure the gig would be up as soon as they were like, &quot;good, one world government set up, now bring out the blood sacrifice for this momentous occasion.&quot; </p>

<p>I do have a one world government, economy, banking system, and a one world police force. It&#39;s a one world order already, lmao, I&#39;m wondering how long it will take Glenn beck from noticing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might I ask you what portions of your research you&#39;d deem the craziest things? Or even less specifically, what resources would you deem quintessential for someone relatively new on the path? For the past while now, my life has seemingly been innately guided toward fulfilling a much greater awakening than the bounds of our fabricated society allows. I&#39;m trying to devour as much of the alternative as I can in hopes of creeping ever closer to a TRUTH I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever find. A cosmic truth. The sort of truth that must be hard to comprehend considering the limitations of our three-dimensional perspective. Does that make sense? Obviously these aren&#39;t the things you find in a subscription to Newsweek, if ya know what I mean, so I&#39;m essentially asking for your help in providing me with a sense of the things you studied that shaped your particular outlooks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enlightenment happens when there is no thoughts. Then you slip into Nirvana, a state of consciousness void of all sense of self. Rejoicing in it and embracing it, you find that perfect state of balance between any given extremes. Attachments, reactions, and re-development of ego can take you out of that state of enlightenment, in which case you have to start all over again, but with the wisdom gained. 
When you allow yourself to be at bliss with existence, you will know the ultimate truth, the truth that lies beyond the superficial, the teachings of the Buddha and Jesus become illuminated, those who wrote the Shobogenzo, all teachings of enlightened beings become known as truth. I don&#39;t mean to be cryptic, lol, but its pretty hard to explain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to be honest, despite the conflict I may generate with intellectuals, but yes, Magic is real. The energy that radiates from my heart, or any other persons heart, has a direct influence on living matter. Love creates a good influence and hate creates a bad influence. You can then say everyone practices magic whether they like it or not, and that everyone&#39;s state of consciousness has a direct influence on the global consciousness. </p>

<p>How the magical energy is harnessed within, is done by ending the reckless use of our personal energy, the energy of our spirit, by gaining control over our minds, our cravings, and our state of consciousness. </p>

<p>The spiritual spectrum of our influence can then be fully imagined. We can easily identify those who have gone to the dark side and we can recognize those who have devoted themselves to the light. Seeing this spectrum of spiritual possibilities, we can start making conscious effort to emulating the light and ending our ego fueled  addiction to the dark. That is the most magical thing anyone can possibly do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, you have to find God on your own, it&#39;s not an intellectual concept, or a man in the sky. </p>

<p>The other stuff you said leads to your destruction, there is a bible verse, &#39;those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who are humble will be exalted.&#39; True empowerment is gaining control of self, of emotions, of thoughts, of identity, to end the externalization of responsibility, to end seeking powers outside of ourselves. </p>

<p>The dark side buys into this world, it buys into the glamour, the superficial, the material, the egotistical, the illusion of power, and is therefore ignore-ant of anything deeper or  spiritually substantial, keeping them in a dark place of spiritual imprisonment to their self created hell. </p>

<p>The meek are the most powerful, the ones who have fought the spiritual war within and came out full of compassion and a willpower to bestow good to the world, the ones who became wise the full spectrum of the dark and the light, those who make conscious effort to be free from possessing ideologies, those who have attained a non-dualistic perspective, those are the miracle workers, both for themselves and others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, he became the candidate for a new religion that would keep pagan and Judaic tradition alive, while catering to common folk. </p>

<p>While you see Jesus as a run of the mill spiritual teacher in the Gnostic gospels teaching an off brand of Buddhism, and then watch him be exalted to messiah, even though Jesus doesn&#39;t fit the description of messiah, I came to the conclusion the whole thing was manufactured to cater to religious and political aims. </p>

<p>Jesus: teaches off brand Buddhism, goes against the Pharisees, did miracles, and taught against Judaism, ie Grace instead of eye for an eye.</p>

<p>Taint Jesus with Judaism, and Hellenistic dogma, you get something Jesus didn&#39;t intend on, the idolatry of Jesus that is Christianity. Liberation from sin and suffering was his gig, now, in this life, so as to bring heaven to earth, it was never his intention to make a religion catering to self righteousness.  </p>

<p>While caesar had begun attempts  at &quot;colonizing&quot; britain much earlier and indeed garnered nominal power installing a puppet ruler in a small area- which would begin to start the process of romanizing britain the link to britain would erode pretty quickly as tribes from a number of backgrounds would lay claim, and more significant claim to britain than the relatively small expedition undertaken by rome.</p>

<li><p>During the time of the Old Testament and Torah, the Kabbalah did not yet exist. The predecessor of the Kabbalah was known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism">Merkabah mysticism</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One might argue Jesus of Nazareth may have been an incarnation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">Logos</a>, of what some cults would refer to as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya_%28Theosophy%29">Lord Maitreya</a>, either of which amounts to a matter of faith or speculation. One could compare the Jesus resurrection allegory with that of Osiris or Dionysus, while more probable this would also amount to nothing more than speculation. What we know for certain is that a Jesus of Nazareth had likely existed, as a dissident and would-be reformer of Judaism, after which the cult of Christianity and of the Gnostics was formed. One could speculate he (Jesus) might have practiced Merkabah, or possibly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreanism</a> or a form of mysticism originating from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi">Magi</a> of Zoroaster and Babylon (i.e. that of the three Magi), however there is no actual evidence to support such a hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>The common bloodline of U.S. Presidents and the Queen of England (among others) is that of certain medieval European monarchs going back to King John of England. The Rothschilds are a separate lineage altogether, supposedly that of the Tribe of Dan. The Egyptians have no relation to either of these. I happen to have a common ancestor with some of these persons of interest, through ancestry to King Edward I (the grandson of King John), however have found this to be largely irrelevant. It&#39;s statistically insignificant.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong bloodline, wrong aeon and only a portion of the overall agenda.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is comprised of one hypothesis applied to a whole lot of speculation but here goes.</p>

<p>Illuminati means enlightened ones. that suggest they know something that most other people don&#39;t. One thing that is known about them is a fairly strong affiliation for numerology and occult geometry. This is something they share with Kabbalah, Freemasons and many ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>The hypothesis part of my theory comes from a guy named Nick Bostrom. He has an interesting theory that is considered plausible by many in the physics community. The idea is that our universe is actually a computer simulation. If you aren&#39;t familiar with this idea, check out &quot;Bostrom, Simulation&quot; on google or Youtube.</p>

<p>In a way, many cultures have believed in something similar since many religions have a sort of simulation hypothesis built into them.</p>

<p>So where do the Illuminati (and others) come into the picture? My theory is that mankind discovered  that the universe is a simulation a long time ago via mathematical methods. Then, a few people began to discover ways of interacting with the simulation via numerology. Ways in which they were able to exert different forms of control over the way events took place. Perhaps they could even affect the probability of the outcomes of certain events.</p>

<p>Naturally, they kept this knowledge the most closely guarded secret. I guess a modern day equivalent would be The Matrix, where some people gain the ability to cheat the program and do superhuman things. What I&#39;m suggesting is that mathematical/numerological secrets exist that allow a person to exert influence over the things that happen in their lives.</p>

<p>The Illuminati are just the latest name to be applied to this group of people. They might use their knowledge to make themselves incredibly wealthy. They might have the ability to affect the outcomes of elections as well.</p>

<p>As for how this actually works? Hah, I wish I knew. Maybe someone discovered that certain dates or numbers really <em>are</em> more lucky... or unlucky than others. Basically, it&#39;s a worldview, combined with some kind of geometric/numerological knowledge that gives the Illuminati an advantage over anybody else in the world no matter how smart, how powerful or how rich they might be.</p>

<p>tldr; secret knowledge attained by a small group that enables significant self benefit by unconventional means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Little tidbit of info. Math/mathematics, the word itself traces all the way back to Egypt and the Egyptian mother goddess Maat. The Egyptians gave this name to mathematics because they considered it to be the mother to all true sciences. We&#39;ve got pretty much the same attitude today.</p>

<p>So the Egyptians felt pretty strongly about math. My theory kind of elaborates on this fact. Basically that there are secret forms of math that can be used in ways that most people would describe as magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have indeed been those who had historically referred to themselves as &#39;Illuminati&#39; over the centuries, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumbrados">Alumbrados / Illuminati of Spain</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumin%C3%A9s">Illuminés of France</a>, to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborg_Rite">Illuminati of Avignon / Swedenborg Rite</a>, and the notoriously subversive however largely secular  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Bavarian Order of Illuminati</a> founded by Adam Weishaupt, to the various other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_organization">initiatory orders</a> that arose since, and unfortunately, the handful of modern orders who have had the audacity to flaunt the name solely to attract initiates and profit from their ignorance.</p>

<p>There exists today, however, influential groups who indeed possess &quot;Illuminati&quot; grades within their uppermost degrees, for example: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis#Initiation_and_teachings">O.T.O. / Ordo Templi Orientis</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian_Monographs#Illuminati_section">A.M.O.R.C. / Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism">Rosicucrian Order</a>.</p>

<p>Then you have certain present-day orders with distinct ties to Illuminism: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn#Structure_and_grades">Third Order</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4#The_Order_of_the_S.E2.88.B4S.E2.88.B4">S∴S∴ / Third Order of the Silver Star</a> within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴ / Argentium Astrum</a>, the Arcana Arcanorum / 90° and higher of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Memphis-Misraim">A.P.R.M.M. / Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misraim</a>.</p>

<p>Above these orders, you have certain key groups whose very name and existence is more often than not denied and obfuscated: the Committee of 300 / Olympians, Old Black Nobility, the Palladium, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs">Secret Chiefs</a> of the Great White Brotherhood, Moriah Conquering Wind, and their Council of 33 &amp; Council of 13 respectively.</p>

<p>Thus, the answer will vary depending on who you ask, and with which faction you are referring to. There are some who are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah">hermetic qabalists</a>, some who practice gnosticism or christian mysticsism, druids and neo-pagans, thelemites, neoplatonists, those who are hermetic and neo-gnostic luciferians, with some being theistic satanists, however most being a combination of the above.</p>

<p>As far as what kind of magic, it can range from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic">ceremonial magic</a>, solomonic magic / goetic operations, enochian magic, to sex magick, tantra, alchemy, theurgy, etc.</p>

<p>Personally, I respect the right of each individual to practice any religion (or lack they of) they so desire, so long as they do not harm others (i.e. engage in human blood sacrifice) in the process.</p>

<p>More or less, and before the Kabbalah it was the Merkabah as I mentioned prior. There were of course other ancient forms of mysticism, influencing most of it not all of the aforementioned groups: Pythagoreanism, followed by Platonism and Neo-Platonism, the Egyptian mysteries, the Chaldean Magi, the Magi of Zoroaster and Babylon, the Canaanites, the Eleusinian and Dionysian mysteries, the mysteries of Mithraism and the Essenes.</p>

<p>Later, we had the Johannites, the Sufi, the Kabbalah, and with the aid of Rosicrucianism we saw the rise of Hermeticism throughout the bulk of Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what form of Christian mysticism you&#39;re referring to. The pseudo-Christian forms of mysticism, such as Rosicrucianism and Martinism can be highly hermetic, perhaps at times more Kabbalistic than Christian in nature. There are some, such as traditional Gnosticism which is moreso based on early cults of Christianity, along with Jewish mysticism. In contrast, one should recognize Christianity itself was largely based on Judaism as well.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t advocate this. It is usually those who have the most potential to harm whom can potentially do the most good. They have already done the &quot;legwork&quot; so to speak in their development for such potential.</p>

<p>Remember, as harsh as it may seem, the atrocities you speak of have brought the collective potential to where it is today. Not to justify any specific or type of act but to point out the &lt;everything here&gt; of <em>you</em> is <em>more</em> than without. Or to go further to whom(s) could such (very broad-)-environmenta potentiality be adequately attributed to? Who is to definitively say the &lt;atrocities effect&gt; was not an inevitable part of the unquestionable flows of Life <em>is</em> &#39;proper.&#39;</p>

<p>It is us, we, whom dared to imagine or think in separation of life categorizing and referencing, those whom were and still are - the old stitchwork finely woven in the fabric of life whom could remember the Great Imposing Responsibility of the privilege if only you could bring them to separate themselves again if only for a tiny unit of experience-<em>ing</em>. But through it all, their bioness, lifeness, whoness, beingness, or even existiness serves as proof that all whom are &#39;living&#39; or existing have their (essentially eternal) &#39;final&#39; &quot;contribution&quot; to the phys-Life space and more.
