        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy and corruption have run rampant through the Globe for decades now. At the center of modern corruption lies the United States of America. While it has not always been like this recent history shows that as corruption shifted to the United States It has had a larger impact on the world.</p>

<p>While most people in the United States oppose war, famine, and genocide its citizens seem complacent to let it occur. Many more people are becoming aware of the injustice occurring across the world and in the United States, and are working hard to let their voices be herd. I am grateful to have found a place such as this forum where I can let my opinions be herd without being ostracized or called crazy. It is people like us who can make a difference in the world and it is imperative that we take action.</p>

<p>I’m sure everyone on this Forum is aware of the transgressions, crimes, and robbery committed by organizations and people who care not of the citizens of the world, but only of their bank accounts and prestige. Organizations such as the Federal Reserve, Mass Media, and governments around the world, as well as Politicians, diplomats, and world leaders are all set on a path for destruction fueled by greed.
I want to let everyone on this Forum know that these people and organizations are much more tangible than we think, and that we can really make a difference if we know who to target and how to target them. We first must avoid getting scared about the economy collapsing, and “Shit Hitting the Fan” or Ebola, mad cow Disease, H1N1, WW3, and things of the nature. I’m not saying to disregard them as possibilities, but we can’t be paralyzed by fear if we expect to change anything.</p>

<p>Enough rambling, let’s get to the NITTY GRITYY: Let’s look at the people in charge of the aforementioned organizations and politics, and see where their allegiance truly lies.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve:
The last three chairmen of the Federal Reserve dating back to 1987 have all been Jewish Zionist, Alan Greenspan, Ben Shalom Bernanke, and Janet Yellen. The current vice chair, Stanly Fischer, holds dual citizenship in Israel and in the US. He is a former governor for the Bank of Israel. I in no way mean to appear anti-Semitic or racist. I am merely pointing out facts, I advise everyone to Wikipedia these names and look for yourself.</p>

<p>The United States government:
Executive Branch,
 The biggest contributor to Barrack Obamas first presidential campaign was Goldman Sachs. The CEO of Goldman Sachs is Lloyd Blankfein, again a Jewish Zionist.  Department of Treasury; Jack Lew a Zionist Jew. Many others under Obama as well as people advising him are Jewish Zionist or Pro Israel. (Henry Kissinger for example)</p>

<p>Legislative Branch,
It’s well known that congress can be easily bought out by lobbyist and special interest. The most powerful lobby in Washington that has the most special interest benefits is undoubtedly AIPAC.
Quote from Collin Powel, “The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) exists for the purpose of lobbying Congress to support Israeli governmental policies and actions. These oligarchies have persistently reduced Israel to their ideological preferences by ignoring its critical opposition.”
Quote from Former Congressman Jim Traficant, “AIPAC runs American foreign policy.”</p>

<p>AIPAC, or American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, is literally the only foreign lobby that is not registered as a foreign agent (RFK demanded that they register as a foreign agency, but they kept pushing it back until he was killed, by a “Palestinian”). Go on AIPAC’s Website and check out what their motives really are. Check out a video on YouTube called, Aipac 101, it sums up everything you need to know. For further evidence of Aipac’s domination of congress, look at the recent vote to send aid to Israel. The senate voted 100 to 0, in favor of sending aid! Our American cities are crumbling, yet our congress finds it necessary to send THREE BILLION dollars of aid to a foreign country annually!</p>

<p>Judicial Branch,
Where the Executive and Legislative branches are elected by the people, members of the Judicial Branch are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. As we have already learned both the Executive branch and senate are merely subjects of their Zionist interest. They act according to what their largest lobbyist want, and it should be no surprise that the lobbyist want to appoint likeminded Zionist on the Supreme Court. There are currently nine Justices of the Supreme Court, three of which are Jewish. That means 1/3 or 33% of the Justices on the Supreme Court are Jewish. This is a huge misrepresentation of the Jewish demographic in America, Where Jews only make up two-three percent of the population. The Supreme Court Justices are Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, and Stephen Breyer. I urge you to look up these names as well as statistics about the Jewish demographic in America. </p>

<p>While the firm grip that Zionist have on the American Government as well as the American Monetary system is striking, it can be argued that the firm grip they have on the Media, popular culture, and Academia is even more frightening. 
In the Television world we have people such as Gerald M. Levin, a Zionist Jew who was the former CEO of AOL Time Warner. Also Zionist Jew Michael Eisner former CEO of the Walt Disney Company, Sumner Redstone a Jewish Zionist whose Family is the Majority owner of CBS corporation and Viacom, and Jeff Zucker current president of CNN another Zionist Jew.</p>

<p>In the Printed version of news, Jewish Zionist are deeply entrenched as the New York Times Company, which owns the New York Times, has been under the control of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger since 1997. Before 1997 the New York Times publishers have all members of the Sulzberger family dating back to 1935 when Author hays Sulzberger was the publisher. All members of the Sulzberger family were and currently are Zionist Jews. </p>

<p>The Washington Post has been under firm control by the Graham family for decades now. Kathrine Meyer Graham was the former leader and Publisher of the Washington Post and her son Donald Graham was the President. The Family has been and continues to support Zionism. 
It should be no surprise to most informed people that Hollywood is dominated by Jews, With Directors such as Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick, Joel Coen, and the list goes on and on and on. Again please look up these names and organizations yourself I am not making this up.</p>

<p>While I could continue to cite more Jewish Zionist dominated aspects of American and Western life, I hope that anyone who has managed to read this post see’s things clearly now. While I’m not criticizing all Jews in the world or considering them as a whole to be Zionist and Pro- Israel, the facts remain that the people in these powerful positions undoubtedly support the State of Israel. I actually have some Jewish friends who in fact helped enlighten me to these facts. I hope this can be enlightening to whoever has managed to read this post.</p>

<p>I want to encourage everyone to get active and actually do something about this problem we face. As Americans we are literally paying taxes which go into Israel’s “Defense Funds” which help to kill and maim thousands of Innocent Men, Women, and Children. We must put Pressure on our Government, and let them know that we are not only aware of their corruption, but we know who is corrupting them and what the corruptors’ purposes are.  Call and E-mail your congressmen and women to let them know we don’t want our tax Dollars to be given to another nation while our own country is breaking down right before our eyes. </p>

<p>Stay politically active, vote Third-party, form political parties, and don’t be afraid of being accused an Anti- Semite. We can beat this Monster,  they can only fool us for so long, their transgressions will not go unnoticed forever and it is our responsibly as citizens of the United States as well as many other countries to fight for what is right. Educate others and don’t resort to silly conspiracy theories that flag you as a kook. All the things I have talked about are document-able facts that cannot be disputed.<br/>
We must bring attention to this Zionist Occupied Government if we wish to stop it. Let all people come together and unite in our goal of ending Global Zionism!</p>

<p>PS, if anyone can direct me to a site where people who should be reading something similar to this post could read it, it would be most appreciated. This isn&#39;t exactly professional, but I just want to put it out their for anyone who is starting to realize they have been lied to their whole lives. Again thanks for reading this post any and all feedback iswelcomed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me for not going into detail, it&#39;s not as if you bothered to engage in conversation before. </p>

<p>It&#39;s disjointed and nonsensical because it is literally a long list of random things that may or may not have happened, in no particular order. There is no evidence for any of the claims made. Linking to the entire Bretton Woods agreement to substantiate a <em>minor</em> point about it is a garbage rhetorical trick. Both you and the author obviously have no idea where in those documents the support for such claims would exist, and that&#39;s exactly why instead of referring to the specific part of the 1871 District of Columbia Organic Act, they just link to the entire 12 pages of 150 year old scanned legal text. I obviously don&#39;t have the time to read through the entire act of law to try and find the minor point that both you and that author can&#39;t seem to find. </p>

<p>It says the US is a corporation <em>because</em> it can borrow money from the IMF - why don&#39;t you tell me how <em>that</em> makes sense?</p>

<p>Everything there is documented and none of it is random at all.  This is telling me you either didn&#39;t read it at all or you did and are feigning ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes there is.  Read the fucking laws, read the Acts, read the statutes.  This isn&#39;t pulled out of someone&#39;s ass, these are literally <strong>on the books</strong>.  You just saying &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is nothing minor about the point that was made about Bretton Woods.  The fact that you&#39;re saying that tells me you don&#39;t really know what the hell you&#39;re talking about at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why is that obvious?  Especially when you admit you didn&#39;t even read it yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I obviously don&#39;t have the time to read through the entire act of law</p>

<p>Of course not.  How could you be expected to actually do any research of your own and examine if the claims have any weight?  Much easier to just stick your fingers in your ears and deny that they&#39;re true based on nothing at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>...lol.</p>

<p>You&#39;re in way over your head.  You should read the Organic Act of 1871 yourself instead of just dismissing the claims made in the link out of hand.  Just read the first few paragraphs and you&#39;ll see with your own eyes when and how the DOC corporation was created.</p>

<p>I did read the laws and I didn&#39;t find any evidence to support the claims you or the site did. Unfortunately, both you and the site fail to actually cite any portions of those laws, so the onus is upon you to demonstrate that they actually do contain what you claim. </p>

<p>You have terrible reading comprehension. What I said was that they made a claim about a Bretton Woods agreement and failed to actually point to any evidence of it. They just simply provided a link to the law. Well, I read that too and I don&#39;t see any evidence. </p>

<p>Did you read any of the laws? Where did you find the evidence for the claim. Certainly there must be actual sentences of legalese that reflect what you are describing. </p>

<p>Of course not. How could you be expected to actually do any research of your own and examine if the claims have any weight? Much easier to just stick your fingers in your ears and deny that they&#39;re true based on nothing at all.</p>

<p>I did as much research as you or the guy who published that stupid website. Linking to a copy of the bretton woods agreement isn&#39;t research. It isn&#39;t analysis either. </p>

<p>I did read the act of 1871 and you seem to misinterpret where it says all the land of united states <em>within</em> washington dc. Obviously you don&#39;t know what the word within means. But let&#39;s be fair - you didn&#39;t really fucking read it anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a Jewish-Zionist aspect, but if you research further you&#39;ll find the Rothschilds who are in control of the financial system are a front for the Black Nobility families of Europe, which are for more rich and powerful. Most of these noble families are members of the Knights of Malta for instance and this order rules over all the intelligence agencies, if you do some research you&#39;ll find that every director of the CIA has been a Knight of Malta. You then have the Jesuit Order, which is the most powerful order within the Vatican. The Vatican and Queen Elizabeth hold the most land and real wealth in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t spread dis-information like this. The Rothschild&#39;s were and still are a powerful international money lending family, but they are not the only ones calling the shots like people like David Icke and Alex Jones would have you believe. While they still have influence in the world today, they are not the only ones at the &quot;Top of Pyramid&quot;. </p>

<p>As Far as the Jesuit Order goes here is a link to a debate between two people who have written extensively about Zionism and the Jesuit Order. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr5fGgr5PK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr5fGgr5PK0</a>. Forgive the man debating the side of Zionism&#39;s obnoxious voice and pay attention to what he says. You should see pretty quickly that the case for the Jesuit Order is a pretty flimsy one. </p>

<p>As far as finding good information about the people who are gaining the most from the long period of lies and deceit. I urge everyone to Youtube names such as Ry Dawson, David Cole, Sibel Edmonds, James Corbett, Daivid Duke, Micheal Collins Piper, David Irving. All of these people have great information about History, Geo-Politics, and current events in general. For other organizations that have had tremendous power in and outside the government you can research organizations like the Department of Defense, PNAC (a Washington think tank), Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, and other top US Defense contractors. You should see pretty quickly how the leadership in all of these organizations overlap, and how they also pledge their allegiance to Israel.</p>

<p>DO NOT get caught up with people such as Alex Jones, David Icke, Jesse Ventura, Luke Rudowski, and people they support in the so called &quot; Alternative Media&quot;. These people all do have Agendas and stand to make money from the dis-info. they spread. Don&#39;t feel bad if you have gotten information form them in the past because a lot of what they say is half true. </p>

<p>Continue your search for the truth, but don&#39;t be paralyzed by fear. As I said in the OP these people in power are far more tangible than we really think and most of their power is illusory. Thanks again for anyone reading this and please provide any type of feedback you wish!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to know what is going on, which is refreshing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Conspiracy and corruption have run rampant through the Globe for decades now. At the center of modern corruption lies the United States of America. While it has not always been like this recent history shows that as corruption shifted to the United States It has had a larger impact on the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing that kept corruption from overrunning the United States in the past was the fact that the US was largely run and controlled by white Christian men. The moral code of Christianity rejects corruption. As Jews became more powerful in the United States and  gained ever more control, the corruption increased. That is why we are in the mess we are in. Jews have taken the reins of power out of the hands of white Christians. Jews have fucked up America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty Much! AS the center of Global Jewry shifted from the British Empire into the United States their reach has gotten even more profound.  They use America as the engine to power their global dominance, they are looting our economy to help grow the war machine. They won&#39;t be able to do this forever though. </p>

<p>If they continue their obscene multicultural policies that are propagated by their influence in Washington as well as Hollywood, the United States will fall into further decadence. (I don&#39;t think the United States should stop allowing minorities in the country, but I absolutely think we that we can and we should better enforce immigration laws. I also believe that their are ethical ways to help slow the rapid birthrates of the poor in the US by making changes to the welfare system) If these faulty polices continue however their war machine will fall apart right in front of them, but it will be at OUR EXPENSE AS WELL!!</p>

<p>If we keep allowing the Zionist-Jewish minority to continue to run our foreign and domestic policies everyone in the US is destined to suffer. We must let congress know that we know exactly what is going on. Simply send an e-mail to your congressmen and women and tell them to stop supporting Israel. Not all of them have completely sold out, but they aren&#39;t going to magically start doing what is right. It is our job as the Majority to convey the message that we are tired of these crony policies and we wont have it any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly urge you to look up the history of the State of Israel and how and why it was formed. There is a reason we give them so much money,  they are our only ally in the hell of what we call the middle-east. I highly highly suggest you read up on world history, both world wars,the creation if Israel, and the state of current geopolitics following the Cold War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, the Balfour Declaration is a very interesting subject. Some good evidence points to the fact that the initial push by the British to create a Jewish State in Palestine, was because international Jewry used it influence to help push the US into WW1 (a war which the US had very little to gain from). Beyond that WW2 incited many Jews to find a new home land in what would eventually be called Israel. And ever since Israels creation it was playing both sides of the cold war. The Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard leveraged his knowledge of much sensitive classified information about US intelligence to the Soviets in order to benefit and enrich Israel.</p>

<p>For even more examples of Blatant Israeli deceit towards the US look up the Lavon Affair and the Attack on the USS Liberty. </p>
