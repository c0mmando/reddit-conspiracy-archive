The Army let it slip that they can put subliminal or audible voices directly into people&#39;s minds with a &quot;neuroelectromagnetic device&quot; here: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/">http://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/</a></p>

<p>The DC Navy Yard Shooter literally had &quot;My ELF Weapon&quot; carved into his shotgun, saying he was being harrassed with electromagnetic weapons. More interestingly it slipped out in official documents from 2006 that the Undersecretary of the Navy was the approval authority for experiments involving &quot;severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions including consciousness altering drugs and mind control techniques.&quot; They even discuss bypassing normal human consent for these experiments. <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/valtin/tag/navy/">http://my.firedoglake.com/valtin/tag/navy/</a></p>

<p>Then someone shoots up the navy yard claiming to be being abused by mind control weapons and no one&#39;s asking exactly what the fuck kind of &quot;mind control&quot; experiments they are doing?! </p>

<p>Snowden&#39;s telling us the tip of the iceberg in the hopes that the populace will be appeased- happy and content knowing that even within some shady spy organizations there are people with a conscious who will alert the masses when they really step over the line, by like snooping our emails. </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t he mentioned V2K? Why is he continuing the charade that one can be secure on the internet at all considering TEMPEST and Van Eck Phreaking? The Dutch government doesn&#39;t allow electronic voting anymore because it&#39;s common enough knowledge that anything on a computer screen can be duplicated exactly by analyzing the EM emanations the screen puts off. This could be done at the distance of miles by the CIA decades ago. Van Eck did it with $20 in radio equipment in the 80s at the distance of several hundred yards IIRC. </p>

<p>Snowden is the waving left hand in the magician&#39;s trick, while the things the right hand are doing are so nefarious and terrible they are hardly to be believed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah GT. Good post. I even noticed a weird voiceover during Sibel Edmond&#39;s drone rant during the last BFP Roundtable. The audio has PBS&#39;s Rise Of The Drones in the background, with two lines about how the drone pilot&#39;s try and minimize civilian casualties and supports ground troops.</p>

<p>I feel it wasn&#39;t really subliminally done, but it was curious, considering everyone in the BFP roundtable would agree that PBS and NOVA are highly influenced by the State Dept, and wouldn&#39;t purposefully use any audio from that type of production. It was also the only time (I listened to it thrice) that kind of audio dubbing/insertion happens, and this show doesn&#39;t have any audio clips typically, it&#39;s just Sibel, James, Peter and Guillermo talkin&#39;.</p>

<p>Edit: podcast in question:</p>

<p>Because, GT, if you just state that the State Dept and PBS/NPR are just mouthpieces for the administration (and I&#39;m obviously not talking about Barack), lurkers will do 1 of 2 things:</p>

<p>-Ask for evidence of a undoubtedly impossible-to-prove claim</p>

<p>-Take what Jim says as gospel and no longer research the matter</p>

<p>But, if you say that they are merely &#39;highly influenced,&#39; maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, someone will investigate it further and head on down the rabbit hole that leads to us talking about things that we kind of know a lot about (for you it&#39;s obviously Snowden).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abu Subaydah was waterboarded 83 times, but all that waterboarding didn&#39;t get him talking. It was a visit in his cell from &quot;Allah&quot; who told him to cooperate as it would go easier on the other brothers. I&#39;m convinced that visit from God was a deployment of a &quot;Voice of God&quot; weapon. All that information is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kiriakou">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kiriakou</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m also positively convinced that these neurological weapons are being &quot;tested&quot; globally right now on innocent citizens. It&#39;s just too unbelievable for the populace to demand an investigation. Especially when we&#39;ve got Snowden leaking <em>all</em> the NSA and CIA dirty secrets. </p>

<p>edit: the <em>all</em> is sarcasm. snowdens documents have told us anything we didnt already know 20 + years ago. literally. they can do sooooo much more... but hey, the masses need to learn they are being watched</p>

Look into microwave weapons and you&#39;ll see that they can do a lot with those weapons, not to mention that they openly used them in Iraq as sub frequency weapons. Its actually one of the most important weapons that the military has these days because it doesn&#39;t leave traces like a bomb.</p>

<p>Also although everybody yelling that Snowden is a limited hangout is starting to get redundant, the suspicion is much warranted with being able to get on national television in the show 60 minutes and not get taken away if he really is one of Americas most wanted. Not to mention the stuff that he is leaking now has been leaked around 2010 by an mi6 agent named Barrie Trower. He actually even goes in depth with the voice of god weapon that youre talking about, if youre interested there are interviews with him and him speaking in front of one of the major technological conferences of Europe around 2011</p>

<p>This is why I think the shadow gov exists.  All the Republicans who ran for President in 2012 all said, &quot;God told me to run for President..&quot;.  Then they all lost.

    <div class="md"><p>you are implying that he had access to this information and hid it, thus justifying your accustaion of him being a limited hangout operative. </p>

<p><strong>This is circular reasoning</strong>: you are implying something, and using this implication of yours as proof !!! </p>

<p>You are completely ignoring other alternatives; such as the fact that he might not have had such information, the information is yet to be revealed since its with the reporters (Snowden himself never made any information public-access), all just as if not more probable.</p>

<p>In order to hold your theory that Snowden is a CIA agent (limited hangout) under the tutelage of Mr. Putin himself, you would need to open a Pandora&#39;s Box of fringe conspiracy theories; where Putin and <em>the West</em> are working together under some unknown major shadow power (eg; Illuminati, Reptilians, NWO Zionists) just to justify that Snowden is a limited hangout agent. Otherwise it doesn&#39;t hold !! </p>

<p>So while you may be right that Snowden is a limited hangout operative, considering the above and applying Occam&#39;s Razor, you probably aren&#39;t !!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but no, I&#39;m not implying that at all.  I&#39;m <em>stating the fact</em> that over 90% of the documents he allegedly had access to have still yet to be released well over a year later.</p>

<p>Now the conclusions we do or don&#39;t draw from this can be argued, and maybe our conclusions won&#39;t agree, but it&#39;s a fact that these documents haven&#39;t been released regardless.</p>

<p>I mean, there is a lot of good evidence showing links between the East &amp; West at the highest echelons of power (at least) since the rise of Bolshevism and the assassination of the Russian royal family in the early 1900&#39;s and then all through the rest of the century.</p>

<p>If Putin <em>isn&#39;t</em> working with the west at all, it&#39;s a somewhat new development (in my opinion).</p>

<p>So while you may be right that Snowden is a limited hangout operative, considering the above and applying Occam&#39;s Razor, you probably aren&#39;t !!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor is pretty antithetical to analyzing and speculating about conspiracies (many of which are elaborate and compartmentalized), I don&#39;t really know why people invoke it as if it means or proves anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s damning what Snowden&#39;s not talking about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can only talk about something you know !! You are alleging that Snowden <strong>knows</strong> about V2K. And this is circular reasoning since from the wealth of USG secrets, Snowden probably has a small fraction of them.</p>

<p>On the other hand Snowden being under Putin&#39;s tutelage is a fact, unlike your presumptions. So while possible that Putin is working with <em>the west</em>, as I stated, this opens a Pandora&#39;s Box of conspiracy theories !!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>clockwork assassins are just people with a psychiatric problem, under the <em>&#39;care&#39;</em> of their doctor, a very special doctor on the payroll of not nice people. (brainwashing ie the focusing of a person&#39;s mania or hatred)</p>

<p>theres two ways to impose a voice into somebodys brain, dual beam ultrasonic, the brain is at the focal point where the two beams meet (doppler or mixing effect).</p>

<p>then the 80s thing with microwaves.</p>

<p>its likely not a very mobile tech, more for stationary targets. and is going to cost big money in equipment and technical people to operate. so tricky to use (focus) and expensive to operate.</p>

<p>so prob more of a theoretical thing and/or only for very high value targets.</p>

<p>Snowden isn&#39;t a limited hangout. He&#39;s a puppet that is apart of a very large scale psychological false flag limited hangout operation. The stories that come from his documents are limited hangout to a certain degree. Snowden exists to scare Americans.</p>
