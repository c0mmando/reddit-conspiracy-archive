The best part was having to bury his body at sea immediately, lol.</p>

And then they had to pretend that they flew his dna to Afghanistan to run it through a &#39;special high speed dna profiling machine&#39; to get quick confirmation, before they dumped his body into the deep blue sea and all of this was in a matter of hours, and there is no evidence they can show to the public to confirm this, just take our word for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical lab-based DNA matching tests like this can take up to 14 days; they’re painstaking and need to be repeated several times to ensure the sample’s not contaminated from any other DNA sources. But that’s not necessarily the only way to do these tests: late in 2010, a University of Arizona team presented research on a machine that can do the analysis in just two hours in a largely automated way. It’s possible that knowing they were engaged on a mission to capture bin Laden, U.S. forces arranged for access to a machine like this to be on quick alert — probably for flying blood, cheek cells, and other samples taken from the body to the lab for expedited analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burying his body at sea immediately was to prevent a retaliatory attack and to prevent this guy from being deified or being seen as a tragic hero.  Al Qaeda confirmed that Bin Laden was killed and the biggest confirmation of his death is Pakistan&#39;s faux embarrassment being expressed.  We invaded the air space of a nuclear power to kill a person, Pakistan was pissed but it was also trying to hide the fact that they knew Bin Laden was in their country just chilling(this is bad for Pakistan diplomatically).  You can read leaked cables discussing pakistan and how much they knew about Bin Laden&#39;s presence in their country. Does anyone here even read wikileaks or any of the leaked government documents? The biggest insight into how the government actually thinks and acts are at our finger tips and no one reads or ever references them...talk about delusion. </p>

<p>None of the leaked documents support any of the crazy theories perpetuated here.  Why is this not more widely discussed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that this sub probably seems delusional and crazy on the surface but there is usually a method to the madness around here and, from my experience, people here are generally happy to explain why/how they came to their conclusions.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with the official version of events is that we have no concrete evidence. Surely a picture of the corpse of the man who supposedly committed the worst terrorist attacks on US soil in history wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask? The US had no problem with <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/1228876245001/graphic-video-qaddafis-body/#sp=show-clips">Gadaffi&#39;s corpse being paraded around</a> (probably NSFW). They also <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news/53820748#53820748">provided video of Hussein&#39;s capture</a>. There&#39;s also plenty of evidence of lower ranking al Qaeda members being killed.</p>

<p>Pakistan&#39;s ostensible embarrassment doesn&#39;t really cut the mustard for me because the Pakistani government has been in bed with the US since at least the Afghan war in the 80s (read Charlie Wilson&#39;s War if you want some insight to this), so their collusion in the official story doesn&#39;t require a huge stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>With regards to Wikileaks, most people are around here are aware of the fact that it&#39;s almost certainly a limited hangout, particularly with respect to 9/11, so this might be why their leaks aren&#39;t more widely discussed. That&#39;s how I see it, anyway. Obviously I can&#39;t speak for everyone.</p>

<p>The reason why an image was not released makes perfect sense and it would be obviously be too much to ask.  Bin Laden was the leader and icon of an organization that is responsible and known for killing and attacking random people across the world. Would an image of their leader, dead, be used as a recruitment tool or inspire/cause revenge attacks(note any revenge attacks WOULD lead to the deaths of some westerners)?  Of course it would. </p>

<p>So now you have a situation where a government&#39;s actions would directly lead to the deaths of westerners and you think it is the rational and just course of action to make... No, no it would not be the rational decision to make.</p>

<p>I should have also mentioned that his family also confirmed his death at the hands of Special Forces as well as Al Qaeda.  The informant that lead to his killing was also sentenced to 33 years in prison for espionage.  Here is a list of Islamic organizations that had something to say about his death.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_death_of_Osama_bin_Laden#Islamic_organizations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_death_of_Osama_bin_Laden#Islamic_organizations</a></p>

<p>You can&#39;t compare Gadaffi or Saddam to Osama Bin Laden because the other two were leaders of a state that was overthrown and being replaced. In these countries imagery of dead former leaders provides a foundation for a new country to be rebuilt which is a positive thing. Contrast this with the leader of a global terrorist network who tries everything it can to recruit and inspire terrorist acts on westerners and you will see how they are not comparable.  </p>

<p>Are you denying that releasing photos of Osama Bin Laden dead body would directly cause/inspire deaths?  </p>

<p>The U.S government can&#39;t even get the Navy Seal who shot him to shut the fuck up about it, and you think there is a conspiracy involving hundreds if not thousands of people, and multiple governments lieing and keeping quite to make the public think that the American government killed Bin Laden...?  </p>

<p>You say </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know that this sub probably seems delusional and crazy on the surface</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but when you look at the thousands of people who are required to be quite about these vast conspiracies they claim to be real and the reasons why they believe them, you can&#39;t help but think that things below the surface are crazier and more irrational then they appear at the surface.  No matter what evidence or how solid of an argument you provide them with, they refuse to partake in a rational dialogue decrying you as some agent of the government. It is from my experience that people don&#39;t like talking about why they believe these things because their reasons don&#39;t hold up to the smallest criticisms and just sound absurd when you read them out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you something, I think that people who believe 9/11 had no government involvement whatsoever are the ones who are nuts.  Way too many aspects of that day, and the subsequent fallout, do not add up whatsoever.  I can make a list if you would like, but people that read this subreddit are already familiar with the reasons.  I digress - with that in mind, why would the government not fabricate a story to essentially to close the circuit for 9/11?  I do not buy the reasoning of retaliation attacks or recruitment for showing pictures of a dead leader.  The CIA has documented links to the Taliban, al queda, Saudi Arabia, etc.  Their reactions to OBL&#39;s death are as genuine as a White House press conference is.  </p>

<p>And how exactly would the hypothetical reasons of future attacks on westerners be a justified reason?  Shouldn&#39;t Homeland Security be doing a better job now with the sweeping pass of the Patriot Act immediately after 9/11?  That was passed to make Americans safer and to prevent something like 9/11 from happening again.  This is just another perfect example of thoughtless reasoning provided by the government which contradicts itself once again.</p>

<p>I can keep going, but why come into this subreddit and try to essentially dispel a conversation when you already know the majority of it&#39;s readers are going to disagree with you?  It&#39;s almost as if, especially with your name (no offense), the government has people trolling certain subreddits to try and discredit people&#39;s voices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not say you guys were &quot;nuts&quot;,  I simply said you guys do not have any evidence or logical argument to support your position. What is this nonsense about closing the circuit.  Why would you bring in more witnesses or loose ends when we could have just never got him. Your reasoning makes no sense. Of course the cia have FL links to all those organizations.  The cia planned the fake vaccine program that allowed bin ladens identity to be confirmed was set up by them, of course they weren&#39;t surprised.  What are you talking about?</p>

<p>Would seeing a dead image of someone you admired and respected make you more or less likely to kill in his name or seek revenge? You would have to be delusional to not answer more or argue that it would have no effect.</p>

<p>The government does not worry about people like you even though they should because the nonsense perpetuated and whole heartedly believed by yourself and most people here,  are what cause terrorist acts.  Most people here think that the government is trying to depopulate the earth... Which presumably includes their family and everyone they care about. You would have to again be delusional to think this would not inspire acts of violence/terrorism.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us all,  the government is actually protecting your way of life and everyone you know in ways you fail to understand and would probably deny if shown to you in black and white.  You would deny the facts because you want to feel like you know something others don&#39;t when in reality so many aspects of reality disprove your understanding of things you are doomed to be perceived as a delusional child for the rest of your existence. </p>

<p>However, if you are a free thinker and decide to empower yourself with knowledge and understand economics you would see how oil effects the value of currency and the price of goods that your quality of life is based on among many other things that show how the government maintains our way of life. Pick up an international relations textbook so you can understand why governments behave the way they do.  Read up on  logical fallacies so you can know when you are reasoning inaccurately, confirmation bias should be a perspective changing concept to reflect on for yourself.  Read some philosophy and reflect where your own beliefs come from and the credibility of sources. </p>

<p>Turn on cspan and watch policy makers discuss the issues they are legislating on, I guarantee you won&#39;t understand a fraction of what they are discussing which is truly unfortunate because you supposedly care about the stuff they are discussing and the future.  You are so far removed from reality your thoughts on political matters makes your thoughts irrelevant and dangerously misinformed. Most people who think the way you do remove themselves entirely from the process often curling up into the fetal position while they encourage others to revolt in their V masks.  </p>

<p>JFK said that when you make silent revolutions impossible you make violent revolutions inevitable, it is unfortunate that you probably did not partake in the silent revolution like most people did not a few days ago during election time. The republicans won, you will have your smaller government, and you are too ill informed to know what that really means and why that is bad. </p>

Bin Laden was the leader and icon of an organization that is responsible and known for killing and attacking random people across the world. Would an image of their leader, dead, be used as a recruitment tool or inspire/cause revenge attacks(note any revenge attacks WOULD lead to the deaths of some westerners)? Of course it would. </p>

<p>I would suggest that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/drone-strikes-killing-more-civilians-than-us-admits-human-rights-groups-say/2013/10/21/a99cbe78-3a81-11e3-b7ba-503fb5822c3e_story.html">killing of civilians in Yemen and Pakistan by US drones</a> is a much more effective recruitment tool but this doesn&#39;t seem to stop the US government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So now you have a situation where a government&#39;s actions would directly lead to the deaths of westerners and you think it is the rational and just course of action to make... No, no it would not be the rational decision to make.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we&#39;re using this logic, some might argue that releasing a film about Operation Geronimo might not be a rational decision to make but the <a href="http://gawker.com/declassified-memo-shows-how-cia-shaped-zero-dark-thirty-493174407">CIA didn&#39;t seem to have a problem with it</a>. I would also have serious reservations about the rationale of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9Cz3nwtazs">Michelle Obama announcing that Argo won best picture at the Oscars</a>, considering Iran&#39;s opinion of the film.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but when you look at the thousands of people who are required to be quite about these vast conspiracies they claim to be real and the reasons why they believe them, you can&#39;t help but think that things below the surface are crazier and more irrational then they appear at the surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you seen <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/047168_conspiracy_theorists_sanity_propaganda.html">this report</a> about the sanity of conspiracy theorists? It&#39;s conclusion is the polar opposite of your opinion on the craziness and irrationality of conspiracy theorists vs. conventionalists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter what evidence or how solid of an argument you provide them with, they refuse to partake in a rational dialogue decrying you as some agent of the government. It is from my experience that people don&#39;t like talking about why they believe these things because their reasons don&#39;t hold up to the smallest criticisms and just sound absurd when you read them out loud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the thing. I have the exact same opinion as you - I require evidence and a solid argument before I believe something, and I just don&#39;t see either in this case. </p>

<p>Let me put it to you like this with regards to conspiracy theories:</p>

<p>Imagine that you knew me, and that it has been proven time and time again that I am a pathological liar. For example, let&#39;s say that I&#39;ve told you that I value liberty and human rights for all, yet you have documented evidence of me giving cash and weapons to a group of people who have a proclivity for committing atrocities such as murdering parents in front of their children and throwing grenades into schools. Incidentally, my defence for this at the time was simply repeating &quot;I don&#39;t remember&quot; 124 times when I was questioned, but this is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s say that I told you I had irrefutable evidence that 9/11 was an inside job but I threw that evidence into the sea because it might upset some folks. The only evidence I have left is the testimony of my friends and known associates. By the way, these friends and associates of mine are pretty nefarious. For example, they lied about a country having weapons of mass destruction to provide a pretext for a war that made them extremely rich. They also murdered the leaders of countries like Panama and Ecuador because these leaders resisted the the oil and foreign aid industries that were destroying their countries both economically and ecologically. Or maybe a few of these friends owned a Fruit Company that committed crimes against humanity to protect their political interests. Whatever - it&#39;s all hypothetical anyway.</p>

<p>Now, knowing what you know about me, would you believe me about this 9/11 evidence? Or would you maybe question me? Or would you go so far to not only believe what I told you, but also tell anyone that disagreed with my story that they&#39;re crazy and/or irrational?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know what sound argument is. Don&#39;t take that personally, but you literally don&#39;t. A sound argument adheres to correct logic. I ask</p>

<p>“Would an image of their leader, dead, be used as a recruitment tool or inspire/cause revenge attacks?”</p>

<p>You don&#39;t say or make an argument why releasing an image of Bin Laden dead will NOT inspire/cause revenge attacks/killings because of x,y,z.  Explaining the x,y,z would be a sound argument but you instead say well we inspire/cause revenge attacks/killings through drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan.  For the sake of rational discourse I will assume your position that drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan cause revenge attacks/killings on westerners is true, does this somehow make it acceptable to have more revenge attacks/killings on westerners because of the release of the image of Bin Laden dead?  The answer is obviously no. </p>

<p>You then use the same logical fallacy and say that well the CIA releasing a video called Operation Geronimo and Michelle Obama praising the film Argo are examples of the government directly causing revenge attacks/killings on westerners.  For the sake of argument again, assuming these are true(which it would be absurd to), would that justify the government releasing an image that would directly cause MORE revenge attacks and killings.  The answer is obviously no.</p>

<p>You have not produced a strong argument on why the government should release an image of Bin Ladin&#39;s corpse(I assume you don&#39;t have one because you have not presented it and one does not exist) and have not provided any argument that would give one reason to think that westerners would not die as a direct result of it being released(I assume you don&#39;t have one because you have not presented it and one does not exist as well).  You are incorrect. Please read this list of fallacies and what they are, it will provide you with more of an understanding of reality and the truth than any alternative news site ever could. Note you will you never see a discussion of logical fallacies on these alternative news websites... because they are the greatest types of knowledge one can have for seeing through misinformation and falsity.  They are tools required to see the &quot;truth&quot; and to understand reality.   </p>

<p>I have two pages typed out responding to the rest of your reply and I will post it when I am done.  To get an idea of what is going to be in it I suggest you read the actual study and what it actually says/implies.   <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703523/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703523/</a> The guy lifted his entire article from another person&#39;s horrendous interpretation of the data and study and didn&#39;t even read the study. Being able to read a study and examine its method for flaws is essential for understanding science and the degree of accuracy each study entails.  This guy couldn&#39;t have read the study because any person with basic reading comprehension would not get out of it what the author lifted from some other lost mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, maybe your bloated prose and hilariously childish attempts at condescension intimidates the folks down at <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> but I can assure you that I can spot pseudo-intellectualism from a mile away so it&#39;s not going to make the nut here (a link to Wikipedia&#39;s list of fallacies, seriously?).</p>

<p>It&#39;s painfully apparent that your primary method of debating is framing the argument in your own image of logic, and then refuting anything that doesn&#39;t fit within those parameters with an ostensible tone of authority. And all of this without providing anything of real substance yourself. You also seem to splice jazzy terms in there to portray an image of intellectualism (logical fallacy, rational discourse, etc.). Seriously, this is kids stuff.</p>

<p>Your reasoning for not releasing an image of bin Laden was: <em>&quot;Would an image of their leader, dead, be used as a recruitment tool or inspire/cause revenge attacks(note any revenge attacks WOULD lead to the deaths of some westerners) Of course it would.&quot;</em> According to <strong>YOUR</strong> very definition of a sound argument, you have failed to provide one. All you have done is a) provide an unsubstantiated claim and insisted that I accept it because you said so, and b) insinuated that any opinion to the contrary would be irrational.</p>

<p>My point about Zero Dark Thirty/Argo/the murder of civilians by drones is that when you put the actions - not the words - of the US government into context, it&#39;s pretty obvious they don&#39;t put too high a priority on blowback. Remember that the US armed and trained ISIS to overthrow the leader of a sovereign nation, and many civilians have died as a result. This is the same ISIS who have a propensity for beheading westerners.</p>

<p>The US also <a href="http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_02_25/Anonymous-Ukraine-Klitschko-e-mails-and-Nuland-Pyatt-dialogue-prove-US-backed-coup-9378/">backed a coup in Ukraine in February</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvRljAaNgg">here</a> is a recording of the Nuland-Pyatt call. The neo-Nazis they placed in power then went on to murder more than 40 civilians in May.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re seriously suggesting that the US government gives a shit about retaliation? I think we&#39;re all sufficiently familiar of the concept of &#39;Murica by now to know that if they had proof of bin Laden&#39;s death they would have paraded it around like there was no tomorrow. A bit like they paraded the <a href="http://d3cced9h6ghzi5.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/full_page_image/inline_image_uploads/20140722_MH17_0.jpg">Google Maps © 2010 Digital Globe image</a> around to prove that Russia shot down MH17, which, strangely, is quite hard to come by these days.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t send me two pages in response. Keep in mind the brevity is the soul of wit, and I have zero fucking tolerance for purposefully impenetrable walls of text. You&#39;re not writing a novella; you&#39;re writing a response to an anonymous user&#39;s post on an internet forum. And remember, it wasn&#39;t this &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracy theorist that started the personal attacks, it was you, the self-proclaimed voice of reason and logic (<em>&quot;You don&#39;t know what sound argument is. Don&#39;t take that personally, but you literally don&#39;t. A sound argument adheres to correct logic.&quot;</em> indeed).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t presume to know your situation but I can tell you that I live in one of the most impoverished areas in my country (top 4% on the poverty index), and I have to say that it fucking baffles me when I see people like you fighting so hard to maintain a system that is quite clearly working against us. Do you ever stop to wonder what would the world be like if people like me <em>didn&#39;t</em> question the power structure?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The level of self-delusion and self-pity is high in this one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you ever stop to wonder what would the world be like if people like me didn&#39;t question the power structure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s start here.  A. Your oppressing and disenfranchising yourself by believing your oppressed. B. You aren&#39;t doing shit to improve the world so the world could only be better off if people like you didn&#39;t believe what you did because then you would actually get off your ass, vote, try to shape public opinion during election time, volunteer for a close local election that would improve your immediate community, etc.</p>

<p>I am glad you brought up concerns you have in your local area because that is the first step in getting them resolved.  There are two different ways of viewing the influence of policy in your area. From the bottom up(local and state), and from the top down(federal).  When you have issues in your community it is easy to follow and communicate your issues to your local city council and local board of education.  When you do this you begin to see how your local government is trying to fix the issues that impact you the most.  You probably don&#39;t even make it to this step because think the federal government is this thing that has control over every aspect of your life and every aspect of your community, which could not be further from the truth.  </p>

<p>When you actually take part in very functional aspects of democracy you will see how it is not broken, and if it is not working you will have first hand knowledge why, as opposed to the beliefs of crackpots who think every election is rigged by jews or the illuminati.  Rest assured, the illuminati does not give a damn who is on your city council and what measures they pass in your area. In fact I am willing to wager that probably 5% or some disgustingly small percentage of your city&#39;s population actually votes in local elections. Many of them will not participate because they think like you do, that the “government” is bad and trying to depopulate the earth, but most will not participate because they are not aware of how the community that they and their kids will be brought up in is literally being created by the policies being passed on the local level. </p>

<p>Mind you since so few people vote in these local elections and the people competing don&#39;t have millions of dollars in campaign money to work with, one person can literally unseat a local politician by rallying those around them and shape public opinion through the appropriate mediums(local newspapers, local news stations, popular local forums, social media, etc).  This is what an engaged citizen who cares about the future of his kids and family does, contrast this with curling up in the fetal position with your thumb in your mouth screaming you are being oppressed by the illuminati and federal government(aka going into circle jerk online communities to complain about a perceived oppressive super villain).</p>

<p>People who believe what you do are like religious people who can&#39;t admit that their belief in a god is a sham.  A defense mechanism kicks in which makes you spew things that defy logic because you have coopted this worldview and put so many aspects of life in this incorrect context you would literally not know what to do if this foundational belief/worldview was wrong.  You even get your information from garbage websites that don&#39;t even write their own articles to reinforce this belief you are this special person with some insider information on how the world works.  This is how delusion and confirmation bias takes place in the human mind.  Over time this makes you into a Olympic level mental gymnast.</p>

<p>The context you put the world into is an illusion.  What you fail to understand is that you can have direct knowledge of reality and the way the world works by looking at the facts and data?  You are playing connect the dots with only 3 dots when there are really 80. Shit is complex, and why do all of the most informed people on the subjects you hold strong beliefs on disagree with you.  All of a sudden smart people don&#39;t know what they are talking about or once they acquire the knowledge shape-shift into cartoon villains trying to deceive the masses.  These educated people who understand specific aspects of reality (medicine, physics, biology, economics, political science, etc) are in the hundreds of millions all around the world and most have zero incentive to lie about their expertise.  In fact, if an Australian academic or an academic from anywhere in the world disproves a fundamental aspect of biology or medicine he will win a nobel prize and become a millionaire over night for revolutionizing a  field.  Being educated and informed of reality takes effort, it is a hard rigorous process that most people who spew conspiracy theories don&#39;t go through.  We aren&#39;t born with the knowledge on how to think objectively and it is difficult place to get to so I suggest you read that list of logical fallacies.   </p>

<p>I will assume you are not in college or in a community full of intellectual discourse so I will post the segments of my response to why the site you linked is garbage and perpetuates the flawed understanding of science and academia, which just so happens to be the crux for most conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>For the sake of being objective I will not use words that maybe demeaning or imply a slew of other ideas that only serve to muddy the dialogue.  In doing so we will see how the &quot;psychological study&quot; you linked lacks this objectivity and does not prove what it claims to. Words such as sanity, insane, crazy, are not productive and by no means some objective label that you can then quantify by some experiment. When we say &quot;insane&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;, we are specifically saying that this person is not rational. &quot;Not rational&quot; is something verifiable by examining the logical structure of their arguments and by looking at the evidence provided to support the position. If the logical structure is incorrect, or if the logic used to examine the implications of evidence A is incorrect, then the belief it claims to prop up is not rational or justified to believe.</p>

<p>Before I break down that article and explain how it is not accurate or remotely scientific, lets look at the source and then its sources. Now lets not kid ourselves that this website does not pander to conspiracy theorists and by virtue of this fact may not be objective.  By just looking at the most viewed article titles we can see it promotes the idea the government is trying to take your guns, is anti-vaccine, anti-American, anti-government, and all the things that a conspiracy website or &quot;alternative media&quot; website dedicates all its time discussing, often repeating information from other conspiracy websites which are not communicating any new information or events.  This website does not understand how science or the scientific method works and this is clearly seen when we look at the details of the articles that claim to report scientific findings.  When thinking independently and trying to understand reality, you will often find yourself looking at the methods used in a scientific study to see if their method does in fact prove or lead one to believe the claim they are making is supported. </p>

<p>This is what most conspiracy theorists overlook and fail to understand when discussing the nature of academia especially in regards to the hard sciences and medicine.  Knowing this is necessary to understand reality and the important distinctions between the academic fringe and the academic mainstream.  You should never accept a scientist&#39;s conclusions just because they are a scientist, you should look at and understand their methods for producing the conclusion they came to.  This will not only give you a better understanding of the subject and why something is true but it will prevent you from believing inaccurate things(robs you over the possible control that specific knowledge on a subject gives you in life).  This false authority we give to people with titles such as scientist, academic, etc is lazy inquiry and will lead to inaccurate beliefs.  Trust no one and question everything.   Academics and scientists who are in the mainstream, are mainstream, because they have the most encompassing and sound method for deducing something which is something verifiable that we can examine ourselves.  If a new development is made and verified in a field then the entire academic/scientific community shifts its position on it instantly and drops all beliefs that are linked to the dated(disproven) view. The disproven view then shifts to the fringe where they lose relevancy to the field they are in.  You will find that the views conspiracy theorists hold in regards to science and academia, time after time after time, are only supported by the fringe.  In particular on vaccines, the concept of cures being withheld, climate change, chemtrails, other supposed sources of poisoning and most other views that make claims that are easily verifiable by looking at the hard sciences related to them.      </p>

<p>One of the titles of the most read articles is titled &quot;Life After Death is Real, Concludes Scientific Study of 2,000 Patients&quot;! This article alone should give you reason enough to reflect on the nature of this website and the accuracy of it.  It is essentially click bait for people who are not aware of the current academic and philosophical understandings that currently exist on the subject or people who do not understand how to analyze good method.  Time to look at the article and how it does not prove what it says it does and it is clearly just some attempt to produce content for their website(serving their financial interest).  </p>

<p>TLDR: I know you aren&#39;t willfully ignorant. Read it. </p>

<p>You thinking that more harm has been done and Americans are less safe by not showing/producing an image of bin laden is laughable. Please explain your reasoning behind this. Bin laden was a real threat doing real damage such as funding operations and producing videos &quot;rallying the troops&quot;.  Al Qaeda knows he was killed by Americans and the rest of the Islamic extremist world knows this as well.  The US government does not care if you decide to ignore the facts. His memory is not better served by having an image of him being a martyr existing. Your curiosity is not worth risking other people&#39;s lives.  Grow up. </p>
