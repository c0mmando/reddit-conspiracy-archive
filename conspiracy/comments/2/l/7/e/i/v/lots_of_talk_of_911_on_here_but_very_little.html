       Compared to 9/11 - they were significantly more crisp with their delivery of the narrative that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember - this was 12 years after 9/11, so their newly established DHS had 12 years to become trained, run drills, and integrate with local police departments.
       <strong>
        Coincidentally, they were running drills that day of multiple bombings.

       As to your question, OP - a lot of us here don't talk about it either because we already did the research 18 months ago as it happened live and Boston used it as an excuse to do a door-to-door military exercise, locking down a major US city, and successfully conditioning the American people that those armor-plated vehicles are a good idea
       <em>
        just in case
       </em>
       (#bostonstrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe that's just why I don't talk about it - it's depressing to relive it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that helps.

       Excellent post. No wonder it is on the 'controversial' page already.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 is to most young people like the JFK assassination is/was to the generation before them: something that happened 'a long time ago' whose consequences they can't grasp because the world they grew up in was never different.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the Boston Hoaxathon, Sandy Hoax and Aurora 'Shooting' Hoax are downvoted so much on this subreddit: because these are recent events which actually CAN and WILL open peoples eyes to what is going on in the US right now, if they are exposed to the overwhelming evidence that the official narratives are completely ridiculous.

       I never really thought of this - and it's a great point. Looking at my 14-year-old nephew - I'm sure he feels this way. If only there was an appropriate way to bring up
       <strong>
        the biggest terror attack in the history of the US
       </strong>
       without being a social pariah...

       Great points! I have used these events successfully as wedges to get people to start questioning things. But it has to come up organically in conversation to have any effect.

       The problem with the bag guys is they've still got their bags after the explosion occurred.

       I disagree. The problem with the Craft Guys is there is still no valid excuse for ex-Seal Team Three, now private civic mercenaries (think Blackwater/Xe/Academi) be doing,
       <em>
        deployed
       </em>
       , at the Boston Marathon in 2013? Isn't that a valid concern? I'd love to know why my government is paying private contractor mercs. Because they don't really have any loyalty, do they? I mean, they're mercs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course there's that ridiculous photo which I won't link that shows the team hanging out at the intersection in front of a black van, with blue and red arrows everywhere. It's a silly photo that I don't think really adds to the argument and only serves to distract.

       two different dudes, there were multiple craft types wandering around and standing about in pairs at Boston, they made themselves absent after the smoke bombs went off.

       That photo doesnt prove innocence. It proves these two clowns were standing around doing nothing when they were presumably there to help with security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have a pic of either of these clowns lifting a finger to help? Or do they just let random shirtless passersby administer life saving aid while they stand around listening to their earpiece?

       Watched the first 5 minutes: complete bullshit. The strap is surely to try and stop some bleeding? And just because a guy had ragged clothes but no injuries it's a conspiracy?

       And images of Christian 'chilling' and lying down. The narrator is just commenting on images that he couldn't
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       have any idea what is actually going through their heads.

       Edit: oh and he has some 'pipe' from his leg. Ridiculous.

       Edit 2: Finished the video just incase I was missing out on some enlightened bit of genius. Nope, the basic premise is look at this one picture, he/she doesn't look injured enough to my standard of non-medically informed opinion.

       You are either part of the agenda or willingly ignorant. There are so many holes in the story its downright absurd. Whoever the director is in the red shirt and glasses should be fired or demoted to actor. But they have done a few things right and one of them being that the lie is so big no one would ever believe it could be untrue. Boston Strong, Newtown Strong, Ottawa Strong? Really? I hope you donated some of your hard earned money to the "victims". Especially to the guy in the wheelchair with his fake legs and the lack of blood that should be squirting all over the place. Does the blood clot that quickly when your FLIPPIN LEGS are blown off? Its comical bro. Did you see the lady that ran across the entire seen with her bandages already on and then laid down? One of the better ones. Or all the glass that should have been blown into the building and not out on the sidewalk? Or the fact that no one lost any arms or head? And yeah, I usually carry a strap in my hoodie too, just in case Im in a bomb situation and someones leg gets blown off yo. At least you are willing to admit the guy pulled a strap from his flippin hoodie - right where I keep mine ;) Haha!  I like your style.

       Youre precious. Care to explain the princess in this video that isnt anywhere near the "firecracker" yet is already wrapped in bandages and walking towards the scene? Then conveniently lays down to receive "help". I would love to meet you and look you in the face while you tell me this wasnt a giant hoax. Plan on being in Wisconsin soon? I would love to buy you a cup of coffee. I'm lol'ing as i type this because youre such a joke.

       This sub tracked the photos of the Craft guys and interesting backpacks. That arab student thing didn't originate from this sub at all. In fact, how it was portrayed on mass media and the big subs on this site led me to believe it was simply a bullshit story (not saying some kid didn't die, but when the media starts howling on something in unison, you know fuckery is afoot) engineered to discredit the community on reddit and other social media platforms as a whole.

       It just begs the question of... Why would he bring up something that was proven to be untrue in a thread merely asking about Boston Marathon 2013?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an explosion of internet sleuths, sure, during the event (it was fantastically entertaining and I definitely subbed to r/findthebombers).
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is nothing different, in my view, than agent provacateurs which have been shown to show up to peaceful demonstrations (r/findthebombers) and incite violence and untruth (falsely propagate the Arab meme) to discredit the otherwise peaceful discussion (banned).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it that big of a stretch?

       how about this. ill keep my ignorant mouth shut about football, fantasy football, FIFA and pro wrestling
      </p>
      <p>
       if you keep your ignorant mouth shut about actual news and events.
      </p>
      <p>
       i see your account is only 3 months old. so basically you are like the guy who walks into a movie theater half way through a movie and loudly asks "What Did I Miss?" and expects everyone else to drop what they are doing, distract themselves from paying attention to what is happening next, just to bring your ignorant ass up to speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, how about instead of being that guy, you decide to sit it out and just wait for the next movie to start, because you will never fully understand what everyone else already knows is going on by tuning in halfway through. actual news is a little more complex to watch and comprehend than football, but at least your kinda trying, right? its unfortunate that you were too busy watching football to pay attention to actual news, but its not really anyone else's responsibility to explain to you what you missed.

       I've spent almost every day following every detail of the Boston Marathon Bombing since it happened, and i still don't know it all. so to me, its pretty obvious that you have not been following this story every day since it began, and that you are utterly clueless about the details of the story.

      <p>
       to demonstrate this fact, ill ask a simple question.

       What is your opinion on the shady alibi of FEMA deputy director Richard Serino during the Boston Marathon Bombing?

       Do you even remember what this conversation was about? This conversation was NOT about whether or not I believe the Boston Bombing was a false flag. My comment was about how this sub participated in a witch hunt of that missing student, who ended up being dead. You are so caught up in trying to prove me wrong (about something I haven't even talked about), that you completely forgot what we were even talking about. Read the thread title, then read my comment, then realize how far off base you are getting when you ask me these questions. Just stop.

       "be careful with your reply..." LOL. As if I care what some clearly obsessed conspiracy theorist on reddit thinks about me. Some of us have lives outside of this website ya know. And stop with the movie analogy. Comparing Reddit to a movie, and comparing me having a 3 month account to a person walking into a movie halfway through  is one of the most idiotic things I have ever heard.

       If you are trying to set yourself up as some of "voice of reason", don't you think a less aggressive approach would be more productive?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are working yourself into a bit of a lather by participating in discussions in this sub, are you are antagonising others in the process. At some point, unless you calm down and try to engage people constructively, other users will call for you to be banned from the sub. Is that your objective?

       Show me where I had an "aggressive approach".

      <p>
       It's so fucking hilarious. If I don't agree with something, all of a sudden you guys start saying things like "I'm being aggressive" and "I'm spitting venom across entire threads".
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the guy who called me a "bitter, derailing troll" is not aggressive. It's the person making very simple statements without personally attacking anyone who is being aggressive.

       This would be an exercise in futility, because you are not going to agree with anything anybody tells you on this sub, are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice to you is to ask somebody who you trust and whose opinion you value, to read the comments you have made in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and see what they think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are reluctant to do this, it may be because deep down, you know your comments don't reflect well on you.

       Youre precious. Care to explain the princess in this video that isnt anywhere near the "firecracker" yet is already wrapped in bandages and walking towards the scene? Then conveniently lays down to receive "help". I would love to meet you and look you in the face while you tell me this wasnt a giant hoax. Plan on being in Wisconsin soon? I would love to buy you a cup of coffee. I'm lol'ing as i type this because youre such a joke.
