        Dorothy Thompson was an American journalist and radio broadcaster
       </a>
       , who in 1939 was recognized by Time magazine as the second most influential woman in America next to Eleanor Roosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thompson was viciously attacked in an orchestrated campaign of what she termed “career assassination and character assassination.” She wrote: “It has been boundless, going into my personal life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Before long, her column and radio programs, her speaking engagements, and her fame were all gone. Today, she has largely been erased from history.

       Dorothy Thompson's career and character assassination was much worse though, the Zionists destroyed her when she was at the height of her profession. It also shows just how long the Zionists have been controlling the media.

       As much as I hate to make posts like this, I have to confess the trickling downvotes (-3 so far when it had 8 points) of my post above are piquing my interest a little bit. My post about Ms Thompson is absolutely backed up, documented and completely factual.

       This topic is being manipulated. The total upvotes are being shaved. I just screened the upvotes go from +92 to +90, as if people are "taking back" their previous upvotes.

       I would love to hear from the 2 people who just took their upvotes on this topic back.

       That's one of the ways posts are kept artificially low.  I don't know the exact mechanism but it's like you said - votes are either ignored or literally "removed" from the total.
      </p>
      <p>
       This becomes particularly obvious on certain posts that will have 60-70 comments while only having 20 votes, for instance (which happens quite a lot if you actually pay attention to it).

       Well it is obvious there was/is significant upvote shaving on this topic, I have been watching upvotes being shaved off this topic ever since I posted that I was going to keep a close eye on this post earlier today. All afternoon I have seen this topic gain a couple upvotes, then lose them a few minutes later. In just
       <em>
        today's
       </em>
       screenshots I have
       <strong>
        clear evidence of close to 50 upvotes being shaved from this topic
       </strong>
       , who knows how many more shaved upvotes went undocumented (I was not home for a couple hours, and I was not fully dedicated to watching every minute for what the votes were doing, so who knows how many more upvotes I could not get definitive proof of, my guess is quite a few more.)
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it is painfully obvious the reported vote totals on reddit cannot be relied upon to be accurate or real. I think this last week I have spent collecting evidence of voting fraud here poses just as many questions as it starts to answer.

       ..lol, I just watched total upvotes drop from 125 to 122 and the post lost another 2 points (110 to 108)..lulz.

       Alison Weir talks about Dorothy Thompson in a couple of her YouTube videos when she is discussing her book, so I am sure her book goes more in depth. I also read about Dorothy Thompson, in brief, in Douglas Reed's "Controversy of Zion" for some corroboration of Ms. Weir excellent research.

        “American movie-distributors refused to become involved in the distribution and exhibition of the motion picture after the A.D.L. and others expressed the fear that the film was harmful; the Rank Organization withdrew the picture in the United States.” Later the picture was released after censorship by the A.D.L.; “seventy two eliminations” were made at its command and a prologue was added assuring beholders that they might accept it as “a filmization of Dickens without anti-semitic intentions.” (In occupied Berlin the A.D.L. ban was final; the British authorities ordered Dickens withdrawn from German eyes).

        I was in America at this time and thus saw the fulfilment of a prediction made in a book of 1943, when I wrote that, as the secret censorship was going, Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens would one day be defamed as “anti-semites.” I thought to strain probability, to make a point, but it happened in all three cases: a Shakespearean actor-manager visiting New York was ordered not to play The Merchant of Venice, Dickens was banned, and the defamationists put Chaucer on their black-list.

        A private organization which can produce such results is obviously powerful; there is nothing comparable in the world. Mr. Vincent Sheehan wrote in 1949, “There is scarcely a voice in the United States that dares raise itself for the rights, any rights, of the Arabs; any slight criticism of the Zionist high command is immediately labelled as anti-semitic.” Miss Dorothy Thompson, whose picture and articles at that time were published everyday in hundreds of newspapers, similarly protested. Mr. Sheehan's popularity with book-reviewers immediately slumped; Miss Thompson's portrait and writings are seldom seen in the American press today.

       Ironically, the same thing happened to Douglas Reed. He was an influential and widely known author until he began to talk about Zionism and it's defects.

       They slink around in the dark. They write poison pen letters filled with lies. They use their political connections to curry favors. They twist the laws. They put pressure on employers and co-workers.

       One thing they take care over is not allowing their faces to be seen in the light.

       Anyone or any country that is being attacked by the Zionist controlled media is good in my book.
