       There is, supposedly, a method to break gold down to it's most basic element.  By ingesting this substance, you can optimize all of  your body's natural abilities.

       It's used in a few different types of medicine to do certain things but I doubt it is a cure-all. That's reductionist thought. There are plants and herbs that are more readily available and provide a holistic approach to body health that aid in the same things that gold is alleged to, like arthritis. Obviously you aren't going to manufacture a plant based mesh to repair a weak artery like they do with gold. The key is prevention before restoration. I have no doubt small amounts of colloidal gold would serve you well but so do Aloe and Turmeric.

       I'm sorry, I never meant to imply it's a cure-all, but it's something that, from what I've heard, could aid in the healing process.  It doesn't "cure" anything, it just makes the machine that is your body work better.

       But what interests me the most is it's alleged ability to make one's pineal gland stronger.  I've a recipe that I've been studying for a while now to create Ormus from salt.  I plan to test it first on some tomato plants.

       Hence why I posted it here.  If this is true, talk about suppressing information!  The thing about this substance, and the reason why it is also refered to as "philosopher's stone", is because it can be made from anything, but gold gives the most effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefor, "turning lead into gold" is exactly what it is, being that the substance you're creating is actually the basic block of every physical thing.

       This refers to the transformation of the "base" man into the enlightened man, not a literal
       <em>
        elemental
       </em>
       conversion. However, early kings and other wealthy men took the term literally, and so funded the experiments of alchemists, who were not quick to point out their error.

       Not sure, but it seems a fun experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept is that every physical thing is made from the same matter, and everything matter can be broken down to this level.  Gold just happens to reap the most, as it's the closest physical thing to the basic.
      </p>

       It sounds interesting and certainly possible.  We're all just beams of light condensed to a slow vibration, after all.  What's the process if you don't mind expanding?  And what does it produce?  For instance, would the output from using Gold be/look/work vastly different than if you were to use coal?

       Anecdotally, it's produced by heating gold until it burns to a fine dust. One proponent claims to have found deposits of it between the floor stones of the Egyptian temple atop Mt. Hermon, which apparently existed for the purpose of producing it. Moses burning the golden calf idol of the Hebrews, and making them consume the residue in a beverage, is an important part of the biblical Exodus story; and it suggests the effect of the substance is actually spiritual/psychological.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect the technique of burning gold was for a civilization for which electricity had been forbidden; and we can achieve the same effect far more efficiently today with a colloid produced by electrolysis.

       There is something to this concept, but you are not going to find the answer on the internet or in a book. All you will find is fakeness.

       You will see a process to make Ormus using acid, special salt, and lye. You will see many youtube videos on this. This is all BS. When you neutralize an acid with a base you make regular salt. Not with monotomic particles, but chemically pure salt and nothing more. The added salt in the first place is BS. It will make salt without adding salt. This is a chemical process called neutralization.

       Fair warning, anything that you find on this subject will be considered "pseudoscience" by the scientific community at large, which I think is a bullshit term, much akin to "heresy" in the religious sense.
