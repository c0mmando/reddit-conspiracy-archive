       Have you ever considered that the same people who control the US government control the drug trade? In the US, narcotics and the War on Drugs are strategies used to control the poor. These strategies rely on narcotics remaining illegal to keep the prices high.

       I don't understand how any logical reasoning can be made from being shot in the head twice. "Yeah. Definitely suicide." That should be the only indicator that the whole thing is bullshit, that he was off'd by someone. I'm pretty sure if I was going to commit suicide with my gun I wouldn't have to pull the trigger twice, not that I'd be able to anyway.

       Let's follow the money. The cartels want drugs illegal so they can make a lot of money. The banks want drugs illegal so they can launder the cartels money. The cops, DEA and other agencies want drugs illegal, so the cartels can make a lot of money so the cops can either get kick backs, greased palms, or just seize the money when they catch them. The private prisons that the United states citizens are paying for want as many inmates as possible because that  means they can charge the US more to house more "criminals." Pharmaceutical companies don't want people self medicating because it would cut into their profit margins. Alcohol companies don't want competition to make sure America's drug of choice - alcohol - has no legal competitors. It's a fucking rigged system. The real reason drugs stay illegal is because it is so damn profitable.

       Afghanistan has over 1400 mineral fields, containing barite, chromite, coal, copper, gold, iron ore, lead, natural gas, petroleum, precious and semi-precious stones, salt, sulfur, talc, zinc among many other minerals. so there's that reason as well, but mainly i agree with you on this point , its the heroin

       Not really, though drugs money may be buying a politician or two. The real campaign to keep drugs illegal is being paid for by the Police Officers associations, the Prison Officers associations, and the people who own private prisons (Who are also often the politicians) and the occasional judge being busted for selling kids into the prison system. All of them will be affected if drugs are made legal and the prison populations are halved, and Federal money for fighting drugs dries up.

       Not yet... for example so far marijuana dispensaries have just made it easier for growers to unload crops, so organized crime hasn't yet suffered too much. Not to mention other 'drugs' are yet to be affected so their larger income sources remain untouched

       No. It's going into creating regulations to exclude as many people from the market as possible. Legal or illegal doesn't matter, as long as they control the market. There will be winners &amp; losers, but there won't be much competition.

       The root of organized crime in the international drug distribution trade, (where the money is) has long since been the US government, used especially for CIA black ops and of course corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       So representatives of the US government have not needed much incentive to keep the trade illegal and thus profit margins through the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Gov seems to be willing to let go of some of these profits now though legalization. The business will go to Big Pharma which will have a lower profit margin, but expand market share.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real pay off for those who control the Gov is in population control. Washington has created a turn key totalitarian state in the US, but it is a police state in the Orwell model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much better than having to repress a people however as the mass middle class is being dismantled and they have no political representation is the Huxley Model, "Brave New World", where you give them Soma, or a legal drug that gives them a state of well being, euphoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who feel good, rarely rebel and thus one does not need to bring in the police, courts, prisons etc. which is expensive and messy.

      <p>
       Florida was set to vote for legalizing Marijauna. A Nevada businessman spent 2.5 million keep it illegal there, while financing it in Israel. (See sidebar, Sheldon Anderson). Additionally we have proof now that Senator Mitch McConnel's family is tied in with cocaine trade in the DC Area with the recent drug bust in the DC ports from they're family owned ship. He is among the hardest of anti drug legislators, yet has family caught redhanded in transferring drugs to the inner city of DC.

      <p>
       We have gone from a nation who condemed other nations for the high rate of convicted felons per capita, and the high prison populations, to a nation whose populations in prison dwarfs everyone else. Even our treatment of prisoners is less humane then other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly speaking, if it is a non-violent offense, it should be a non-violent punishment. If you didn't do anything but possess a contraband item, or be high, then fine the person, or put them in a white collar prison. Supermax for a drug offense is overkill and does nothing but turn a non-violent offender violent, because it exposes them to that violence and makes them live it for a time.

       I know this is an unpopular opinion here and maybe I need someone to explain where I'm wrong, but I believe the War on Drugs IS working because there are so many millions of Americans out there who DON'T use illegal drugs out of fear of ruining their lives, losing their jobs, getting arrested and/or going to prison.  Those are major deterrents for responsible adults and they wouldn't exist if there wasn't a war on drugs.

       Do you realize how many non-violent drug offenders are rotting away in jail cells all across the US, the country with by far the most prisoners on Earth and also the highest incarceration rate per capita?  And that many of these prisons are for-profit, meaning that the stockholders literally profit from keeping them as full as possible?  And that this amounts to little more than slave labor as a lot of these prisoners work manufacturing jobs while in jail, receiving pennies on the dollar as these products are then sold to the country and world at large?

       I think about this all the time.  I think about it through my own personal experiences and anecdotal evidence of good people I've seen get lost or dead because of shit like Heroin and Meth.  I think rehabs are bullshit, that your average drug abuser needs to go through 3, 4 or even 5 times before they begin seeing the light and acquire enough willpower necessary to never relapse again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I hear what you're saying and agree with most of it, especially the private prison stuff, but you're still talking about a very tiny fraction of the US population.  A small amount of people who may very well be "non-violent", although I'd argue that's subjective and applies mainly (probably exclusively) to marijuana dealers/users who are in jail for breaking the law.  The facts on the ground are still the same.  Cocaine, Heroin, Crack, Crystal Meth, and Rx meds are highly dangerous/addictive drugs that are ruining people's lives, destroying families and ravaging communities.  I don't want to see these problems exasperated because of across-the-board legalization/decriminalization where the only penalty is a 28 day stay in a hotel with other drug users where everyone's talking about how bad their lives are, how great getting high is and how much they can't wait to get out and get high again.  So I'm repeating myself cause I've been there done that.  Rehab is expensive ass bullshit that only works for maybe 2 out of every 10 people who visit one.  Just about everyone relapses eventually.  It's probably still cheaper to put them in prison than to perpetually house them in rehabs and halfway houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we can crunch some numbers on that, I never have, have you?  I'd like to know how much more cost effective it would be to send drug dealers and abusers to a nice fluffy inpatient rehab facility than it is to send them to a cold hard jail cell.

       I agree with you that hard drugs like coke heroine pcp and meth should be criminalized for public policy reasons and due to the destructive nature of these substances.  That is not to say that i believe police and three letter agencies should abuse drug laws to enrich themselves, but such is life and the nature of man.  I think pot, however, should be legal.

      <p>
       How is it subjective?  Either the crime they committed was violent in nature or it wasn't, there isn't really any grey area.  Drug offenders are non-violent in almost 100% of cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the marijuana laws are and have always been
       <strong>
        bullshit
       </strong>
       .  If you're going to use "well they broke the law" in your argument then we probably won't ever see eye to eye on this subject.  One of the main reasons marijuana is illegal in the first place is to keep the prisons packed.

       Couple things here.  First off, have you looked at all into what some other countries are doing with regards to this i.e. clean needle exchanges?  If you haven't, you should.  You'll note that this has predominantly

       drug users,
       <em>

       The second point is that putting a drug addict in jail isn't helping them either.  Drugs are very easy to get behind bars and our entire "penal system" is shit for rehabilitation as has been proven millions of times over the last 100 or so years.

       Also, it isn't a black and white situation.  There is a lot of room between "decriminalize everything, do whatever you want" and what we have now - which is literally about as horrible a system as I can imagine.

        It's probably still cheaper to put them in prison than to perpetually house them in rehabs and halfway houses.

       Cheaper for who?  For the most part our taxes are what's supporting the largest prison population on the planet both in total inmates and per capita.  For instance, it apparently costs the municipality I live in over
       <strong>
        $160,000 per year, per inmate
       </strong>
       .  Is that cheap?  That's over 3 times what I make in a year which is itself on the higher end of what most people in this country are making.

       Edit:  Note that I live in NYC so that number is probably higher than most anywhere else but the point still stands.  Look up some of these numbers for yourself - you'll probably be surprised by what you find.

       The reason your opinion is unpopular is that it is horribly, horribly wrong.

      <p>
       The European experiment with acceptance, treatment and free 'hard' drugs has proven that hate doesn't work at all - but love does.

       Please, think about your best friend or children, and imagine them trapped in a crisis of health that could send them to prison.  It is appalling and ignorant.
