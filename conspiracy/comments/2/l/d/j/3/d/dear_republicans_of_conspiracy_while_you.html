<p>They have the power as of now, to do all of the things they have promised to do.</p>

<p>None of those promises will be kept.  Just like Obama abandoned his party politics when he won the presidency and started ruling for the elite ruling class and obstructing REAL justice when it threatened to expose the actual government of super secret and unaccountable intelligence agencies, the republicans will now do the same to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step to getting a large amount of the population to realize this is to drop the labels. Which is hilariously easier said than done. We are conquered because we&#39;re divided. It&#39;s always us-vs-them. The sooner we drop the party lines and divisions, we can start to identify common goals and threats. And the common threat for ALL of us, regardless of affiliation, is that our choices and voices in the world don&#39;t matter at all, because dangerous  powerful people decide things, and not on our behalf. As <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> said, no matter our election choices, things remain the same.</p>

<p>There is this thing called a &quot;veto&quot; that the President can do which can only be overridden by a 2/3 majority in Congress. The Republicans do not have a 2/3 majority in either House.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of those promises will be kept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will introduce bills to reppeal the ACA at least monthly.</p>

<p>They might finally successfully tag Obama with the &quot;impeached&quot; tag. All that takes is a simple majority of the House of Representatives, which the Republicans now have. To <strong>convict</strong> (and thus remove from office) the President on the charges for which he is impeached requires a 2/3 majority of the Senate, which the Republicans do not possess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...nothing will change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we&#39;ll get to hear about how the Republicans passed all these wonderful, awesome laws through Congress but the President obstructed them with vetoes. That will be the spin. The reality will be that the laws the R&#39;s pass would be tragically detrimental to the normal American.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m <em>hoping</em> Obama would veto that shit.</p>

<p>If Obama ratifies bills that come from Congress that are completely against what the Democratic Party paints its values as, that would tend to mean it&#39;s more pervasive and blatant and less fearful of discovery than if he does veto bills completely against Democratic Party principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They just have to get him to say something under oath that they can twist to be construed as &quot;not entirely true&quot;, as they did with Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not entirely sure he even has to commit any crime aside from being of the opposite political party from over half the House and 2/3 of the Senate. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States:">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States:</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist.</p></li>
<li><p>The House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article or the resolution as a whole to pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Once in the Senate... The U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for conviction.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nixon tried to get his Impeachment ruled upon by the federal judiciary, bu the Supreme Court put the Kibash on it.</p>

<p>Seems like charges can be &quot;trumped up&quot; as long as you know you have the votes to get what you want.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I can tie your dual citizen of Israel to the USA being glass. One of the reasons - possibly the main reason - the USA is not glass is that before it became glass, it would also make glass out of whomever launched the attack. Mutually Assured Destruction. Nobody sane will launch.</p>

<p>(Side note: This is why it&#39;s so rightfully frightening for terrorists to get their hands on nukes. They&#39;re insane. They don&#39;t care.)</p>

<p>This statement is incorrect. 
The 3 branches are Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. 
The Executive is Democrat President Obama and his cabinet of Secretaries (State, Defense, Education etc.)
The Judicial is the non-partisan (neither Democrat nor Republican) Supreme Court. 
The Republicans now control both chambers of Congress (the House and Senate).  Better stated as &quot;Republicans are now a majority in ONE of the three branches of government.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called Hydra.  You can learn all about it by watching the agents of shield or if you prefer the real world version of it you can look for the 4th Reich or the red house report.  Intelligence report No. Ew-pa 128.</p>

<p>Operation paperclip, Hitler living to old age in Argentina, Prescott Bush.  Etc etc etc.</p>

<p>All the information is out there but people are too busy playing make believe politics and fighting over abortions and gay marriage.  Once someone opens their eyes to the 4th Reich or the NWO... whatever you want to call it.  You start to see how WWII never really ended.  The poor citizens of Nazi Germany who gained nothing from that political party paid for the sins of the 3rd Reich.  The actual Nazis went underground, with the help of embedded allies within the American intelligence communities.  Operation paperclip, the red house report etc etc. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t call themselves Nazis anymore, but they walk among us.</p>

Let us unite, be strong and take the greatest country ever known to even greater heights. It will take alot of work and time but i believe it will happen soon.
