<p>Hm, I wonder if the Republican victory yesterday contributed to these folks openly donning the proverbial aluminum headgear...?</p>

<p>This comment is currently at nearly 600:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I work in performance testing, so I do a lot of work testing out environments when they want to shake down their fail over procedures (fail over is when one of the computers in a system fails, and the automatic backups take over).</p>

<p>After looking at the technical specs for Ohio 2004, there is no doubt in my mind that the election was stolen. The system was designed to facilitate it. At one point, the vote count in a particular county was going for Kerry, then a fail over occurred (for no reason that I could discern), and control of the vote count was handed off to a backup reporting server hosted in another state by a partisan Republican consulting firm who had been found guilty of electoral fraud previously. When the system came back up, Bush was suddenly winning.</p>

<p>No valid reason for the fail over was ever presented. The case died, because two years after the fact, what are they going to do? They got away with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ohio &#39;04 was clearly won through illegal manipulation. While many of the voting records were destroyed, some workers were able to same some evidence. They found very unlikely statistical things, like entire Districts voting for Bush unanimously but showing disagreement on every other vote during the race. These anomalies cropped up all over Ohio.</p>

<p>You can read all about it, and see the data, in the book <a href="http://electiondefensealliance.org/witness_crime_citizens_audit_american_election">Witness to a Crime: A Citizen&#39;s Audit of An American Election.</a> Pretty damning stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ohioan here. Major metro area. My voting machine changed my vote from Kerry to Bush on the review page. If I wasn&#39;t so new to voting/young and naieve I would have raised hell. Instead, I just corrected it and re-selected Kerry. Then submitted. I greatly regret that I didn&#39;t have the ability to raise hell about that at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s better late than never, but this comment pretty much sums up how I feel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is hysterical. The Republicans win a big election, and reddit finally gives a fuck about voter fraud?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly predictable, but at least the conversation is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Democrats are worse at the game and also outnumber the GOP by tens of millions.  They&#39;re flat out less capable of fraud and would probably fix up their anemic Get Out the Vote! efforts before stealing elections on orders from on high.

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta vote man. It IS all a sham, but it&#39;s the only way we&#39;ve got (atm) to try and make a difference. Ideally, we should be marching in the streets calling for revolution, but until then you gotta try at every opportunity to make it harder for them to take over completely, even if it&#39;s small.<br/>
  For example, the soda companies spent beaucoup dollars in my area to try and convince people to not vote to increase taxes on Soda. Since they obviously didn&#39;t want people to vote for that, of course I went out and voted for it. Measure passed in my city, didn&#39;t pass in the bigger city next door. So now people in my city will have to pay a ridiculous amount for soda (it&#39;s already ridiculous that sugar-water costs as much as it does where I live now), which means some people might stop drinking it, which means maybe a couple people might be living a little healthier, and Coca Cola doesn&#39;t get as much money to shovel in it&#39;s maw.<br/>
  Now, what if a LOT of people get healthier, and then other counties (like the bigger city across the water) see the example &amp; follow suit? THEN we see serious hits to Coca Cola&#39;s profits....THEN we, as a population, have won a small victory over an impossibly-large organization. A seemingly insignificant plunk can ripple out in a lot of big and unforeseen ways. You&#39;re never gonna win the war with the capitalist system we have in place now, but you can make it harder for the machine to commodify &amp; ingest you completely. That&#39;s the (potential) power of a vote. It&#39;s important that we not write it off all together; a victory in a small battle is still a victory nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what do you suggest? Not vote at all? Some sort of acceleration gambit here...like, if we just lay down and let them do all the stuff they wanna do and shit all over us completely, then maybe everyone will get mad enough to do something?

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck this voting manipulation controversy bullshit. While it&#39;s certainly possible (or likely) that the votes are manipulated, it generally doesn&#39;t matter which way you vote because the country is going to shit anyway. It&#39;s all semi-mainstream manufactured dissent which will eventually hit mainstream which will then &quot;make&quot; the government &quot;investigate&quot; and &quot;fix&quot; the issues that were &quot;discovered&quot; and then the mainstream media will trumpet the success of the people as we &quot;joined together&quot; to stop the abuse. We might see some well-publicized protests if they&#39;re beneficial. It all further drive us into the false reality that our votes make a difference. And it works unsurprisingly well.</p>
