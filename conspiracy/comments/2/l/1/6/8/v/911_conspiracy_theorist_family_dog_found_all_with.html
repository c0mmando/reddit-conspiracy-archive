<p>Here is one of the last audios I could find of him.  He makes too much sense, is too smart, level headed, and credentialed to discredit, so they had to kill him.<br/>

<p>EDIT: The bots took over the comments.  Here is a short video debate that summarizes his murder and why it is so suspicious.  Professional Cleaning crews came to the house and cleaned it before the investigation was done.  The guy who is debunking the murders says &quot;and again i&#39;m not a fan of the Saudis&quot; at least five times.  Someone is protecting the Saudis.<br/>

<p><a href="http://sheriff.co.calaveras.ca.us/Portals/sheriff/Press/2013/Update_Marshall_Investigation.pdf">Here is a report</a> about the death from the local Sheriff.</p>

<p>My previous comment on this was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police summary of events seems quite detailed. The gun was registered to him, he was seen buying the ammunition shortly before the murders, for the suicide shot the gun was held in a way that would have been difficult for another person.</p>

<p>He had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and had a history of depression and mental illness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tragic event for sure, but the only reason anyone is suggesting it is suspicious is because of who he is, not any of the known facts of the killing.</p>

<p>For the &#39;who he is&#39; thing - what sense does it make to kill a 9/11 conspiracy writer after he&#39;s written and published two books?</p>

<p>Surely if conspirators were killing anyone to keep the truth of 9/11 under wraps it would be people you&#39;d never heard of... They&#39;d be the ones with the real good information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor is itself a blunt tool.</p>

<p>Often the simplest and most obvious explanation is NOT the correct one.</p>

<p>For example, the most obvious explanation for the shape of the Earth, is that it is flat, because that is what we can see with our eyes. It seems counter intuitive that the Earth is spherical, unless one has additional knowledge.</p>

<p>Edit: or take the example of whether the Earth goes around the sun, or the sun around the Earth - the simplest explanation, that was believed for thousands of years, is that the sun travels around the Earth, as do the rest of the Heavens. It took a lot of work the accumulation of a lot of knowledge to undo that simple explanation.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor doesn&#39;t always work. It often depends on how much knowledge and information one has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor means the solution that makes the least assumptions is generally correct, not necessarily the simplest.</p>

<p>Zeus makes lightning. Simple. But you have to assume there&#39;s a God on top of mount Olympus that no man has seen.</p>

<p>The workings of how clouds generate lightning is very complex, but there are almost no assumptions made anymore thanks to the scientific method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, that was a correct use of Occam&#39;s razor. It&#39;s a principle for forming a theory on the basis of available data, it doesn&#39;t matter what the data is.  </p>

<p>The possibilities here are either </p>

<p>a) mentally ill man commits murder/suicide, police accurately report it. 
Or<br/>
b) 9/11 conspiracy theorist is onto the truth, powerful people accidentally let him publish books about this truth, but then become scared that he knows too much. Rather than making his death appear accidental, they kill him and all his family and either make it look like a suicide or just make the police lie.  </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor can&#39;t tell you that one of these is true and one isnt, but without anot other evidence, it makes more sense to believe the simple story. If you always take the simpler story as truth, you&#39;ll probably  be right more often than wrong.</p>

<p>Nope, that was a correct use of Occam&#39;s razor. It&#39;s a principle for forming a theory on the basis of available data, it doesn&#39;t matter what the data is.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, good comment. I generally agree with what you said, and this is especially important:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occam&#39;s razor can&#39;t tell you that one of these is true and one isn&#39;t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that Occam&#39;s Razor tells us when we should question why we&#39;re leaping to the less likely conclusion, not that it&#39;s always wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you always take the simpler story as truth, you&#39;ll probably  be right more often than wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only thing I have a problem with. Occam&#39;s Razor isn&#39;t about simplicity, it&#39;s about introducing new assumptions.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s take 9/11. Many conspiracy theorists look at the buildings falling and see something that looks like the way a controlled demolition behaves. They then assume that this is what happened. But this requires introducing a new set of causes, rather than the fuel-laden plane that had just slammed into it, and which most experts agree would have weakened key supports via heat, leading to a chain of failures.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation is, &quot;what looks like a demolition is,&quot; but the one which introduces the fewest new assumptions is that the complex interaction of burning jet fuel and a building built to withstand small plane impact produces the same result.</p>

<p>It&#39;s never going to be better to add unnecessary complexity, where there is no evidence to justify it. Where there is such evidence, if it is sufficient it will make the more complex theory the simplest explanation. That&#39;s not an argument against Occam&#39;s razor,</p>

<p>The gun was held inverted against his temple. That is perhaps the easiest and most relaxed position, but it&#39;s equally possible (and not difficult) for someone to hold a handgun against their head the right way up, or even on it&#39;s side (in one direction at least). </p>

<p>So the gun being held in what would be the normal way for another person placing it against the victim&#39;s head wouldn&#39;t be unusual for a suicide, as the person could easily hold it themselves in the same position.</p>

<p>But being held upside down, while easy for a suicide victim, would be more difficult for an assassin.</p>

<p>Marshall&#39;s blog is still up. And whether he did what he is accused of or not, he <em>did</em> do years of research on 911 and his blog is well worth reading.  </p>

<p>There is talk of the censored 28 pages now and most people say that those pages deal with the Saudi Government and their involvement. </p>

<p>Well look at what Phillip Marshall wrote:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WANT ANSWERS? WHO TRAINED THE 9/11 HIJACKERS TO FLY BOEING JETLINERS  </p>

<p>Dozens of reports focused on the pilot/hijackers Mohamed Atta, Hani Hanjour, Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al-Shehhi. Flight instructors around the United States told similar stories of attempting to train them. All four had a very difficult time in their basic training on small, single-engine airplanes...SNIP </p>

<p>...So began my search for Middle Eastern operators of Boeing airliners. Because the hijackers were mostly Saudi Arabian, the firm of <strong>Dallah Avco</strong>, a Saudi operator of multiple private Boeing airliners, soon stood out as a focal point. <strong>To my amazement, I immediately discovered that Congressional investigators had already linked Dallah Avco with the actual hijackers.</strong> Omar Bayoumi, a Dallah employee and operative within the Saudi Ministry of Aviation, had provided housing and basic support for three hijackers: Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and the pilot/hijacker of American 77, Hani Hanjour.</p>

<p>FBI evidence of the cell would confirm that the hijacking team of American 77 had formed and operated separately <strong>with direct financial support from top-level members of the Saudi government</strong>, bitter enemies of al Qaeda. The picture was beginning to clear...Much More

<p>There&#39;s also the matter of his next book, which he said contained &quot;blockbuster&quot; new evidence.</p>

<p>Was that on his computer that AFAIK is still in the Sheriff&#39;s custody? Was that computer turned over to his ex wife? Was any physical evidence that the Sheriff detailed in the final report made public? Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s the point. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to let someone publish two books and gain a reasonably high profile within the 9/11 Truth community before killing them.</p>

<p>If they have real good information you kill them before anyone has heard of them. No one hears about their death or even has any idea that there might be any reason to question it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I say, I should have phrased it better.</p>

<p>The report says the gun was held upside down against his right temple. That is a very natural position for a right-handed shooter to hold a gun against their own head.</p>

<p>However, it would be quite unnatural for another person to hold a gun against the victim&#39;s head in that way. It would also make their grip substantially weaker if there was any chance of a struggle.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the gun had been help right way up, then it would be more ambiguous as that is an easy way for a person to hold a gun to their own head (only marginally less comfortable than upside down), and would also be the natural position for another shooter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying I&#39;m not claiming he was killed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what sense does it make to kill a 9/11 conspiracy writer after he&#39;s written and published two books?</p>

<p>Surely if conspirators were killing anyone to keep the truth of 9/11 under wraps it would be people you&#39;d never heard of... They&#39;d be the ones with the real good information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know how people like Richard Dawkins, Neil Tyson, Cristopher Hitchens(rip) are known for their cause and become a sort of a &quot;leader&quot; for their respectives &quot;movements&quot;? Well, perhaps he was gaining too much traction and they wanted to stop him before he got too big.</p>

<p>Sure, of course if we were to assume that it was a murder then there are plenty of scenarios that can be imagined which would explain why.</p>

<p>Although I think that leader one is probably a stretch - there are plenty of high profile figures and leaders in the 9/11 Truth movement, he never seems to have been one, or even been close to becoming one. From what I could see the last time this came up - he was actually very low profile until he died.</p>

<p>If we were imagining reasons then I prefer the idea that <em>they</em> had been monitoring his work on a new book and discovered that he was actually about to disclose some real new information. Something that had never been touched on before.</p>

<p>I mean depending on how powerful you think <em>they</em> are it could be assumed that every piece of 9/11 Truth information that&#39;s publicly known has been <em>allowed</em> to come out, indicating that perhaps it&#39;s all wrong. The real truth of the conspiracy in that scenario would be the idea we&#39;ve never actually heard. People are killed before it can come out. Usually they&#39;re people no one knows about, but in this case, because he&#39;d published about it before he was already known.</p>

<p>(I think I could be a pretty good conspiracy theorist if I wanted :) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually those are not very good ideas.</p>

<p>1- You can&#39;t kill everyone with a skeptic mind and anyone who asks &quot;why don&#39;t they release other tapes of the pentagon attack and silence the doubters?&quot;, &quot;why is the nist building model used to explain the collapse of building 7 kept a secret?&quot; and things like that. Which leads people to investigate further</p>

<p>2- He may have been low profile but (assuming they can monitor everything) they started seeing an increase in popularity</p>

<p>3- You have figures like Alex Jones, but nobody takes them seriously. Maybe he was a person smart, charismatic enough etc to be a REAL leader.</p>

<p>4- I have no idea who he is, his works or whatever, I&#39;m in a conspiracy theory subreddit making a conspiracy theory. No need to downvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this whole mess is an ancient Jewish plan millennia old that was concocted long before the word &quot;Zionist&quot; came into usage. The plan for world domination is in the Hebrew Bible. Now of course it has always been a minority of Jewry that have really understood and promoted this plan and still today hold the keys, but the vast majority of your average Jews have been trained from birth to hold the same anti-&quot;Gentile&quot; views expressed by the leadership, and are perfectly willing to assist the leadership in achieving their ancient plan against the rest of the human race. It&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy for them to find crisis actors and shills amongst the Jews. So Jews collectively share some guilt but the vast majority cannot really be blamed, as they are a product of their upbringing. Much like Christian Zionists who have been brainwashed by Judeo-Christianity into helping to doom their own children, Jews have been brainwashed into hating the rest of us through things like the Holocaust (TM) and the idea that non-Jews complain about Jews for no real reason (anti-semitism). I can&#39;t really blame your average Jew who is nothing but a pawn just like I cannot blame your average &quot;Gentile&quot; who is also nothing but a pawn. It&#39;s the &quot;elders&quot; who are to blame. On the other hand, the rest of us are to blame for letting it happen, Jew or not Jew. Most people just don&#39;t care about the truth and thus they do nothing against true evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually been talked about extensively, such as the leaks/cables that highlighted specific techniques used to discredit (misinform, and manipulate) social discourse in forums like ours.  Getting people to associate conspiracy theories (evidence-based) with wacko reactionary conspiracies is an age-old strategy.  Leading <a href="/r/conspitard">/r/conspitard</a> members even got caught planting anti-judaism and racist comments so they could say, &#39;see, they are all racist&#39;.  </p>

<p>Before people say, &#39;but it is evidence-based that Jews control this or that&#39;. Yes, sub-groups are involved in conspiracies.  But these strategies perpetuate &#39;us versus them&#39; by ignoring other subgroups that are just as involved in the conspiracies, like the fact the entire military industrial complex is owned and controlled by Christians.  Guess what, &#39;right-handed people&#39; control the world too!  Of course this is a silly statement, but that&#39;s what it looks like when we perpetuate racism using generalizations, rather then focus on the &#39;true&#39; other that is controlling the masses, e.g., &#39;the elites&#39;, which cross ethnic lines and existing in different shapes and forms in all societies.  The difference is &#39;power&#39; based, or &#39;class&#39; based, and they are trying their hardest to ensure no one pays attention to this.</p>

<p>Another common example is to say it is &#39;lizard-men&#39; instead of, you know, powerful generations-strong monied elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of the subreddit is not to question everything and connect the dots (though that&#39;s part of it...) its to seek the truth using a very particular framework:</p>

<p>Conspiracy = a secret action or plan between one or more parties to break the law or cause harm.</p>

<p>Theory = a cohesive and testable explanation or model based on reason, observation, and analysis which adequately describes a phenomenon using the totality of available evidence.</p>

<p>Here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, y&#39;all are real good at the conspiracies but not so great at the theories. Every once in a while something intriguing pops up - which is why I stay subscribed - but most of the time its junk and the interesting stuff winds up at <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a> or <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> after it passes through here.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that this sub defaults to tin-foil-hat theories and rather than changing the theory when asked a tough question, they just dismiss the tough question as shilling and return to the circlejerk.</p>

<p>What evidence from the scene was used to make the determination that its a murder suicide as opposed to outside party execution? If we&#39;ve got two plausible theories then the simpler will usually be true (Occam&#39;s Razor) and/or the one that attributes more to chance and incompetence than deliberate malevolence will usually be true (Hanlon&#39;s Razor.)</p>

<p>If a claim is made that its an outside party execution, then an extraordinary claim like that would require extraordinary evidence. Are there signs of forced entry? A weapon that did not belong to one of the victims? Residues or ballistics that are inconsistent with the narrative? Extra fingerprints? Video surveillance tapes from down the street that show a black helicopter landing in his back yard? When you look at it against the police report that another user (edit: <a href="/u/thinkmorebetterer">/u/thinkmorebetterer</a>) posted, there&#39;s just not enough evidence for a hit in the face of <a href="http://sheriff.co.calaveras.ca.us/Portals/sheriff/Press/2013/Update_Marshall_Investigation.pdf">overwhelming evidence of a murder-suicide.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So after all that, you really still think that a hit is at least an equally likely explanation based on the available information and using the fewest and simplest possible assumptions?</p>

<p>Theory A: guy had marital problems, debt, and bipolar disorder. He bought a gun and ammo, whacked his kids and dog in their sleep, then killed himself in a murder-suicide.</p>

<p>Theory B: the government creates a body double to buy a gun and ammunition and plant it in his house, the government conspired with his wife to get her to divorce him and used manipulation to convince him to run up unsustainable debts so it would look like he had motive, the gov sent in an agent to infiltrate the house with no signs of forced entry, executed the kids and dog in their sleep using the gun and ammo the body double planted, and then killed the subject in a position consistent with suicide. All of that with zero evidence of struggle or forensic evidence that there had been an outside party present while the conspiracy was organized <em>after</em> he published books exposing fringe theories about 9/11 that were not particularly well recieved.</p>

<p>Which one makes fewer and simpler assumptions to fit the available data? You can decide for yourself, but I know where I stand.</p>

<p>I think that there&#39;s such a big conspiracy element to his downfall during his life that tacking on the conspiracy about his death only serves to discredit the former part. It&#39;s weird that there were two gun shots but you have to assume the first would be non-fatal and the secon would be fatal right? Two fatal gun shots makes no sense in either case (suicide or assassination). Then it would seem that the double gunshots add less information then it would seem at first glance. It also doesn&#39;t make sense to kill him years after the fact. That&#39;s just my tale at least.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it&#39;s seldom that simple. Obviously there are people who seem stereotypically &#39;suicidal&#39; but many seem completely normal, outwardly, until they actually take their lives. </p>

<p>Mental illness can be a horrible thing, and it&#39;s a tragedy that it gets so stigmatised that people are afraid to seek help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_operation">Black Ops is indeed a thing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A black operation or black op is a covert operation by a government, a government agency, or a military organization. This can include activities by private companies or groups. Key features of a black operation are that it is clandestine, it has negative overtones, and it is not attributable to the organization carrying it out.[1] The main difference between a black operation and one that is merely clandestine is that a black operation involves a significant degree of deception, to conceal who is behind it or to make it appear that some other entity is responsible (&quot;false flag&quot; operations).[2][3]</p>

<p>... </p>

<p><strong>Examples of black operations</strong></p>

<p>In 2007 the Central Intelligence Agency declassified secret records detailing illegal domestic surveillance, assassination plots, kidnapping, and infiltration and penetration of other &quot;black&quot; operations undertaken by the CIA from the 1950s to the early 1970s. CIA Director General Michael Hayden explained why he released the documents, saying that they provided a &quot;glimpse of a very different time and a very different agency&quot;.[9]</p>

<p>In May 2007 ABC News, and later the Daily Telegraph, reported that United States president George W. Bush had authorized the CIA to undertake &quot;black operations&quot; in Iran in order to promote regime change as well as to sabotage Iran&#39;s nuclear program.[10][11] ABC News was subsequently criticized for reporting the secret operation, with 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney saying he was &quot;shocked to see the ABC News report regarding covert action in Iran,&quot; but ABC said the CIA and the Bush Administration knew of their plans to publish the information and raised no objections.[12]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are now more than ever helpless...free thinking open minded people have no voice in this society,  no matter how hard the evidence for conspiracies (facts) are presented. The people are brain washed and the elite have learnt from their predecessor&#39;s, capitalism has taken its toll. Looking back into history revolutions are completely necessary and plausible,  now it seems only possible if people are thrown into slavery like conditions, which will not happen until the ruling class has total control through globalization and technology. Governments are fast taking rights away from the people and the majority don&#39;t even bat an eyelid, we just wait for someone else to take action.</p>

<p>We need an awareness campaign targeting the (simple minded) unaware majority. This must be filled with hard presentable facts and reason behind how things are getting worse and how the system and people in charge need to be overthrown...A collective effort into an awareness video entailing how fucked things are and how a collective action needs to be taken now. It is becoming worse as their influence and control is increasing it is imperative for us to take action collectively. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t wait, the struggle is getting worse and worse and it is up to us the free thinkers to collaborate in order to aware the masses and create positive change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Readers of this post might enjoy this fictional take on a subject on everyone’s mind today:
Jihad in America travels on the wind. Can the government, dodgy as it is, possibly stand up to a real attack? 
While a nuclear terrorist attack is unlikely, in a bioterror epidemic, the genetically engineered plague is invisible. Our borders are vulnerable, and metal detectors are useless, even as ISIS, the Islamic State, raises its menacing black flag in Syria and Iraq.
What if the government is helpless, gridlocked in perpetual party conflict and rancor?</p>

<p>BEYOND TERRORISM: SURVIVAL is the fictional story of two unlikely strangers who found a way to survive the apocalypse, the most deadly terrorist attack in history.

<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/9-11-conspiracy-theorist-philip-marshall-kills-his-2-children-dog-and-himself">According to Santa Barbara View</a>, Philip Marshall&#39;s book accused the Bush administration of being in cahoots with the Saudi intelligence community .. he said “a coordinated training operation prepared the hijackers to fly heavy commercial airliners.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Bush / Saudi connection is total bullsh*t, his intelligence minders were Jews not Saudis.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As well there were no hijackers, since the planes that struck the WTC Towers were flown by remote control, using technology developed by Bush&#39;s one time &quot;Senior Foreign Policy Advisor&quot; <a href="http://100777.com/node/1836">Rabbi Dov Zakheim,</a> who stole 2.3 trillion dollar$ while Comptroller at the Pentagon!</p>

<p>Airplane homing beacons had been installed in the offices of Kroll Associates in both towers, by one time WTC Security Chief and co conspirator <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=iLt4OYwyt68C&amp;amp;pg=RA4-PA17&amp;amp;lpg=RA4-PA17&amp;amp;dq=Airplane+homing+beacons+Kroll+Associates&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=q5MM8Ev3Lm&amp;amp;sig=ohcYvSNgALAo6__qeXjRWlYLjJo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=k2VcU5zuDpS68gWYpYLACg&amp;amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Airplane%20homing%20beacons%20Kroll%20Associates&amp;amp;f=false">Jerome Hauer</a>, who began the <a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=117351">OBL did it myth</a> in an interview with Dan Rather at CBS in New York on the morning of the attacks!</p>

<p>So for whatever reason Philip Marshall his two kids and his dog finished up dead on February 6, 2013, it was not because of 911 truth since his 911 input was total bullsh*t, that avoided the issue of Jewish culpability!</p>

<p>I believe the whole airplane drama was just cover for the controlled demolitions of the towers. A missile hit the pentagon. Usama was murdered in 2001. For 9/11, Silverstein knew, Cheney knew, Rumsfeld was in on it.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So after all that, you really still think that a hit is at least an equally likely explanation based on the available information and using the fewest and simplest possible assumptions?</p>

<p>Theory A: guy had marital problems, debt, and bipolar disorder. He bought a gun and ammo, whacked his kids and dog in their sleep, then killed himself in a murder-suicide.</p>

<p>Theory B: the government creates a body double to buy a gun and ammunition and plant it in his house, the government conspired with his wife to get her to divorce him and used manipulation to convince him to run up unsustainable debts so it would look like he had motive, the gov sent in an agent to infiltrate the house with no signs of forced entry, executed the kids and dog in their sleep using the gun and ammo the body double planted, and then killed the subject in a position consistent with suicide. All of that with zero evidence of struggle or forensic evidence that there had been an outside party present while the conspiracy was organized <em>after</em> he published books exposing fringe theories about 9/11 that were not particularly well recieved.</p>

<p>Which one makes fewer and simpler assumptions to fit the available data? You can decide for yourself, but I know where I stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occam&#39;s razor is itself a blunt tool.</p>

<p>Often the simplest and most obvious explanation is NOT the correct one.</p>

<p>For example, the most obvious explanation for the shape of the Earth, is that it is flat, because that is what we can see with our eyes. It seems counter intuitive that the Earth is spherical, unless one has additional knowledge.</p>

<p>Edit: or take the example of whether the Earth goes around the sun, or the sun around the Earth - the simplest explanation, that was believed for thousands of years, is that the sun travels around the Earth, as do the rest of the Heavens. It took a lot of work the accumulation of a lot of knowledge to undo that simple explanation.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor doesn&#39;t always work. It often depends on how much knowledge and information one has.</p>
