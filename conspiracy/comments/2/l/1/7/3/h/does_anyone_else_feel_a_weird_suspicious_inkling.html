If there was a &#39;shadow group&#39; that controlled both resources and space travel, they&#39;d neither want a company mining for gold and diamonds and other resources in space where they are plentiful, thus, bringing the cost of these minerals down (eventually, I&#39;m assuming gold from space and diamonds from space may cost more, because of the initial investments in technology and infrastructure and equipment to get it), nor would they want any company to even be in space that isn&#39;t &#39;in the know&#39; about alien civilizations that may be just past our planet.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? I&#39;d love to have a discussion with anyone that is interested in this sort of stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. The most effective means of sabotaging this shit would be financially, which TPTB could have done at a whim.</p>

<p>However...</p>

<p>It could also not be TPTB. Could be a rival billionaire or something, someone without the endless resources of a government or governments, but with enough scratch to do a brute-force fuck-em op on the companies that suffered the failures.</p>

<p>It could also be some straight-up bad luck that will bring the eggheads back to the drawing boards. Rocket science is not trivial shit. One digit wrong, and you don&#39;t get rockets, you just get the science laughing in your face,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I think:  Its sketchy as hell that in the New York Times articles, the events don&#39;t acknowledge each other whatsoever, despite two catastrophic space mission failures never having occurred with this kind of chronological proximity before.  I think the fact that Antares was self destructed 15 seconds after ignition is pretty sketchy.  I think the fact that nothing in way of even speculation has been offered as the roots and causes for either failure is pretty sketchy.  I think the fact that they&#39;re both private american space company mission failures occurring in the span of 3 days is sketchy.  Here&#39;s what I know: there have been shitloads of UFO sightings in the Mohave where the virgin galactic crash just occurred.  Every report on Antares makes note that the craft was self-destructed.  It seems to me like none of the explosions we witness in the video occurred due to failure, but due to this self destruct.  My questions, then, are &quot;how, in the 15 seconds since ignition, can the decision to self-destruct possibly be made, and is there a guy with his hand over the button during every unmanned launch, and they can&#39;t just cut the engines and salvage what they can, that&#39;s not more efficient than blowing up a billions of dollars craft?  And hypothetically, if aliens are among us or whatever, setting back the private space sector would behoove the government in keeping their presence somewhat clandestine.  In the context of an unmanned rocket resupply mission that doesn&#39;t make much sense (except it sort of could given the mosquito larvae on-board or whatever), but it makes a lot of sense for the virgin galactic crash.  Also, in the most prominent amateur video (and fastest to hit the web/reddit) of Antares, a suspiciously audible comment of &quot;That&#39;ll teach nasa to privatize space exploration&quot; is heard.  All the top comments on that video in <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> were referring to this audible comment.  It appeared like shilling to me, and I think if these were/are examples of sabotage, TPTB are attempting to dismantle the private space sector.  If SpaceX suffers some kind of setback in the near future I am gonna be pretty skeptical.  All this being said, we can&#39;t know for sure.  The reporting is super suspect, though, and we are given very few facts.</p>

<p>Quite easily.  If the rocket is going to go off target maybe towards populated areas you now have a massive bomb flying out of control</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No.  It had 2 tones of pure oxygen on board.  Oxygen is pretty good at interacting with sparks to create massive explossions. Also put that together with it flying off course maybe towards people, bad things gonna happen thus bad press.</p>

<p>In that light,  take a read of this report regarding a Russian rocket disaster: </p>

<p>&quot;In June, there were reports that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was looking into the crash. According to the Russian daily Izvestia, the FSB found that foreign matter may have been deliberately placed into crucial components at the factory where it was assembled.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True story; I was working in Avionics for a new passenger flight company. Lots of political plays they did to get licenses and routes and all that with the FAA.</p>

<p>Leading up to the launch, at a most critical time, some of their aircraft were being fitted with their custom interiors at a fixed base operator at RME. At just about the worst time possible, with enough equipment unpacked and exposed to matter; somehow [I never dug into the details] the fire suppression/foam system in the hangar went off. All the exposed equipment, existing mainly of initial semi-prototype shipsets of cabin interior pieces, were rendered unusable.</p>

<p>This type of shit isn&#39;t a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was really just a peon/Field Engineer for a primary vendor. So I don&#39;t have the &#39;skinny&#39;. But I do know that the other airlines fought very hard to keep them from being allowed into the market. Think of it like GM trying to keep Tesla out of the market, using bullshit dishonest tactics like lobbying to mandate dealership sales/inefficient business models. I believe the airlines, especially American, played dirty pool. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone simply used connections or called a favor into someone they knew who worked at RME to &#39;pull the switch&#39;.</p>

<p>It seems like it cost about 6 months delay in Type Certifications. It was fine with us, our company had multi-million dollar vaporware and buggy software that wasn&#39;t ready anyway. The delay helped everyone except the Airline. To compete in America you have to have deep pockets, because of all the theft and vandalism. I am finding out that is a truism from top to bottom in this god forsaken country. The poor rob eachother blind while the wealthy shrink our diets and throw us into prison for good measure. Dog eat Dog world I tell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of their batteries was punctured in a very specific accident, but it didn&#39;t really seem fishy to me. But do a little digging on the Toyota &quot;runaway car&quot; problem with the hybrids. That was definitely some industrial sabotage shit. Like oil money people trying to make hybrids seem dangerous or something. But the whole thing was so shoddy it was just laughable. [I don&#39;t think they ever found anything credibly wrong with the cars, definitely nothing with the software that could lead to runaway acceleration]. There was one white haired guy who claimed he had his foot on the brake and the car was still accelerating, which has been repeatedly demonstrated as to be impossible.</p>

<p>Yes planetary resources had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat">CubeSat</a> on Orbital sciences&#39; rocket but that was only <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/an-asteroid-mining-company-heads-to-space-for-the-first-time-tonight-17364787">10 pounds out of 5000</a></p>

<p>Also no I very much doubt it was sabotage. Before you post something like this do a bit of research. Both companies are investigating to see if they can figure out went wrong.</p>

<p>Also SpaceX did have a bit in the news on Oct 27th, that was its Dragon Capsule returning from the ISS successfully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought the same. Its odd though, the president recently was talking about how private companies can help Americans get to space. I also could swear I heard some tool on CNN say some if the payload was confidential then immediately said the us didn&#39;t use the ISS for nefarious purposes.  That said, the fact that we can get to space still freaking amazes me and I would not doubt a fuckup. </p>

<p>Well yeh, I mean it&#39;s quite common that politicians say one thing but believe/do another, I&#39;m sure you know that :)</p>

<p>And yeh, it amazes me too, about how it&#39;s getting to the point that going to space is something that normal people will be able to witness and experience one day... i love it</p>

<p>Crash and burn: Top 5 recent rocket disasters: 
<a href="http://rt.com/news/200395-rocket-crashes-failure-list/">http://rt.com/news/200395-rocket-crashes-failure-list/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Proton-M disaster prequel:
The following year, a far more sinister version of events began to surface.</p>

<p>In June, there were reports that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was looking into the crash. According to the Russian daily Izvestia, the FSB found that foreign matter may have been deliberately placed into crucial components at the factory where it was assembled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;how, in the 15 seconds since ignition, can the decision to self-destruct possibly be made, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite easily.  If the rocket is going to go off target maybe towards populated areas you now have a massive bomb flying out of control</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and is there a guy with his hand over the button during every unmanned launch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they can&#39;t just cut the engines and salvage what they can, that&#39;s not more efficient than blowing up a billions of dollars craft? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It had 2 tones of pure oxygen on board.  Oxygen is pretty good at interacting with sparks to create massive explossions. Also put that together with it flying off course maybe towards people, bad things gonna happen thus bad press.</p>

<p>We prospect out of Randsburg and Johannesburg just north east of &quot;the base&quot;, always felt area had much more activity than Nevadas &quot;base&quot; when up around Ruby Hill,Windfall,Ratto Canyon. Stuff never comes across as UFO, but more of military strangeness testing some toys.</p>
