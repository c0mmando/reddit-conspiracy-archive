       Both Planetary Resources and SpaceX were involved in accidents/crashes that set them back. If there was a 'shadow group' that controlled both resources and space travel, they'd neither want a company mining for gold and diamonds and other resources in space where they are plentiful, thus, bringing the cost of these minerals down (eventually, I'm assuming gold from space and diamonds from space may cost more, because of the initial investments in technology and infrastructure and equipment to get it), nor would they want any company to even be in space that isn't 'in the know' about alien civilizations that may be just past our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts on this? I'd love to have a discussion with anyone that is interested in this sort of stuff.

       I agree with this. The most effective means of sabotaging this shit would be financially, which TPTB could have done at a whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       However...
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also not be TPTB. Could be a rival billionaire or something, someone without the endless resources of a government or governments, but with enough scratch to do a brute-force fuck-em op on the companies that suffered the failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be some straight-up bad luck that will bring the eggheads back to the drawing boards. Rocket science is not trivial shit. One digit wrong, and you don't get rockets, you just get the science laughing in your face,

       I'm definitely willing to agree with you, that what has occurred is something that should have occurred and will continue to occur, since we are playing with fire, i just wanted to tickle everyones brain and get a discussion going

       just place a seed of an idea, so if this continues to happen in the future, more and more people may ask one another "hold up... you thinking this may all be planned?"

       Here's what I think:  Its sketchy as hell that in the New York Times articles, the events don't acknowledge each other whatsoever, despite two catastrophic space mission failures never having occurred with this kind of chronological proximity before.  I think the fact that Antares was self destructed 15 seconds after ignition is pretty sketchy.  I think the fact that nothing in way of even speculation has been offered as the roots and causes for either failure is pretty sketchy.  I think the fact that they're both private american space company mission failures occurring in the span of 3 days is sketchy.  Here's what I know: there have been shitloads of UFO sightings in the Mohave where the virgin galactic crash just occurred.  Every report on Antares makes note that the craft was self-destructed.  It seems to me like none of the explosions we witness in the video occurred due to failure, but due to this self destruct.  My questions, then, are "how, in the 15 seconds since ignition, can the decision to self-destruct possibly be made, and is there a guy with his hand over the button during every unmanned launch, and they can't just cut the engines and salvage what they can, that's not more efficient than blowing up a billions of dollars craft?  And hypothetically, if aliens are among us or whatever, setting back the private space sector would behoove the government in keeping their presence somewhat clandestine.  In the context of an unmanned rocket resupply mission that doesn't make much sense (except it sort of could given the mosquito larvae on-board or whatever), but it makes a lot of sense for the virgin galactic crash.  Also, in the most prominent amateur video (and fastest to hit the web/reddit) of Antares, a suspiciously audible comment of "That'll teach nasa to privatize space exploration" is heard.  All the top comments on that video in
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       were referring to this audible comment.  It appeared like shilling to me, and I think if these were/are examples of sabotage, TPTB are attempting to dismantle the private space sector.  If SpaceX suffers some kind of setback in the near future I am gonna be pretty skeptical.  All this being said, we can't know for sure.  The reporting is super suspect, though, and we are given very few facts.

       Quite easily.  If the rocket is going to go off target maybe towards populated areas you now have a massive bomb flying out of control

       No.  It had 2 tones of pure oxygen on board.  Oxygen is pretty good at interacting with sparks to create massive explossions. Also put that together with it flying off course maybe towards people, bad things gonna happen thus bad press.

       We prospect out of Randsburg and Johannesburg just north east of "the base", always felt area had much more activity than Nevadas "base" when up around Ruby Hill,Windfall,Ratto Canyon. Stuff never comes across as UFO, but more of military strangeness testing some toys.

       Planned by who? Who gains the most?
Russia. At the moment they are the only way ISS gets astronauts and material back and forth. SpaceX recent successful launch of a cargo hold will have made them nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA being told not to communicate with the Russian space agency at all, except for those ISS launches, may have been the last straw.

       Russia has been beaten up over Snowdon in dozens of ways. From the fake outrage over lgbt rights (our government still loves Saudi Arabia even though they behead gay people) to Ukraine and new tariff barriers on Russian  goods. They want to even the score and protect the billions they get from space flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who in Russia though is difficult. It's so corrupt it could be a frustrated oligarch with only tacit Putin involvement.

       Or maybe someone else blew it up/ordered it detonated to piss off Russia. It was ferrying supplies to ALL the astronauts at the ISS, right? What if someone else were to say to Russia "we give so little of a fuck about you we're going to blow up our own shit...well, your shit, too...but a lot of our own shit and then publicly admit we did it intentionally just to see the looks on your faces, you fucking commie fucks. Eat a dick, fagz."

       I agree with OP  its unlikely. We're just shooting the breeze. Remember Aristotle said "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."  That's what we're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that light,  take a read of this report regarding a Russian rocket disaster:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In June, there were reports that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was looking into the crash. According to the Russian daily Izvestia, the FSB found that foreign matter may have been deliberately placed into crucial components at the factory where it was assembled."

       Exactly that, I just want to open up discussion here. A lot of times I see posts that are trying very hard to push one view on everyone, which is something I feel many of us are here because of, that we're tired of the MSM doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have our own opinions and discussions, and we'd just like to exercise our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something were planned, as an act of sabotage, maybe one day it will come to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for now, I just want to discuss it, and not take everything as it is given to us.

       True story; I was working in Avionics for a new passenger flight company. Lots of political plays they did to get licenses and routes and all that with the FAA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leading up to the launch, at a most critical time, some of their aircraft were being fitted with their custom interiors at a fixed base operator at RME. At just about the worst time possible, with enough equipment unpacked and exposed to matter; somehow [I never dug into the details] the fire suppression/foam system in the hangar went off. All the exposed equipment, existing mainly of initial semi-prototype shipsets of cabin interior pieces, were rendered unusable.

       This type of shit isn't a coincidence.

       Well I was really just a peon/Field Engineer for a primary vendor. So I don't have the 'skinny'. But I do know that the other airlines fought very hard to keep them from being allowed into the market. Think of it like GM trying to keep Tesla out of the market, using bullshit dishonest tactics like lobbying to mandate dealership sales/inefficient business models. I believe the airlines, especially American, played dirty pool. I wouldn't be surprised if someone simply used connections or called a favor into someone they knew who worked at RME to 'pull the switch'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like it cost about 6 months delay in Type Certifications. It was fine with us, our company had multi-million dollar vaporware and buggy software that wasn't ready anyway. The delay helped everyone except the Airline. To compete in America you have to have deep pockets, because of all the theft and vandalism. I am finding out that is a truism from top to bottom in this god forsaken country. The poor rob eachother blind while the wealthy shrink our diets and throw us into prison for good measure. Dog eat Dog world I tell you.

       One of their batteries was punctured in a very specific accident, but it didn't really seem fishy to me. But do a little digging on the Toyota "runaway car" problem with the hybrids. That was definitely some industrial sabotage shit. Like oil money people trying to make hybrids seem dangerous or something. But the whole thing was so shoddy it was just laughable. [I don't think they ever found anything credibly wrong with the cars, definitely nothing with the software that could lead to runaway acceleration]. There was one white haired guy who claimed he had his foot on the brake and the car was still accelerating, which has been repeatedly demonstrated as to be impossible.

       I've thought the same. Its odd though, the president recently was talking about how private companies can help Americans get to space. I also could swear I heard some tool on CNN say some if the payload was confidential then immediately said the us didn't use the ISS for nefarious purposes.  That said, the fact that we can get to space still freaking amazes me and I would not doubt a fuckup.

       Like buying Tesla cars and setting them up to have a firey explosion when they collide with another car / street lamp / etc? ;)

       It's like that in other countries too, not just america. You can't limit, though I don't think you are, the "game" to just america. america is one playground, earth (and space) are the war.

       thanks for such a descriptive response!!! I did not see the same angle as you (the news papers not mentioning one another), but VERY good call

       And that amateur video, I haven't seen it yet, will need to find it, but that is a very suspect thing to say...

       Russia has been beaten up over Snowdon in dozens of ways. From the fake outrage over lgbt rights (our government still loves Saudi Arabia even though they behead gay people) to Ukraine and new tariff barriers on Russian  goods. They want to even the score and protect the billions they get from space flights.

       Who in Russia though is difficult. It's so corrupt it could be a frustrated oligarch with only tacit Putin involvement.

       "The Proton-M disaster prequel:
The following year, a far more sinister version of events began to surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       In June, there were reports that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was looking into the crash. According to the Russian daily Izvestia, the FSB found that foreign matter may have been deliberately placed into crucial components at the factory where it was assembled."

       Quite easily.  If the rocket is going to go off target maybe towards populated areas you now have a massive bomb flying out of control

       No.  It had 2 tones of pure oxygen on board.  Oxygen is pretty good at interacting with sparks to create massive explossions. Also put that together with it flying off course maybe towards people, bad things gonna happen thus bad press.

       We prospect out of Randsburg and Johannesburg just north east of "the base", always felt area had much more activity than Nevadas "base" when up around Ruby Hill,Windfall,Ratto Canyon. Stuff never comes across as UFO, but more of military strangeness testing some toys.
