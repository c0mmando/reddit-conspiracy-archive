        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We often see news articles about all the benefits fat people receive in some countries like food stamps, paid medication, etc. One would wonder why the government would rather pay for all that instead of cutting them down and letting those people slim down. After all, if they aren&#39;t given enough money to buy tons of junk food they are bound to lose some weight.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where my theory comes in: the government doesn&#39;t want these people to be thin. They want them to be fat and die because of their obesity. On the long term the money they spent on these people is far less than what they would spend on them if they got old and started having diseases because of their age. Most old people need some kind of medication be it for their hearth, arthritis, or some other kind of genetic disposition. By encouraging those people to stay obese governments are cutting down on money they would spend on their health insurance later on. It&#39;s also a form of population control.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t government money making people fat.  The problem is that the majority of people don&#39;t have tons of disposable income and bad food is cheaper.   If I&#39;m running low on money, its cheaper to live off Ramen noodle, microwaveable pizza&#39;s, and macaroni and cheese.  Nothing but pasta and prepackaged crap.  Its cheaper to drink generic soda and candy bars than it is to eat fresh vegetables.  You can make a fresh veggie and cook up some whole means and whole grain pasta for one meal, or you can get canned veggies, hamburger helper, and bags of cheap pasta for three meals.  </p>

<p>Eating bad is cheap.  Eating healthy is expensive. </p>

<p>TL:DR - Eating to much isn&#39;t the problem, its WHAT you eat that is the problem .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who was very overweight, I can say with a high amount of confidence that you are very uninformed about obesity.  </p>

<p>Obesity is about WHAT you eat.  You can&#39;t exercise your way out of a bad diet.  Period.  If I&#39;m eating bad food and exercising hard, I will not lose weight.  Any good doctor or dietician will tell you that what you are eating is the problem. </p>

<p>Point in case.  A lack of &quot;self control&quot; is largely due, not to actual will power, but due to artificial &quot;cravings&quot; that near addiction level that are fed by poor food choices.  Our food is loaded with sugar and sugar substitutes like High Fructose Corn Syrup.  These sugars have been shown to behave like a drug in our system and creates a measurable addiction to it.  </p>

<p>Obesity is caused by the influx of bad food that creates food addiction and metabolic syndrome that can only be corrected by changing your diet.  It cannot be corrected by simply eating less of bad shit.  period.  You have to stop eating it, which requires money.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s true. But you can exercise your way out of a can of coke. Taking that can out of your day with exercise helps chisel away at the consequences of bad habits. </p>

<p>How does not eating something require money?  </p>

<p>If you have an addiction to coke - High Fructose Corn Syrup, as you put it. How will it cost me more money by just not drinking coke? </p>

<p>The withdrawals are going to suck for a while, sure. But it can be done and at no monetary cost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are blaming a part of the problem for the majority of the problem.  People who eat right rarely feel the need to over eat.  When I changed my diet to eating things better for me, it increased my food cost by 1/3rd.  When my wife changed, it cost nearly double now.  </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t count calories.  Because i don&#39;t need too.  Because those &quot;hunger&quot; cravings were not because I was really hungry.  In other words changing to eat the better, more expensive whole foods changed the way I eat naturally without the need for mental will power.  The withdrawal was awful but its not a change I could have made without having the funds to do so. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t talking about all people.  Rich people can eat bad by choice and over eat by choice, as can poor people choose to eat and drink bad things.  But portion control is easier when you don&#39;t have to do it with foods that by their nature store as fat easier and give you less nutrition, causing the bodies incessant feeling of needing to eat. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the nature of eating right? . . . To not over eat? </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about becoming accustomed to eating less.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Depends what you changed your diet to (Duh!). </p>

<p>But the diet i&#39;m currently on is quite simple, eat the same types of food, just less of it. Price of food goes down, weight goes down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words changing to eat the better, more expensive whole foods changed the way I eat naturally without the need for mental will power.</p>

<p>Then how do some poor people stay thin whilst other, equally poor get fat? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rich people can eat bad by choice and over eat by choice, as can poor people choose to eat and drink bad things.</p>

<p>Precisely. Rich and poor, it doesn&#39;t matter if you make bad choices. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If that were the case, why isn&#39;t obesity equal worldwide? </p>

<p>Why is it only the Americans who are at the top of world obesity whilst the rest of the poor people in the world are further down the list? </p>

<p>If obesity were as simple as you claim, most of the poor in first world countries should be overweight. But they&#39;re not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also a predisposition towards obesity.  </p>

<p>Obesity is easy.  Eat the right foods and you naturally eat less.  :)</p>

<p>However, our country is unique.  We allow more foods into the population that other countries don&#39;t.  Advertising drives sales of things that we eat and drink that are bad.  Consider how a child grows up in the US.  They are constantly inundated with advertisements for bad food and drink.  </p>

<p>Its all choices, but my claim to simplicity isn&#39;t about economics but about what you eat.  Poor people generally have less choices due too income.  That doesn&#39;t get people out of responsibility, I&#39;m not claiming that.  </p>

<p>But it is much easier to eat right when you have the income to do so.  I&#39;m not sure how to solve the crisis.  If &quot;just eat less&quot; was really so easy, more people would have success doing it.  There is a reason it doesn&#39;t work for drugs and cigarettes with the success rate that would make this an easy choice. Some can. Some can&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Governments want people to be fat because the underlying conditions that cause obesity funnel immense funding to big pharma and the shady weight loss industry. </p>

<p>The proof is in the &#39;food pyramid&#39;, which favours the consumption of foods that make you fat (grains, starches, sugary plant products) <em>heavily</em> over fats and proteins, which are actually not as bad as we&#39;ve been told. It&#39;s no coincidence that obesity skyrocketed with the reduction of fat and increase in carbohydrates that occurred with the creation of LBJ&#39;s &#39;food pyramid&#39;. He was motivated to punish the dairy and meat industry for voting against him, but the side effect was huge revenues for pharma. </p>

<p>The resulting demonization of fats and meats have continued with a headlong rush to obesity in every nation following the American food guidelines. No, it&#39;s not a matter of self control or people lying about their food intake. Our diet is structured <em>wrong</em>. It might have been accidental at first, but they&#39;ve realized too many financial benefits for themselves by making everyone obese and then blaming the fatties for a population health crisis <em>they</em> created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ratios. We eat way more carbohydrates (sugar and starches) than we should be. We probably shouldn&#39;t be eating grains at all, let alone making them the basis of our diets. If you&#39;re continually on the verge of starvation it wouldn&#39;t matter so much, but we aren&#39;t. Our metabolisms simply aren&#39;t able to cope with the sugar and starch loads and react by converting it to fat and storing it. Meanwhile the insulin cycle gets disrupted which leads to blood sugar spikes and crashes which leads to hunger and fatigue, which leads to eating more and feeling too tired to move. Which makes us fat. </p>

<p>You actually CAN eat fairly healthy on food stamps if you look for deals, but it takes some effort.</p>

<p>After all, if they aren&#39;t given enough money to buy tons of junk food they are bound to lose some weight.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how obesity works. If money was the issue, the rich wouldn&#39;t be fat and the poor would all be thin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the long term the money they spent on these people is far less than what they would spend on them if they got old and started having diseases because of their age</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An obese person is going to have more health issues throughout their life than a healthy person who gets old. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most old people need some kind of medication be it for their hearth, arthritis, or some other kind of genetic disposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most old people have also paid a great deal of taxes throughout their life. The medication they purchase would also go towards the governments pocket, so why is spending money on meds a bad thing for the government? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also a form of population control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would the government want to shrink the population? </p>

<p>One would wonder why the government would rather pay for all that instead of cutting them down and letting those people slim down</p>

<p>Do you really think cutting food stamps will result in people &quot;slimming down&quot;?</p>
