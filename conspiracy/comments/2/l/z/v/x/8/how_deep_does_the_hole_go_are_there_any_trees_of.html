       Still new to the subreddit but been reading the top and recent stuff, doesn't seem like anything too new. My knowledge is from other sources and not the usual sites I see linked here so I am curious to know, what do you believe the current order is? Who owns who?

       That is a very good question.  Many think it's Zionist Jews.  I think the rabbit hole goes a
       <em>
        lot

       deeper than that.

       Certainly goes beyond the "Jewish Conspiracy", in my opinion, although there can be no doubt that many Zionists are involved (although most if not all Jews people talk about with regards to this are descendants of Eastern Europe and aren't actually "Jewish" at all, at least not historically).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that it goes much deeper.  Been delving into the origins of the three Abrahamic religions lately and I've been pretty amazed at some of what's there to uncover.

       Absolutely.  Lots of indications attesting to that very thing.

       I'd say Jews/Zionists are top level peons of those in charge - as opposed to many others that are not even that.

       I'm currently reading "The Lost Light" by Alvin Boyd Kuhn if you're curious.  It's very dense and not an "easy read" necessarily (though it's
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       well-written), but I would give it my highest recommendation.

       I think the Rothschild group owns most of the major governments. The governments of the U.S. and U.K. set most of the global policies. 
I have no proof, but follow the bombs. If a nation is not under Rothschild control, they either have been bombed until they are or are on our list to be bombed (Iran, North Korea, etc.).

       How can one determine which countries are under their control? I remember seeing the video of the man from Chile yelling at the Rotschild to get out of his country. I thought I'd like to have the opportunity to do it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I realized that despite all of the talk of their family I've not seen anything showing the direct connection to the modern family and modern governments. I'm guessing it's going to be through the banking interests in the country, but would you be able to shine some light on this one for me? Where do I look to see the Rothschild finger prints?

       It's really difficult, but for America - you have to go all the way back to the Treaty of Paris, in which the colonial lands are turned over but the King still required a return on his investment in the Virginia Company in the early 17th century. The lands were turned over to who owned it next after the king, which according to his charter, was the Virginia Company. And then you'd have to figure out who owns the shares in that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you establish who owns America (most likely the Crown), you can even go back to see who owns them (you would have to go back to when a certain king was excommunicates by a certain Pope, and then what the King had to do to get back into the good graces of the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you'd have to go and see if anyone owns The Vatican (do they have a Central Bank...?)
      </p>

       Happy hunting ;-)

       You got it bud. If you want any resources or get stuck - feel free to PM me. I kinda gave away parts of the story up there but the challenge is proving it legally (which is doable
       <em>
        I think
       </em>
       , as I:m satisfactorily convinced).
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with the Treaty of Paris (where, when, who) and that should get you started.

       On mobile so I can't link, but look to countries who have private central banks and were in significant debt, usually due to warmongering or trying to support an empire. Magically, they were extended credit in times of need, but at what cost? Permanent influence to the highest levels of government and a literal license to print money.

       I don't think it's as much about DNA or environment as it is about choice. I could have chosen to be that way too. Two main choices are involved. Firstly the choice to question anything no matter how it makes one feel. Secondly, there is a choice to think about things oneself with one's own mental faculties without the need for others around to support oneself. Just because everyone around disagrees it does not mean that one is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took effort at one time to get where I am now. It no doubt makes people think I'm crazy. That's fine with me, because I think I would be crazier if I rejected my own thoughts in lieu of peer pressure or the assertions of respected authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that I don't know if there is an element of extraterrestrial control involved in the global control system, but many narratives that include it do better at explaining the many alleged dark rituals, the pedophilia, the apparent mass coordination between so many different types of actors, the wildly successful psychological strategies for maintaining secrecy and the long term vision of the conspiracy. There are a great number of very similar narratives from spiritually oriented sites that speak of such an otherworldly element. Yet, there is no undeniable proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings alone might account for it, but they'd be some very impressive human beings. Their intellectual ability alone could qualify them to be a separate species. The end goal in either case appears to be the same, control of Earth and it's people, by convincing the majority of the people to submit to unaccountable centralized control systems corrupted by beings uninterested in the well being of the majority of the human race.

      <p>
       Yes.  It takes great effort...and most fall asunder, ending up simply going right back into the "group think" mentality as opposed to dealing with the possible/likely social ridicule and ostracizing involved with being considered "different".

       And by way of this above-statement right here, sir, you have just explained why such narratives are often a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more logical and sound than many other explanations considered "standard" by the MSM.  The catch, of course, as you already touched upon in your first statement, is that TPTB have manipulated this society in such a manner that most people look at this particular type of narrative - logical and sound as it is - with great amounts of ridicule, and those giving it any sort of real time get largely marginalized.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       More than saying "there is no undeniable proof", I would say that there is not proof that has been globally accepted and pushed forth by TPTB in the same manner that other subjects and "truths" have been pushed forth.  It is ultimately almost nothing at all more than the indoctrination that TPTB push forth that causes the people to go or not go with a particular thought or way of looking at things as opposed to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about what has or doesn't have "undeniable proof".  It's about what TPTB
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       , adopt, and push forward as having acceptance in the society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth, after all, was not only flat, but the center of the entire universe just a few short hundred years ago.  Pretty much ALL the plebs absolutely "knew" that...And there was quite a bit of "undeniable proof" for it back then as well, wasn't there?  I mean the books and the scholars and the scientists and the priests of back then all said that it was the case, didn't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today some know that "undeniable proof" really is a malleable thing and can indeed be greatly manipulated depending upon who holds the reigns to a society and its molding.  It all depends, ultimately.  What a society thinks, therefore, is rarely if ever dependent upon what there is "undeniable proof" for or not one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends upon what TPTB (whoever WHATever they are)
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and most of us plebs simply follow along unquestioningly...and those that
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       question the PTB-imposed narrative? get ostracized, marginalized, and/or killed.

       It's said that

       account for it.  It's been said that the human

       is pretty replete throughout the galaxy and cosmos.  There are said to be
       <em>
        many

       , many bipedal homonids that are not from this planet but that look very similar to if not identical/indistinguishable from terrestrial/Earth humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outwardly, many look similar/the same, but it's said that there are at times great differences between what exists inside in terms of the physiology, chemistry, and intellect between species of similar/identical-looking homonids.

       Correct.  Karen Hudes speaks quite a bit about homo capensis.  She's a good example of the immediate ridicule that befalls anyone - even people with very valid and otherwise greatly-respected credentials like her - who attempts to speak about subject matter that falls outside of the extremely narrow band of accepted topics outlined by PTB-established social engineering.  I spoke about this very topic quite a bit w/someone yesterday.  My

        two responses to the poster
       </a>
       (as well as their generally closed perspective/point of view) give a good indication of just how easily many of us are manipulated to give an immediate, unthinking, pavlovian, knee-jerk rejection to anything that falls outside of what we have been mentally and emotionally engineered to consider "acceptable".

       I didn't immediately reply to the above poster because I went to sleep after I posted my initial response and didn't see his until right now.  That being said, I just made a response to his, but am going to proof read it before posting it, since I often make a lot of type Os and want what I say to be as understandable as possible.  I'll post my response soon(ish) and will link it to you so that you can see that at least one person actually

       Um...what's
       <em>

       "irrelevant" is the fact that the response was already posted, and you asked
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       I had already posted it.  THAT'S the point.  As such, your "I'm waiting to read your response." statement showed more than anything the fact that you simply hadn't payed attention to my already having posted it.  All you had to do was scroll through the thread again.

       Thanks for posting these links. I'm really into this kind of stuff at the moment. The skeptic in me still has doubts about the Galactic Council, etc. but for reasons I can't quite explain I do have an innate belief that it's real.
      </p>

       I do find it odd that believing this stuff automatically qualifies you as crazy in the eyes of the mainstream, yet believing the bible is perfectly acceptable. If you take historical context out of the equation there's really not too much difference between the two beliefs (and they may even be related for all we know) in terms of a required a leap of faith.

       I'll be sure to check that out. I do have an Old Testament Bible knocking around somewhere, which I keep meaning to read. I've also just bought the Book of Enoch. The Ra Material is also on my list. Have you read that?

       It is absolutely socially engineered that way by TPTB.  Those

       in charge of the conditioning on this planet (who are behind the scenes, above the governments that people "vote" on, and have a veritable carte blanch on what they can do and not do here) are, for whatever reason, making
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       sure that the Earth humans here remain very ignorant of how active and alive this cosmos, galaxy, solar system, and
       <em>
        planet
       </em>
       is with beings whose intelligence rivals and often far surpasses human intelligence and ability.

       The Christian bible is an instructional manual for how and what the humans on Earth should think.  It is mixed with some truth, but even the portions that are true are often clouded and made purposefully vague by erroneous interpretation and fabrication.

       The existence of off-planet beings on one end, and what is in the bibles of the world on the other are
       <em>
        very

       much related.  The information in, among other sources, the first two links I provided deals with this very dynamic quite extensively.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's where you're wrong though, my friend.  No "faith" is required for any of this.  Faith is the word that we humans have for that which should be believed even when there is insufficient evidence for it.  Buddha himself is quoted as having said
       <em>
        "Believe nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it - not even if I myself have said it - unless it agrees with reason and common sense."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is quite a bit of evidence strongly indicating that we are indeed very much
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "alone" in the cosmos.  No "belief" or "leap of faith" is needed for that.  What's needed is the willingness to break through all the sociological and psychological engineering and blockages that have been designed by TPTB and the MSM here - blockages that have been imposed upon the minds of the majority of us in order to only look at and investigate a
       <em>
        veeery
       </em>
       narrow band of "socially-acceptable" subject matter.  Once you do break through that barrier, even though the shills will come out in force to attack you and protect the faux house of cards TPTB have built to keep everyone sequestered in, you will begin finding out that there is a LOOOOT of information out there that 1) stands up to a lot of scrutiny, and 2) is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different (and sometimes counter to) what we have been taught in school by the institutions of indoctrination on this planet.
