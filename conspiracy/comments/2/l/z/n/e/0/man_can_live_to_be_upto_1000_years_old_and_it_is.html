       The bible clearly says people have lived to exceed several hundred years on life span. This is also accounted for in several other ancient texts from other religions and societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only recently within the last 10,000 years that man has begun to eat foods which are detrimental to our healths, thus reducing our life spans considerably.

       I don't think the bible is a good measuring stick for physical anthropology either.  I think the real question here is why would anyone wanna live 1000+ years?  Not in this economic system where the rich rape the poor.  Maybe in the

       1000 years of working 60+ hours a week with no vacation allowed.
1000 years of sitting in traffic or the subway.

       1000 years of paying taxes.
       <br/>
       1000 years of inflation.

       You're not a God though. Back then, if you were a God, you'd command a whole population to build you a pyramid. And quite frankly, I can't imagine a God would need you to be alive much longer than past your prime.

       Okay, so we can just shove our faces with anything. Eat it all, and ignore the countless numbers of auto-immune disorders, where we as scientists currently believe the immune system "attacks our own tissue".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clearly our immune system desperately trying to keep pace with ridding pollutants from our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       This blows me away, as the way I interpret things is that electron microscopy has only begun to peer into these disorders.

       so you go from the bible and god to man living 1000 years. you are either a shitty scientist or not a scientist at all. i agree, the shit we eat is killing us. but to say if we got back to biblical diet we'd live a thousand years is a stretch buddy.  im a strong believer that we view time and space very differently than our ancestors did. there is no proof we have life passed say 100 from historical texts in perspective. i believe the oldest modern person was 120+ which is a freak of nature. this all seems loaded and bias. what are you poking at?

       I'm not suggesting we rocket back in time and start eating what our ancestors did exclusively. We all have different ancestors and different genetic adaptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suggesting that the direction we are currently heading is a kludge, a hard uphill struggle when it doesn't need to be. Simple changes such as avoiding foods that are known to be poisonous to us and being aware of how to fix those poisons when they get out of hand. How do you dissolve coal tars from the body? How do you remove tree resins? How do you get good natural sources of unadulterated collagens into the system? How do you get rid of petroleum food products that junk up the system?

       There is no point in denying people what they want, but for them to be oblivious to these harms is idiotic.

       Okay, well lets look at ancient monuments of the polytheists. Stonehenge or perhaps Göbekli Tepe. These are altars on which animal or even human sacrifices to the Gods occured. The feast was the most important part of their spirituality. They surely didn't waste a single drop of meat, and probably ate the whole kill.

       <em>
        Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930), now meaning cruel, malicious laughter. In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.[7]

       You're also new to The Bible. The Bible records approximately 6,000 years of "history" (and I use the term
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       loosely). The people you say it says lived several hundred years existed within that 6,000 year period, not before that 10,000 year mark where you say we started eating bad food.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the topic of eating bad food, don't you think food killed humans a lot more often before techniques like pasteurization were invented than after?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the topic of The Bible, you realize it's a fable just like the Odyssey and the Epic of Gilgamesh, right? That religion is the most broadly reaching, most thorough control mechanism that TPTB have over the majority of the population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I recall reading about studies into nutrition that have found that dramatically reduced caloric intake measurably extends the lifespans of certain mammals, including mice or rats and humans. Obviously eating "dumber" (highly processed foods, fatty foods, extremely salty foods, way too much sugar, etc.) shortens life spans.

       Polytheism was alive and well, way before the Bible. The old testament, well, the ancient Jews probably worshiped the Zodiac.

       <em>
        During the pre-Columbian era, human sacrifice in Maya culture was the ritual offering of nourishment to the gods. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.[1]

       In other words. The bible goes back "6,000 years", because that's what historians and politicians of today attach meaning to places which exist "today". The interpretations are based on religious politics and mis-interpretations. Not genuine scientific scrutiny.

       Not unheard of, but not common either. I'm sure someone who was ultra wealthy or in a position power could live longer. But the average person didn't.

      <p>
       Anyways, I once read that germ free mice, in a lab live something around 8% longer. So that's not so significant. However, what if they were fed the most optimal diets possible, would they live longer then? I know they do if you give something simple, like CoQ10. Or that's what I saw once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess where CoQ10 is found in a mammals body? In the heart. Guess what CoQ10 supplements do? They improve your heart. Real tough to figure out, right?

       Now I will attempt to blow your mind with a common misconception which we believe today to be true. That gum harmlessly passes through the human digestive system

       What is true about that presentation, is that we only began to chew gums within the last few thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gum is traditionally saps from trees. It is the juice that stays in our system for 7+ years and leads to things such as obesity which is in truth a mild case of mild lymphedema (probably petroleum food products). Google images will give insight to that medical phenomenon where our lymphatic system fails to circulate properly or retains substance inappropriately.

       I'm suggesting that we deviated from healthy ancient rituals that may have approached immortality standards back in ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
       We probably began deviating 10,000 or so years ago. Only guessing based on historical accounts of when we started chewing gums, and the advent of mass agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Egyptians. Their whole civilization is based on immortality. It's something people have strived towards forever. I believe in the past, people may have achieved much greater life spans. Especially royal figures.

       I agree, we have deviated greatly from healthier eating. I haven't researched historical dietary habits, but i believe my first statement is quite apparent when you look back at the last 100 years. The rise of fast food, pesticide, and just too much to list.

       The Egyptians supposedly ate powdered gold mixed with dough and baked to produce what they called Sho/shew bread. Not sure on the spelling of that. Ancient African religious texts describe several god kings who reigned for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. Look up Michael Tellinger. He describes the African texts and the Egyptian bread.

They are mostly discussed as being found in cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays, and chimaeras); however, they are also reported to be found in Chondrostei such as Reedfish[1] and sturgeon.[2] Lungfish have also been reported to have them.[1] Teleosts have re-evolved a different type of electroreceptors.[2] They were first described by Stefano Lorenzini in 1678.

       Christianity is corrupt and Christians worship an evil false deity. I have no love for Christianity, Islam, or Judaism, which are all corrupted teachings emanating from the same source to mind control people.

       Interesting, and I wouldn't say impossible, but I would maybe shy away from using the Bible as a historical reference.  It is pretty certainly allegorical in nature, based mostly on astrology, the zodiac, and man's internal struggle with and for divinity (and the same can be said for the texts of almost every other modern religion).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder where you got the 1000 number from.  While I can accept that certain ancient people lived healthier lives both physically and spiritually, and thus were able to survive longer and lead more fulfilling lives, I find it hard to believe that the difference would be
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       substantial.

       I'm not saying we could reverse any evolutionary decline which happened over the last 14,000 years or so, but I can entertain the idea that some people on Earth have lived for hundreds of years.

       I am suggesting however that the majority of foods we eat are probably very bad for us. Whatever habits we have picked up over the last 14,000 years, who could possibly figure it all out, right?

       Sure I agree that the majority of foods we all eat are horrible for us.  This is especially true in modern times in "advanced western society" where our food is full of processed garbage and artificial sweeteners and genetically modified plants and "natural flavors" and preservatives, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that it's difficult to discover the truth of the matter and determine if people actually did live far longer in the ancient past but, having said that, I don't think the difficulty in discovering the truth should cause us to jump to conclusions or assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think that an animal living to be hundreds or thousands of years old definitively proves anything with regard to humans.

       You're correct on some accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organisms which live the longest also co-incidentally, one could say are, the least mobile, and least prone to stumbling across foreign eco-systems which they have not yet adapted to living well in.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if there ever was a time when humans lived for hundred of years at a time, it most certainly was among small groups of tribe in civilizations that were isolated from others.

        Pumapunku or Puma Punku (Aymara and Quechua puma cougar, puma, punku door, hispanicized Puma Puncu) is part of a large temple complex or monument group that is part of the Tiwanaku Site near Tiwanaku, Bolivia.

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Tiwanaku is significant in Inca traditions because it is believed to be the site where the world was created.[1] In Aymara, Puma Punku's name means "The Door of the Puma". The Pumapunku complex consists of an unwalled western court, a central unwalled esplanade, a terraced platform mound that is faced with stone, and a walled eastern court.[2][3][4]

       One could speculate forever...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        As was characteristic of civilizations around this time, the Tiwanaku actively incorporated human sacrifice into their culture. The remains of dismembered bodies have been found throughout the area. Ceramic artifacts depict imagery of warriors, masked with puma skulls, decapitating their enemies and holding trophy skulls, adorned with belts of human heads with their tongues torn out.[14] It is believed that, because of certain markings on stones found at Puma Punku, the Gate of the Sun was originally part of Puma Punku.[16]

        While there is universal agreement that some Mesoamerican people practiced human sacrifice, there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism in pre-Columbian America was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet.[63][64][65] Others have hypothesized that cannibalism was part of a blood revenge in war.[66]

       Kings and Queens, royal lineages, probably ate what was most nourishing and proven to be sustainable for longevity purposes. You don't wake up one morning, and say hey, let's see if this will work. People develop these things after millenniums of trial and error and effort.

       I think the human body can do surprising things if the psychology and health of the human machine is kept in ideal conditions. However that is realistically impossible for a normal person today to achieve, so why bother talking about it? Also probably not the best sub for something like that.

       Okay, well lets look at ancient monuments of the polytheists. Stonehenge or perhaps Göbekli Tepe. These are altars on which animal or even human sacrifices to the Gods occured. The feast was the most important part of their spirituality. They surely didn't waste a single drop of meat, and probably ate the whole kill.

       <em>
        Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930), now meaning cruel, malicious laughter. In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.[7]
