I have to admit that my gut reaction was that he and his daughter are insane, and that children really did die in Newtown. But I suppose it&#39;s possible that I could be wrong in believing the official story.  </p>

<p>So are they nuts, or am I a sheep?  </p>

<p>I do have to take issue with the article blaming Rahm Emanuel, as he had been Mayor of Chicago for a year and a half at the time of the alleged Sandy Hook shooting.</p>

<p>Wow! It looks like that&#39;s true. Some of those kids who &quot;died&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv4-5yQL3-Q">were at the Super Bowl</a>. Holy shit!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore the whole superbowl thing - it&#39;s a massive red herring. </p>

<p>But Sandy Hook WAS a political hoax involving a number of US government agencies, actors and and corrupt officials within Newtown and Connecticut State medical/police services. Local and national media were also involved in the hoax.</p>

<p>The &quot;victims&quot; were fictional protagonists - no birth or death certificates exist for any of them. They were created using photoshopped images of real children and given a back story and a &quot;family&quot; to make them appear real. The &quot;crazed gunman&quot; Adam Lanza was a real person, but he changed his name to Ryan (ostensibly his brother, but for whom no birth certificate exists) leaving a ghost identity that the organisers were able to use as the killer.</p>

<p>This hoax demonstrates the level of corruption that exists in the United States government, from the President down. It also shows just how far the mainstream media colludes with government. </p>

<p>Sorry, this is an invalid claim. Here&#39;s one, for starters:</p>

<p><a href="http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/05/noah-pozner-death-certificate-released.html">http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/05/noah-pozner-death-certificate-released.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;All but two of the 26 students and staffers massacred in at Sandy Hook Elementary School died from “multiple gunshot wounds,” according to death certificates released Tuesday. The death certificates were made public through the Freedom of Information Act after the Newtown Clerk’s Office refused to give them up, citing privacy for the victims’ families.&quot;</p>

<p>Claiming &quot;no death certificates exist&quot; is simply not true. </p>

<p>Every Sandy Hook thread seems to have a blowhard like you: when the facts don&#39;t fit the theory, it&#39;s the facts that are rejected.

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to state something that everyone in r/conspiracy has a problem admitting to themselves. Every conspiracy theory out there lacks in direct concrete evidence that you can see and make a definite decision from. If there was evidence that good for any of these theories then they would no longer be theories they would be facts.</p>

<p>With that being said in most every theory there pieces of evidence that are credible enough to make people begin questioning the situation. This is what creates the theories in the first place. Without these weird things going on people would likely never create the conspiracy theory in the first place. As for sandy hook one of the first &#39;&#39;weird things&#39;&#39; was the father smiling and laughing while thinking he was off camera then getting himself all choked up and preparing to act emotional once the cameras start rolling. To anyone&#39;s common sense that was a huge red flag seeing as how his child had just recently been murdered. Things like that begin the theory and people dig everything they can out and grasp at anything that is out of place. People truly are trying to get at the truth but sometimes their bias mentality blinds us a bit around here. </p>

<p>Overall I will simply say that keep an open mind but don&#39;t come to many definite decisions about what you see researching these things because once you &#39;&#39;decide&#39;&#39; on something then you have linked your own defense mechanisms to that decision. It can blind you to anything trying to counter your decision because you have now tie emotions to it. </p>

<p>I myself believe that most all of these theories have good work put into them and good evidence supporting them but not good enough evidence that I make a decision.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this.  As far as I can tell, most conspiracy theories are created INSTANTLY after the event.  No wait for facts or investigation or evidence.  What &quot;creates the theory&quot; is the desire to support some pre-existing conclusion (usually &quot;govt is evil&quot; or &quot;corps are evil&quot; or something).  The theory is just an attempt to create &quot;facts&quot; to support the desired conclusion.</p>

I don&#39;t want to believe that a bunch of innocent kids went to school one day and ended up dead. Please, god, let it have been a false flag. It&#39;s no different than 9/11 or Ebola. Nobody wants to believe that terrorists can just hijack planes so easily and kill thousands, or that some terrible disease can run unchecked by modern medicine and we aren&#39;t prepared to stop it. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we know now beyond a shadow of a doubt that conspiracies DO happen. MkUltra. Human experimentation in St. Louis in the 60&#39;s. Stuff we never thought was possible really happened. </p>

<p>The internet is a big place. Has anyone ever seen even one person outside of media that has posted about being from Newtown and knowing someone who was killed? If I were from there and it happened to someone I knew, I would be on these posts like white on rice telling people they were wrong. Does anyone here know anyone from the Newtown area? It&#39;s impossible that the whole town is in on it, right?? </p>

<p>It has kind of died down now. But. About a year ago you couldn&#39;t say a word about it without a random shill popping up claiming to be from/know the families and how could we possibly be questioning this? Every.single.time. Like I said, it&#39;s not quite as rampant now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You  can spend days watching videos of people trying to make a case for this conspiracy, and it is an entertaining thought. Yet, it is not logical that so many would be involved in this elaborate scheme, when something like this could have been pulled off easily with one shooter and a select few people behind this ruse. There is no reason to hire thousands of actors and paying off the police, paying off the hospital, and paying off fake witnesses. It lacks logic or reason. They would be taking the path of the most resistance. It would be insanely stupid. The conspiracy theory has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.</p>

<p>Some of these conspirators have claimed Tony Hawk, actors from law and order, Mad tv and SNL were apart of this. It is absurd. Now, I do believe there are plenty of conspiracies that are probably mostly accurate, and many parts of history have been, and continue to be covered up, but we have to choose our battles more wisely than this story concerning Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Sad truth. </p>

<p>I start talking to people about it after I have known them a while, so they know I&#39;m reasonably intelligent and not some loony. Get them to watch one of the good videos on the subject and they instantly see that you&#39;re telling the truth. This then leads them to start questioning other events and doing their own research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore the whole superbowl thing - it&#39;s a massive red herring. </p>

<p>But Sandy Hook WAS a political hoax involving a number of US government agencies, actors and and corrupt officials within Newtown and Connecticut State medical/police services. Local and national media were also involved in the hoax.</p>

<p>The &quot;victims&quot; were fictional protagonists - no birth or death certificates exist for any of them. They were created using photoshopped images of real children and given a back story and a &quot;family&quot; to make them appear real. The &quot;crazed gunman&quot; Adam Lanza was a real person, but he changed his name to Ryan (ostensibly his brother, but for whom no birth certificate exists) leaving a ghost identity that the organisers were able to use as the killer.</p>

<p>This hoax demonstrates the level of corruption that exists in the United States government, from the President down. It also shows just how far the mainstream media colludes with government. </p>

<p>This is patently false. Who the hell thinks that?</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories evolve out of discrepancies and lies in the official government narrative. The official Sandy Hook story is a tissue of lies - the whole thing was fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of two minds on this. On one hand, heck, personally I WANT to believe in a Sandy Hook conspiracy. I don&#39;t want to believe that a bunch of innocent kids went to school one day and ended up dead. Please, god, let it have been a false flag. It&#39;s no different than 9/11 or Ebola. Nobody wants to believe that terrorists can just hijack planes so easily and kill thousands, or that some terrible disease can run unchecked by modern medicine and we aren&#39;t prepared to stop it. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we know now beyond a shadow of a doubt that conspiracies DO happen. MkUltra. Human experimentation in St. Louis in the 60&#39;s. Stuff we never thought was possible really happened. </p>

<p>The internet is a big place. Has anyone ever seen even one person outside of media that has posted about being from Newtown and knowing someone who was killed? If I were from there and it happened to someone I knew, I would be on these posts like white on rice telling people they were wrong. Does anyone here know anyone from the Newtown area? It&#39;s impossible that the whole town is in on it, right?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter who reports it, look at the source. It links to the Connecticut state documents, look for yourself. The data showing 0 murders was in reference to the local PD of Newtown. Whatever &quot;happened&quot; at sandy hook, it was responded to by state police, which is why its in the state police documentation for the year, not newtown PD&#39;s count</p>
