        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve dealt with some troubling times in my past, for a period of time I was just waiting to die (actively encouraging it). I just didn&#39;t care. I&#39;m not religious, I do ask of things from a creator, I must say, I&#39;ve always gotten everything I wanted. Was this his command or was this my mind? I think it was my mind. My question is, people are so afraid of death, so afraid of what&#39;s next that it puts them in a comatose state. Is this the reason they cannot divorce themselves from, well themselves and think for a second on a bigger scale. I am the most objective person you will meet and yes, I can read your character, it&#39;s not hard and it&#39;s not magical. It&#39;s a gift my humble ancestors passed down to me. I see so many people wanting to wake up, but if I bring things up, they shut down. Usually I&#39;m pretty convincing, but damn, people are so stuck. FTR I&#39;m trying to wake up those loved ones around me. What are your thoughts, strategies and advice. How do I go about this? Are some people too gone? Do you really have to face every demon you have to wake up? I have and I said fuck em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive faced death as well... from death threats, knives in my face, and suicide attempts.. and it wasnt until death became just a word and ive said fuck it all, that i decided to wake up.. it took me to realize i have nothing to lose by dying to wake up... i did my research and learned all i can.. sometimes it takes a lifetime of pain to realize we cant hide behind lies anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See and this is what I&#39;m saying. People are so afraid but once they meet it in the face, really you are free. I&#39;ve never told family, but the reason I&#39;m so &quot;laid back&quot;, is because I&#39;ve come to terms with things so many people are afraid of. Maybe this is why one of the last rituals of free masonry is death. Because, only then, once you conquered it mentally you can be freed. Idk, I&#39;m buzzing, but I thought I&#39;d put it out there. Thanks for your comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I mean think about this: We&#39;ve been lied to... about everything. That sucks... But. There are some very amazing things that have been suppressed too. Hidden things. Things we&#39;re not supposed to know about. Ancient civilizations. Like thousands of years before the Sumerians. Sacred geometry. <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> is all over this. It&#39;s all over ancient architecture. New, powerful ways of understanding the universe. Ayahusaca. I&#39;m a hard core materialist, masters degree in mechanical engineering, but... I&#39;m thinking astral projection might be real. Crazy cool stuff. Still exploring, but it&#39;s very exciting.</p>

<p>And fwiw, most all the expats down here in Costa Rica know what&#39;s up. We have dinner conversations about private central banking and Laurel Canyon. You look like a loon down here if you parrot the official 9/11 story. Total role reversal.</p>

<p>And if you can project yourself spiritually, without drugs, consider that a profound gift. The drugs are just a means to an end -- or at least that&#39;s how it should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this, good for you! When I was 17, this was the last thing on my mind. But now as I got older, I start to think at things a little differently, mainly, not from my pants. For some of us it&#39;s a journey and some a road trip. I&#39;m glad to see a young one here awaken. Don&#39;t buy into you&#39;re crazy, don&#39;t buy into YOLO. There are so many forces going against you guys your age. IDK, I&#39;m drunk now. I&#39;m just glad to see your awake. Help those youngsters around you and say fuck you to the rest. I wish you the best :).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easier said then done, I know. Your not jaded (imo, i don&#39;t know you but i feel for you), you just see through bullshit. This is a strong characteristic. We may feel jaded, I get called jaded all the time. At the end of the day, I know what I want, I can see through peoples bullshit, and I scream when shit doesn&#39;t make sense. This isn&#39;t jaded, this is being your own being. I call things out no matter the consequences, I speak my mind, you know why? Because I can, lol, fuck the nay sayers fuck those who call you crazy. You&#39;re not, we are among the most sane here on this place. We live amongst dead people, both spiritually and physically. Not preaching, but people just don&#39;t know themselves. You can see it in reality TV. People just want to live the lives of others whilst not accepting their own. It&#39;s sad, don&#39;t get discouraged, don&#39;t get depressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the feeling, some times we just got to let go. We can&#39;t help everyone, we got to focus on mainly us and then those we love the most. I know it&#39;s a scary feeling. I lose myself on a daily basis, trust me. But there are things that shock me back. Mainly family, mainly my little nephew. It gives me a purpose. I will take being called crazy, as long as I can teach him and be apart of his life. Don&#39;t wish to be asleep again, because it&#39;s not possible. Once you&#39;ve seen shit, it can never be the same. The same as if a partner cheated on you. You can&#39;t go back, but you can learn. It&#39;s hard and exhausting, but worth it. I&#39;d take my feelings I have at age 26 over being clueless at 17. You want to know why? Because either way I&#39;m going to get to 26, better to be awake then dead inside. I know who I am, I know what I believe, It took a long time. Seclusion, alcohol, depression, hopelessness, but I was reborn from the ashes, a new being. As I think you are doing. You just started at an earlier age. Which in some sense is better. Wish I could&#39;ve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love and truth conquer all.  When you stop fearing death and the unknown, it frees you.  Each and every one of us are meant for something more.  It&#39;s long overdue that we stand up.  Cowering in fear will never benefit us or our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people get so scared when they hear the word death... its just a word.. and words cant hold power over us... if we just give up the fear that word gives then we will be free.... i just dont understand why we let words control every aspect of our lives....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It must be a welcomed part of thing we call consciousness.  Fear cripples all.  Fear ruins all.  I&#39;m a handful of years older, however our ever evolving conclusions are quite similar, if not identical.  It took me much longer to realize the readily apparent truths that constantly surround us.  Far too long.  Shedding fear changed me permanently.  As I&#39;m sure it did you as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it has changed me.. im more reckless, but not in ways youd think a teen would be.... since ive woken up and been freed, i havent self harmed (which i was severely prone to for six years), i dont drink or smoke or party... but im not afraid to speak out.. im not afraid to question my teachers or challenge authority.. im not afraid to hold or shoot guns like i was before i woke up... im more free in my expression and stronger in my oppose.... adults sometimes fear me and try to beat me down.. nothing can stop me... </p>
