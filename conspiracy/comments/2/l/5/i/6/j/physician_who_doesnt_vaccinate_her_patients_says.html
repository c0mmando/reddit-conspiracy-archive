        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Dr. Toni Bark Illinois MD</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC1p2EJww_4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC1p2EJww_4</a></p>

<p>Dr. Bark has seen the damage that vaccines can cause because a number of the families she has in her practice come to her because their first child suffered a vaccine reaction and they didn&#39;t want to vaccinate their other children. </p>

<p>&quot;What I notice is that children who come to me from other practices where they&#39;ve been fully vaccinated often are--well they are the kids in my practice with asthma, panic disorder, OCD, pandas, autism, Asperger&#39;s.  My kids who&#39;ve never been vaccinated in my practice, I don&#39;t see those issues.  I don&#39;t have one child who was not vaccinated who also has asthma, food allergies, or Asperger&#39;s or autism, or Crohn&#39;s or ulcerative colitis-none of these chronic, either chronic inflammatory or chronic autoimmune diseases..  I don&#39;t have that in my population that never was vaccinated-or even that was probably vaccinated very delayed and selectively. But often those kids are in families where the first child was vaccinated fully and .there was a vaccine reaction, so the parents decided not to. .</p>

<p>&quot;I can only make comments about my own patient population.  I can say in my patient population, the kids with chronic illness are the kids who were vaccinated.  And the kids that weren&#39;t vaccinated, I don&#39;t have any of those children on medications.  None of them have chronic illness. .I can&#39;t think of one that has any kind of chronic illness. Not one..</p>

<p>&quot;I hear very similar stories.  I have to believe the parents when-in twenty years, I&#39;ve probably had a few hundred families come to me and tell me a very similar story.  Which is, their first child received vaccinations, whether it was at birth or whether it was two months in, or whether it was six months in-at some point they received a round of vaccinations where they had high pitched screaming, fever, arching the back, and they were never the same. &quot;</p>

It could be that it&#39;s not vaccines causing the deaths, but rather other factors which the study hasn&#39;t accounted for.

<p>While you provided your sources (kudos), she can not and her words should not be taken as anything other than words.  Some doctor who vaccinates his patients can come out and say his patients are all healthy and those that are not vaccinated that come to him are sickly.  We couldn&#39;t trust him either.  Neither doctor can prove their statements due to HIPA, and as such their statements should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>To claim vaccines cause these various ailments, you must prove causation.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s known vaccines cause autoimmune diseases and allergies, this is no secret, there are many studies.  </p>

<p><strong>Self-Organized Criticality Theory of Autoimmunity</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008382">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008382</a></p>

<p><strong>Notice how she went on about how healthy her unvaccinated kids were and how sick the vaccinated kids were, yet didn&#39;t say anything about how many she&#39;s seen that were vaccinated and healthy?</strong></p>

<p>If 99.9% of unvaccinated are perfectly healthy while only approx 75% of vaccinated are healthy, then this is a huge problem.  It would explain why Big Pharma keep refusing to study the unvaccinated, as it would give away their dirty secret of how they increase the size of their drug sales market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must know very little about the history of vaccines.  Multiple MMR vaccines have been banned because they absolutely caused horrible encephalitic fevers,  The extremely dangerous OPV Polio vaccine which is banned in the First World because it often caused Polio symptoms is what&#39;s being used on Indian children (While they claim to have eradicated Polio the prevalence of never-before documented and identically symptomatic ailments such as NPAFP and asceptic meningitis have skyrocketed).  Millions of the original Salk vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus because they used body tissues of monkeys. </p>

<p>The VICP has awarded compensation to over 200 victims of encephalitic fever resulting in an ASD diagnosis.  This is after throwing out thousands of cases without any examination.  And remember the VICP is not conducted like a legal case, it is a panel of experts who decide to award compensation only if the victim can present enough evidence to prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the causation of their ailment.</p>

<p>And lastly, you must not realize that legal precedent against a vaccine is nearly impossible because manufacturers cannot be sued for injuries their product may cause.  The only way to implicate a vaccine is through peer-reviewed research, and as <a href="/u/liverpoolwin">/u/liverpoolwin</a> has pointed out, there are many studies implicating vaccines.  The problem lies in the fact that pharmaceutical companies invest heavily into the Research Institutes that put on the studies, the Journal&#39;s that publish them, and the media that is supposed to report on them.  It is well known that the corporate media is not allowed to cover [b]anything[/b] that casts their financiers in a negative light. </p>

<p>Those kids without a single health problem in the world could have parents that simply &quot;forgot&quot; to get their kinds vaccinated because &quot;they never really got sick.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know only two things for sure about vaccines. I never get them and I&#39;m fine. My friends get them and manage to catch everything. I also know that vaccine reactions exist in pets and can be quite life threatening for them, which is why I am never about to dismiss the existence of vaccine reactions , and why if you have a dog or cat,your vet should be administering the vaccines in the back leg so it can be amputated if need be instead of over the shoulders.Discounting all else, for lack of being able to completely verify any of it, at least without far more time at my disposal to attempt to, my opinion, is that I&#39;m sure vaccines have their moments and uses; However, I trust them only enough to use them when there is absolutely no other choice. That is my personal and professional experience. The fact that such a huge controversy exists about it, in my opinion, doesn&#39;t help. Seems to me that when such a huge uproar exists about something there has got to be a problem with whatever it may be somewhere. I may not know what it is but I&#39;d bet my ass there is something wrong. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a good reason to downvote the article though (IMO anyway). I&#39;d downvote it for not being very conspiracy related, not because I think anti-vax is overflowing with bad science and muzzy-headed thinking.</p>

<p>Really!  You are nothing but a parrot.</p>

<p>Unless you have YOUR OWN peer reviewed studies on the topic, then you know nothing other than what you&#39;ve been told.  More and more information indicates that you damn well may have been told wrong.</p>

<p>People like you automatically assume that this means that ALL vaccines are bad and no one should EVER be vaccinated.  However the facts are starting to pile up against the prescribed method of loading new born babies with every vaccination available...</p>

<p>Yeah, genius... Let&#39;s vaccinate new born babies for STD&#39;s.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>A practice of spacing out select vaccinations is a perfectly logical response.</p>

<p>If it is completely wrong and is not helpful or constructive, then what is your answer to all the maladies that children suffer these days that were so incredibly scarce only a couple decades ago?</p>

<p>Big pharma, with it&#39;s big budget bottom line is evil.  Pure and simple.  The good that they do is quickly being outpaced by their insanity.</p>

<p>To note... I&#39;m speaking from first hand experience.  I was poisoned by pharmaceuticals and lost three years of life, in and out of hospitals.  I was fine, except for some very light fatigue that was interfering with my extremely active work and personal life.</p>

<p>Instead of doing blood work and trying a nutritionist, or physical therapy/exercise regimen, I fucked up and let a doctor medicate me.  Immediately after, my life was a total wreck until my parents bought my way in to see a concierge doctor who would spend hours with me on a single visit.  He weened me off the meds and I IMMEDIATELY improved.</p>

<p>I lost my job... Almost lost my wife... And as a musician, I fell of my instrument and trashed a lifetime of practice and discipline that I&#39;m still struggling to regain.</p>

<p>FUCK the pharmaceutical companies and their myriad of side effects in order to treat a runny nose.  They&#39;ve gotten so far off track, it&#39;s criminal and should be prosecuted.  And vaccinations are right up there as their flag-ship-evil, right next to anti-depressants.</p>

<p>And FUCK the parrots that run their fucking mouths without knowing shit, except for what they&#39;ve been told.  You go ahead and pump your children full of poison.  I was careful with my kids and all three of them are perfect, while ALL of their friends have issues. </p>

<p>Heh. Anyways...</p>

<p>The problem with conspiracies is that they do -exist- but we&#39;ve got the other end of the spectrum that believe everything. You&#39;ve got to utilize reason and logic in your thinking. Otherwise, when you say that 9/11 was an inside job -- with some very articulate points and arguments -- but then switch to the vaccination thing, people are less likely to believe your relevant previous points. ( not saying you think that, just giving an example )</p>

<p>If only people would cluster around the things that are backed up with some greater thinking -- maybe this sub would get somewhere. </p>

<p>Please my friend, go read the scientific literature on vaccines. Science is something you can believe in. Peer review. Double blind testing. These are things that you can rally people to your cause with, and useful to know when you are barking up the wrong tree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things you&#39;ve cited are from credible sources, unlike that first move. I like the trend in your linkage. Vaccines do have side effects, yes. I completely agree. It&#39;s why we don&#39;t give everyone the Anthrax vaccine, because it is rare to encounter such a thing and there is a greater risk associated with it than normal. And in some cases, isolated ones, we&#39;ve may have been hasty to utilize them -- but in the vast majority of cases, vaccines are responsible for the upkeep of so much more life than they are of death. There is simply no other way to keep this many people on our planet alive than to prevent the outbreaks that would inevitably consume us... </p>

<p><a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/lessons-unlearned/">http://www.texasobserver.org/lessons-unlearned/</a></p>

<p>That article is more of a history lesson than a scientific reference, but I feel it is a good basis for my argument.</p>

<p>Concerning the greater cause of pro-vaccination, I present to you this tomb. It references many of the things you refer to -- which also happen to be inevitable. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25344/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25344/</a></p>

<p>It takes time to refine and sometimes we make mistakes. Fortunately that is why we have Science. Vaccines on the whole have proven to be a good thing, but just like the rest of medicine -- we&#39;re not all the way there yet.</p>

<p>That does not mean we should throw out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pro-vaccine story is not based on real science or history, it&#39;s all about myth and assumption.  If the necessary studies to show that vaccines really have helped were commissioned and if they could clearly show that vaccines had caused less harm and more good, I would change my views, but at the moment vaccine science is quite simply junk science and there are huge conflicts of interest, especially with the fact that Big Pharma benefit if they induce autoimmune diseases and allergies via vaccine.  I&#39;ve seen many people (friends, neighbors and family) have their lives destroyed by vaccines, whereas a spot of Flu, Chicken Pox or Measles would have been a far safer bet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people should resist the urge to try to oppress people from expressing such opinions. People like to think that allowing people to openly talk against vaccines is dangerous. I say those people are the one who are a danger to the cause of encouraging vaccines. When you restrict the argument, you force polarization. Then people are forced to decide which polarized view to stand by, that vaccines are a risk-less miracle, or that they are dangerous cause to most diseases with elusive causes. I think both views are wrong and many when forced to decide without enough information, will naturally chose to lean towards caution.</p>

<p>Discussion is good and middle ground allows people without enough information to have a choice that isn&#39;t forced to an extreme view.</p>

<p>Unless you have YOUR OWN peer reviewed studies on the topic, then you know nothing other than what you&#39;ve been told.  More and more information indicates that you damn well may have been told wrong.</p>

<p>People like you automatically assume that this means that ALL vaccines are bad and no one should EVER be vaccinated.  However the facts are starting to pile up against the prescribed method of loading new born babies with every vaccination available...</p>

<p>Yeah, genius... Let&#39;s vaccinate new born babies for STD&#39;s.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>A practice of spacing out select vaccinations is a perfectly logical response.</p>

<p>If it is completely wrong and is not helpful or constructive, then what is your answer to all the maladies that children suffer these days that were so incredibly scarce only a couple decades ago?</p>

<p>Big pharma, with it&#39;s big budget bottom line is evil.  Pure and simple.  The good that they do is quickly being outpaced by their insanity.</p>

<p>To note... I&#39;m speaking from first hand experience.  I was poisoned by pharmaceuticals and lost three years of life, in and out of hospitals.  I was fine, except for some very light fatigue that was interfering with my extremely active work and personal life.</p>

<p>Instead of doing blood work and trying a nutritionist, or physical therapy/exercise regimen, I fucked up and let a doctor medicate me.  Immediately after, my life was a total wreck until my parents bought my way in to see a concierge doctor who would spend hours with me on a single visit.  He weened me off the meds and I IMMEDIATELY improved.</p>

<p>I lost my job... Almost lost my wife... And as a musician, I fell of my instrument and trashed a lifetime of practice and discipline that I&#39;m still struggling to regain.</p>

<p>FUCK the pharmaceutical companies and their myriad of side effects in order to treat a runny nose.  They&#39;ve gotten so far off track, it&#39;s criminal and should be prosecuted.  And vaccinations are right up there as their flag-ship-evil, right next to anti-depressants.</p>

<p>And FUCK the parrots that run their fucking mouths without knowing shit, except for what they&#39;ve been told.  You go ahead and pump your children full of poison.  I was careful with my kids and all three of them are perfect, while ALL of their friends have issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must know very little about the history of vaccines.  Multiple MMR vaccines have been banned because they absolutely caused horrible encephalitic fevers,  The extremely dangerous OPV Polio vaccine which is banned in the First World because it often caused Polio symptoms is what&#39;s being used on Indian children (While they claim to have eradicated Polio the prevalence of never-before documented and identically symptomatic ailments such as NPAFP and asceptic meningitis have skyrocketed).  Millions of the original Salk vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus because they used body tissues of monkeys. </p>

<p>The VICP has awarded compensation to over 200 victims of encephalitic fever resulting in an ASD diagnosis.  This is after throwing out thousands of cases without any examination.  And remember the VICP is not conducted like a legal case, it is a panel of experts who decide to award compensation only if the victim can present enough evidence to prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the causation of their ailment.</p>

<p>And lastly, you must not realize that legal precedent against a vaccine is nearly impossible because manufacturers cannot be sued for injuries their product may cause.  The only way to implicate a vaccine is through peer-reviewed research, and as <a href="/u/liverpoolwin">/u/liverpoolwin</a> has pointed out, there are many studies implicating vaccines.  The problem lies in the fact that pharmaceutical companies invest heavily into the Research Institutes that put on the studies, the Journal&#39;s that publish them, and the media that is supposed to report on them.  It is well known that the corporate media is not allowed to cover [b]anything[/b] that casts their financiers in a negative light. </p>

People like to think that allowing people to openly talk against vaccines is dangerous. I say those people are the one who are a danger to the cause of encouraging vaccines. When you restrict the argument, you force polarization. Then people are forced to decide which polarized view to stand by, that vaccines are a risk-less miracle, or that they are dangerous cause to most diseases with elusive causes. I think both views are wrong and many when forced to decide without enough information, will naturally chose to lean towards caution.</p>

<p>She&#39;s making claims that none of her non-vaccinated patients have any problems, and those that do have been vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s her experience.  At no point does she claim that that&#39;s the case for every doctor or every patient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s trying to force you to connect the dots in a manner that shows vaccines cause those problems and if you don&#39;t do vaccines you won&#39;t get those problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She&#39;s trying to get people to question vaccines and ensure that they&#39;re effective and safe.  No one is being forced to think anything - that&#39;s entirely and completely in your head.</p>

<p>P.S. You&#39;re easily swayed with anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>Your comments are all the anecdotal evidence I need ;)</p>

<p>We know the man fell off the 10 story building, and that his body is laying there in a bloody mess, but it would be a stretch to say the man died from falling off the building.</p>

<p>Thats why Frank Luntz coaches shills to open their statement with something that shows the audience that they really care... but are concerned about because reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fraud was exposed when <em>peers reviewed</em> the study and could not reproduce the same results. Also, with a little investigation, they were able to find financial conflicts of interest. The study was immediately discredited and the co-authors pulled their support. So no, my confidence isn&#39;t shaken. They found that it was wrong and corrected the mistake immediately. </p>
