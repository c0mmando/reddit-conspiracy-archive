<p>James Corbett talked about this a little bit in his AMA.  He talks about it a lot in his videos and podcasts, as does Sibel Edmonds and many other anarchists/voluntarists online.  </p>

<p>We need a way to pull together all of the voluntarists that are legitimate, and weed out those that are not (the Alex Jones-tards).</p>

<p>In the meantime, developing our own alternative forms of currency, taking payment in cash/barter/iou&#39;s, and developing our own ways of strengthening our communities from within, rather than relying on government handouts, which inevitably control us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. This is the number one issue that must be addressed. All the 9/11 truth videos in the world will fall on deaf ears if they contradict &quot;trusted news&quot; for people.</p>

<p>What about a site that catalogs news sources and rates their credibility? Or if those exist, can we give them more visibility?</p>

<p>edit: Of course the question is who does the rating, and how do we prevent that from getting corrupted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on an idea like this for awhile.  You could create it much like reddit is structured, but instead of us just submitting links, you are required to either analyze the article itself or offer up analysis in some fashion.</p>

<p>We see it here because it&#39;s what we see to be doing lately (at least I am) where I will link to a story or two and then try and poke some holes in the &#39;Official Version&#39; of events with other sources (that are sometimes MSM themselves).</p>

<p>A crypto-currency tip-jar can maybe be utilized to add other incentives besides karma to a successful post, and may be used as a carrot-on-a-stick mechanism to put out regular, quality analysis.</p>

<p>My problem is I have no experience in anything like this, but would love to contribute in other ways. Maybe that&#39;s already out there? And if it isn&#39;t...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a constitutionalist, and close to being a minarchist. </p>

<p>While a lot of people hate him, he does a lot of good as well. Sure, he exaggerates some things, but in general he&#39;s pretty close to bang on. He has an obvious blind spot when it comes to Israel, but c&#39;mon... overall he&#39;s 100x better than any MSM outlet. </p>

<p>We can pick anyone in the alternative media and criticise them for something. (Jeff Rense anyone?) Or we can take the good, leave the bad, and focus on points of agreement. All too often we tend to be negative, when we need to be more positive and proactive. The negative stuff is good to know, but what do you do with that?</p>

<p>e.g. GMOs are horrid - a negative point. What do you do? Buy organic or natural food - boycott Unilever and Sun Foods (negative) -- and buycott (actively purchase) food from organic producers (a positive action), etc. </p>

<p>Same goes for news. Boycott the MSM and buycott alternative media. Get a subscription to The Corbett Report, even if it&#39;s just 100 JPY a month. Buy Tangy Tangerine? :) Hehehe!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I boycott anyone who tries to discredit Alex Jones.  So much he&#39;s done.  He&#39;s human and makes mistakes but he&#39;s at least doing something and made the movement larger than ever.  jafbm just sounds butthurt and bit jealous when he adds &quot;the Alex Jones-tards&quot; and calls him illegitimate.  Anyone who does this in my opinion is a troll or just someone who hates conspiracy theorists and want to lead them away from the main conspiracy theorists that are doing the most harm to the MSM.  </p>

<p>jafbm is not trustworthy.</p>

<p>Everyday the trolls post a news article and add in something negative about AJ.  It&#39;s quite obvious what they are doing.  </p>

<p>Bingo! :) </p>

<p>Every now and then I catch AJ saying something that&#39;s not quite right, and quite often he&#39;ll stop, mull it over, say &quot;Pull that up,&quot; and continue. </p>

<p>Like you said, he&#39;s human and makes mistakes, but he&#39;s done far more good than just about anyone else out there in the alternative media space. </p>

<p>I get that a lot of people don&#39;t like him, but I also figure that there&#39;s no sense in starting fights about it. Better just to brush it off &amp; move on. </p>

<p>A lot of people don&#39;t like his personality; that I find rather immature - better to listen to the message. &quot;Shoot the messenger&quot; isn&#39;t a great strategy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to any public place, such as an airport, a coffee shop, a McDonald&#39;s, a bar, or a hospital and they will have CNN or Fox on their TV for people to &quot;get their news&quot; or just be entertained. When people could find credible news sources online, they&#39;d rather sit on their Facebook app or Candy Crush and half-way pay attention to the TV.</p>

<p>Credible sources are hard to come by because .com or .net news sites are run like businesses because it costs money to host the site. How do you get people to come back to your site? Embellish a little and dramatize what really happened to get more readers, people love good stories. If a website had only the whole truth and it was plainly written, the traffic would be too low to pay for hosting if their ads aren&#39;t gaining enough views. I&#39;m personally not aware of any non-profit news organization websites. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr: Most people don&#39;t care if the news is credible because none of it affects their life. Credible sources are rare because of the strong presence of MSM. (Sounds like common sense when you dumb it down.) Turn off CNN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that is that most Americans are xenophobic (especially towards Middle Eastern peoples post 9/11), and showing them an often credible news source based out of Qatar (where most Americans couldn&#39;t point out on a map) would be met with blind opposition. Perhaps if the name wasn&#39;t mentioned or plastered all over the screen (which Al-Jazeera isn&#39;t guilty of), people might actually be fed some truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me I believe the war against corruption and greed will be through information. Currently we&#39;re losing.</p>

<p>We need to eliminate the power of shills and downvotes in a system like reddit. They spread too much disinformation and we have a hard time detracting the people from their lies. Which is what they&#39;re trained to do.</p>

<p>If we had a site that had a &quot;for&quot; &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;against&quot; comment section that once you commented in one you we&#39;re inable to comment or vote in the others (still being able to link replies) i think it would go a long way. People are not stupid,  you just need to encourage their own critical thinking at their own pace. If they could see both arguments,  without shills intentionally infuriating and name calling, I think it may do just that. </p>

<p>We also need a site or group dedicated to compiling evidence of fabricated news or disinformation spread by the MSM. But that said this is all very winnable still. We have a chance but that window has been closing since 2001. Which is exactly what they want to happen. This is why they still block videos on fb,  because they know what can happened with an informed public.</p>

<p>Anytime you see someone add &quot;the Alex Jones-tards&quot; or anything negative in their articles titles it&#39;s obvious what they are trying to do.  Everyday they do this.  And they try to get people to break the law and talk about drugs and aliens.  </p>
