Feels creepy and no one can articulate it quite right, just &quot;dude, join a commune&quot; or &quot;dudette, I&#39;m not a part of your system.&quot; Anyone know what&#39;s up? ZeroHedge just posted this &quot;I&#39;m not a part of your system&quot; agitprop: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-03/election-2014-%E2%80%93-why-i-opt-out-voting">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-03/election-2014-%E2%80%93-why-i-opt-out-voting</a></p>

<p>Are they trying even harder to push us from voting a third party to show the disenfranchised&#39;s strength? I know a bunch of people are falling for this propaganda--but who&#39;s behind it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I always end up voting third party because it really is Douche vs. Turd Sandwich, but I still don&#39;t understand why there appears to be a concerted effort to get people like us not to vote at all this year when a lot of states have <em>a lot</em> of important measures on the line (for instance, in California, reduced sentencing for minor drug offenders).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because not voting matters too. It means something when people don&#39;t show up. Even more than that, it means something when the numbers of people who voted vs. who actually did conflict (as they have done in many states, and countries, as long as voting has existed).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t vote anywhere. I don&#39;t agree with it. Leaders will NEVER be able to appease <em>everyone</em>. It&#39;s unrealistic to expect that. Democracy is flawed in many ways, but I am talking about the way that it creates an Us vs. Them attitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul made a big stir in 2008, he got a surprisingly large amount of votes in the primaries despite the mainstream media actively marginalizing him. It may seem like nothing was accomplished but the People in Charge were at the very least forced to expend resources to co-opt the movement and transform it into something less threatening and more polarizing; the Tea Party.</p>

<p>Voting third party is more effective than not voting. Paul never really had much of a chance, I understand that, but look at how They reacted to his grassroots campaign. There were people who were very serious about making sure no-one took Paul seriously. Paul was GOP but if a third party gets 20% then the whole illusion that there are only two choices starts to crack.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;who&#39;s behind it&quot;. It&#39;s a matter of &quot;what ideas are behind it&quot;.

<p>This.  People make this false assumption that &quot;democracy is virtuous&quot; because of the social conditioning/brainwashing that they have had to endure.  When you examine the fundamental morality of &quot;democracy&quot;, then you find out how immoral &quot;democracy&quot; actually is and why it is just another trick to keep people in compliance with our rulers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done that many times over the years (I&#39;m 68) without ever voting and with much better results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This system is corrupt, so voting is participating in (=validating) a corrupt system. This is rational behind the &quot;Don&#39;t Vote&quot; movement.</p>

<p>However, the people likely to understand and agree with this thinking are just those people that the powers that be would most like to stay home on voting day. It rids them of the need to fix the vote after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a good thought exercise.</p>

<p>I am trying to develop a new habit where I don&#39;t tell someone &quot;I&#39;m going to do such and such&quot;. Instead, I just do it. Because neurologists have determined that when you tell someone about your plans, you get little dopamine rewards as if you had accomplished something.</p>

<p>So going down and voting for &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; is giving you some satisfaction in your brain as if you are an important part of the process. You&#39;re not, you&#39;re more valuable not buying into the system at all.</p>

<p>If you had enough time to go and research everyone who is running, and then go and write in your candidates [anyone worthy enough for me generally doesn&#39;t make the ballots] - at least your candidate can then appear in the results, right?</p>

<p>Nope. The same media that doesn&#39;t give them any exposure still isn&#39;t giving them exposure. So you&#39;ve wasted time that in my opinion, you could have used to learn about solar power, or design a water catchment system so you can drink water without flouride.</p>

<p>I am not wasting my time, comparatively. But that wasn&#39;t my question here - my question was really that I am mostly curious, about the massive push that&#39;s going on re:encouraging people (especially people on free-thinking and conspiracy sites) not to vote, and this backwards idea that allowing bad laws to pass or fail without real dissent is some noble thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having had clearances and also worked under DOT guidelines, I gotta tell you, as long as you&#39;re not showing up to work drunk you&#39;re fine.

Same for airline employees, Senior Flight Attendant for a major airline gets a random coming into customs.</p>

<p>And TBH, I&#39;m all for it. You sign up to do a job, you do the job. You agree to something, you follow through.

<p>I&#39;ve not seen it personally but they can and do test for alcohol now too. And even under DOT there were only random piss tests. [I never got tested except to get the job] However I know a WAITRESS who got a hair follicle test and it had like years of history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“I have solved this political dilemma in a very direct way: I don’t vote. On Election Day, I stay home. I firmly believe that if you vote, you have no right to complain. Now, some people like to twist that around. They say, ‘If you don’t vote, you have no right to complain,’ but where’s the logic in that? If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent politicians, and they get into office and screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You voted them in. You caused the problem. You have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote — who did not even leave the house on Election Day — am in no way responsible for what these politicians have done and have every right to complain about the mess that you created.” — George Carlin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you vote for a major party, you might as well not vote at all. Nothing will change. </p>

<p>Some people think that voting is immoral because the system is simply a monopoly on violence, and you&#39;re only contributing to that violence by participating. Most never stop to think that given that violence, voting might be a form of self defense. </p>

<p>I never vote because there&#39;s never anyone worth voting for. I would vote for a voluntaryist though (which seems bizarre). </p>

<p>But, if you really do want to vote, you will achieve more if you piss or shit in the ballot box. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In which country do you live? In the US, elections entail voting for political candidates and legal amendments. You can omit voting for Governor, but choose to vote for other items on the ballot. Refusing to vote for items that affect you personally (like tax increases, law changes, etc.) doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense unless you truly don&#39;t care about the outcome. Some people don&#39;t, but voting means you <em>can</em> bitch later because at least you got off your ass, you&#39;ve got it exactly backwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely seen more of this worrisome message this election cycle. Here&#39;s what I just wrote in another thread:</p>

<p>&quot;I will never understand people who don&#39;t vote. You think all the options are crappy: that I can understand. But by not voting you are giving your tacit consent to be ruled by these clowns. Stand up for yourselves. Go into the booth and write in Captain Cockface for every candidate, for all I care, but please just cast a vote. Be actively defiant. Your passive defiance gets spun by the media as apathy. Instead, show the politicians that there is a bloc of engaged citizens with the motivation to get themselves to the voting booths but who simply are not interested in what&#39;s being sold there. #CaptainCockface2014&quot;</p>

<p>Not voting gives <em>more</em> legitimacy to the election results, because the media can report it as &quot;Corporate Puppet X won with 52% of the vote,&quot; and just ignore the fact that only 40% of the population voted. If all the frustrated people got themselves to the polls to vote 3rd Party or write in some message, we might get something like &quot;Corporate Puppet X wins with 38% of the vote,&quot; instead. 38% of the vote can&#39;t be interpreted as a mandate no matter how you spin it, but with 52% they can claim it was the will of the majority, and those who didn&#39;t vote must ok with it.</p>
