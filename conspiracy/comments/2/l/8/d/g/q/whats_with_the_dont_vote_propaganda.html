       I'm seeing it on all my social networks especially from suspect 'counter-culture'/anarchist types (i.e., they seem like 'assets') - don't vote, don't vote, don't vote. Feels creepy and no one can articulate it quite right, just "dude, join a commune" or "dudette, I'm not a part of your system." Anyone know what's up? ZeroHedge just posted this "I'm not a part of your system" agitprop:

       Are they trying even harder to push us from voting a third party to show the disenfranchised's strength? I know a bunch of people are falling for this propaganda--but who's behind it?

       I agree with the thought that voting locally is important. However, the shit you should be able to vote for is never on the ballot. There's no real democracy in this country.

       Agreed. I always end up voting third party because it really is Douche vs. Turd Sandwich, but I still don't understand why there appears to be a concerted effort to get people like us not to vote at all this year when a lot of states have
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of important measures on the line (for instance, in California, reduced sentencing for minor drug offenders).

       Because not voting matters too. It means something when people don't show up. Even more than that, it means something when the numbers of people who voted vs. who actually did conflict (as they have done in many states, and countries, as long as voting has existed).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't vote anywhere. I don't agree with it. Leaders will NEVER be able to appease
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       . It's unrealistic to expect that. Democracy is flawed in many ways, but I am talking about the way that it creates an Us vs. Them attitude.

       But they don't give a fuck if you don't vote. They don't give a fuck if you do. This election has a lot of important little local issues, and there appears to be a concerted effort to dissuade conspiracy and independently-minded people from voting. I find this alarming.

       The more people vote, the more legitimate the election seems.  Everyone who votes is essentially declaring that they see the process as valid, and that they agree to abide by the results.

       It's not about "them," it's about us. When the average person finally realizes that it's all rigged, the government won't have any lies to fall back on for their puppets. Who voted for this person? Nobody. Nobody did. The government doesn't represent the people and we can show that by refusing to participate.

       Don't vote for that person! Vote for a third party, or write in SpongeBob...there are a lot of important measures on a lot of ballots this year, and smart people are being dissuaded from being involved in them. It's creepy.

       I'm not sure how "the government gets what the government wants" is dissimilar to "whatever the government wants to happen, will happen." If that's what you really believe, why spend so much time here? I can't believe you believe that. Just as I have trouble believing that you think silence sends any message at all. No one cares if educated people don't vote. All it does is give the data-collectors a list of names they can use to illegally vote their preferred way without suspicion or interference.

       I believe this is an accurate statement at least on the bigger things. Like most recently in Canada. The government wanted more power to spy on its citizens so they created an event that would enable them to pass laws to do just that.

       Countries that have gone through intense periods of disillusionment have a solution for all of this and that if not enough people vote then the election is invalid and must be remade again.  America has yet to reach peach disillusionment and so just doesn't really understand this concept (yet).

       Ron Paul made a big stir in 2008, he got a surprisingly large amount of votes in the primaries despite the mainstream media actively marginalizing him. It may seem like nothing was accomplished but the People in Charge were at the very least forced to expend resources to co-opt the movement and transform it into something less threatening and more polarizing; the Tea Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting third party is more effective than not voting. Paul never really had much of a chance, I understand that, but look at how They reacted to his grassroots campaign. There were people who were very serious about making sure no-one took Paul seriously. Paul was GOP but if a third party gets 20% then the whole illusion that there are only two choices starts to crack.

       Ross Perot got 18.9% of the vote in 1992, nearly 20% - I believe that's why there was so much active treachery against Ron Paul in 2008. They didn't want a repeat.

       We're at a point of history where, what are we getting in 2016 - Clinton vs. Bush again? Cripes. - ensuring anyone who'd vociferously vote third party thinks voting is lame is important to the crooked majority parties.

       I was a kid when Perot was running, I ignorantly laughed at the media's mockery of him along with everyone else. Now whenever I see a clip from that campaign it's clear he was making a little too much sense and had to be turned into a cartoon character. I didn't know he got that many votes, that's amazing.

       If I'm correct then it seems that Perot dropped out due to fearing from the CIA going after his family and then manned up and got back in only to then be ridiculed for being crazy and not serious.

       theres no real democracy because last I checked we were not a democracy, but a republic, where the only say the people get is what our elected officials say we get. and we do that because a true democracy is horribly inefficient and even easier to be repressive.

       Not at all. No one knows if you don't show up. And TPTB could give a fuck if you don't show up, except to steal your registration.

       It's not a matter of "who's behind it". It's a matter of "what ideas are behind it". And the ideas are voluntarism etc. You're making it sound like it's a conspiracy (right subreddit anyway) to get people not to vote. I think it's quite the opposite. It's people opposing the conspirators that subjugate them.

       This.  People make this false assumption that "democracy is virtuous" because of the social conditioning/brainwashing that they have had to endure.  When you examine the fundamental morality of "democracy", then you find out how immoral "democracy" actually is and why it is just another trick to keep people in compliance with our rulers.

       No one knows if people don't show up? Huh? There are all kinds of statistics out there, and if it ever gets to the point where there are just as many people voting as there are who aren't that speaks volumes. Hopefully there would be some change. Hopefully there will be before then!

       a massive election, it's all local shit. In some cases, it's about reducing mandatory minimums for drug laws and pro-marijuana legalization - issues people on these forums likely care about. But the propaganda we're being fed is "be edgy, don't vote." Why don't you guys find this suspicious?

       Your answer doesn't make any sense, in context. Why are you so insistent that people don't vote? What does it gain you?

       Not enough people will vote for a third party candidate for some reason. So it's like throwing away a vote. Yet another reason to not vote. No one has to be told to not vote. Its likely an ideology and is far from a conspiracy. The majority want people to vote the "propaganda" you speak of is self perpetuated

       If you vote, you are giving your complicity with an immoral system where we use the state as our agent of violence to solve problems and take things from others.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I don't come over to your house and steal from you because I am not a scumbag.  I also will not go to a voting booth and ask the government to steal from you because I am not a scumbag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the right to do these things to others and using the state to force people to do things "the way I want" is an immoral use of violence.

       Because you're still, by and large, voting for tweedle-dee or tweedle-dumb, no?  Most local election candidates are as hand picked as the national ones, especially in the cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, by voting, you're saying, "I support the current system and believe that I can affect positive change within it."

       I, personally, do not support the current system, nor do I believe that positive change can come from voting within its confines.

       I do however agree that it is a little fishy, all of this "don't vote" stuff that's been going around.  Most likely just another attempt at creating division amongst the populace: "You

       If a large group doesn't vote, what they don't want will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally understand not voting in presidential elections, that doesn't really ever change anything except faces, but local elections are about your district, county, city and state. In Florida we have some really good amendments on the ballots (MMJ and Wildlife conservation are the two that stick out). I didn't vote for any people (except this one guy who was the only person running for his office), but I'll be damned if I'm not going to vote for an amendment or proposition that I believe in.

       If the group is large enough you can shut the government down.

       Or be lied to about numbers which will light the fire of the revolution. 
The idea is show action just short of arming up and fighting its the next "best" thing.

       Problem is just like voting you have no idea if people voted or not..so in reality you are damned if you do and damned if you don't... So no one votes...how do you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       They could just pass whatever and say people voted.. Anonymous voting is the problem. Everyones vote should be public and verifiable that's the only way votes count. Stand by your beliefs don't oppress people with anonymity maybe that will finally stop this fake overly PC society

       This system is corrupt, so voting is participating in (=validating) a corrupt system. This is rational behind the "Don't Vote" movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the people likely to understand and agree with this thinking are just those people that the powers that be would most like to stay home on voting day. It rids them of the need to fix the vote after the fact.

       for an anarchist, to refuse to vote is to refuse to play a rigged, losing game.  An anarchist voting is like an atheist being baptized.  Like they say, if voting could change anything, it would be illegal by now.

       By voting, one implicitly agrees that the outcome is legitimate. Once one has agreed to it's legitimacy one must accept the consequences.

       The thing is, there's more on the ballot than two candidates. This year, many states have measures related to GMO labeling, marijuana legalization, mandatory minimums for non-violent offenders...

       There's this "opt out, everybody sucks" line being fed to us. I know people who stand on the corner protesting Monsanto who won't spend five minutes to go to the polls and vote for GMO labeling. What's up with that? Why bother protesting or posting on Reddit about it if you can't help get the bill passed?

       It's weird how the sentiment went from "vote third party" to "don't show up." I really feel like there's some propaganda push, especially given how disenfranchised everyone is. If everyone went and voted their conscience, it'd be kind of hilarious the new laws they'd try to pass to keep the third party candidates from winning...(and I also wonder if part of this has to do with a lot of the ballot measures on the table this election, since it's just congress, which won't change too much)

       I think you're right that there is a conspiracy to convince people like us not to vote. On the other hand I think there are a lot of people who just figure it's pointless to vote and it makes sense to them that the vote won't count anyway and you're kind of consenting to the results by voting in the first place. So a lot of them probably aren't intentionally trying to do harm but are just misguided.

       I get that, because my vote never counted, but I voted because I'm an opinionated arse. Then I moved to a small town where my vote did count and a lot of little local issues that affect me exist.

       I went through and did all the nitty-gritty today. There really is almost zero information about a lot of local candidates, although it turns out I did have an opinion on the school district board members. My favorite thing are the signs all over town that just say, "Vote Yes." Vote Yes to what? To everything? Yes, apparently, they want you to vote Yes on
       <em>
        everything.
       </em>
       Sigh.

       Here's a good thought exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am trying to develop a new habit where I don't tell someone "I'm going to do such and such". Instead, I just do it. Because neurologists have determined that when you tell someone about your plans, you get little dopamine rewards as if you had accomplished something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So going down and voting for "the lesser of two evils" is giving you some satisfaction in your brain as if you are an important part of the process. You're not, you're more valuable not buying into the system at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had enough time to go and research everyone who is running, and then go and write in your candidates [anyone worthy enough for me generally doesn't make the ballots] - at least your candidate can then appear in the results, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. The same media that doesn't give them any exposure still isn't giving them exposure. So you've wasted time that in my opinion, you could have used to learn about solar power, or design a water catchment system so you can drink water without flouride.

       I do not participate.

       I have a system that allows me to drink water without fluoride and I have a working solar panel and know how it works.

       Today, I am hanging out shitposting on Reddit. Taking ten minutes to run down and vote for medical marijuana does nothing but allow you guys and gals to not see my blathering on for a bit. Win-win.

       I am not wasting my time, comparatively. But that wasn't my question here - my question was really that I am mostly curious, about the massive push that's going on re:encouraging people (especially people on free-thinking and conspiracy sites) not to vote, and this backwards idea that allowing bad laws to pass or fail without real dissent is some noble thing.

       However I am so disgusted by the whole lying system I believe complete and utter diconnectedness from it is the only way for meaningful change.

       I am not for rebellion in the old fashioned sense. But I am taking my money out of the banking system and going anarcho syndiclist. I want to build a pond with tilapia/hydroponics and barter the tilapia for things I need in my community. I do programming to earn petrodollars and I have been trying to pay my taxes however am in bankruptcy and have already lost my life savings. The system didnt work for me even though I worked very hard for many years. That effort was useful only as a lesson.

       Yes and no. Using a tumbler you can make Bitcoins untraceable. But unless you're buying illegal things, who cares if they can track it? The financial system is your fingerprint, how could Bitcoins be worse?

       There are plenty of things you might want to hide. Your location and patterns can be divulged based on your purchases; big decentralized wallets can help, but if you're buying beer from the pub every Friday and the blockchain and the transactions are public (and the recipient is static, not tumblerized), a lot can be intuited.

       I don't like that the government can track me right now with my credit card purchases. But, in the future, not only can the government do it, but also the crazy ex-boyfriend? This problem (and others, like ease-of-use-for all) has got to be solved for cryptocurrency to succeed.

       Re: the government, people who may need clearance or otherwise want a right to privacy might not want the government tracking their alcohol purchases. But those people, for now, just use cash. All cryptocurrency all the time will block that, as well.

       Cryptocurrency needs to grow up, plain and simple, and designers need to think about real world implications of its transparency and ease-of-use if they want it to succeed.

       Having had clearances and also worked under DOT guidelines, I gotta tell you, as long as you're not showing up to work drunk you're fine. And under DOT, they use the drug testing as a tool. If someone doesn't fit the profile, the randomized testing hits. Same for airline employees, Senior Flight Attendant for a major airline gets a random coming into customs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And TBH, I'm all for it. You sign up to do a job, you do the job. You agree to something, you follow through. I think for most jobs drug testing is bullshit, but you're going to work for the Government [ostensibly public service] - or you're going to work in transportation, you leave your vices at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've not seen it personally but they can and do test for alcohol now too. And even under DOT there were only random piss tests. [I never got tested except to get the job] However I know a WAITRESS who got a hair follicle test and it had like years of history.
      </p>

       Privacy is an illusion. Darkcoin is a step in the right direction. But worrying about what they think will shorten your life.

       You seem to be skipping right over my points about personal safety unrelated to government surveillance. As many others do, also--to systems' development peril.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cryptocurrency has got to find a way to be truly anonymous and easy to use in order to successfully go mainstream. You (and many others, honestly, which is likely one of the many reasons why cryptocurrency's adoption is much slower than it should be) seem not to grok that it's not just the government that may be out to get you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be very useful to get more people into cryptocurrency that understand these issues (and honestly, any and all systems/software development, as omitting safety as the designers were lucky to live privileged lives and never thought about all of the use cases ruins plenty of other big projects).

       “I have solved this political dilemma in a very direct way: I don’t vote. On Election Day, I stay home. I firmly believe that if you vote, you have no right to complain. Now, some people like to twist that around. They say, ‘If you don’t vote, you have no right to complain,’ but where’s the logic in that? If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent politicians, and they get into office and screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You voted them in. You caused the problem. You have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote — who did not even leave the house on Election Day — am in no way responsible for what these politicians have done and have every right to complain about the mess that you created.” — George Carlin

       If you vote for a major party, you might as well not vote at all. Nothing will change.

       Some people think that voting is immoral because the system is simply a monopoly on violence, and you're only contributing to that violence by participating. Most never stop to think that given that violence, voting might be a form of self defense.

       Is that the only item on your ballot? At least where I'm at, there are a bunch of items on the ballot, some that specifically affect my town and taxes, some that affect the environment, medical marijuana, too. Plus, if candidate A wants to frack-frack-frack and candidate B doesn't, what do I care what religion they have? I want drinkable water.

       whoever votes cant complain about anything later on - you give your own "voice" to someone else, so you lose your voice. In addition the US voting system is more like polls (opinion polls), you can submit your opinion, this no longer means that you elect anyone.

       that is not what I understand as "vote", this would be a petition, which you usually sign with your name and address. I was referring to a political vote, i.e. presidential election

       In which country do you live? In the US, elections entail voting for political candidates and legal amendments. You can omit voting for Governor, but choose to vote for other items on the ballot. Refusing to vote for items that affect you personally (like tax increases, law changes, etc.) doesn't make a lot of sense unless you truly don't care about the outcome. Some people don't, but voting means you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       bitch later because at least you got off your ass, you've got it exactly backwards.

       I think the solution in all countries in the world today is that the more local an election is, the more meaningful it can be (so I agree with you). The more "federal" an election is, the less meaningful it is and I would never vote in such en election, not even at gunpoint.

       I've definitely seen more of this worrisome message this election cycle. Here's what I just wrote in another thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I will never understand people who don't vote. You think all the options are crappy: that I can understand. But by not voting you are giving your tacit consent to be ruled by these clowns. Stand up for yourselves. Go into the booth and write in Captain Cockface for every candidate, for all I care, but please just cast a vote. Be actively defiant. Your passive defiance gets spun by the media as apathy. Instead, show the politicians that there is a bloc of engaged citizens with the motivation to get themselves to the voting booths but who simply are not interested in what's being sold there. #CaptainCockface2014"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not voting gives
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       legitimacy to the election results, because the media can report it as "Corporate Puppet X won with 52% of the vote," and just ignore the fact that only 40% of the population voted. If all the frustrated people got themselves to the polls to vote 3rd Party or write in some message, we might get something like "Corporate Puppet X wins with 38% of the vote," instead. 38% of the vote can't be interpreted as a mandate no matter how you spin it, but with 52% they can claim it was the will of the majority, and those who didn't vote must ok with it.

       This thread's voting pattern is unfortunately proving my point a bit.

       Don't vote for that person! Vote for a third party, or write in SpongeBob...there are a lot of important measures on a lot of ballots this year, and smart people are being dissuaded from being involved in them. It's creepy.
