       So check this out... Last weekend I went to an ayahuasca ceremony. One of the participants was from Israel, literally flew in from Tel Aviv and took a taxi to the ceremony from the airport. Instantly, my alarms went up and I was thinking all kinds of crazy shit. Turns out he's a cool guy and lives in a town near me. I gave him a ride back, and yeah he knows about the big conspiracy and does not seem happy about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So rewind further... A few times, I've met local Costa Ricans, hung out, drank beer, smoked weed, etc.. and at some point they will say "You're a good man." like that was a big deal to them. Which struck me as weird, but um okay. I'm just a guy, ya know? I don't own any media giants or bioweapons factories or mega yachts with machine gun turrets...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider this: The US is as big, or bigger an asshole globally, when it comes to countries, than Israel is. And none of us are cool with it. Why would it be any different for most common people from Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is that it's totally probable for Israel's government and its "elite" parasitic class to be subhuman vermin, but its average citizens to be just regular people of varying degrees of coolness or shittiness. Just like Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that makes sense.

       Its funny you mention that, when the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 equates the two in section 3 subsection 10:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anti-Semitism at times has taken the form of the vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel.
       </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this legislation was used to create an agency in the State department to put together an annual report on Anti-Semitism globally. Which includes the vilification of Zionism. So, merely criticizing the government policies can be construed as Anti-Semitism. And boom - you're on

       Yeah it's like this in every country. Those who disapprove if government actions are silenced, marginalized, ostracized, or ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would think the same of me (American). Maybe they think I'm pro-drone, pro-interventionism, and approve of our fiscal policy. But I don't... But how would you know unless we hung out?

       It's interesting that you bring this up as the flood of anti-Semitic/anti-Jewish/anti-Zionist is my biggest disagreement with r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had some conversation with a moderator a couple of months ago and attached a blizzard of these anti posts that went up in this sub in about two hours time in the middle of the night USA, all posted by two usernames.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live on the US west coast and I'm a night owl, I watch the new queue here. Roundabout 2AM or so - which is mid afternoon in the middle east - the barrage starts. Same posters over and over and over, all the same hate messages, lots of really shabby Youtube links and links from the most unworthy websites you could ever dredge up on the internet, really low quality stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my PM to the moderator I linked more than 20 posts which had gone up in just an hours' time from just a couple of posters, middle of the night US. Most of Reddit pretty much dies off around 8 PM west coast time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most offensive poster was Aushluss66 or whatever his name was. There were a couple more too. And these posters had no history of comments on anything, they just bombard r/conspiracy every night with this billboarding of anti-jewish stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current major offender is a poster who shows up about 2AM every fucking night and cranks out the junk. His nic is u/Indra-Varuna. There is another new one as well, Juansomething. I think they're just new usernames for previously banned assholes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they are prolific. They dump a lot of garbage in here Every.Fucking.Day. And the mods don't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes r/conspiracy knee deep in rubbish so that there is so much useless noise in this sub it's hard to find the quality postings.

       And a couple others that I've kept my eye on. These people will submit over a dozen links per day, a few per hour. They post content that is interesting to users in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but really the content has nothing to do with conspiracies. Just fucked up shit in the news. I've caught
       <a href="/u/Indra-Varuna">
        /u/Indra-Varuna
       </a>
       posting outright racist shit (speaking against race-mixing). They post so much content that it's rare for the front page of this sub to not have at least a couple of their submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys are either pushing an ideology, or creating an environment in this sub that is just toxic so that it falls apart, or they're just shills for these blogs so that some MRE retailer can make some more cash. Variations on the number 88 (HH, or Heil Hitler, Neo Nazi shit), show that the user is more than likely a genuine racist, instead of just a shill to make the sub look bad (trying to remember the name of a user with 7777 in his name 4x7 is 28, two 8s, but maybe I'm reaching with that one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, this little group (they may be acting individually, but they all follow the same formula) is controlling a lot of content on this sub. Eight people for a sub of 260,000. This sub needs a floodgate.

       Being against race mixing is not necessarily being racist, in fact it's often the very opposite, some of us care about cultures enough that we don't want them to disappear, no matter what the culture is, and unfortunately, as ok as i might be with different colors loving each other, it does dilute cultures... and that i dislike, we've lost enough already with all this constant moving about (for capital's needs too).

       Couldn't agree more, yes those are the posters currently submitting all the racist anti-Zionist/Jew/Israel birdcage droppings.

       They're fucking retarded Nazis, thats why. They believe in an 80 year old document titled "The Protocols of Zion." They dont like to think critically for that would lead to other conclusions, rendering the Jewish conspiracy ineffective.

       I can give you an example.

      <p>
       Our speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, was in the perfect position to start an impeachment of GW Bush for lying us into war and for the 9/11 debacle. But she didn't. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that makes any sense at all is that she is a dual citizen Israeli and was in fact serving Israel's interests. In other words she is a traitor to the US and is serving Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her action was backed up by a whole lot of other people in the media and in politics and if you look closely at who they are, you will find Israeli fingerprints all over it.

       She might officially hold a passport from both the US and Israel, but as long as you are Jewish you are technically also a citizen of Israel. Of course if you are Jewish you can say I don't support Israel and I denounce any association with them but Nancy Pelosi is a staunch supporter of Israeli security and the country in general.

       I highly doubt any of them are shills. The vast majority of the evidence points to Zionist Jewry as primary architects behind the NWO and behind the grand conspiracy of the ages which started with the Hebrew Bible. Israel did 9/11, the biggest conspiracy of our times. They control the US government and the media. So it's only natural that people will talk about Zionism, Israel, and the Jews, since they appear to be primary culprits in the conspiracy realm. And that is why you have people, not shills, posting here about it: because all roads lead to Jews.

       It

       possible that it's not really Zionist Jews who are at the top of the pyramid, but the evidence for that theory has not been very convincing. Perhaps it is intentionally hidden so that we "blame the Jews", I do not know.

       I'm a Jew--a REAL Jew (not an Eastern European Ashkenazi)--a Sephardic Jew who's roots reach to Egypt)--and I see the Ashkenazi Jews involved with ALL sorts of bad behavior. They know that Americans don't know the difference and, they figure once they get themselves expelled from the USA (121 countries in 2000 years) ALL Jews will. Therefore I try to explain the Jewish bad behavior comes from Ashkenazi Jews nearly 100%...I'm just a pilot who look vaguely Arabic who goes to work every day, is not rich, and makes little money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is a racist apartheid state founded by, and kept running through, immense terror. They are running
       <em>
        open-air concentration camps
       </em>
       for god's sake--thinking up things to do to the people who actually OWN the land that even Hitler would call cruel!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's come full-circle...now the Ashkenazi are going to ruin it for everyone as Americans are getting wise about who starts EVERY war (in which American blood is spilled), who charges them $750,000 for a $200,000 house (the rest is usury), and who has utterly ruined the morals, cohesiveness, and cooperation of the US society.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Divide and Conquer" they shout! America MUST be multicultural! Ha...try that in Israel! There is NO "multiculturalism" there as it would ruin their "no Goyim allowed" rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest that you read the Talmud someday soon--even skim it--to see why SO many people want Jews far, far away from their countries and their money supply. If you are NOT Jewish you are a beast who deserves no better treatment than a pig.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: seen with my own eyes in Israel--also spit on, swore at, and ganged up on. The rudest people by far that I have ever met.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Americans only knew--if not for the US there would be NO Israel. Wish someone would remind them of this. This is what your $20 million dollars (usually more) PER DAY buys you, American Taxpayer. All the while they are laughing all the way to their Uncle Morry's bank to deposit your--the American taxpayer's--money.
      </p>
      <p>
       With "friends" like Israel who needs enemies?

       I am half Ashkenazi... I hate myself half the time. Seriously though, the Ashkenazi is a satanic people if we are going to claim deity affiliation. I agree with the "real" Jew in what he says. These people are the elite, blood thirsty, Illuminati/NWO folk that hate Christians. I'm no fan of Islam, but they are nothing compared to these people.

       I haven't been able to verify some of the Talmud quotes that I hear thrown around, which makes me suspicious as to whether the ones thrown around on the Internet are actually true or not.

      <p>
       Then again, the Torah makes it pretty clear what the Jews' mission is - to rule over the rest of humanity. So there's that.

       I went to sleep after I posted this, it was like 4 am over here in the UK!

      <p>
       And yes, I have started doing some research on the Jewish connection to conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stems from that the fact that I cannot help but feel like I'm constantly being reminded, whilst browsing this sub, that the powers that be are Jews.

       Why is that important. Just tell me what they have done wrong.

       I just see this sub painted as racist all the time but there are two things those people usually fail to notice. The first is that the majority of posts are actually about Israel, not jews. And second is that the majority of the posts about Irsael or Jews are posted by a small group of people.

       They obviously think some very high powered people believe in things that they don't and have a massive problem with it. To the point of collective destruction and bias toward it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be curious to know why you choose to pick on relatively innocuous Jew slandering on a more or less fringe sub instead of confronting a much larger and more widely accepted attack on the christian notion in default subs all across the site.

       I do not have problems with Jews; however, I do have problems with Zionists. It is the Zionist who believes in their rights as a superior being ... that the rest of humanity is a sub-human group of beasts to be leveraged.

       The Talmud is their book which contains this vile, hatred-filled dogma. This book and these cancerous views are some of the reasons the entire religion and it's followers have been and are viewed with such distrust and hatred.
