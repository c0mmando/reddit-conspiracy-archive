    <div class="md"><p>So check this out... Last weekend I went to an ayahuasca ceremony. One of the participants was from Israel, literally flew in from Tel Aviv and took a taxi to the ceremony from the airport. Instantly, my alarms went up and I was thinking all kinds of crazy shit. Turns out he&#39;s a cool guy and lives in a town near me. I gave him a ride back, and yeah he knows about the big conspiracy and does not seem happy about it.</p>

<p>So rewind further... A few times, I&#39;ve met local Costa Ricans, hung out, drank beer, smoked weed, etc.. and at some point they will say &quot;You&#39;re a good man.&quot; like that was a big deal to them. Which struck me as weird, but um okay. I&#39;m just a guy, ya know? I don&#39;t own any media giants or bioweapons factories or mega yachts with machine gun turrets...</p>

<p>Now consider this: The US is as big, or bigger an asshole globally, when it comes to countries, than Israel is. And none of us are cool with it. Why would it be any different for most common people from Israel?</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s totally probable for Israel&#39;s government and its &quot;elite&quot; parasitic class to be subhuman vermin, but its average citizens to be just regular people of varying degrees of coolness or shittiness. Just like Americans.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny you mention that, when the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 equates the two in section 3 subsection 10:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Semitism at times has taken the form of the vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/79640.htm">http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/79640.htm</a></p>

<p>Now, this legislation was used to create an agency in the State department to put together an annual report on Anti-Semitism globally. Which includes the vilification of Zionism. So, merely criticizing the government policies can be construed as Anti-Semitism. And boom - you&#39;re on <em>a list</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s like this in every country. Those who disapprove if government actions are silenced, marginalized, ostracized, or ignored.</p>

<p>They would think the same of me (American). Maybe they think I&#39;m pro-drone, pro-interventionism, and approve of our fiscal policy. But I don&#39;t... But how would you know unless we hung out?</p>

<p>At some point we will realize that <em>we vastly outnumber them</em>, but their media monopoly convinces us of the contrary. It&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you bring this up as the flood of anti-Semitic/anti-Jewish/anti-Zionist is my biggest disagreement with r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>I had some conversation with a moderator a couple of months ago and attached a blizzard of these anti posts that went up in this sub in about two hours time in the middle of the night USA, all posted by two usernames.</p>

<p>I live on the US west coast and I&#39;m a night owl, I watch the new queue here. Roundabout 2AM or so - which is mid afternoon in the middle east - the barrage starts. Same posters over and over and over, all the same hate messages, lots of really shabby Youtube links and links from the most unworthy websites you could ever dredge up on the internet, really low quality stuff.</p>

<p>In my PM to the moderator I linked more than 20 posts which had gone up in just an hours&#39; time from just a couple of posters, middle of the night US. Most of Reddit pretty much dies off around 8 PM west coast time.</p>

<p>The most offensive poster was Aushluss66 or whatever his name was. There were a couple more too. And these posters had no history of comments on anything, they just bombard r/conspiracy every night with this billboarding of anti-jewish stuff.</p>

<p>Our current major offender is a poster who shows up about 2AM every fucking night and cranks out the junk. His nic is u/Indra-Varuna. There is another new one as well, Juansomething. I think they&#39;re just new usernames for previously banned assholes.</p>

<p>But they are prolific. They dump a lot of garbage in here Every.Fucking.Day. And the mods don&#39;t seem to care. </p>

<p>Which makes r/conspiracy knee deep in rubbish so that there is so much useless noise in this sub it&#39;s hard to find the quality postings.</p>

<p>And a couple others that I&#39;ve kept my eye on. These people will submit over a dozen links per day, a few per hour. They post content that is interesting to users in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but really the content has nothing to do with conspiracies. Just fucked up shit in the news. I&#39;ve caught <a href="/u/Indra-Varuna">/u/Indra-Varuna</a> posting outright racist shit (speaking against race-mixing). They post so much content that it&#39;s rare for the front page of this sub to not have at least a couple of their submissions. </p>

<p>These guys are either pushing an ideology, or creating an environment in this sub that is just toxic so that it falls apart, or they&#39;re just shills for these blogs so that some MRE retailer can make some more cash. Variations on the number 88 (HH, or Heil Hitler, Neo Nazi shit), show that the user is more than likely a genuine racist, instead of just a shill to make the sub look bad (trying to remember the name of a user with 7777 in his name 4x7 is 28, two 8s, but maybe I&#39;m reaching with that one).</p>

<p>Regardless, this little group (they may be acting individually, but they all follow the same formula) is controlling a lot of content on this sub. Eight people for a sub of 260,000. This sub needs a floodgate. </p>

<p>In case I&#39;m banned for making this comment, I might PM it to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt any of them are shills. The vast majority of the evidence points to Zionist Jewry as primary architects behind the NWO and behind the grand conspiracy of the ages which started with the Hebrew Bible. Israel did 9/11, the biggest conspiracy of our times. They control the US government and the media. So it&#39;s only natural that people will talk about Zionism, Israel, and the Jews, since they appear to be primary culprits in the conspiracy realm. And that is why you have people, not shills, posting here about it: because all roads lead to Jews. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130103231509/http://zioncrimefactory.com/jew-world-order/">http://web.archive.org/web/20130103231509/http://zioncrimefactory.com/jew-world-order/</a></p>

<p>It <em>is</em> possible that it&#39;s not really Zionist Jews who are at the top of the pyramid, but the evidence for that theory has not been very convincing. Perhaps it is intentionally hidden so that we &quot;blame the Jews&quot;, I do not know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Jew--a REAL Jew (not an Eastern European Ashkenazi)--a Sephardic Jew who&#39;s roots reach to Egypt)--and I see the Ashkenazi Jews involved with ALL sorts of bad behavior. They know that Americans don&#39;t know the difference and, they figure once they get themselves expelled from the USA (121 countries in 2000 years) ALL Jews will. Therefore I try to explain the Jewish bad behavior comes from Ashkenazi Jews nearly 100%...I&#39;m just a pilot who look vaguely Arabic who goes to work every day, is not rich, and makes little money.</p>

<p>Israel is a racist apartheid state founded by, and kept running through, immense terror. They are running <em>open-air concentration camps</em> for god&#39;s sake--thinking up things to do to the people who actually OWN the land that even Hitler would call cruel!</p>

<p>It&#39;s come full-circle...now the Ashkenazi are going to ruin it for everyone as Americans are getting wise about who starts EVERY war (in which American blood is spilled), who charges them $750,000 for a $200,000 house (the rest is usury), and who has utterly ruined the morals, cohesiveness, and cooperation of the US society.</p>

<p>&quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; they shout! America MUST be multicultural! Ha...try that in Israel! There is NO &quot;multiculturalism&quot; there as it would ruin their &quot;no Goyim allowed&quot; rule.</p>

<p>I suggest that you read the Talmud someday soon--even skim it--to see why SO many people want Jews far, far away from their countries and their money supply. If you are NOT Jewish you are a beast who deserves no better treatment than a pig.</p>

<p>Source: seen with my own eyes in Israel--also spit on, swore at, and ganged up on. The rudest people by far that I have ever met.</p>

<p>If Americans only knew--if not for the US there would be NO Israel. Wish someone would remind them of this. This is what your $20 million dollars (usually more) PER DAY buys you, American Taxpayer. All the while they are laughing all the way to their Uncle Morry&#39;s bank to deposit your--the American taxpayer&#39;s--money.</p>

<p>With &quot;friends&quot; like Israel who needs enemies?</p>

<p>What the hell, why are you asking me this? Did you not read my post where and most of the other top voted posts in this topic? 99% of the people here do not think there is anything wrong with &quot;the jews&quot;.</p>

<p>The large majority of the anti-semetic stuff posted here is done by a very small group of users.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your problem to figure out mate. I&#39;ve never had that feeling.</p>

<p>EDIT: And to illustrate my point, I took the first post on the new queue about Israel and looked at the user who submitted it. CHeck out his user history, almost everything he submits is about Israel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/jimmyb207/submitted/">http://www.reddit.com/user/jimmyb207/submitted/</a></p>
