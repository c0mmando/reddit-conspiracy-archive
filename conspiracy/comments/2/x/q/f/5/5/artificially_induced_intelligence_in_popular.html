        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are well acquainted with the presence of Silent Sound Spread Spectrum (SSSS - SQUAD) or synthetic/ artificial telepathy technology. For those of you whom are not, don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss the case on this one because you could be getting a lot more then what you bargained for when watching those movies and tv shows of yours.  </p>

<p>Through analyzing and recording human emotions and brain waves patterns with EEG devices, scientists have been able to replicate and record these into sound frequencies that mimic thought patterns, emotions, physical and psychological beings and different states of consciousness. The sound frequencies can be transmitted to induce these these brain states that have been recorded from one human brain into another human being.  </p>

<p>Existence of the technology has been denied by the US government but with little research anyone can find this to not be true, with evidence of experimentation and even U.S patents on the technology dated back to the 90&#39;s.  </p>

<p>The most popular suspected use of the technology is when hundreds of thousands of Iraqi troops surrendered without putting up a fight to US led coalition forces. Most of whom were Experienced Middle Eastern war veterans. There have also been several other cases like these with German and Israeli military forces; known to be technology superior militias.  </p>

<p>Although the technology has mostly military advantages how is it being used on a mass-scale?  </p>

<p>What most people who are riddled with modern day and popular media, tv shows, movies, music, etc. don&#39;t seem to know is that they are being exposed to these types of mind altering sound frequencies constantly. Kids who seem to be getting the worst of it by occupying most of their time with these things. There are many uses for this technology to be implemented by the entrainment industry, addiction being the most prevalent.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of film for a very long time so I have watched everything from classics to the junk that is put out today. I started my research into this when I noticed that most of the recent tv shows and movies had one eerie thing in common that didn&#39;t seem to make much sense. They all seemed to implement a technique of tinnitus in a character or a &quot;high pitched ringing sound&quot;. I didn&#39;t think much of it at first until the annoying ringing scenes of the character being in pain got a little out of hand. I eventually came to find what I have told you here and came to the conclusion that most of these sounds that industry creates and implements are attempts to addict the consumer. Watch another episode, listen to that song just one more time, rent that movie you watched in theaters a week ago and watch it just one more time come on!  They are things that I have done one to many times but no more. I hope to whomever reads this for you to expose this truth and help your family and friends avoid these unhealthy entrainment practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t compiled a list, but one example I can think of at the top of my head would be the pilot episode of the widespread popular tv show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. The scene where Walt is getting tested for cancer in the machine is where the Silent Sound hypnosis begins, the steady sound of the machine overlaps into the scene where Walt is in the doctors office, this is where the key element is placed , the frequency played in this scene induces chemical changes in the brain and nervous system that creates the desired effect of the sound engineers likening. People mistake this as Walt experiencing tinnitus as a result of his ill health but if you notice it happens all through out the series in seemingly random events. Many people have compared watching the show to smoking cigarettes or taking part in notoriously addicting activities. Consumers always come back to get their quick fix. Note that this is first time in the entertainment industry where terms like &quot;binge-watching&quot;  are being used.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that I agree with your conclusions, but there is one thing that we can be certain is true: Anything that <strong>CAN</strong> be used to manipulate/control the minds of the masses <strong>WILL</strong> be used to manipulate/control the minds of the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be on to something, I watched House Of Cards ep. 1 seas. 3
on Netflix today and the use of Tinitis ringing ear post Concussion with  character Doug Stamper happened at the 8min 54sec mark and it lasted aprox 26 seconds. The show had at least 8 more ear ringing scenes. I guess they have to hit you hard on the first episode. Thank you for waking me up, in the past I would have binge watched all the episodes, today I just wrote down the tinitis ring times and when the show was over I had no desire to watch any more. Also on the most recent episode of Better Call Saul there is a scene where an elderly woman is riding a chair lift and it has the same tinitis sound.</p>
