<blockquote>
<p>It’s happening under the leadership of the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS): “The Adult Immunization Plan.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/national_adult_immunization_plan_final.pdf">(See National Adult Immunization Plan National Vaccine Program Office DRAFT: National Vaccine Program Office February 5, 2015</a> and also <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/02/06/2015-02481/solicitation-of-written-comments-on-the-draft-national-adult-immunization-plan">Solicitation of Written Comments on the Draft National Adult Immunization Plan</a> (HHS, 02/06/2015))</p>

<p>The HHS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States">a cabinet agency</a> under the President.</p>

<p>The goal of the Plan? To vastly increase the number of adults in the US who are vaccinated against diseases in accordance with the CDC schedule of vaccines.</p>

<p>Here are key quotes from the Plan:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities includes a measure to increase the percentage of the minority population who receive the seasonal influenza vaccination.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: The government cares about minorities, and to prove it these persons will be injected with a variety of germs and toxic chemicals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Increase the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and immunization information systems (IIS) to collect and track adult immunization data.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: expose confidential patient medical records to many doctors and government agencies, in order to discover all adults who aren’t up to speed on their vaccinations—and therefore must get the shots. Goodbye, privacy. Goodbye, unencumbered free choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Educate and encourage other groups (e.g., community-
and faith-based groups) to promote the importance of adult immunization…A variety of networks can be leveraged, including faith-based and community organizations and individual trusted leaders.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: Step up government-initiated propaganda at all levels of society, in order to convince adults to come forward and receive their injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“All healthcare professionals must ensure that adult patients are fully immunized.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: During every office visit, doctors must check the vaccination status of their adult patients and pressure them to take their injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The Affordable Care Act [Obamacare]…will help make prevention [vaccination] affordable and accessible for all Americans by requiring health plans to cover preventive [vaccination] services…”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: Increased taxes and the rabid printing of new money will ensure that many more Americans are injected with a variety of germs and toxic chemicals.</p>

<p>The Adult Immunization Plan doesn’t specify compulsory mandated vaccination, but it certainly moves in that direction. Tracking, surveillance, propaganda, doctor-applied pressure are its features.</p>

<p>Note the connection of the Adult Vaccination Plan to Obamacare. <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/devastating-truth-about-obamacare/">As I warned several years ago,</a> one of the main features of Obamacare is the step-by-step evolution toward medical slavery.</p>

<p>As with any health insurance plan, there comes a complete list of diseases and disorders that are covered, as well as the permitted treatments for each condition.</p>

<p>Eventually, this list IS what medical diagnosis and treatment consist of—and nothing else.</p>

<p>No choice for patients, no choice for doctors.</p>

<p>Government makes all the decisions.</p>

<p>Universal coverage for both childhood and adult vaccinations is now on the Obamacare list.</p>

<p>Pressure to comply now, forced obedience later.</p>

<p>In military terms, this is a pincer movement. State legislatures are now considering new bills to limit or entirely cut off vaccine-exemptions.</p>

<p>Media are falling in line. “Experts” are virulently supporting mandated vaccines for all, under the banner of “protect the children.”</p>

<p>Public schools are overtly lying, telling parents their children must be fully vaccinated in order to enroll, when in fact the parents can opt out with exemptions that the states still allow.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/dumbed-down-populations-accept-outrageous-vaccine-logic/">Dumbed-down members of the public</a> are responding to all this with: “What? Vaccines aren’t absolutely required for everybody already? I’m shocked. I thought they were.”</p>

<p>The freedom and the right to refuse medication is the last bastion. It must not fall.</p>

<p>Highly publicized lawsuits must be filed by honorable and relentless attorneys now. One basis for such suits is informed consent. By law, all patients must be informed, by their doctors, about the risks associated with any medicine, including vaccines, before such medications are taken. <a href="http://experimentalvaccines.org/vaccine-ingredients/">Vaccine manufacturers’ package inserts spell out some of the major risks and dangers.</a></p>

<p>Consider this: informed consent absolutely implies that the patient can refuse the medication. He has that freedom. Otherwise, “informed” means nothing and “consent” means nothing.</p>

<p>How can informed consent have any practical force if the patient must take the medicine?</p>

<p>That would be like saying, “I’m now going to tell you about the dangers of jumping out of this plane without a parachute. The law compels me to spell out the dangers. But when I’m through, you will jump out of the plane.”</p>

<p>This is a sword an attorney can hold and use.</p>

<p>Of course, the monolithic State will argue that protection of the population outweighs any consideration of individual freedom and informed consent. The State always and forever argues in that fashion, in all cases, in all matters.</p>

<p>That is why it is the State. It seeks, first and foremost, to expand its own power. It spreads like a fungus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument has never involved the efficacy of vaccines but the right to chose which medical procedures that I and my children undergo regardless of religion or cultural background (vaccines are definitely NOT <em>halal</em> or <em>kosher</em>!). It is called INFORMED CONSENT. <em>Informed</em> means that I have the right to ALL of the information about the medical procedure that I am going to subject myself or my children too, good or bad news. And the <em>consent</em> portion is my right to agree to the procedure or to reject it. This is essential to freedom and there is no argument against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I was fully vaccinated as is my child. But I don&#39;t want to force my views on others especially if they have a family history of adverse reactions to the components of vaccines. Besides, if every kid has to be vaccinated for my kid&#39;s vaccines to work, then the vaccines were sold under a false pretense and I spent three years in Africa working for the U.S. govt. (Peace Corps) with a false sense of security.</p>
