        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://theantimedia.org/nation-reacts-chicago-polices-secret-prison-confirms-fears-ndaa/">From The Anti Media:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CHICAGO, IL — Is this the calm before the storm? We are in the midst of an earth shattering revelation about Chicago Police detaining protestors, minorities, and unidentified enemies of the state in a <a href="http://theantimedia.org/chicago-police-secret-detention-center/">secret detention warehouse</a> in the Homan Square area of Chicago. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site">The Guardian has reported</a> that Chicago Police are operating a secret detention facility that mirrors the CIA’s <a href="https://secure.huffingtonpost.com/news/cia-black-sites/">“black sites.”</a> </p>

<p>From violations of due process to torture, the revelations raise serious concerns about the deteriorating state of freedom and justice in the United States.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://theantimedia.org/chicago-police-use-local-news-media-downplay-secret-torture-site/">local media outlets continue to downplay</a> the severity of the facilities, literally repeating the department’s PR talking points.</p>

<p>The most important part about this revelation may be the likelihood of there being several more locations like this all across America where police can secretly detain, disappear, and kill people illegally or legally under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).</p>

<p>This could be the first instance of the NDAA being put to use; the first time authorities exercise their power to detain or kill anyone they want legally. Or maybe we just haven’t heard about this program because it’s been a closely guarded secret for a long time. </p>

<p>There is a possibility that this secret detention center’s practices predate the indefinite detention provisions of the NDAA, which was signed into law on New Years Day in 2012. This would mean the program was operating entirely outside of what is considered to be the law. Not exactly surprising.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this detention without due process power was utilized by the police, and likely still is. These are the very people currently under the collective watch of concerned citizens for <a href="http://theantimedia.org/1000-people-killed-cops-2014-fbi-wont-report-correctly/">killing over a thousand people</a> last year. </p>

<p>This involves minorities being disappeared and possibly killed at Homan Square. A 15 year-old boy was detained without due process in this warehouse. An unknown amount of activists from the Chicago NATO protests were detained and abused, which happened in May 2012 — only a few months after the NDAA’s indefinite detention language was passed. Who knows how many people have passed through the cold doors of this warehouse since or before then.</p>

<p>Protests and movements to inform people of this ‘black site’ are currently being planned all over the US.</p>

<p>“Groups across the country are coordinating a way to strike back against the rogue police department,” <a href="http://thefifthcolumnnews.com/2015/02/war-declared-against-chicago-pd-over-secret-jail/">according to a Fifth Column article.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://thefifthcolumnnews.com/2015/02/war-declared-against-chicago-pd-over-secret-jail/">An Anonymous affiliated activist said</a> “This is the moment when Americans have to decide whether they want to live in a police state or if they are willing to fight back against oppression.”</p>

<p>It feels like a threshold has been crossed, and this topic may become a primary issue of 2015.</p>

<p>If you have been watching the NDAA’s progression over the last few years, you have been anticipating this story for quite a while. Well, it’s finally here. The police can detain and kill anyone they want with no due process, for any reason — and it could all be happening legally.</p>

<p>The fact is, we don’t know how many people were disappeared and/or killed in this warehouse. There is at least one documented case of a person dying there, however paperwork documenting the cause of death seemingly does not exist. We don’t know, and as activists and journalists we need to dig deeper to get to the bottom of this secret facility.</p>

<p>Could there be more facilities like this around the country?</p>

<p>Please share this with as many people as possible. Are we going to stand up and do something — anything about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be absolutely shocked if this doesn&#39;t turn out to be the first in a series of similar revelations. We&#39;ll probably start learning about similar facilities in NY, Seattle, LA, etc., etc. There are no such things as &#39;revelations&#39; in the media anymore. If this made the news, it&#39;s because THEY want it to make the news. They&#39;re slowly, methodically, deliberately conditioning us all to accept the police state. The uptake here is: &quot;Thinking about protesting?&quot; Well, hope you&#39;re prepared to end up in a &#39;black site&#39; prison. They&#39;ve let us know we&#39;re being watched, now they&#39;re letting us know we&#39;ll be punished.</p>

<p>I would. This is the exact response that is expected. Don&#39;t make it like Ferguson. Make it constructive, not destructive. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give in to what TPTB want. Do not call for indiscriminant violence against police and associated buildings. Let&#39;s use this as a lightning rod to demand a transparent investigation to the activities in Homan Square, and to demand appropriate federal legislation banning any further Defense Department equipment and programs that have been militarizing our police since 9/11.</p>

<p>No more of this. Let&#39;s keep focused, and not get swept up in emotions.</p>

<p>You know damn well that there is no such thing.  I know where you are at in your thinking.  You are thinking that if there is some way we can get an open discussion of the facts, then people will see the truth of the matter and resolve this peacefully.</p>

These fake storefronts were set up in 2007 for the film &quot;The Invasion&quot; with Daniel Craig &amp; Nicole Kidman. The fake fronts have never been taking down, at least 3 times a week my phone cuts out when I&#39;m talking across the street, and yesterday I actually head back chatter while on the phone. It&#39;s very disturbing. Granted there are a lot of empty buildings in Baltimore, but this is in prime real estate and 4 blocks east of police headquarters. I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only real answer I see is people quitting their jobs and/or not paying income tax en masse and avoiding other traditional ways of being a &quot;productive&quot; member of society. But since there is no community identity and people can&#39;t keep it in their pants or keep their cards on ice, many will be ready to be scabs because they&#39;re hungry or their kids are or they have debt. </p>

<p>Protesting is cool, trying to get millennials to vote is cool, UBI is cool but none of those are going to be the thing that solves the problem. We need to starve the beast by committing brave acts of self-denial in order to de-base those who live on top of us, but I expect we are too diabetic and fearful to do that in meaningful amounts before it is too late.</p>
