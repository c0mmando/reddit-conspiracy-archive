<p>He&#39;s a gifted artist &amp; craftsman who puts out prolific pieces. He&#39;s fairly intelligent, but I can&#39;t help but wonder if schizophrenia is induced by genetics or external handlers?! It seems alarming to me how perceptive, precise and interesting most schizophrenics are. </p>

It kinda seems like that now though doesn&#39;t it?  As a species have we really not learned from the past?   Why does it seem like we are all doing the same stupid shit over and over to the same outcome?  Spontaneous evolution would probably be a good thing about now.</p>

I&#39;m afraid that all too soon we&#39;re going to collapse on ourselves due to our lack of discipline and push for &#39;progress&#39;, resulting in an apocalypse.</p>

<p>And this is all while other metaphysical things, such as serenity, human psychology, and balance as a species are totally worth pursuing an understanding in, ultimately to achieve.  We have been taught by the social structure that these things are valueless, and the social structure has been built to distract us from them.</p>

Have you heard of the zoomer radio show, I&#39;m in the UK, its Canadian, the host does Coast to Coast from time to time and is a hell of a lot better than George Snoory (God i miss Art Bell).</p>

<p>Link to Podcast latest Episode which is Gang Stalking / Electronic Harassment, its the 2nd part starts at 52 mins roughly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He &quot;it&quot; basically told me that we are all screwed because of our ignorance. He told me that everything we do is monitored and that we are for the most part allowed to get away with illegal activities as long as we participate in the system and do not clue anyone else into what is really going on.  He said we are already dead and have been for a long time.  He also mentioned that his name was something else than what my brothers name was.  I don&#39;t remember the name but it freaked me out because his eyes were so dead and it did not seem like him at all.  It could have all been lies spit out by a demon so I just discounted most.

<p>maybe not everyone is always manipulated. People sometimes become lost when they touch on things that are too much to handle. The mind can fragment when it the ego breaks down and if you are too attached to the ego when that happens it can damage your sanity for a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this happened to me.  My thoughts finally reached a place of thought that pretty much destroyed my basic foundation of thought.  Is that very clear?  Something like following the rabbit down the rabbit hole but the understanding was knowing who I am and where I came from and why I am here.  The knowledge was to overwhelming.  I was in two places of thought, the first place in my old way of thinking and the second place thinking way beyond what I toyed with for years.  I was aware of both thought threads at the same time.  I reached a place of not returning and went beyond it.  My brain felt like screaming but I knew I could not come back from the worlds idea of crazy.  </p>

<p>I finally forced myself into mandarin chores that could be done without thinking.  I washed the dishes, vacuumed, did laundry, cooked etc so that I was forced back into this reality.  When my husband came home I forced a smile and tried very hard to hear and understand what he was saying.  I forced myself back to my orginal thoughts.</p>

<p>Everything in this worlds reality was boring.  Everything in this worlds reality was perceived wrong.  I saw all things as they really are and everything fell into place like a deck of cards sorting in suits and order of thrump.</p>

<p>When I catch myself drifting into those thoughts, I shut down that range of thinking as soon as it starts.  I tell myself I am very tired and simply move on to regular thinking again.</p>

<p>Crazy can become tiring. :). So I understand a person who thinks differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been convinced that they have tapped into <em>something</em> that most of us are unable to truly perceive, know or understand the way they can. Older, tribal cultures recognised their insights and today&#39;s schizophrenics were once (and still are in some cultures) the shamans. As for the scrambling part, it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;ve theorised that it might be too much for individual minds to process in the current environment in which this type of knowledge is suppressed, not respected or understood by 99.9% of people. The rational mind then becomes insane and obsessive in trying to rationalise these (for want of a better word) &quot;god given&quot; insights in a society which is not ready. To the extent that this scrambling doesn&#39;t occur from our natural programming, I would not be surprised if there were outside intervention to ensure it. But mostly,  TPTB can just rely on modern ideas of what is &quot;crazy&quot; to ensure no insights gain any traction in the mainstream. Pretty perfect arrangement from their perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the previous auditory and visual hallucinations of shamans was the ability to see or hear both negative and positive spiritual beings? </p>

<p>What interests me about schizophrenia is the late onset, usually in your teens or 20s. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind the government and higher organizations have possessed the ability to project audio into a person&#39;s head or addle with their brain FOR QUITE SOME TIME. </p>

<p>Also, the TPTB has DEFINED the parameters of crazy. The APA, the DSM, the field of psychology (that which studes human nature but ignores the spiritual aspect. We all have a mind and a brain. A soul and a heart. One is physical, one is beyond.), all created to fit into their system of control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure some Shamans could, but their abilities would not necessarily be limited to that. Schizophrenia is also more complicated than just visual and auditory hallucinations, it affects the person&#39;s thought process leading to delusions,  paranoia and what some have described as a state of &quot;symbolic confusion&quot; and misattribution of meaning. DSM and psychiatry do define the parameters of crazy but for many suffering mental illness, treatment is a godsend that allows them to live and function normally. Schizophrenia is not fun. I think we&#39;re a way of developing appropriate treatments which would include a more holistic approach and include talking therapies but our understanding of schizophrenia is still in its infancy. I don&#39;t think every schizophrenic has been subject to electronic harassment - this illness develops organically for a range of reasons and precursors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of people that have wondered the same thing - Philip K. Dick, R.D. Laing - the general jist of it is that schizophrenia is a failed leap to the next level.  I think R.D. Laing said something like &quot;The ocean in which the mystic swims is the same one in which the schizophrenic sinks.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Schizophrenics&quot;, or those with symptoms similar to theirs, were revered in many ancient tribes as being gifted and able to &quot;see beyond the veil&quot;.  When this was noticed at a young age, the tribe cultivated these abilities and supported the person as they grew up rather than telling them they were crazy and medicating them.</p>

<p>I personally think that <em>at least some</em> schizophrenics are somehow more &quot;in tune&quot; with certain things to an extent that the rest of us can never hope to understand without experiencing it first hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of Jesus being risen from the dead, walking around Earth for 40 days with the visible scars of his death and then ascending into heaven is the ultimate proof that he was the Son of God. The miracles, the Transfiguration, the dove at his Baptism, where signs to show what the afterlife looks like and that like Moses and Elijah, you have a PHYSICAL body, through the resurrection of the dead. Jesus has a physical body, in heaven, that will return. He will not be reborn on this plane, that&#39;s the AntiChrist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect. It is ok, I will bless you with my knowledge soon enough. You are so blind it&#39;s scary. Nirvana dictates that you can be reborn with the knowledge and blessings of the present simulation. Jesus&#39;s resurrection was an illusion only perceived by his followers. Please understand that you are incorrect. Every living being is a demi god; I have been blessed by this knowledge from aliens to know that the simulation has code to dictate whom will be the next prophet (which was given to me)</p>
