<p>Treason: Violation of allegiance toward one&#39;s country or sovereign, especially the betrayal of one&#39;s country by waging war against it or by consciously and purposely acting to aid its enemies.</p>

<p>These guys are allowing a foreign prime minister to have the national spotlight. Everything Netanyahu says is being absorbed by the U.S. corporate media. <strong>Why does it seem like Iran is being silenced here?</strong> Everything I know about Iran tells me that they want peace and to avoid another Iraq. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: &quot;Not just any foreign leader either, one that brags about how easy it is to manipulate the United States into doing what he wants and how he wants to make life unbearable for Palestinians so that they leave their homes for other countries.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I just found a video someone posted on Netanyahu saying that he knows how easily it is to manipulate the United States.</strong> <a href="http://youtu.be/sDORGC7sXng?t=1m">http://youtu.be/sDORGC7sXng?t=1m</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374531501">http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374531501</a></p>

<p>Start there. Its written by the 2 most prominent political theorists of our generation. Waltz and Mearsh have added more to political theory together than all of the other political theorists combined IMO.</p>

<p>These two are not &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; - they are acclaimed professors of political theory. Renowned in every respect. They wrote about the &quot;Israeli Lobby&quot; and its impact on US foreign relations. Its an unprecedented amount of support. I know it sounds weird to say &quot;Zionism owns America&quot; but to someone who is IGNORant (not a jab at you, its just the reality) it sounds strange. When you start reading about Zionism/Israel/Jews and their political impact on American foreign relations, every action you see witnessed on your TV or articles you read make contextual sense. </p>

<p>If you actually want knowledge, and not just facts you can peddle but not backup, then by all means go Google away. If you want a grounded understanding of how Israel buttfucks Americans so openly, start with the book.</p>

There are many many more aspects to &#39;conspiracy thought&#39; that are well worth a read. Israel is just one of many issues people take head on. </p>

<p>And btw, fuck anyone who downvoted you for asking a damn question. Nothing pisses me off more than someone asking a legitimate question. You did not approach it sarcastically or nefariously. Not that karma matters at all in anything ever, but if you were to be downvoted anymore other people would dismiss your post or might not be able to view it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s important to look at both sides of the coin. Is it a coincidence? Are they just really savvy? Are they trying to help? How? Why would we be so involved with such a small country? Look for precedents and correlations with other non-jewish countries like Yugoslavia for example. Why did we go to war with them instead of make them our ally? What happened to spark the war? What were the events leading up to it? Who exactly did we support and why?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that you should question everything no matter what you believe. The world used to be flat until people questioned their own beliefs. Once you&#39;ve questioned all the details, you won&#39;t be able to draw a conclusion because it will draw itself.</p>

<p>I made a promise to myself that I&#39;ll no longer debate racy subjects with anyone that&#39;s not messaging privately or standing in front of me due to the relentless attacking not on the debated subject, but rather my character. When I see these comment patterns, they&#39;re always the same, I know I&#39;ve stated something true that others want buried into the ground and never spoken of again. I don&#39;t do much with what I&#39;ve learned as I believe knowledge is it&#39;s own reward. I&#39;d love to know without a doubt the answers to questions that plague us just to know the truth, no matter if it supports my opinion or refutes it. Good luck on your search.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure how or why some of these companies are listed as being &quot;Jewish&quot; beyond the fact that there are some Jews in high positions. They&#39;re really grasping at straws. Its like the article said: Is the founder Jewish? If not is the president Jewish? If not is the vice-president Jewish? If not is the director of marketing Jewish? If not is there someone in the mailroom thats Jewish? And then just worked there way down and found a Jew so that they could call it a Jewish company. </p>

<p>Sony for example is a Japanese company yet its listed as being Jewish? Oh thats because apparently the Michael Schulhof, who runs Sony Corporation of America, and Alan Levine, who runs their picture division, are Jews. Well actually those aren&#39;t quite true either. A quick google search will reveal that <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/foundation-press/press-releases/3126-schulhof-release-foundation">Michael Schulhof was only CEO from 93-95</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/03/business/sony-says-studio-head-has-resigned.html">Alan Levine was CEO from 94-96</a>. So the two year stints of these guys forever made the company Jewish? Do you actually read the crap you post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, when you post really poorly written articles with bad information that implies that because companies have Jews in top level positions that they are going to spread misinformation and push a pro-Zionist agenda you&#39;re going to upset a few people. This is like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion 2.0 and to be fair, your response indicates that you did not (critically) read the article you posted. Second, if you want to talk about rudeness I would say that trying to nullify someone&#39;s opinion by imply they are paid to have it is much ruder than using a few bad words. Not to mention this was after I spent the time to do a little research and you simply responded by laughing, the aforementioned accusation, and posting a video of a horse.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more like the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel all have the same goals.</p>

<p>The US wants to eliminate oil competition in the region because the US has a ton of money invested in Saudi oil.  Saudi is in it for the same reason.  That&#39;s why Iraq and Iran are are targets.</p>

<p>Israel was created and backed to provide easy access into Saudi Arabia if something should threaten those oil interests.  If the region stabilizes, Israel&#39;s existence will not longer be something the US oil industry will care about.  If Saudi Arabia has to compete in the free market, it&#39;ll be the same thing for them.  So Saudi Arabia and Israel want to keep the US involved in the region.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the military industrial complex wants to keep war going anywhere it can.  More guns sold to the US army, the Israelis, and the Saudis.  The Saudis easily throw money at radical groups that they bring up by funding mosques in war torn regions, throwing fuel on the flames of angry orphaned teenagers and young men in the region.</p>

<p>This makes weapons high demand for the Saudis and Israelis, and soon the US (I&#39;m calling it now, next US president will be Republican and will go full scale invasion in Syria or Iraq).</p>

<p>Also AIPEC can pay congress to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Lastly, the regions of Iraq/Iran, Syria, and Egypt have historically been a huge breeding ground for intellectualism and tolerance in the Muslim world.  They are historically very diverse and tolerant populations, that if left to stabilize, would explode into a golden age in the region.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have any of that.  Especially if a stable Democracy was Shi&#39;a.  Even Bush said it.  Democracy will spread.  if Democracy is stabilized in the region, it&#39;ll spread, and take out the Saudi Royal family, and force Israel to be a democracy for everyone, not just European Jews.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t disagree with <em>certain aspects</em> of that.</p>

<p>I’d say it was created for a lot more reasons than that, but I would imagine that what you state here was certainly one significant benefit that came out of it - yes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would not disagree with that.</p>

<p>Not a horrible dot-connection you did here, sir.</p>

<p>Reading the rest of what you stated, I must say that this was a very cogent, level-headed, intelligent summation of the dynamic.  Very well-done, sir.</p>

<p>Not much I can disagree with in what you said.</p>

<p>no, you mongoloid wag the dog believer/lacky/fanatic, it&#39;s because Israel is the 53rd US state and it exists in and controls the middle east - and acts as out outpost in the last part of the world(the arabian peninsula) which is not totally controlled by the western world already culturally / financially / militarily / legally(though that&#39;s in the process of happening and has been for decades since the US first started invading and occupying the nations there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Venezuela is democratic and officially a federal presidential constitutional republic. They had a lot of poor people (70-80%), mostly indigenous, that came under the bus during the conservatives that exploited the country and had ties to foreign countries. So the biggest profits went to foreigners and a few landlords with ties to them. The poor people are now the basis for the leftist party and the country riches are shared more evenly which stabilizes the country. And because they have big oil reserves they are targeted constantly by the Anglo-American empire that uses every occasion to attack the country and portray it in very bad light. I have no doubt they also organize demonstrations with the opposition, finance quite a few of the TV stations in Venezuela and tried several destabilization attempts.</p>

<p>Nicolás Maduro is President since 14 April 2013 with 50.61% in the democratic election. Some conservative clowns do not like it and depict Venezuela as dictatorship, but that is far from the truth. I know how a dictatorship looks like in South America. Most of the time there was a Coup d´Etat and a military dictatorship was installed with a ruthless leader for live that did not held any elections. Martial law was declared, dissident media silenced or prohibited, dissidents were tortured and disappeared, the police did not pay for their pizzas and the population was living in fear. That is what a dictatorship looks like. Think more of Pinochet. You do not find any of this in Venezuela so please do not spread the Yankee propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that Maduro is not becoming a dictator? Venezuela is already a very authoritarian system, but it&#39;s currently in the process of a slow self-coup, of sorts, to cement the power of the chavistas. He has been arresting dozens of opposition party members and even the mayor of Caracas on charges of &quot;conspiracy to overthrow the government&quot;, which simply means trying to win a real election.  Chavez may have been a better leader, and truly liked, but Maduro is not.  He is a wanna-be dictator and he is going to be the downfall of Venezuela.  But no, you anti-american circle-jerkers can&#39;t see that because it goes against the propaganda you consume.<br/>
No one is saying America hasn&#39;t been involved in imperial capitalist policies, especially in S. America, but to assert that our opponents are true democracies, or are somehow noble, is naive.</p>

<p>The things you pointed out have nothing to do with dictatorship. The President did not call off the elections and he did not declared himself leader for life. His actions are within the consitutional perimeters. After last election there was kind of turbulance and there is no reason to doubt that he has evidence that some &quot;opposition&quot; members commited treason and tried to annulate the democratic results they did not like. And the reason I believe him over the US is that the US was also involved last time in the Coup d&#39;Etat attempt plus that PNAC with its presidential advisors declared Venezuela a geopolitical target. I do not trust the ones who are constantly lying and I give the others the benefit of the doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have such a 2D view of the situation. You realize the PNAC crowd is no longer in charge right?  We have real elections here. Power is transferred between different groups, peacefully. Venezuela has been controlled by the same group for decades. And when Maduro is recalled in 2016 and he seizes power by force, I&#39;m sure even then you&#39;ll deny it and say it&#39;s some capitalist plot. He is wildly unpopular. And you think they don&#39;t lie?  All countries lie and distort the truth. It&#39;s politics. Everyone does what&#39;s in their own best interest. You&#39;ve just fallen for the propaganda from other side in your attempts to avoid the American propaganda. Many conspiracists make that mistake, admittedly even myself early on.  I&#39;m not into most of the stuff anymore because a lot doesn&#39;t hold water, but there are certainly some benefits to the point of view. But this anti-American flavor is idiotic. </p>

<p>So you think there is no continuaty in the US? You do not seem to follow the left-right paradigm, the military complex, the revolving doors, military continuity programms, lasting goepolitical strategies and the presidential puppets. Brezeinski is an advisor of Obama and his globalist friends are in charge since decades. There is only the illusion that the next party will change something of significance. Geopolitical strategies are not changed each administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am familiar with all of those things. And yes, overall strategies don&#39;t change because Americas interests don&#39;t change very fast. But the means to achieving those goals do change. There is a dramatic difference between the Bush doctrine and Obama&#39;s approach. And what about Brzezinski?  He is not an advisor to Obama. He was an advisor under Carter. He&#39;s hardly a hawk. He&#39;s opposed to a strike on Iran, was opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as well as being skeptical of the influence the Israel lobby has on the United States foreign policy. And so is Obama. What do you think this Netanyahu political theater is about?  Obama is a much different president than our other recent ones.  That&#39;s an example of a real shift in policy that a president and his administration brings.<br/>
I know the military industrial complex is powerful and influential, but not as much in recent years. I also understand the very real revolving door but that&#39;s a corruption problem that exists in every government around the world. It&#39;s a human-thing. We&#39;re kind of corrupt.  Sure, some presidents are &quot;puppets&quot;, but I don&#39;t think so in the way you see it. I think Bush 43 was heavily influenced by Cheney and the PNAC crew. He was very hands off and acted much more like a figure head. Obama has been vastly different. DOD&#39;s concern with Obama has been his administrations micromanaging of the military and our foreign policy. He is a very hands on president because he has a vision and doesn&#39;t want private forces having all of the reigns. You say nothing changes from administration to administration.  Maybe in your lifetime, as a Clinton or Bush baby, sans the last few years, but that&#39;s not true on the big scale. The last 70 years have seen huge political shifts from admin to admin, left to right. The last 30 have seen a huge shift to the right, even under Clinton, but that very will likely change as the Y-generation comes of age. 
There&#39;s is no concerted effort to control the world by any one group of people. All we have is a huge number of groups and interests trying to steer policy in their own direction. Its to be expected and, honestly, pretty understandable.<br/>

<p>Chavez called them &quot;mundialistas&quot;. Alex says it is the NWO. But it is everything connected to the power structure behind the UN. This includes WTO, WHO, IPCC and all the other international, intergovernmental organizations plus all the non-official international groups that influence geopolitics like the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, the Transatlantic Partnerships, CFR, Rotary Clubs and their helping spiritual groups like Masons, P2, Knights of Malta, the occult, AA, Bohemian Grove, Golden Dawn, Rosicrucians, AMORC and many more. Not every member inside these groups knows the connections, but the more you climb the hirarchy the more you have to accept the idea that the best for this world is a united global body, with one religion, one jurisdiction, one system and absolute power for the ruling class. A lot of public figures inside these groups wrote a few books about globalism and praised it as the only way to go. If you follow the money and who was responsible for forming these groups you will see always the same names connected and you will know it is a system that serves them because they designed it that way and secretely controll it in desguise of democratic pseudo structures. The ones who joined because they believed they joined something good are trapped by the worst system ever imagined where no other options are allowed anymore and the monopoly is sacred.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that Americans aren&#39;t really in the dark about the government&#39;s capacity for such things, but they would LIKE to assume that when their government does do those things, there&#39;s a core of logic behind the actions that the American people are being served in the end. </p>

<p>Only twice have foreign dignitaries addressed a Joint Session of Congress: French Ambassador Andre de Laboulaye (20 May 1934), to mark the centennial of the death of the Marquis de Lafayette, and Cuban Ambassador Guillermo Belt (19 April 1948), to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cuban independence after the Spanish-American War in 1898.</p>

<p>Did he address a Joint Session of Congress? (I can&#39;t easily find the answer to that.)</p>

<p>Is it Constitutional for him to do so? Lets read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/01/25/is-netanyahus-address-to-congress-unconstitutional/">this</a> from The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the logic of the “unconstitutional” position: (a) the power to receive ambassadors and public ministers a foritiori includes the power to receive foreign heads of state when they are here on diplomatic business; (b) this power is lodged by Constitution in the executive, and, explicitly given to the executive, Congress can’t exercise it unless at the invitation of the president.</p>

<p>I guess the equivalent of first lady doesn&#39;t qualify for foreign dignitary, but diplomat does.  I suppose it&#39;s the lack of official position despite her likely having much more clout.</p>

<p>Not so certain. Was listening to AM radio and their painting Republicans as pro Israel. Things got humorous when they had to backtrack on Schumer and his anti Israel leanings. IMO, the more the US aligns with factions in Israel the better. We need more sunshine on Likud craziness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pelosi&#39;s statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The <strong>unbreakable bonds between the United States and Israel</strong> are rooted in our shared values, our common ideals and mutual interests.  Ours is a <strong>deep and abiding friendship that will always</strong> reach beyond party. Americans stand shoulder to shoulder with the Israeli people.  The state of <strong>Israel stands as the greatest political achievement</strong> of the 20th century, and the United States will always have an unshakable commitment to Israel’s security.</p>

<p>“That is why, as one who <strong>values the U.S. – Israel relationship, and loves Israel,</strong> I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister’s speech – saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.</p>

<p>“Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated something we all agree upon: a nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable to both our countries.  We have all said that a bad deal is worse than no deal, and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is the bedrock of our foreign policy and national security.  As President Obama has said consistently, all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear-armed Iran.”</p>

<p>no, you mongoloid wag the dog believer/lacky/fanatic, it&#39;s because Israel is the 53rd US state and it exists in and controls the middle east - and acts as out outpost in the last part of the world(the arabian peninsula) which is not totally controlled by the western world already culturally / financially / militarily / legally(though that&#39;s in the process of happening and has been for decades since the US first started invading and occupying the nations there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more like the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel all have the same goals.</p>

<p>The US wants to eliminate oil competition in the region because the US has a ton of money invested in Saudi oil.  Saudi is in it for the same reason.  That&#39;s why Iraq and Iran are are targets.</p>

<p>Israel was created and backed to provide easy access into Saudi Arabia if something should threaten those oil interests.  If the region stabilizes, Israel&#39;s existence will not longer be something the US oil industry will care about.  If Saudi Arabia has to compete in the free market, it&#39;ll be the same thing for them.  So Saudi Arabia and Israel want to keep the US involved in the region.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the military industrial complex wants to keep war going anywhere it can.  More guns sold to the US army, the Israelis, and the Saudis.  The Saudis easily throw money at radical groups that they bring up by funding mosques in war torn regions, throwing fuel on the flames of angry orphaned teenagers and young men in the region.</p>

<p>This makes weapons high demand for the Saudis and Israelis, and soon the US (I&#39;m calling it now, next US president will be Republican and will go full scale invasion in Syria or Iraq).</p>

<p>Also AIPEC can pay congress to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Lastly, the regions of Iraq/Iran, Syria, and Egypt have historically been a huge breeding ground for intellectualism and tolerance in the Muslim world.  They are historically very diverse and tolerant populations, that if left to stabilize, would explode into a golden age in the region.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have any of that.  Especially if a stable Democracy was Shi&#39;a.  Even Bush said it.  Democracy will spread.  if Democracy is stabilized in the region, it&#39;ll spread, and take out the Saudi Royal family, and force Israel to be a democracy for everyone, not just European Jews.</p>
