       The one problem that literally NOBODY from any side ever brings up is that of
       <a href="http://www.susps.org/images/worldpopgr.gif">
        population growth
       </a>
       . The planet is projected to hit 10 billion people by 2050, and over 14 billion by the end of this century according to the UN, the World Bank and other international bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your thoughts on this? What would your solutions be to this problem? Are there any conspiracy aspects one should know about concerning this issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my view that this will be our ultimate downfall as a species which will lead to conflict on a global scale comparable to The Second World War, but likely worse due to modern weaponry.
      </p>
      <p>
       All thoughts appreciated.

        Edit:
       </strong>
       I would implore anyone who does not think that there is going to be a serious problem with population growth to find the time to watch this lecture:

       overpopulation is a lie. A lie used to excuse massive amounts of death on the planet each year. We have the ability to feed, water and shelter the whole human race several times over on this planet, but we're too busy filling the water with blood and oil to appericate that opition. Globalist really want population control so the numbers are easy to track and contain, not because they give a fuck about mother earth. And the earth can handle anything we throw at her, weither we can or not is a whole nother topic. I'm not saying we shouldn't go greener, more renewable, far from, it's the only logical future. But at the same time, don't let the elitist make you think that keeping your light bulb on an extra hour is the cause of faminie in the congo (or detroit. o.o;)

       The thing is, right now, we don't have the ability to do shit. We are the majority, the 6 billion and a half that are slaves to the system. The minority, the people who have control of the monetary system, they are the ones with full control.
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       are the ones allowing poverty to happen, this is their agenda and plan. They are living in the utopia they helped create and mantain, the rest of us are in the other side of the spectrum in the dystopia... What
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       have to do is wake the fuck up, raise awareness of what is happening, how the world works and what's wrong with it. Billions everyday are passively living their existence slaving away, most of them without a real purpose other than keeping the system alive, just imagine what we all could do focusing on the collective evolution of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said we have all the tools and resources for it, we know it's possible. The first step is spreading the word...

       not true. with advances in robotics we could live the greecian dream of discussion and thought amongst the ppl while the machines did the meaningless labor that too many suffer and die under the yoke of. can't make positive changes until you believe in em, champ, and so to make a better tomorrow, we gotta look for solutions, not problems.

       Well, I'd agree that there is no political will to solve exponential population growth.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        overpopulation is a lie
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The numbers don't lie though, or are you saying that there isn't 7 billion people currently living on this planet and that future projections are wrong? Short of colonizing another planet or creating cities in the ocean, continued population growth will eventually cause living space problems. It already is in poorer parts of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that the elite want the population to continue to grow to unsustainable levels in order to create problems that they then can solve via military means?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I do agree that we have the ability to feed, water and shelter the whole human race. But unfortunately we absolutely won't though and people are not going to stop pro-creating and world consumption rates are going to go through the roof.

       I don't think the numbers of ppl are a lie, infact, it's probably short. But that doesn't matter, cause if we used the planet wisely and justly for all, we could supply 70 billion ppl with life styles equal to that of lower class americans. And it's not like it would take total communism, the rich could still have thier nicer car and larger plot of land. idc 2 be honest, but when someone (like some tele-priets) has a 200 room house and 14 jets while supposively being a public servant...idk, it's all fucked up.

       They want to convience ppl that there are too many ppl so they're more apathetic to the death counts to come. Soon it will be "well, lest it wasn't me!" mentality that's already setting into the world mind set.

       The thing is, I'm in agreement with you that we have the space on earth, and yes it's probably true that we could fit everyone into an area the size of Texas, of course that would be silly, but it speaks volumes about how badly the world is organised on a social, economic and political scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, this is not going to happen and the fact of the matter is is that by 2050 the population is expected to be at roughly 10 billion and by the end of the century over 14 billion. This
       <a href="http://www.susps.org/images/worldpopgr.gif">
        graph
       </a>
       ought to at least slightly concern most people, whatever goes up, must, or will come down. There is an issue with how fast the population is growing, especially since the industrial revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is is that the world population is going to continue to grow, and one day, without the right leaders, it's going to cause serious problems.

       Well, I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm unsure of what your not buying.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 7 billion people on the planet, right? There will be roughly 3 billion more by 2050, and another 4 or more by the end of the century.
      </p>
      <p>
       The population is increasing, and without the political will (i.e. as long as the world remains as corrupt and backwards as it is today, which I suspect it will), population growth is going to be a serious issue. Population goes up, demand for resources goes up, particularly finite resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The population might be sustainable now, but it's not going to stop growing is it?

       Japan is selling more adult nappies then baby nappies. And families are getting smaller. If you and your wife don't replace each other with children, then you are making a net loss contribution to population growth.

       There is no such thing as "overpopulation" except in the minds of those who want to rationalize genocide as a lesser and therefor necessary evil.

       The problem is the distribution of resources.

       Everyone on the planet can fit in the state of Texas alone. Just an example to give you an idea of how bogus overpopulation is. The next step would be how to better utilize our given space, but we don't even use our resources to the best of their ability as is. I agree with anyone who asserts that overpopulation is a lie, especially when figureheads continually perpetrate, embarrassingly attempt to grind this idea into everyone's head.

       The important point to grasp is that the West is not a part of the problem. The populations in Western nations are shrinking, not growing. The problem is a black African problem, an Asian problem, an Hispanic problem. Not a white problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to what to do about it, the West should stop sending free food to the Third World. The more you feed them, the more they will breed. This is not rocket science, this is obvious. Look at  your local cat lady with 101 cats shitting all over her house. Keep feeding them, and they keep breeding. It's the same for Africans.
