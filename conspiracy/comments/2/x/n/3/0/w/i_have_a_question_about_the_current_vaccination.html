        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After reading that Pakistan was arresting parents for not vaccinating their children against polio, it made me think about something I had heard a few years ago. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, I have no idea if it was a video or something I saw on here etc. All I know is that it was talking about how there would be talks about vaccinations in a big way and there would be stories about basically what is going on now, where people aren&#39;t vaccinating their kids or getting vaccinations themselves in the US and it was putting others at danger. There would then be discussion about forced vaccinations on people after a while. </p>

<p>I know it sounds a bit crazy but I know what I heard and I hope someone here can share any ideas they have of where it might be from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The debate should be whether we should be &quot;forced&quot; to vaccinate. The debate should be, are our bodies sovereign and do we have ultimate say in what we put in them. People who are pro-abortion say it&#39;s the females right to choose. Of course it is, we own our bodies. Same with vaccines, we own our bodies. We choose what we do with them. The gov can not force us to do anything within our own sovereign body. This debate is getting so muddied, and you can see why.  Don&#39;t fall into the trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fine lets not talk about how there&#39;s no science to back up claims that vaccines are bad. Let&#39;s not talk about the fact that the paper that kicked it all off was deemed incorrect by multiple sources and the &quot;doctor&quot; who wrote it was not only paid and fasified results and had his medical license revoked. Lets not talk about that. Lets just talk about the freedom of it. If you want the freedom to refuse a vaccine, fine you can get a waiver for your children. However a private company can still require you to be vaccinated to work for them (it is their company it&#39;s their perogative). A doctor in a private practice can still refuse to treat you. I can still refuse to let your children play with mine. This can all happen and not infringe on your freedoms, on your rights. However other people and their children have the right to life and by not being vaccinated you and yours risk that right. You can be damn sure that if you&#39;re the cause of my wife or any of my family&#39;s right to life being taken away because of your dumb ass decision to ignore something we&#39;ve had for a century that I will do everything in my power to ensure that you lose your rights. That&#39;s how it works, you take away someone elses rights you lose yours. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s change focus now, back to the waivers and what not. If you have a religious (or any personal reason) not to be vaccinated. Fine, then suffer for your beliefs. The Amish are among those who don&#39;t get vaccinated based on beliefs so do what they do. Be an isolated community where you and all your non-vaccinated amigos can live in diseased harmony together away from the rest of society. Now everybody wins. You don&#39;t get the vaccines and we don&#39;t get sick from your dumb ass decisions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfectly fine, as long as we have a choice. The issue is gov mandated vaccination. Most, who aren&#39;t vaccinated are homeschooled and/or secluded. Perfect. Get your kids out of that shit. Point being, there should be no mandate. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. I believe in some vaccinations, which have been tested and proven. But I&#39;m not about to get my kids hooked on some flu vaccine that gives them the flu. It&#39;s about choice. You really wanna give that up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that all vaccines in some way give you the disease right? It&#39;s how a vaccine works, you get a weakened form of the virus and your body fights it off like the real thing and now it know how to fight the real thing. As for the flu virus specifically: I get the nasal spray instead of the shot every year (my job requires I get the flu vaccine) which actually uses a live virus instead of the &quot;dead&quot; virus like the shot and the most I&#39;ve ever gotten is a runny nose. I think your flu shot making you sick was either a fluke (it is a rare but possible side effect) or in your head. </p>

<p>As for the issue of mandating vaccines: I am campaining for the mandated vaccine. That&#39;s your choice, you get the vaccine or you go live in an isolated community. I don&#39;t want polio, polio sucks I like using my legs and you know not being dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things like the flu vaccine no you probably don&#39;t need every year unless there&#39;s a huge wave of a new flu virus. However MMR? Fuck yeah that shit&#39;s important. Back when polio was still a threat (no longer thanks to vaccines)? Fuck yeah, like I said I enjoy walking and living. Vaccines help us eliminate diseases that don&#39;t need to be had that kill far more people than they should. Like I said you want the choice fine you get a choice: Get the vaccines, or go live in your little anti-vax hippie commune away from society and if you have to come to town for any reason wear a bio-hazard suit. </p>
