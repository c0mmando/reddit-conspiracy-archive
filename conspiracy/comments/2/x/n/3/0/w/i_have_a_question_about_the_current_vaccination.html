       After reading that Pakistan was arresting parents for not vaccinating their children against polio, it made me think about something I had heard a few years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, I have no idea if it was a video or something I saw on here etc. All I know is that it was talking about how there would be talks about vaccinations in a big way and there would be stories about basically what is going on now, where people aren't vaccinating their kids or getting vaccinations themselves in the US and it was putting others at danger. There would then be discussion about forced vaccinations on people after a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds a bit crazy but I know what I heard and I hope someone here can share any ideas they have of where it might be from.

       The debate should be whether we should be "forced" to vaccinate. The debate should be, are our bodies sovereign and do we have ultimate say in what we put in them. People who are pro-abortion say it's the females right to choose. Of course it is, we own our bodies. Same with vaccines, we own our bodies. We choose what we do with them. The gov can not force us to do anything within our own sovereign body. This debate is getting so muddied, and you can see why.  Don't fall into the trap.

       Fucking hell no, its not a women's right to choose if both parties agreed to have a baby. If she was raped or a one night stand sure. But if we both agreed to have children its both parents joint choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question then becomes if you choose not to vaccinate, why should you be allowed to endanger others with your belief?

       Sovereign body, you have much to learn. I agree, a man does have a right for input, but ultimately, it's their body. I'm not opening this can of worms, we shouldn't. That's the point. We are going to face tough issues in the coming days, but she is sovereign just as you are. Endanger your child from what, exactly? I need to shove needles and drugs in my kids for you to "think" your kids are safe? Please...

       You are endangering others with your beliefs. Show me any scientific literature that is published that backs up vaccinations are bad. Please because I can't find any.

       Sorry bro, you aint carrying that child. Hate to break it to you, she is. That's her body. You do not have equal say. I'm sticking up for each side,which is the right thing to do. It's not about scientific fact (i can provide links), this is where you are mislead, it's about a choice. I'm free to not do it. My god/creator/spaghtetti man in the sky right to do as I wish. You cannot force me or any other to do it. I choose, not you. You are opening a can of worms you cannot defend/nor understand. I pity you...

       Ok fine lets not talk about how there's no science to back up claims that vaccines are bad. Let's not talk about the fact that the paper that kicked it all off was deemed incorrect by multiple sources and the "doctor" who wrote it was not only paid and fasified results and had his medical license revoked. Lets not talk about that. Lets just talk about the freedom of it. If you want the freedom to refuse a vaccine, fine you can get a waiver for your children. However a private company can still require you to be vaccinated to work for them (it is their company it's their perogative). A doctor in a private practice can still refuse to treat you. I can still refuse to let your children play with mine. This can all happen and not infringe on your freedoms, on your rights. However other people and their children have the right to life and by not being vaccinated you and yours risk that right. You can be damn sure that if you're the cause of my wife or any of my family's right to life being taken away because of your dumb ass decision to ignore something we've had for a century that I will do everything in my power to ensure that you lose your rights. That's how it works, you take away someone elses rights you lose yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's change focus now, back to the waivers and what not. If you have a religious (or any personal reason) not to be vaccinated. Fine, then suffer for your beliefs. The Amish are among those who don't get vaccinated based on beliefs so do what they do. Be an isolated community where you and all your non-vaccinated amigos can live in diseased harmony together away from the rest of society. Now everybody wins. You don't get the vaccines and we don't get sick from your dumb ass decisions.

       Perfectly fine, as long as we have a choice. The issue is gov mandated vaccination. Most, who aren't vaccinated are homeschooled and/or secluded. Perfect. Get your kids out of that shit. Point being, there should be no mandate. That's all I'm saying. I believe in some vaccinations, which have been tested and proven. But I'm not about to get my kids hooked on some flu vaccine that gives them the flu. It's about choice. You really wanna give that up?

       You realize that all vaccines in some way give you the disease right? It's how a vaccine works, you get a weakened form of the virus and your body fights it off like the real thing and now it know how to fight the real thing. As for the flu virus specifically: I get the nasal spray instead of the shot every year (my job requires I get the flu vaccine) which actually uses a live virus instead of the "dead" virus like the shot and the most I've ever gotten is a runny nose. I think your flu shot making you sick was either a fluke (it is a rare but possible side effect) or in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the issue of mandating vaccines: I am campaining for the mandated vaccine. That's your choice, you get the vaccine or you go live in an isolated community. I don't want polio, polio sucks I like using my legs and you know not being dead.

       Things like the flu vaccine no you probably don't need every year unless there's a huge wave of a new flu virus. However MMR? Fuck yeah that shit's important. Back when polio was still a threat (no longer thanks to vaccines)? Fuck yeah, like I said I enjoy walking and living. Vaccines help us eliminate diseases that don't need to be had that kill far more people than they should. Like I said you want the choice fine you get a choice: Get the vaccines, or go live in your little anti-vax hippie commune away from society and if you have to come to town for any reason wear a bio-hazard suit.

I understand her thoughts though and I agree. I told you I'm not against it, I'm against mandatory vaccination. Because the science and gov are butt fucking eachother, the science aint there. I'm pro choice.

       Its called an example. Break a complex issue down to something others might understand.

       The example is flawed. You broke the equation down to keys, people aren't keys. Your logic is flawed (we cant be broken down that easy). You may think I'm a troll, but I'm not not. Think, for a second what you are spouting...

       I have already backed up what I've said. Your now trying to derail the issue by claiming I think humans are keys. Every time you type, you just add another level of stupidity. Please I suggest you stop.

       There needs to be a serious backlash against the vaccine industrial complex. Look at all the stunts they  have pulled just in the last 6 months.

       I dont think anyone should trust the vaccine industry ever again about anything they have to say. There should be consequences for deception, and one of those consequences is losing your credibility and reputation.

       CDC whistleblower was testifying using a retracted study. Which means his evidence is no longer valid.

       I think all we can do is counter it with articles about forced sterilizations in U.S. history past and vaccination problems like those in Italy.  Freedom of Choice concepts and past questions about additives in various vaccines.
