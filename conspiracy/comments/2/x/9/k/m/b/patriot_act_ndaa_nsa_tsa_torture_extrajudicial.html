       Trust busting is perhaps the one aspect of its power that the government can actually use to benefit all citizens.

       Eh, IMO it's been that way since that fateful day in November of 1963.

       Some would argue the corporate control of this Union extends back to when the Bull-Moose lost the election of 1912; and with the Aldrich plan coming to fruition under Wilson, I have a tough time arguing that point.

       To that end, it is entirely possible that JFK happened to get lucky and break the cycle, if only for a few short years.

       The death of JFK really was a major turning point though. It was a silent coup d état perpetrated by the very forces that a sitting president warned us about a few decades earlier. No one heeded that warning, &amp; those forces grew into a nasty, black octopus-squid from hell, killed the one person who saw what was happening &amp; could change things, to try steer America back in the right direction. He was assassinated and every since then, slowly but surely we were brought to where we are today, which is 'fucked'.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more good guys with any power are left. It's really fucking sad.
Anyway, I digress..

       Don't ignore that it was the state that was behind the special treatment and regulations that enabled AT&amp;T to become the huge monopoly in the first place.

         Federal Communications Commission
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Legal scholars have pointed to the possibility that federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had been captured by media conglomerates. Peter Schuck of Yale Law School has argued that the FCC is subject to capture by the media industries' leaders and therefore reinforce the operation of corporate cartels in a form of "corporate socialism" that serves to "regressively tax consumers, impoverish small firms, inhibit new entry, stifle innovation, and diminish consumer choice".[40] The FCC selectively granted communications licenses to some radio and television stations in a process that excludes other citizens and little stations from having access to the public.[41]
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael K. Powell, who served on the FCC for eight years and was chairman for four, was appointed president and chief executive officer of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association, a lobby group. As of April 25, 2011, he will be the chief lobbyist and the industry's liaison with Congress, the White House, the FCC and other federal agencies.[42]
       </p>
       <p>
        Meredith Attwell Baker was one of the FCC commissioners who approved a controversial merger between NBC Universal and Comcast. Four months later, she announced her resignation from the FCC to join Comcast's Washington, D.C. lobbying office.[43] Legally, she is prevented from lobbying anyone at the FCC for two years and an agreement made by Comcast with the FCC as a condition of approving the merger will ban her from lobbying any executive branch agency for life.[43] Nonetheless, Craig Aaron, of Free Press, who opposed the merger, complained that "the complete capture of government by industry barely raises any eyebrows" and said public policy would continue to suffer from the "continuously revolving door at the FCC".[43]

       look at tit this way TPTB isn't some monolithic guild of calaminous intent, but various powers looking out for their own selfish interests in the anarchy that exists in the international sphere. To them the internet is no different than the printing press or spoken language, just a tool.

       Who cares what silly name you call them?  At the end of the day, it is individuals who make the decision to betray the rest of us to serve their own interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individuals will need to be reminded about being responsible for the decisions that they make.  From the scientist that chooses to build bombs instead of something constructive, to the policeman who was "just following orders", and even the politicians who will say they were doing this "for national security", they have made these decisions for their own benefit and accountability is not always only for the "little people".

       NN is good because it means less monopoly power, because it allows consumers more choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being against unnessarry regulation is one thing, being against monopoly breakups is another. Once this goes into effect you won't be forced to get your Internet from a single ISP. This benefits everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, in regards to "obamacare for the internet", the FCC doesn't have the power to regulate the actual content that flows through the internet's tubes. Otherwise, porn sites wouldn't exist because the FCC has been censoring it on TV and Radio for a long time. The new ruling makes it much more difficult for an ISP to gouge websites and customers, therefore making information more free. If you seriously think that this particlular ruling will create censorship, then you misunderstand it completely. The FCC does not have the power to regulate the content of individual websites. Even if they did, this particular ruling would make it easier for people to setup and access websites that would otherwise be gouged out of existence by ISPs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, if you think the Internet wasn't somehow regulated by the FCC beforehand you're severely mistaken too. The FCC predates the Internet and has been effectively regulating it for it's entire history especially considering that the original Internet ran on telephone lines, which is also heavily regulated -but not censored- by the FCC.

       Yeah we'll see about that one. If there's one thing the government does well, it's creating monopolies. And I don't see them deviating from their heavily carved-out path.

       because you can choose a different ISP. The end goal here is to force Comcast to lease lines out to smaller companies, as is done with telephone service. And, as I've already mentioned, the Internet is effectively the same as telephone service (from a regulatory standpoint). The new ruling means cheaper service and more options for consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, if you think the FCC did not already have monopoly power over digital communications, you're serverely mistaken. The entire reason your computer can connect from one ISP to another is because of century-old FCC regulations. There was a time when people requried multiple telephone hookups/utility service just to make calls into different teleco areas. This is one of the few situations where the goverment has done something positive for the average person.

       They're not crazy.  It's how we evolved.  For thousands of years the less knowledgeable have been guided by the more knowledgeable.  This new world demands increasing levels of autonomy and "uniqueness"--a desire to carve out individual experiences based on the quasi accessible sum of human knowledge.  A side effect of this has been a basic desire to be curious about and question so many more aspects of human society than the populace had ever really even considered before.

       Thinking is also extraordinarily hard work much like physical labor.  It is a natural inclination to avoid it in favor of a more facile approach to survival, even if this approach is not necessarily superior.

       Hopefully we can read the bill. As it stands right now we can only speculate. Statists will always praise the state and some of us conspiracy folks can be too quick at the draw. If we just took recent history into account it becomes all too easy to get upset when Washington does anything. Can anyone name one regulatory body that exists that doesn't have a infiltration problem? This is what makes me uneasy about the whole thing. How long before regulatory capture takes place? It's not a matter of if but when.

       What the hell are you guys talking about? Did you not learn anything from the Snowden releases? Even without this regulation the ISPs and other corporate interests already gave everything to the government spooks. The only thing that changed was the rate of speed our not private information travels.

       Dooood, I understand where you are coming from, but nobody has seen the 300+ page bill. I'm sure there are other stipulations that could and probably will have a negative effect on you, me, and the all the rest of us! It just sucks that our government is so shady that they pass bills without the public's full knowledge of the law.

       But the act of holding the document isn't an act of deviousness, or evil. This is SOP for such decisions, how it's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been done, and the legal process for almost every Western government/economy. Acts of federal committees will have marked effect on certain areas of the stock market, and if someone sees it beforehand, they could exploit it or the corporations manipulate it in a manner that would influence the vote. I don't know why everyone's acting like they're trying to pull one over on us, because this is exactly how it is supposed to be designed to protect the integrity of the three branches of government and the decision itself.

       If things were 'frozen in time' as they are
       <em>
        right this instant
       </em>
       that would be far better than what TimeWarner/Comcast/AT&amp;T et al have in mind for the future. I mean, they have shareholders.. so it's inevitable that they are going to keep doing things to 'maximize shareholder value', which is WallST for 'squeeze the fuck out of paying customers'.
I certainly fear what this new deal is about too, don't get me wrong. But letting these ISPs do whatever the fuck they want (2-tiered service, suing municipalities going for their own solutions, etc).. that's
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       a bad idea. Really there are no heroes in this situation. Just villains &amp; victims.

       Your tax is all the stupid fees, the throttling is being done against content providers, ie Netflix has to pay more to isps in different areas simply because of the isps demanding it.

       Reform the corporate tax structure (AKA dismantling a tax structure which was intentionally designed to be a breeding ground for oligopolies). Bring back the free market, which died over 100 years ago but nobody really noticed and now think a free market has caused all our problems.

       There was a reason people travelled across the Atlantic to escape the British monarchies, and those reasons are exactly what we are experiencing today. The only problem is we have nowhere to run to now, and the British monarchies (bloodlines) are back in power in the U.S. and the rest of the world for that matter.

       I'm not worried about censorship. I'm worried about the erosion of anonymity. And that erosion will happen with the call to catch pedophiles,  stop terrorists and protect children from onlines bullies. See China's Real-Name registration:

       I guess we were doomed either way right? On one side is the shareholder wetdream of a 2-tiered internet,  squeezing customers dry for crappy embarrassing internet speeds (compared to a whole bunch of Asian &amp; European countries), or a government dictated, regulation-overloaded utility. Seriously, is there another option we could have had? I definitely like what some municipalities have been able to create for themselves (Nashville TN has a great local municipal internet, IIRC).. though some of them aren't great either. I don't know, I guess the golden age of free open internet was doomed either way. Frustrating.

       If our two choices are government regulation and a monopoly via ISPs, then I'll take the former. Everything "out of bounds" is already covered by the NSA. If they want your info they'll get it and if they want to censor stuff they'll do it. If they want to plant pro government supporters in the comments section of every YouTube video, blog, and forum like the Russian and Chinese governments do, then they'll accomplish that as well. Regardless of who in the end controls the internet, the government will get its way. The biggest danger in this case was not the NSA feeling emboldened to do what it has already been doing for two administrations now, but companies denying access and services when it suits them.

       So uhh, they aren't turning over the internet. The internet didn't just become a utility, it just means that it will be
       <em>
        regulated like
       </em>
       a utility. Meaning its not in the free market realm anymore.

       You're just hanging out in the wrong subreddits.  I've checked conspiracy a few times today and everyone seems to be against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I haven't read the bill, obviously, but I'm pretty sure it is really about censorship, which would explain why 'Reddit' is throwing a party; they love that censorship shit.  Just look at all the things that already get censored on reddit.  With great power, comes wanting even greater power...

       Who cares what silly name you call them?  At the end of the day, it is individuals who make the decision to betray the rest of us to serve their own interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individuals will need to be reminded about being responsible for the decisions that they make.  From the scientist that chooses to build bombs instead of something constructive, to the policeman who was "just following orders", and even the politicians who will say they were doing this "for national security", they have made these decisions for their own benefit and accountability is not always only for the "little people".

       How can you say that so certainly without having read a page of the 300+ page document?  That's an educated guess at best on your part.  Having said that, I hope you're right - but time will tell.
