       The official explanation is that two 20-somethings, with no formal expertise in digging tunnels or excavation, simply wanted to build a cave to "hang out" in. No names have been released. No charges will be filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hard to believe that digging a tunnel on private property, and endangering plumbing and electrical resources would not warrant a charge to be filed. Any theories? Obscure info?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I find it more likely that, with Bill C51 giving CSIS more policing powers, it was going to be flaunted as an intelligence success at disrupting potential terrorism before he PanAm games, until a random dog walker discovered it and actually disrupted their staged disruption.

       It's probably true. Statistically speaking we Canadians are far more likely to be injured or killed by a moose than a terrorist.

       I just suggested that it is a common dream and not beyond the realm of disbelief that someone might do such a thing, good idea or not.  Calm down.

       I'm reluctant to offer counter points, but maybe I should.

       1) You're probably not married or have kids.  The garage, unlike tv, isn't a perfect solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) If they realized this, and thought it was a "good" idea to dig then they're also the type to think generators for light is a "good" idea.  Especially if they are frequently drunk.

       However, if you find your question mark to sentence ratio so high, you may want to ask yourself if you're reacting emotionally rather than thinking rationally.

       Wow.  Rationally hey?  Let's break it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rational - according to you
* garage not a perfect solution. (however, digging a tunnel downtown with the intent to stay hidden is???)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They must have figured out that garages suck as "man caves" - and thus the OBVIOUS idea is to actually dig a tunnel no where near your home and provide power because they're going to be drunk and need light when they find their tunnel hidden in the park???   Never mind the gas for generators, never mind the mud and water and smell.  Cold and shitty place to hang out with your pals...... (Still pushing with the "man cave" idea)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I asked if you thought that was a reasonable answer to this situation and your answer is "Never said that."  So why are you suggesting it?  Why think of some supporting arguments for this whole thing if you don't think its likely?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You said rentals for machinery to achieve such goals are very reasonable priced but you're eye rolling me???
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You attempted to justify this thing in every comment like the one above, and you received a couple of upvotes too!  So yeah, some people as well as you think this is totally cool!  Or not, You said you don't really think this is reasonable but you're still tossing out ideas like it IS normal and understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the mixed signals here?  Your ridiculous comments here are as strange as the tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then redirect to me because I'm the one acting on emotions unlike you, who are CLEARLY the "rational" thinking person here, right?

       The point is that people do stupid things and it's not unreasonable to think that they might dig a tunnel for shits and giggles.

       It makes no sense to use the tunnel for terrorism, since its in the middle of a forest.

      <p>
       Also, its not on private property and no plumbing or electrical resources were endangered. What charge should be laid against them?

       If this were really to be used as a staged terrorist plot, why make the hole so many months in advance?

       You really think that the authorities started building an open tunnel in a public area months and months in advance? When there are far more effective ways to accomplish the same goal, without the risk of detection? Putting the tunnel in the middle of the forest makes it very unbelievable that anyone would use it for nefarious purposes, let alone the authorities.

       I don't think that it was going to be used for a terror plot staged by our government, maybe it was, but I also do not buy the MSM story.
A far more likely explanation is a grow up. I love "Man Caves" like the next guy, but an actual cave/tunnel is damp and moldy and not really ideal for a "Man Cave".

       I agree it could be something mundane and nothing close to the theory I outlined above. But it is odd enough that there were no charges laid and no names/company names released, that there has to be something more to the story.

       There could be.But you should know by now that as a Canadian,that the government is only going to tell you what THEY think you should know.It does seem strange that these two guys would pick such a location for their "man cave" but it has been filled in and no one is going to investigate further.
