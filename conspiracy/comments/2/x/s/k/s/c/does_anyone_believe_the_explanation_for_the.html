        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The official explanation is that two 20-somethings, with no formal expertise in digging tunnels or excavation, simply wanted to build a cave to &quot;hang out&quot; in. No names have been released. No charges will be filed.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that digging a tunnel on private property, and endangering plumbing and electrical resources would not warrant a charge to be filed. Any theories? Obscure info?</p>

<p>Personally I find it more likely that, with Bill C51 giving CSIS more policing powers, it was going to be flaunted as an intelligence success at disrupting potential terrorism before he PanAm games, until a random dog walker discovered it and actually disrupted their staged disruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just suggested that it is a common dream and not beyond the realm of disbelief that someone might do such a thing, good idea or not.  Calm down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reluctant to offer counter points, but maybe I should.</p>

<p>1) You&#39;re probably not married or have kids.  The garage, unlike tv, isn&#39;t a perfect solution.</p>

<p>2) If they realized this, and thought it was a &quot;good&quot; idea to dig then they&#39;re also the type to think generators for light is a &quot;good&quot; idea.  Especially if they are frequently drunk.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t see anyone advocating anything.</p>

<p>Never said that.</p>

<p>However, if you find your question mark to sentence ratio so high, you may want to ask yourself if you&#39;re reacting emotionally rather than thinking rationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Rationally hey?  Let&#39;s break it down.</p>

<p>Rational - according to you
* garage not a perfect solution. (however, digging a tunnel downtown with the intent to stay hidden is???)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They must have figured out that garages suck as &quot;man caves&quot; - and thus the OBVIOUS idea is to actually dig a tunnel no where near your home and provide power because they&#39;re going to be drunk and need light when they find their tunnel hidden in the park???   Never mind the gas for generators, never mind the mud and water and smell.  Cold and shitty place to hang out with your pals...... (Still pushing with the &quot;man cave&quot; idea)</p></li>
<li><p>I asked if you thought that was a reasonable answer to this situation and your answer is &quot;Never said that.&quot;  So why are you suggesting it?  Why think of some supporting arguments for this whole thing if you don&#39;t think its likely?</p></li>
<li><p>You said rentals for machinery to achieve such goals are very reasonable priced but you&#39;re eye rolling me???</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You attempted to justify this thing in every comment like the one above, and you received a couple of upvotes too!  So yeah, some people as well as you think this is totally cool!  Or not, You said you don&#39;t really think this is reasonable but you&#39;re still tossing out ideas like it IS normal and understandable.  </p>

<p>Do you see the mixed signals here?  Your ridiculous comments here are as strange as the tunnel.</p>

<p>Then redirect to me because I&#39;m the one acting on emotions unlike you, who are CLEARLY the &quot;rational&quot; thinking person here, right?</p>

<p>Ridiculous.</p>
