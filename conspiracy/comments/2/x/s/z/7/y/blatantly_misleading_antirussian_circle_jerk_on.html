<p>Lol yes, only a matter of time.</p>

<p>The anti-Russian circle jerk on this site since the whole Ukraine thing has really been sickening to me. It really shows the nature of the sheep mentality.</p>

<p>So many teens and young 20&#39;s on this site who will latch onto any &#39;meme&#39; that makes them feel part of the in crowd.</p>

<p>Then you take into account that the software used by intelligence agencies has the ability to monitor/administrate something like 20-30 accounts per live human user and the sheer amount of fuckery becomes exponential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti-Russian campaign is getting a tad ridiculous. At worst, the Russian government is no better (morally/ethically) than western governments like the US. I actually tend to think Putin, has a greater sense of honor than most US political types; that doesn&#39;t make him a &quot;good guy&quot; but gives him a notch up on the ladder in my reckoning.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/23137">best speeches</a> I&#39;ve ever read was made by Putin, he speaks in terms that we seldom hear from western politicians.</p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we needed to do was to carry out a rational reconstruction and adapt it to the new realities in the system of international relations.</p>

<p>But the United States, having declared itself the winner of the Cold War, saw no need for this. Instead of establishing a new balance of power, essential for maintaining order and stability, they took steps that threw the system into sharp and deep imbalance.  </p>

<p>The Cold War ended, but it did not end with the signing of a peace treaty with clear and transparent agreements on respecting existing rules or creating new rules and standards. This created the impression that the so-called ‘victors’ in the Cold War had decided to pressure events and reshape the world to suit their own needs and interests. If the existing system of international relations, international law and the checks and balances in place got in the way of these aims, this system was declared worthless, outdated and in need of immediate demolition.   </p>

<p>Pardon the analogy, but this is the way nouveaux riches behave when they suddenly end up with a great fortune, in this case, in the shape of world leadership and domination. Instead of managing their wealth wisely, for their own benefit too of course, I think they have committed many follies.   </p>

<p>We have entered a period of differing interpretations and deliberate silences in world politics. International law has been forced to retreat over and over by the onslaught of legal nihilism. Objectivity and justice have been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. Arbitrary interpretations and biased assessments have replaced legal norms. At the same time, total control of the global mass media has made it possible when desired to portray white as black and black as white. </p>

<p>In a situation where you had domination by one country and its allies, or its satellites rather, the search for global solutions often turned into an attempt to impose their own universal recipes. This group’s ambitions grew so big that they started presenting the policies they put together in their corridors of power as the view of the entire international community. But this is not the case.</p>

<p>The very notion of ‘national sovereignty’ became a relative value for most countries. In essence, what was being proposed was the formula: the greater the loyalty towards the world’s sole power centre, the greater this or that ruling regime’s legitimacy.</p>

<p>We will have a free discussion afterwards and I will be happy to answer your questions and would also like to use my right to ask you questions. And during the upcoming discussion let someone try to disprove the argument that I just set out.</p>

<p>The measures taken against those who refuse to submit are well-known and have been tried and tested many times. They include use of force, economic and propaganda pressure, meddling in domestic affairs, and appeals to a kind of ‘supra-legal’ legitimacy when they need to justify illegal intervention in this or that conflict or toppling inconvenient regimes. Of late, we have increasing evidence too that outright blackmail has been used with regard to a number of leaders. It is not for nothing that ‘big brother’ is spending billions of dollars on keeping the whole world, including its own closest allies, under surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you follow Putin&#39;s public speeches, interviews, press conferences with some regularity, you will note how consistent and eloquent his positions are, and that a lot of these interviews and press conferences are not the softball nonsense Obama hides behind. He might use a speech-writer but i&#39;m willing to bet that he doesn&#39;t need it.</p>

<p>This is the polar opposite of Obama, which Americans think of as having &#39;oratorical ability&#39;, but when I see the speeches and addresses he gives, makes me cringe. Of course, it is difficult to sound inspiring or convincing when your mental positions are ridden with inconsistencies, outright lies, half-truths, contradictions, - which is probably why Obama really needs and relies on a speech-writer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s your perception, but mine is that Putin is as self deluded, thus the cult of personality. Although, I don&#39;t see all of Putinism as flawed, there is basically no alternative media in Russia, and journalists are basically criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russians in general are for more grounded in the real world than Americans. </p>

<p>This is a broad statement, but one I think is accurate. Putin may be a thug and their news media an official mouth piece, but they know these things; it changes little to nothing in regards to how they view themselves in the world. </p>

<p>The majority of Americans still believe in the lies they have been raised on, and much of those lies are about America&#39;s place and role in the world.</p>

<p>Russians haven&#39;t been indoctrinated with the idea that everything the newspapers say is true, or that every politician is generally working for the betterment of the citizens. Communism kind of blew that trust out of the water. Pragmatism is something most Russians still have by default, a quality that has been in great decline in the West.</p>

<p>We can attribute the Russian difference of perspective to the fairly recent events of the past 30 years. The US has been far more sheltered and entrenched in ideas that now serve to squelch independent thinking. The US is awash with focus on &quot;first world-style&quot; problems, something not prevalent in Russia.</p>
