<p>What the hell is wrong with America? Was it a country destined to be corrupt, or was it corrupted over time? Because right now the saturation of corruption is staggering in the USA.</p>

<p>Is America corrupt because of it&#39;s dirty politicians, or because of it&#39;s population&#39;s increasing apathy / decline of morality ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of those top countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) have homogeneous populations, oil money that runs their economy, a cold climate that nobody gives a shit enough to move to and have largely stepped aside from global politics in the last century. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also going to go ahead and guess that Singapore and Australia are either fudging their numbers somehow or are going to soon be off the list. The UK is at number 14 and we&#39;re just now learning that many of their top government officials are running pedophilia rings, in addition to their rising anti-islamisicism and expanding govt. control of communications. If that&#39;s number 14 then it really isn&#39;t a surprise most societies are corrupt. </p>

<p>As a Brit, I would say that ordinary Americans no more likely to be corrupt than people in many other countries (and probably less), but the US political class is far more corrupt than any other G7 nation (and they are all pretty bad). </p>

<p>There is one huge difference between the US political system and the rest of the developed world - the egregious laws allowing unlimited donations by corporations to individual politicians and political parties. This completely subverts the democratic relationship between politicians and their constituents, and makes politicians completely corrupt.</p>

<p>When elected politicians are corrupt, the judiciary gets corrupted, law enforcement gets corrupted, regulatory bodies stop doing what they are supposed to do. The rot spreads from the head down, like a rotting fish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would refine the statement and say that humans in positions of power and authority are corrupt.  That no matter how government is designed, the power it gives to the few corrupts them and enslaves the rest. I don&#39;t believe that humans are naturally (for the most part) born corrupt, but are shaped by the state of the society they are born into.  Some say there is a &quot;Law of Freedom&quot; that states as the morality of the people in a society declines, the less freedom there is and vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just America is corrupt but the global elite or TPTB. America I believe is just a means for this to pan out. Aldous Huxley says it well in the novel Island &quot;Armaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence—those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you&#39;d collapse. And while you people are overconsuming the rest of the world sinks more and more deeply into chronic disaster &quot;. The level of corruption has been in place for years, and many have tried to warn us of our imminent demise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a natural ebb and flow from societal traits, between  authoritarianism and freedom, corruption and purity (or hiding corruption),  puritanical and debauched.  We got more corrupt because we assumed we were better because of the name of our land, not the sweat of our brow.  Being incorruptible is difficult and takes moral fortitude.  We have worshipped at the altar of self advancement and easy money too long for that to be an acceptable loss for many.  And they can stomach being corrupt in large ways by holding tight to their belief in American (or western) exceptional ism. </p>

Harumph...... but Apache sacred lands that were agreed upon to be preserved are now sold to a foreign mining corp, and the pesky Indians should fuck off of their sacred lands and let profit wipe those stupid sacred lands away with a pollution swipe of &#39;&#39;it&#39;s federal propertry&#39;&#39;.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that many of the leaders were satanic...
We did have some presidents that were good and the country COULD have changed... it just didn&#39;t. People didn&#39;t care or try hard enough. They didn&#39;t fight against the banks. But I&#39;m not sure if it was planned to be a &quot;Luciferian military arm&quot; but it has basically become the big bankers personal army.
Look at an aerial view of the whitehouse/washington D.C.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only frightening because Christianity has been administered to the populace as a sedative. Anything that Christianity doesn&#39;t mandate is classed as counter or evil. Occult knowledge is just hidden knowledge. It&#39;s grossly misunderstood by most and automatically classed as satanic thanks to Christian brainwashing. There&#39;s a high probability that the powers that be have used occult knowledge often for power and nefarious deeds. But it doesn&#39;t have to be used that way.</p>
