       i just dont understand how you can be a billionaire, and not want to immediately fly over to africa and feed as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       or even go to bad areas like detriot and southside chicago and buy lots of buisnesses to provide jobs for all of the unemployed people.

       because they a) don't believe it will make a real diffrence.

       b) don't care.

       You don't make a billion dollars in today's society without atleast a 82% chance of soul loss/satan sell-out. And for every billion you stack, those percents go up, to where only the devil and his kids and truely those blessed by Lord God have any wealth. This age of poverity was predicted, but we have it so good in district 1 (the us), that we can't even feel the pain when a part of our own district collaypses (detroit). It's sickening really. We tax payers gave a fuck ton of money to detroit to stimulate the economy and all those money whores did was hold on to it while turning off the poor man's power. Truely disgusting. Side note, that's why I have respect for Eminem, he refuses to work outside of Detroit in things like movies and what not so that the city can get the funds, and he donates his own cash. That's someone that really loves thier city. But even E sold his soul to get the kinda money required to do that act. He even talks about it, about how he knew selling his soul was worth it for Haley's sake, and after it was too late how he realized what all that really did to him. Good stuff, and thanks for reading all this run on if you did =)

       Although I imagine that a, b, and c are the legitimate reason of
       <em>

       of these billionaires, the fact that I absolutely KNOW that there are at least

       few of those 1,700+ that really
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want to help people, but that don't/can't, makes me think that "d" is a very real situation going on as well.

       Seems very much correct - which is a large part of the reason why I said one isn't

       And this is why if I were a billionaire, I would just go to Africa and Detroit myself and give

       without first siphoning the money through b.s. tax dollars given to a corrupt governmental system.

       The billionaires could single handedly fix housing in certain areas too. Buy properties for cheap, higher a construction company to bring them up to standards, sell at a low price but still make a few thousand on it and watch people come back into the community. Detroit is what I am mostly thinking of but could happen to every major city. They're barely making money and helping each community. They're just greedy fucks looking for the biggest margins/profits.

       I wonder, however, if any billionaire attempting to do something like this wouldn't get undermined and possibly killed before accomplishing the task.

       Think about it.  Let's say you had something like $10B.  That wouldn't even put you in the top

        120 people
       </em>
       on that fucking list, by the way.  Anyway, imagine what you could do with, say, $2-3B of that in Africa or anywhere else in the world that was impoverished.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could completely turn around a country w/$2-3B wisely spent...and you'd still have $7-8 MILLION FUCKING DOLLARS LEFT OVER!  More than you could ever possibly spend in your entire life!

       I have a feeling it's because you're not

       to REALLY help the world and the people in it out the way you could if you wanted to.  If I were a billionaire, I could feed and clothe and help the entire nation of Africa and bring them back to health.

       No dyed in the wool capitalist would want to emancipate third world nations. When I say that i don't mean to imply financial deregulation in a Friedmenesq view of capital, liberation and freedom. That in itself just acts as an other form of tyrannical oppression supporting US hegemony. We don't want them healthy wealthy and wise as they'd be much harder to control and exploit. Broken corrupt governments and fractured socio political structures are great for business! So long as the costs are low trade routes are open the globalists don't give a fuck.

       I wouldn't necessarily disagree with this.  I guess I'm not a capitalist in any sense of the word then, because if I were a billionaire, at least a good portion of my money would go straight to the worst parts of the world to help there.

       I think the main reason is what's required to ever become a billionaire in the first place.  It doesn't happen overnight, it doesn't happen by accident, and it doesn't happen without the "help" of others.  If all of humanity was prospering and working together, there would be no mathematical way for billionaires to exist at all, it's only through inequality that they're able to acquire
       <em>
        that much more
       </em>
       of the pie.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: I highly doubt there are very many billionaires who aren't soulless husks or greedy psychopaths, just by virtue of what they would have to have done to have acquired that wealth in the first place.

       I understand and even agree with the general sentiment stated here, sir.  However, it seems the level of greed that exists on this planet has to be about a lot more than simply wanting more for yourself and less for others because - if one stops and really thinks about it for just one moments - one will realize that you yourself would actually be
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       off in a world where
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       were living in clean abundance and health.  It’s easy if you stop and think about it:  Would you rather have 80% of 20 or 20% of 90?  Right now the world and the civilization can be said to be at 20% efficiency because of the actions of a few who are sequestering 80% of that dismal efficiency.  If EVERYONE really decided to work together as one, however, then everyone’s standard of living would rise dramatically, and those who currently have 16 of those 20 units of wealth (i.e. 80% of it) would suddenly have 18 units of wealth - i.e. even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       than they had before.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a win win situation.  Those who are wealthy now/already would become even more wealthy - maybe not in terms of fictitious fiat currency paper dollars in a cyber bank account, but in terms of REAL material worth and wealth in their lives and their standard of living.  Doing things this way actually BENEFITS the greedy elite more than would otherwise be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I can think like this and come to this realization, then I’m confident that really almost anyone can.  I’m confident that at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       if not many of these super rich types have realized this.  I also feel confident that at least a
       <em>
        few
       </em>
       of them may have even actually
       <em>
        tried
       </em>
       going through with using some of their vast wealth to help others and change things in a manner, perhaps, similar to what I just explained above here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have a sneaking suspicion that their efforts were thwarted somewhere down the line…somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that not one of those who have (presumably) tried this method have come even close to succeeding tells me that there is
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       - some power - beyond simple “human greed” that prevents it from happening.  It reminds me very much of

       Your first paragraph here seems to be saying that if everyone worked together, everyone's piece of the pie would stay the same and it'd only be the size of the pie itself that would grow.  This isn't how I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If humanity worked together going forward and prospered, there are some things that would be required first for this to happen.  Government control would need to be severely curtailed, the central banking cartel would need to be totally overhauled or abolished, the MIC would need to stop waging wars of aggression all around the world for profit, etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these things would lead to the current billionaires
       <em>
        losing
       </em>
       some percentage of the total world's wealth as the rest of us were
       <em>
        gaining
       </em>
       a larger percentage of the total world's wealth.  I mean what if the solution to humanity's problem was to stop using currency at all?  How would that benefit the world's billionaires?  It would in fact directly fuck them because all of their billions and mountains of paper would be entirely worthless and they'd be on an even keel with all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even for a "non-evil" billionaire, I'm sure the prospect of slumming it with the common man is appalling and terrifying, so why would they work towards this goal by helping a large number of people?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think it just seems this way to you or I because we're thinking of it from our own perspective.  How would it benefit the greedy elite to have a world full of self-sufficient people who work together to provide for themselves, don't require government, don't require fiat currency, etc.?  If your goal was control and your means of achieving it was fucking over your fellow man, why would you support anything that would empower them?  It only benefits the greedy elite if they actually have humanity's best interests in mind instead of their own, and I don't think that's the case at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as whether some billionaire has tried to actually help people, I don't know.  I'd need to see something to support that.  Where I'm at now is pretty much, "He wouldn't be a billionaire if he wasn't fine with fucking people over, period."  I don't know that there are any exceptions to that because I haven't seen any.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'd say that if there is such a power, it's coming from the highest levels of the world elite (whoever that ultimately is), and we know they have many different means of blackmail and of getting what they want so it probably would be relatively simple to keep billionaires from getting too cute with their money or charitable causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also, that quote from Wilson is on the one hand horrifying and on the other hand maddening because he couldn't have been more of a shill if he'd tried while in office, he's arguably more responsible for the awful state of this country than any other individual president if you look at what took place while he was in office.  But then, I guess he would know about the accuracy of that quote better than anyone.

       Not necessarily because what it seems would likely happen in a civilization where EVERYONE is living properly/correctly/equally is that (as I said above) although the super wealthy themselves may no longer have a hoard of “fictitious fiat currency paper dollars in a cyber bank account”, the “REAL material worth and wealth in their lives and [in] their standard of living” would likely increase exponentially.  As such, they
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       indeed be more wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kind of like the concept of
       <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/estate-planning-inheritance/estate-planning/trusts">
        trusts
       </a>
       :  You may “technically” not have any money or items that ACTUALLY belongs to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , per se (“It all belongs to the trust.  I’m merely the executor of it.”), but YOU YOURSELF would nonetheless still be living in extravagant wealth if it happens to be a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       trust that you are the executor of and if you handle that trust wisely.  Essentially, in the paradigm I’m speaking of, there could exist a level of equality whereby the very planet itself is looked upon as “the trust” and everyone benefits bountifully from its offerings in a manner far greater than would be the case via the current method of great inequality and draconian monetary policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I apply this benefit for not only the poor, but for the uber wealthy s well.

       I say it would seem this way to anyone if they  stop and think about it logically and cogently for a moment.  As I said before, would you prefer 80% of 20 (equaling 16) or 15% of 150 (equaling 22.5)?  You end up with a greater net profit in the latter scenario.

       What everyone - even the rich - would get in a society valuing health, cleanliness, and equality - a society that puts great emphasis on technological growth and sustainability - would be a civilization vastly cleaner, healthier, and more robust than the cesspool of general filth that currently exists to such great extents that even the uber rich “exclusive” neighborhoods are not exempt from being adversely effected by it.  I understand that many rich people live in opulent surroundings, but trust me.  I live very close to some of the richest mansions in the United States, and RIGHT NEXT to some of them are neighborhoods that can nearly be classified as “section 8 housing”.  They are nowhere near as removed from “the dirty masses” as they think or would like to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       A world full of healthy, intelligent, educated, self-sufficient people would ensure that whatever neighborhood the uber wealthy today happen to live in and whatever air they and their children happen to breath will be cleaner and surrounded by health - not a world that is generally unhealthy, bad for you, and where the water you drink and the aquatic life in it that some people eat is contaminated, etc.

       That’s a good question, but here we get into some even deeper waters because one has to at this point wonder if the goal is “benefitting oneself” or “control”.  If it’s the former, then controlling the masses via draconian measures WOULDN’T actually be the best way to achieve a better life for yourself.  Lifting EVERYBODY up together is by far the better way (what’s stronger, after all? One man who can life 1,000 pounds, or 2,000 only lifting one pound each?).

      <p>
       If the goal is control, however, and one is willing to gain that control at the cost of great sacrifice to one’s very own well-being (which is what the .01% are currently doing), then one does have to wonder

       If the main motivation of the elite is greed, then it would seem they

       want any scenario whereupon they get more wealth and

       indeed better off.  If their main motivation is control, however, then it would seem the fact that they would be willing to have it at the expense of their own further benefit has to be questioned.  One really has to stop and wonder why exactly that would be…and I don’t think mere “greed” or “because they’re just crazy!” is really an adequate answer or explanation.

      <p>
       That then seems to strongly indicate that their actions are actually not about
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       per se, but about something else - some “greater cause” or principle that they are merely a part of and are executing that goes/exists
       <em>
        outside
       </em>
       of mere wealth acquisition.  Why do I say that?  Because it seems indubitably obvious that the acquisition of wealth and control ONLY for the sake of wealth and control alone is actually WORSE for the individuals that strive for those things.  And if somebody like me knows this…then I
       <em>
        KNOW
       </em>
       that the rich elite know this.  I
       <em>
        KNOW
       </em>
       that they understand the extent to which their remaining in the imbalanced status quo as it currently exists is actually WORSE for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, further, strongly indicates that there is
       <em>
        something else
       </em>
       going on and motivating the paradigm of great inequality that exists on this planet other than simple and basic “greed and control” alone.  If my goal is to benefit myself as best as possible, and I discover that this end goal gets WAY more accomplished by living in a group where EVERYBODY is benefited also, then I’ll make sure and work toward THAT type of world and scenario even if I don’t care about the other members of the group.  In other words, if helping you benefits me, then I don’t care whether I like you or not, I’m going to help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I KNOW the elite understand and grasp this concept, so the fact that they continue to actually HURT those not in their ranks and make sure that the great disparity in classes continues indicates that there, again, is most definitely
       <em>
        something else
       </em>
       going on other than just pure “human greed run amok”.

       Where we differ is that I don't see how helping the rest of us would benefit them at all from a power/control standpoint.  I agree that there very likely is some "larger reason" for why this is what they're working towards, but I'm not seeing how helping the rest of us to prosper would make them more powerful or more in control - if you want to control a group of people, I think keeping them distracted, confused, fighting amongst themselves, etc. would be the way to go.

       I guess my question is why do you think the elite would be better off from a control standpoint if they started helping the rest of us bridge the gap between us and them?  Money is a fictional entity, they have as much of that as they'd ever need and all of the resources and material wealth they'd ever need, so why would giving some of that away to us help them control us?

      <p>
       From a power and control standpoint, you have a valid argument.  There is indeed a school of thought, however, wherein which a greater level of control is garnered by actually
       <em>
        helping
       </em>
       those you want to control rather than forcing them into it.  In other words, although there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       some people that are just crazy/socio/psychopathic, etc and that might very well kill their parents and loved ones
       <em>
        regardless
       </em>
       of how they’re treated and raised and helped, one has to wonder:  What would work better? getting someone to work for you by forcing and threatening them to do it and killing them if they don’t? or by helping them, giving them good education and a good standard of living, being fair with them, and treating them nice/well?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem the latter would work better as far as I can see.  It would seem that would allow even better control because there wouldn’t be as much collateral damage that you would constantly have to sweep up after as a result of having an aggressive, imbalance society.  A strict but fair justice system that DOES punish wrong doing across the board regardless who engages in it would, I imagine, help curtail those elements that go rogue, etc, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this, however, is under the assumption that we’re not living in a society wherein a secret cabal of human and/or non-human entities exist that have the specific interest and intent of actually aggressively ruling and enslaving (essentially “farming”) the human masses that they see as (or actually
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       ) far beneath them in evolutionary development.

      <p>
       From a strict control standpoint, it might indeed not be part of the plan.  From a perspective of what would simply be
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       for this elite, what I’m saying would indeed make better sense.  Again, however, from a strict control aspect, what you say is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we’re talking about here, then, REALLY drives the point home that this planet may very well ALREADY have extensive extraterrestrial (or, at the very least, non-terrestrial-human, non-homo sapien sapien) contact running through and controlling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not certain that the power that’s responsible for giving the uber billionaire elite
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       the power and status that they have - i.e. the power responsible for helping them become the uber billionaire elite that they are and helping them forge this civilization into what it is today - is strictly terrestrial homo sapien sapien and
       <em>
        from
       </em>
       this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       From
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       stance and
       <em>

       </em>
       foundation and
       <em>
        this

       <em>
        at the expense
       </em>
       of everyone else - remaining in control to the extent that they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t quite wrap my head around any other reason why this paradigm if inequality would make any real sense, however.  I’m not super certain that human beings alone and by themselves are actually intelligent or advanced enough to have come up with all of
       <em>

       Yes.  Absolutely.  That’s kind of my main, basic counterargument to this entire dynamic.  That’s it right there.  It really makes no sense UNLESS they’re working for/under “somebody else” and/or unless their motivation and the reasoning for their actions is NOT purely about benefitting themselves and taking more and more for themselves at the expense of everyone else.

       I don’t know for sure either, but it really does seem to be logically pointing toward a power and an influence that - in NOT having the best interest of the terrestrial human race in mind - quite possibly ISN’T, therefore, human itself.

       Situations where everyone has a standard of living that is actually BETTER and cleaner and healthier than would ever be the case otherwise.  You’d rather have a private jet, skyscraper, and an island when you yourself are a putrid mess inside and will live a miserable life in the process? or would you rather have a nice house, car, all amenities you need, AND have about as healthy a lifestyle and body as you could hope for?

       I did not mean to imply that it's "either or" only.  However, there actually
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       indeed a major study that was conducted a while back that wondered who in society is the happiest, and who in society is the most depressed/least happy.  And what did the study find?  It found that the worst off, most emotionally and psychologically unstable, most perturbed, and
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       happy types were rich

        WASP
       </a>
       s.  And the happiest?  Poor African American women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go figure.  I guess the point here is that at the end of the day, the dilemma is neither
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       false or hefty, and my point very much still stands.

       You're being far too simple in how you're interpreting this dynamic.  Again, and as I said initially, those who already have those things would be more likely to give them up if they found something that was even
       <em>
        better

       - which the civilization would ultimately be if the technology THAT ALREADY EXISTS were allowed to be let out and flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       This generally assumes the .01% aren't part of a cabal of control who's end game involves control more than "living an improved, ideal life".  If it's the former reasoning, then - as already mentioned in prior posts - the elite maintaining a status quo that actually
       <em>
        hurts
       </em>
       them and keeps them from a better, healthier way of life is okay so long as it keeps the 99% subservient and under control (as is currently the case).

       How do you convince a group of people living on their own private island (of which there are apparently billions) to leave to build a skyscraper for free?  You can't pay them enough to make it worthwhile since they can already afford anything they want, right?

       It's fantasy.  You can't earnestly believe what you are saying: that the worlds richest man will become richer by giving away his money to poor people.  Or that there are 7billion private islands and the means to construct skyscrapers and boats on them without labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all silly.  You don't become more wealthy by giving everyone same amount of wealth as the richest have, so the richest have to lose wealth to approach equality.  That's all there is to it.

       But they DO need to cost labor and/or capital.  This means that if they don't "cost money" there is a problem of slavery (stealing labor) or theft (stealing capital).  Money is a convenient means of exchange that helps direct the use of labor and capital from a grassroots level, not an inherently evil mechanism for control.

       Did you read the rest of my comment?  When I said "prosperous and working together", I meant not dominated by a tiny percentage of people, not corrupt to the core, not polluting the planet, not set up for the few at the expense of the many.  Is that impossible?

       I don't think I said anything about a totalitarian utopia, and I certainly don't "pine" for one.  I'd much prefer governments around the world to be severely curtailed or removed altogether.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Globalisation has moved 700 million people around the world out of poverty. In 1980 there were 1.9 billion people living on £1 a day — now there are 1.2 billion. So we have to acknowledge that’s a good result. The problem that it creates for developed economies is that our workforces are being displaced by cheaper places for production. That requires business and government to work together to provide education for the skills we need in the developed economies for the jobs that are being sent away. It means that successful economies have got to be innovative. I take this right back to capitalism, because capitalism has proved to be the greatest engine for innovation, and that’s what makes the United States so special. It’s another virtuous circle.

       Sometimes I wonder if it might be "wrong" to try to convince anyone of anything, because it's something that can lead readily to manipulation. Maybe in practice it would be better to encourage people to
       <em>
        just think
       </em>
       instead; but that can be less than gratifying because it takes so much time.
