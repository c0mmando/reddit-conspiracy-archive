        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What is the conspiracy that is so far-out that you won&#39;t even talk about it online, because you know you&#39;d be downvoted and laughed at? What conspiracy are you too afraid to talk about?</p>

<p>Also, what conspiracies are you too afraid to even ask about? Ever wanted to know more about something but didn&#39;t want to battle the hive mind? Ask it here!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I&#39;ll start! </p>

<p>I believe that TPTB have &quot;mastered&quot; time-travel. I believe that Germany won WWII on our &quot;original&quot; timeline, or at least the most prominent one (I believe in a multiverse). I believe that TPTB went back and altered our timeline, claimed a victory in WWII, but secretly allowed all of their top officials to escape and live peaceful lives, or come to the US and work.</p>

<p>I believe this was a result of E.T. technology.</p>

<p>I also believe that immortality, or something close to it, has been achieved. I believe that the average human lifespan, on other planets, is 1000 years. I believe that they have basically found out how to reverse aging. I believe this has something to do with &quot;The Ganesh Particle&quot;.</p>

<p>I also believe that this 3D reality is simply a state of consciousness, and that there is no such thing as a &quot;physical&quot; world. I am just energy experiencing myself. Which means that I am talking to myself right now. I believe this to always be the case.</p>

<p>I also believe that this is somehow related to &quot;physical reality&quot; to be nothing more than interfering sound waves moving through. . . . <em>something</em>. I believe that <em>something</em> is somehow related to sacred geometry.</p>

<p>I also believe that, different points in space-time have very specific frequencies and amplitudes. When the sound waves that are traveling through the substrate change their amplitude and frequency (and whatever other attributes it may have), time changes. So space-time would have a set of vibrational coordinates. If you change your vibration, you change your place in space-time.</p>

<p>I believe there are many ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>I believe DMT is somehow a tool invented in my own mind, put in my reality to help me understand how all these things tie together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell, i can even give the offical story ppl that there were planes hijacked by some ppl of saudi decent that rammed planes into 2 buildings that brought 3 down. I can strech my imagination that far. Now why in the hell did Norad fall asleep at the wheel? Why was the CIA running a drill that mimiced the &quot;act of terror&quot; that day down to the second. Like mother fucking clock work convience. What about those ppl that were killed when the offices were hit? Did you know most of them were there for a meeting. A meeting the boss didn&#39;t show up for, because he &quot;moved&quot; it to the hotel across the way. Then went on to tell the press about how it was those damn dirty apes! Then went on to lead the reconstruction in Iraq? That&#39;s not suspicious at all???</p>

<p>9/11 was alot of things, pissed off terrorists that hate our freedom wasn&#39;t one of em, though. It&#39;s obvious to anyone that&#39;s even bothered to look into the subject that a thousand shady moves took place in the shit storm of chaos. They know that the pilots were here on visas and being watched by both FBI and CIA through out thier stay, and all the way to the point we get a pretty nice pic of ol Massad walking into the building. But that&#39;s all, you never see another pic of that guy again, except the one that&#39;s place up from his passport photo that survived a plane crash that the black box couldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>That, is the kinda bullshit the offical story offers. I can let em have thier towers came down however they want to believe it. Deny the beams were tampered with. I think you&#39;re wrong, but fuck it, before we address the physics, let&#39;s look at some of the ppl involved, and the money that changed hands that day, etc, and still tell me it was all on some guys plotting in a cave half the world over. If you&#39;re seriously that naive (not you poster, just a general &quot;you&quot;) then Big Brother&#39;s brainwashing machine known as public education has done it&#39;s number on you. That&#39;s all I can for certain say is true. That&#39;s why I&#39;m a truther =)</p>

<p>Moon landing indeed was a hoax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe we DID reach the moon. However, given the political race with the Soviets, many mistakes, accidents, astronaut casualties were censored to not lose face and keep the public&#39;s interest and morale up. And, Stanley Kubrick did film many flight, landing and spacewalk and moonwalk scenes just in case the real ones weren&#39;t available or had <em>inconvenient</em> details. And that&#39;s the second part of the conspiracy...</p>

<p>I think the USA and Soviet missions discovered that the Moon is not a natural satellite. They saw intelligent activity there, they found evidence of the occupants/builders. They might have been contacted and warned not to explore. Not to return.</p>

<p>Maybe Kennedy or his handlers wanted to expose this, or wanted to push forward with exploration, maybe plunder the resources or artifacts there. Maybe that&#39;s one more reason why he was sacrificed in Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>P564:1, 49:3.4 Life on the worlds of the nonbreathers is radically different from what it is on Urantia (Earth). The nonbreathers do not eat food or drink water as do the Urantia races. The reactions of the nervous system, the heat-regulating mechanism, and the metabolism of these specialized peoples are radically different from such functions of Urantia mortals. Almost every act of living, aside from reproduction, differs, and even the methods of procreation are somewhat different. </p>

<p>And then THIS!:</p>

<p>P564:3, 49:3.6 You would be more than interested in the planetary conduct of this type of mortal because such a race of beings inhabits a sphere in close proximity to Urantia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I would agree with most of that.</p>

<p>There may have been a holocaust, but there was no where near 6 gazillion murdered. 30,000? Sure. That&#39;s enough for a ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Earth is the center of the Universe? I&#39;d have a real difficult time accepting that one. Too many E.T.s and none of them have mentioned that. Many have said that we are not though.</p>

<p>That being said, it is all a matter of perspective, and we could very easily just put ourselves in the center and relate everything else to us.</p>

<p>I do not believe there is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. That is also perspective. But there is paths towards unity, and paths away from unity. Unity = Love = Light = God. </p>

<p>But alas, the paths are many but the truth one. All paths eventually end in unity. So who is to say which path is preferable to another?</p>

<p>No one is going to judge you. That is fear. That is control. You are here on earth to experience life. All that there is to experience. Until you ultimately &quot;find god&quot; and &quot;become one with your creator&quot;. That is, understand that all things are one, and therefore love all things as we love our self.</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m afraid not. Because what&#39;s &quot;no particular rhyme or reason&quot; for me, isn&#39;t the same for you. </p>

<p>What does &quot;common sense&quot; mean? </p>

<p>What about indigenous people making human sacrifices to their gods? Gods you don&#39;t believe in. Is that immoral? To them it isn&#39;t So whose sense is &quot;common&quot; in that scenario?</p>

<p>You see, what <strong>you</strong> believe, you think everyone should believe and you call it &quot;common sense&quot;. But what you believe is all based on what you&#39;ve been taught. Other people have been taught other things, and you aren&#39;t the one who gets to decide who is right.</p>

<p>Do what thou wilt. That shall be the whole of the law.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means.</p>

<p>You are confusing Luciferianism (a theistic worship of The Light Bringer) with LaVayan Satanism, which is atheistic service to self. Not to be confused with Theistic Satanism, which is worshipping the prince of darkness.</p>

<p>Also not to be confused with Thelema, which you erroneously quoted.</p>

<p>Not really though. Religion is a system of control. So it&#39;s not <em>really</em> about service to others.</p>

<p>The holocaust is like the oldest fishing story ever. Every time someone tells the story, the death toll goes up.</p>

<p>And I love all the people with their anecdotal &quot;My grandma died in the holocaust, so that&#39;s proof of 60 gazillion!&quot;</p>

<p>There were swimming pools at auschwitz, kiddo. There were also many many many birth records.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t make much sense to have a swimming pool in a &quot;death camp&quot;, nor does it make sense to allow births.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read Mein Kampf, if you want to know what WWII was really about. </p>

<p>Hint: It wasn&#39;t about &quot;exterminating&quot; anyone (killing a jew isn&#39;t mentioned once in Mein Kampf), it&#39;s just about removing the slime from their country that was trying to enslave the population through usury and financial manipulation.</p>

Hitler was an reject of society and he blamed the jews for his problems, the country did so aswell.
Where are you born exactly? Seems that you&#39;re the one misinformed considering the use of mein kamf as a basis for your argument.</p>

<p>Initially Hitler wanted to ban jews to madagascar but due to some meeting forgot the name the final solution was put in place.
The german army specifically the ss was vile and driven, don&#39;t forget the huge amounts of speed snorted.
Butchering villages, I&#39;d think you never seen all the horrors my friend.  The executions, enjoying the murders as an innocent leisure..
The angel of death never did the things that he did at auschwitz, so yeah I really doubt there are swimming pools for the prisoners there, maybe the officers but  just no.

<p>I have always understood the universe has no such thing as a center as everything is getting further from everything, so the space itself would be expanding. Just like that balloon theory. If it was a torus instead of a balloon, would that affect the center of the universe in any way? Just as with the balloon there would be no center.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get distracted by too much of the New Age stuff regarding this, as that movement was started by the Illuminati in the 60s, for the purpose of a One World Religion. </p>

<p>If you would like to more about this stuff, I recommend listening to people like:</p>

<p>Al Bielek<br/>
Preston Nichols<br/>
Stewart Swerdlow<br/>
Mark Richards  </p>

<p>All of the above have been interviewed by Project Camelot.</p>

<p>You may also want to read The Hidden Hand Dialogue, where he explains that Lucifer is a 6th density entity, as opposed to YHWH who is a 4th density entity.</p>

<p>Although the Lucifer Soul Matrix exists in multiple densities. </p>

<p>That being said, HH claims that Lucifer is <strong>not</strong> reptilian, which I have my doubts about. </p>

<p>It is also very likely that YHWH is Reptilian as well. So expect the HH Dialogue to have a certain amount of disinfo.</p>

<p>So, of course we have free will.</p>

<p>But you are right, there is no such thing as a physical reality. It is only an illusion of this level of consciousness. But it&#39;s not the advanced beings who wrote the &quot;program&quot;, it was the original consciousness. The creator. The source.</p>

<p>I understand what you are saying. Yes. But I would disagree with you.</p>

<p>I believe there is a multiverse, where all possibly things are happening in every possible way. </p>

<p>But yes I agree that thoughts are creative. You form your reality as you think it. Our collective conscious forms the reality that we agree on. Where we interface. </p>

<p>This is all tied in with holographs and fractals and sacred geometry. </p>

<p>If you search for &quot;Chem Trail Terraforming&quot;, you&#39;ll get a pile of information. </p>

<p>But someone who had experience with actual ExtraTerrestrial Biological Entities, said that they were spraying aluminum and shit into the atmosphere to make it more hospitable for extraterrestrial races.</p>

<p>I assume this was for the reptilians, as they obviously prefer a warmer climate. So all of this &quot;global warming&quot; stuff, is very likely being done on purpose, and then used to distract us. So we argue about shit that we really have no power to change. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>, the chem trail thing may have been on an interview with Project Camelot. You can find that on YouTube. So that might help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely, I have never watched the X-Files. But that is not to say that they couldn&#39;t have used the stories in the show.</p>

<p>Almost always, the government/military/PTB will do a &quot;soft disclosure&quot; and put occult information into movies, TV and music. </p>

<p>This is done for 2 reasons, first is to discredit the source is there&#39;s any leaks. &quot;You got that from the X-Files!&quot;. The second reason being &quot;See, we told you so? We tried to tell you! You didn&#39;t want to listen!&quot;</p>

<p>The movie Stargate is a prime example of this. So is The Matrix.</p>

<p>Also, when authors or movie producers are &quot;read in&quot; so they may be allowed to produce some epic book/movie, the proceeds from the book/movie are used to fund black projects. Like the Secret Space Program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, that&#39;s a good point. I was just wondering the other day what Snowden is really all about. I figure him for CIA. So I wonder if he is ever where he claims to be. I thought maybe he was somewhere in D.C. or something running his PsyOps. But you&#39;re right. He may not exist at all.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t follow him, because I think it&#39;s all a scam. But has anyone ever actually seen him or known him? Someone who isn&#39;t a crisis actor or whatever. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Laura or Glen. Has anyone else claimed to have met him?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s just Glen and Laura, they are prob CIA too, so it&#39;s all a con job.</p>

<p>I should def get on board with him being a hologram. </p>

<p>The only thing that would prevent me from accepting this would be the following:</p>

<p>If they can create a hologram, why not make a presidential candidate?</p>

<p>What&#39;s to say Obama isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>There are people who have been to mars with him, when he was a child. So he used to exist.</p>

<p>But, I would be willing to accept it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently explained this in another post, but since you asked so nicely, I&#39;ll repeat myself.</p>

<p>it has multiple meanings.</p>

<p>First, it is saying that &quot;Religion is the embodiment of evil&quot;, specifically Judeo-Christian religion. Religion is just a tool for control and enslavement.</p>

<p>Second, it means that the character called &quot;YHWH&quot; in the Talmud is most likely the same entity that is also called Lucifer/Satan. Most likely a reptilian. His &quot;positive&quot; attributes and actions are usually attributed to YHWH, while his &quot;negative&quot; ones are attributed to Satan.</p>

<p>There is a quote from the bible, something along the lines of &quot;There is no evil that YHWH didn&#39;t create&quot;. This is one of the hints.</p>

<p>Third, it means that YHWH and Satan are just many other Gods all lumped into 1 (or 2). For instance, many actions of both Enki and Enlil have been attributed to both YHWH and Satan, depending on if it was viewed as positive or negative. The bible is just retelling of older stories, but in the original stories there were many gods. Those gods were then made into one mono-theistic god, and his antithesis. </p>

<p>Much like whats-his-name from Braveheart. The actions of many (or at least a few) have all been attributed to one person, over the ages.   </p>

<p>Same thing happened with YHWH.</p>

<p>What? 3 major religions? You mean the 3 abrahamic religions? Because surely you don&#39;t mean Buddhism, right? Which has neither.</p>

<p>And if you are talking Abraham, then no, you are also wrong. Only Christianity believes that &quot;Jesus&quot; (Jmmanuel, really) was a God, or died for our sins.</p>

<p>And Jews don&#39;t really have a Hell or Devil, from my understanding.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d say you&#39;re pretty far off on all that.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing Satanism with Luciferianism. LaVayan Satanism is atheistic and preaches a service to self in the material world. Theistic Satanism worships the idea of &quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot;, but not believe he was an actual entity.</p>

<p>Luciferianism is the worship of the The Morning Star, which is most likely a Reptilian.</p>

<p>That being said, the uneducated seem to lump it all into &quot;Satanic Cults&quot;. Along with other groups like the Temple of Set and Thelema, OTO, A∴A∴, etc etc.</p>

<p>I am not sure what Sammy Davis Junior was into, but I do know that many of the elites enjoy fucking kids before ritualistically sacrificing them. </p>

<p>Whatever their specific religion is.</p>

<p>It may not be so much that the ones in power are trying to bring around the ends of time, as described in many ancient texts, but it could be that the ancient texts predicted that this would all happen.</p>

<p>Perhaps a self fulfilling prophecy. (I believe that most are)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with the following dualistic, almost Marcionism take on Christianity? It appeals to me</p>

<p>God exists, the Creator God, the Old God, who created humans in his image.  He is a vengeful, petty god, and we are a vengeful, petty creation.  Creator God plagues us with our imperfections, and punishes our bodies to a life on Earth and our souls to eternity in Hell.</p>

<p>Wandering in the infinite Cosmos was the Alien God, the Loving God, who came upon humans and their suffering.  This new Alien God wanted to help us, and struck a deal with our Old God.  He will live and die a tortured human life as Jesus Christ, and preach to us his gospel of love and peace.  A portion of him will exist in Hell, a token of human suffering, in exchange our Alien God can save our souls.  The Alien God, who can only teach us the ways of peace in our Earthly form, can actually save us from eternal damnation and allow our souls to be free with him in the Cosmos.  He is a compassionate God who will always forgive you, and will always be there, even after Death, to save your soul from our Old God and be a companion to mankind&#39;s spirit.</p>

<p>Why would an all powerful creator send himself down to die for sins that he created? The Old God is vengeful, but Jesus was loving. They are separate entities</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation is given in the Front Pages of the Talmud of Jmmanuel as to why &quot;Immanuel&quot; is written starting with a &quot;J&quot; symbol (not the letter J found in the English alphabet, and not the first letter of &quot;Jesus&quot;). It was to honor the Pleiadian/Plejaren ETs who planned his life and mission, as a J-shaped symbol had stood for the i,j,y sounds in an alphabet of their forefathers. Thus it is in no way a harmonization with the name &quot;Jesus.&quot; The &quot;J&quot; symbol substitutes for the &quot;Ayin&quot; in the Hebraic spelling of Immanuel, with &quot;Jmmanuel&quot; being pronounced the same as &quot;Immanuel.&quot; </p>

<p>If you actually research things, you find the answer. Rather than just listening to &quot;debunking&quot; websites.</p>

<p>TMYK!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: You have been told this, more than once, and yet you always try to bring up this argument. There is a professor who spent 20+ years researching the Talmud of Jmmanuel. You think that he didn&#39;t look into the &quot;J&quot; issue on day 1? Don&#39;t you think that any modern day &quot;hoaxer&quot; would know not to use a &quot;J&quot;?</p>

<p>But are you saying that Jmmanuel was the only person ever up to that time who had a &quot;J&quot; in his name?  That the letter was invented when he was named and then disappeared into obscurity for another 1300+ years?  I&#39;m aware that it was pronounced with an &quot;i&quot; sound but the fact remains that the letter didn&#39;t exist anywhere else aside from this alleged historical manuscript.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a little hard for me to take at face value, we have other things written during that time period and none of them use the &quot;j&quot; letter or sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the moon landing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watch Apollo Zero. None of the apollo missions actually went to the moon. That is not to say that we do not have the tech to go there. We do have a base there. But the apollo missions were faked. The tech we had made public was not enough to get us there, and we were not willing to disclose the tech we do have. (From ETs).</p>

<p>Captain Mark Richards explains a lot about what is going on with the Secret Space Program.</p>

<p>It <strong>would</strong> still be funded, even without wars. The Illuminati are the ones who profit from wars, and they are also the ones behind the secret space program, but there is another source of funds.</p>

<p>&quot;Soft Disclosures&quot; in the movies and books. Authors and Producers are &quot;read in&quot; on occult information. People like H.G. Wells and Steven Spielberg. They are given info to produce epic tails and become rich and famous from them, but most of the money actually goes towards funding Black Ops like the Secret Space Program.</p>

<p>Stewart Swerdlow also talks about this, I believe.</p>

<p>Nope, all kinds of natives had thier gods. Infact, the sky God of the Hopi indian and the judeo/christian/islamic mono God are so simliar it&#39;s truely amazing and I hope you take the time to look into it. It&#39;s just more confirmation for someone like myself that there is a creator who does invest His attention on us as humans, and wishes that we know Him.</p>

<p>Also, without tech advances and culture we might be free of the usury banks, but we would also lack the time we have for self and luxury, because you couldn&#39;t specialize in a few skills, you&#39;d have to specialize in survival skills. Art, free thought, hope would all die. It would literally be the dark ages. The dark ages represented what happens when we stagnate as a human species. We are to evolve, to grow.

<p>Nope, all kinds of natives had thier gods. Infact, the sky God of the Hopi indian and the judeo/christian/islamic mono God are so simliar it&#39;s truely amazing and I hope you take the time to look into it. It&#39;s just more confirmation for someone like myself that there is a creator who does invest His attention on us as humans, and wishes that we know Him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they had wasn&#39;t religion.</p>

<p>Religion is all that dogma that you buy into that is used to instill fear in you, in order to control you.</p>

<p>Reptilians brought that idea here, as a form of control.</p>

<p>The same reptilian bloodline wrote the New Testament and renamed Jmmanuel to &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; (which has pagan/occult implications). </p>

<p>You need to let go of your dogma if you wish to be free.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, without tech advances and culture we might be free of the usury banks, but we would also lack the time we have for self and luxury, because you couldn&#39;t specialize in a few skills, you&#39;d have to specialize in survival skills. Art, free thought, hope would all die. It would literally be the dark ages. The dark ages represented what happens when we stagnate as a human species. We are to evolve, to grow. To be more than we were the day before. That&#39;s not accomplished by going to mad max mode. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said anything about technology?</p>

<p>Look at the technology used to build the pyramids. Back before we were limited by speech. We had better technology than we have today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the real origin of the pyramids. 30,000 years ago, or longer.</p>

<p>Even the ancient indian texts speak of flying machines.</p>

<p>So technology can advance (usually with the help of ETs) without people needing to be enslaved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so, for you the words religion and organzied religion are as one. I get that. They surely worked thier backsides off to hijack the faith. </p>

<p>By religion I ment faith and understanding of the creator. a culture that is developed to please Him, so to speak, through rites and what not. And it&#39;s not the works that matter, it&#39;s all just show, because we as humans are limited in expression. But God knows a man&#39;s heart, and knows if that goofy dance was ment to please Him or if it was just a goofy dance. And by dance i mean pretty much 90% of the goofy shit the church of rome/satan does in the name of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lil more complex than such a simple defination, but that&#39;s okay, because I think we&#39;re agreeing for the most part. That&#39;s why I gotta wonder this tanget of things other than humans have spirits. What faith on the planet thinks that only humans have spirits, and if ya say Christanity then I know for certain ya haven&#39;t read the book. Cause there&#39;s no way a lion lays next to a lamb while a child plays with a snake in heaven if all those things didn&#39;t have a similar quality, namely a soul. But an animal soul and human soul are diffrent. Animals do not sin. They simply are what they were intended to be, God&#39;s pleasure. Man however does sin, and so therefore our souls are under a judgement that is specifically reserved for us and the angels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, sorry, I was in the middle of typing a response, and got a phone call, and just hit submit.</p>

<p>I was saying that they believe that not just humans have spirits, and that all of our spirits are connected.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to pay anyone to have their soul saved, and they aren&#39;t shamed into behaving according to someone else&#39;s sense of morals. </p>

<p>I would argue that the &quot;mysticisms&quot; if that&#39;s what you want to call them, of most indigenous peoples, have very little in common with anything resembling modern day religion.</p>

<p>To call the two the same thing is misleading, I would say.</p>

<p>You can tell the difference by looking at them from outside. One group is very clearly under strict control, the other is the polar opposite.</p>

<p>But as a man of science I cant call it a theory as it has too many holes and assumptions and already been disproved by the most basic pf knowledge of the world.

<p>This shows that you have done very little research.</p>

<p>The fact that 1% control the 99% is just the tip of the ice berg. </p>

<p>If you are interested in the truth, you&#39;ll research how and why such a small group came into power. You&#39;ll want to know how they could plan thing 1000s of years in advance.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ll do the research, and find out that it&#39;s not my &quot;imagination&quot;, and it&#39;s &quot;theories&quot;, but actual events as described by many many many many witnesses and whistleblowers.</p>

<p>You may want to start with Graham Hancock, as a way to ease yourself into human history and their coexistence with extraterrestrials. From there you can branch out to things like The Montauk Project.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tip though, if you&#39;re worried about people associating you with &quot;tin foil hats&quot;, you&#39;ll never understand the truth. </p>

<p>That is why people make fun of the truth, to keep it from being exposed. </p>

<p>One should never let what other people think keep them from the truth.</p>

<p>Good luck, kiddo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that this now moment is totally dependent upon the moments that came before - the history before the present. There is only one absolute undisputed fact that human minds can rely on and that is the necessity of history having happened (sequenced) in the manner that it has so that the present is the way that it is. In many ways this historic sequence of events, both on the micro and macro scales, was required; Required History. </p>

<p>We can argue abstract what-ifs, but history is absolute. Even if one were to time travel the necessity for history to have happened in the manner that it did for time travel to be invented and perfected is absolute in order for that person to be able to travel backward/forward into their present history manifestation.  As we are well aware of the fact that the time traveler will be experiencing not the past, but his own present within the past. His present is still directly dependent upon Required History as it actually has sequenced since First Motion of the universe. The true  history of reality that we are only now beginning to chart accurately. </p>

I&#39;m not sure the ritualistic or spiritualistic details, but they prey on the innocent and create deep trauma that propagates well beyond the time and space of their sins.

That and reincarnation, or atleast that we carry a sort of soul through each new body. I have no beliefs in an evil entity but for some reason i cant bring myself to fully believe that there isn&#39;t an evil being pulling strings. I also believe psychedelics are a way of sort of getting to understand this said higher being but dmt may be a way to contact them. I do believe that our souls come from a recycling process and that we go through the different dimensions just to end up in the realm of the living. I also believe in other beings living coherent in this universe with us seeking this said being when they stumble across us aka Roswell but we were too greedy at the time so we took technology instead of understanding. That and also were too primitive to understand this being and it will take the beginning of the psychedelic renaissance for it to actually begin this idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of this. But the &quot;higher being&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily look like us. Nor do I believe that it has ever manifested in physical form.</p>

<p>Well, there are higher beings that created us here on Earth, that do indeed look like us. That is well confirmed. But the Original Creator has no shape or form. That is the original consciousness that became self aware and then began to subdivide to create and experience all things. That is the 8th Dimension/Density. We are the third dimension/density. So there are 5 levels of consciousness between us and the original creator. </p>

<p>There are humans though with higher levels of consciousness</p>

<p>Lizard people control the world.</p>

<p>Well, no. But some &quot;lizard people&quot; as <em>you</em> call them, wield quite a bit of power here on Earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to bash religion but this one is right up there with believing &quot;the Lord works in mysterious ways&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, you&#39;ve come here to tell people what you <em>don&#39;t</em> believe in. I wasn&#39;t aware anyone had asked that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people are evil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There&#39;s really no such thing as &quot;evil&quot;. Maybe you mean people are cruel. That I could agree with. But that is due to a &quot;service to self&quot; rather than a &quot;service to others&quot;. Not good/evil. My good might be your evil, and vice versa. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>not lizards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I am sure lizards are just as capable of being evil as people. I am sure there are some lizards that eat other lizards. What would you say about someone who ate other people? You might call that &quot;evil&quot;.</p>

<p>Makes ya think, eh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes bad shit happens for no reason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Everything happens for a reason. That much is certain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s not &quot;god&#39;s will&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that all depends on what you define &quot;god&quot; as. You see, people like you usually define him as a nosy old man in the sky. And because <em>you</em> have a weak understanding of &quot;God&quot;, you assume others do as well. </p>

<p>If you understand that &quot;God&quot; is nothing but &quot;the original thought&quot;, the original consciousness, the source, Unity, Light, Love, etc etc. then you understand that surely everything <em>is</em> &quot;God&#39;s will&quot;. As that is <em>all</em> there is. </p>

<p>I hope this helped!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <em>You</em> are God. Just so you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re talking about. I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;lizard people&quot; are real. A human eating another human I think would be evil. And yes people are evil, starting wars to profit off of loss of life is evil, thinking otherwise is naive. You cannot prove everything happens for a reason anymore than I can prove it doesnt. What I&#39;m saying is people rush to believe that when something like a school shooting happens for example that it is somehow &quot;gods&quot; will. It&#39;s not, it&#39;s evil people doing evil things. I respect your opinion though, have my upvote.</p>
