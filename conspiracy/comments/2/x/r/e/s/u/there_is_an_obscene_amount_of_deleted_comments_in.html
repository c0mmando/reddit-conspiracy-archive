Check the post timestamps on all of the [deleted], it was around the same time as other treads having massive deletions. I asked if it was the same spammer from the other threads and Axo never replied. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any other explanation than a spammer since the times were so close together and in massive amounts (especially in response to one comment in a few threads) </p>

<p>Yes, exactly. Why go through 50 comments and click &quot;remove&quot; if they&#39;re already invisible? Something clearly does not add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  I don&#39;t know what explains that then, in every case I&#39;ve ever seen in the past of shadowbanned users commenting, their comments are totally invisible.  For instance, you&#39;ll go to a thread and see &quot;2 comments&quot; but only one will be visible, since the other user was shadowbanned.</p>

<p>Only thing I can think of then is maybe the admins shadowbanned this guy <em>after</em> he made all the comments?  I don&#39;t really know - but either way, the salient point is that he was spamming the same meaningless comment over and over, it was most likely a bot.</p>

<p>Thank you for confirming my suspicion. Whoever removed the comments (which you&#39;re lying that you can&#39;t see who it was) probably was trying to confirm the spam filter&#39;s assumptions. </p>

<p>I suspect that numerous confirmed positive blocked &quot;spam&quot; comments would lead to an auto shadowban. Interesting, will have to test the bayesian filter later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of his comments have been approved in that thread.  Literally every single one.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about here at all.

I think at this point you&#39;re just being stubborn because you realize you&#39;ve been proven wrong.</p>

<p>Is your implication actually that that user spammed the thread with 50 meaningless, repetitive comments but then posted two Earth-shattering, world-ending ones that are being censored?  Do you have a reason to think that outside of your own irrational belief?  Did any of the comments of his I approved give you the impression that he was anything other than a troll/spammer/bot?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve wasted so much time explaining all of this to you, it&#39;s clear your mind was made up from the start that some dire knowledge was being hidden in those deleted comments.  Keep thinking that if you want, I&#39;ve said my piece.  Cheers.</p>

<p>No, this isn&#39;t what you said.  You&#39;ve accused me of being a liar multiple times and of being a censor multiple times when I&#39;m neither of those things and haven&#39;t lied to you once.  It&#39;s pretty annoying to be honest, considering how far out of my way I&#39;ve gone to explain the situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lying about not knowing the identity of the remover of randomhuman117&#39;s comments -- and there is no way you can cover that up because we both know the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was shadowbanned and, again, there is no record of either approval or removal in the mod log.  Believe me or don&#39;t, whatever.  Maybe an admin deleted his comments and did something to hide their tracks, that&#39;s really the only way I can think of for it to have not shown up in the mod log if the comments actually were removed or deleted manually (which I&#39;m not really convinced of).</p>

<p>Ah whatever, I&#39;ve wasted enough time on this.  I&#39;ve been up front with you since my first reply and haven&#39;t told a single lie.  Believe me or don&#39;t, I won&#39;t lose sleep over it although I do find it mildly irritating being accused of things I didn&#39;t do by an anonymous stranger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those have never been my claims. I will repeat myself for a third time, these are my claims:</p>

<p>1) You are censoring comments.</p>

<p>2) You have lied about not knowing the identity of the original person who removed the already spammed/shadowbanned comments of <a href="/u/randomhuman117">/u/randomhuman117</a>.</p>

<p>3) A simple spamming of comments to-be-later-removed <em>could</em> be used to mask the removal of valuable comments.</p>

<p>4) Throughout this conversation you have proven yourself to be, in fact, a liar.</p>

<p>5) You have implicated the reddit admins in a conspiracy -- to cover up the fact that you are lying.</p>

I don&#39;t have any evidence at all that this is the case, I was just speculating since I couldn&#39;t think of another explanation.  And I&#39;m not lying nor am I covering anything up.</p>
