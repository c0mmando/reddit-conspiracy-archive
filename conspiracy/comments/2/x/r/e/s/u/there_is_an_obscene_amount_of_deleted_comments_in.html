        Axo's post earlier today
       </a>
       a spammer had its way before being banned and Axo commented about it (ctrl-F for his comment). Check the post timestamps on all of the [deleted], it was around the same time as other treads having massive deletions. I asked if it was the same spammer from the other threads and Axo never replied. I don't think there's any other explanation than a spammer since the times were so close together and in massive amounts (especially in response to one comment in a few threads)

       I'm not sure what you're implying here - shadowbanned comments still show in the count of comments made on a post, they're just invisible.

       Any comment you see that shows as "[deleted]" was removed by the user his or herself, none of those are the ones I'm referring to which are all from the shadowbanned account and are invisible to everyone besides us mods.  I think you're confusing the two.

       I can approve one and link it to you if you actually feel like I'm lying to you for some reason.

       That's a complete fabrication. Anytime you remove a spam-filtered or shadowbanned comment, it appears to the non-mods as [deleted].
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: responding to your edit -- That would be a nice way to cover up a mass removal of comments. Very interesting. Even I have two shadowbanned accounts.

       No it doesn't man, I think you've been misinformed.  Shadowbanned comments are totally invisible.

       Are you saying that in the thread above you see dozens of "[deleted]" comments?

      <p>
       Also, what do you mean "remove a spam-filtered or shadowbanned comment"?  Why would either of those need to be removed?  They're already removed by virtue of the spam filter/shadowban.

       Yes, exactly. Why go through 50 comments and click "remove" if they're already invisible? Something clearly does not add up.

       Really?  I don't know what explains that then, in every case I've ever seen in the past of shadowbanned users commenting, their comments are totally invisible.  For instance, you'll go to a thread and see "2 comments" but only one will be visible, since the other user was shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only thing I can think of then is maybe the admins shadowbanned this guy
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       he made all the comments?  I don't really know - but either way, the salient point is that he was spamming the same meaningless comment over and over, it was most likely a bot.

       They're invisible until you either click "remove" or "approve." It's easy, check the moderationlog and tell us who went through and individually removed the comments. It should say next to every comment who was responsible.

       Why would anyone do that though if they were already removed by the shadowban?  That would be a massive waste of time, there were probably over a hundred comments posted by that user across a few different threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just checked and the mod log has no record at all of any of these comments being removed by any of the mods or admins.

       The two that are removed are troll comments from a different user and I won't be approving them, they're both part of the first comment chain and both essentially say that

       We both know those were the two comments I was previously referring to and there's no way of confirming what happened to them unless you're a mod (your word against x). BrianBrecker's comments never appeared as [deleted], because none of the mods bothered removing his spammed/
       <del>
        shadowbanned
       </del>
       comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for confirming my suspicion. Whoever removed the comments (which you're lying that you can't see who it was) probably was trying to confirm the spam filter's assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that numerous confirmed positive blocked "spam" comments would lead to an auto shadowban. Interesting, will have to test the bayesian filter later.

      <p>
       edit: BrianBrecker's comments were spammed not shadowbanned, since his account is

       All of his comments have been approved in that thread.  Literally every single one.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you just don't know what you're talking about here at all.  The
       <strong>
        only two
       </strong>
       remaining comments that say "[deleted]" were ones removed by whoever posted them, not by randomhuman117, and they
       <strong>
        are not visible to me
       </strong>
       .  I think at this point you're just being stubborn because you realize you've been proven wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your implication actually that that user spammed the thread with 50 meaningless, repetitive comments but then posted two Earth-shattering, world-ending ones that are being censored?  Do you have a reason to think that outside of your own irrational belief?  Did any of the comments of his I approved give you the impression that he was anything other than a troll/spammer/bot?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why I've wasted so much time explaining all of this to you, it's clear your mind was made up from the start that some dire knowledge was being hidden in those deleted comments.  Keep thinking that if you want, I've said my piece.  Cheers.

       I've made no implications other than the fact you are busy censoring comments, that you are lying that you cannot see who removed randomhuman117's comments, and that a simple spamming of comments to be removed
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be used to mask the removal of valuable comments. That is all that I have said.

       I have only accused you of one thing -- lying about not knowing the identity of the remover of randomhuman117's comments -- and there is no way you can cover that up because we both know the truth. It is simply the way reddit works.

       If anyone did, it wasn't in the mod log.  I'm not lying, don't really know what else to tell you.  Why would anyone go through and remove comments that were already shadowbanned?  You saw what garbage comments they were as well, what is it that you think was censored?

       No, this isn't what you said.  You've accused me of being a liar multiple times and of being a censor multiple times when I'm neither of those things and haven't lied to you once.  It's pretty annoying to be honest, considering how far out of my way I've gone to explain the situation.

       He was shadowbanned and, again, there is no record of either approval or removal in the mod log.  Believe me or don't, whatever.  Maybe an admin deleted his comments and did something to hide their tracks, that's really the only way I can think of for it to have not shown up in the mod log if the comments actually were removed or deleted manually (which I'm not really convinced of).

       Are you saying that you think there's some nefarious censorship going on because the mods remove posts and comments that break the rules?  Were you really not aware that comments such as "fucking hook nose kike" get removed?  If not, now you are - congrats on this newfound knowledge, I hope it's beneficial to you going forward.

       I get annoyed when people accuse me of things I haven't done and continue to be stubborn and confrontational even when provided a thorough explanation backed by evidence.  If I was going to ban you it would've happened already, the fact that I haven't should (for a logical mind) suggest that I'm not hiding anything at all from you or anyone else.

       Those have never been my claims. I will repeat myself for a third time, these are my claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You are censoring comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You have lied about not knowing the identity of the original person who removed the already spammed/shadowbanned comments of
       <a href="/u/randomhuman117">
        /u/randomhuman117
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3) A simple spamming of comments to-be-later-removed
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be used to mask the removal of valuable comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Throughout this conversation you have proven yourself to be, in fact, a liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) You have implicated the reddit admins in a conspiracy -- to cover up the fact that you are lying.

       1.)  We remove comments that break our sub's rules.  We always have.  This is not a secret and never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.)  No I haven't and I provided screenshots
       <em>
        proving
       </em>
       that there was no record of anyone removing randomhuman's comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.)  Yes, of course it could.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.)  I haven't lied to you a single time, literally.  What specifically do you think I'm lying about?
      </p>
      <p>
       5.)  I didn't implicate anyone, I suggested that
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       those shadowbanned comments were removed (and I've seen nothing to indicate they were, nor do I see a reason why they would've needed to be if they were already shadowbanned), I don't see any way they wouldn't show up in mod log aside from the admins doing something to hide the actions.  I don't have any evidence at all that this is the case, I was just speculating since I couldn't think of another explanation.  And I'm not lying nor am I covering anything up.

       Like axol told the top commenter in here, some guy just spammed multiple threads with dozens of comments saying things like, "fuck" and "iamilluminatiiamilluminati".
All shitposts, none of them had any substance or information. And he was on a shadowbanned account.

       The two that are removed are troll comments from a different user and I won't be approving them, they're both part of the first comment chain and both essentially say that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
