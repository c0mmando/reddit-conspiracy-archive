    <div class="md"><p>I live in america, actually. But your statement about
&quot;my&quot; leaders is even more valid taking that into consideration.</p>

<p>Also, everyone else gets our money too, we have armed Egypt
to the teeth, for example. It would be great if our asshole politicians
just butted the fuck out of everyone else&#39;s business, but i&#39;m not
really looking for that to happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>So as long as we are arming israel&#39;s neighbors, and countless radical muslim militants,
i don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t keep taking our money. Also, a lot of that money
you see reported Israel being &quot;given&quot;, is earmarked to purchase military technology from them,
not really a &quot;gift&quot;.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>As I said. I mean, yeah the Jews are synonymous with Israel, but SHOULD they be considered synonymous with Israel? I mean, as one other poster stated, I think he said there&#39;s more christians there now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about the jews. Im talking about the fact that in my religion, Israel is like the homeland for everyone and the final place that&#39;ll survive etc etc etc. Im asking, since Israel - the modern nation- is a fucking asshole, how do I reconcile hating a country that Im told to embrace, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here to say something similar. If OP (and many religious people) really knew what the bible and religion says about the Jews, is that the State of Israel goes against their religion. Many Jews explain this way better than I can. But, from being an ex-Catholic, I know that the Jews will/can never have a &quot;state/home land&quot; until their Messiah comes back. Then and only then will their be a State of the Jews.

<p>LOL, and aall of the second. Or are you saying that you hold no opinions and you do not think nor do you suppose? I highly doubt that.</p>

<p>You know, you could just put your personal feelings towards God aside and just say &quot;I believe certain things to be true.&quot;.</p>

<p>That is a human statement that is specifically conveys that while you believe, it is in certain things, which implies that there is a stipulation to the belief.</p>

<p>To rational people, evidence matters. As a rational person I accept that for which evidence exists and decline to consider that for which evidence does not exist / isn&#39;t presented. That&#39;s it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the classic turning it around. In rational discussion, the burden of proof lies upon the individual making the claim. In this case, that&#39;s the claim of the existence of a deity.</p>

<p>If you choose to make that claim, I&#39;m willing to consider the evidence you present with that claim. Please make sure you understand what evidence is, first. Hint: The Bible isn&#39;t it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A member on Christianity has requested I share that I have made [this submission](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/Christianity/comments/2xafj5/man_refuses_to_admit_he_believes_mental/">/r/Christianity/comments/2xafj5/man_refuses_to_admit_he_believes_mental/</a>) for the intent of discussing the topic of words and psychology. They felt I was going behind your back, but rest assured I am in no way doing this with any malicious intent against you, it is merely for discussion of the subject of our exchange.</p>

<p>That all being said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can try to spin it any way you want to fit your own need to believe in shit for which there is no evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe what you want, I&#39;m not spinning anything, besides beats and tops and wheels and other literal things obviously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To rational people, evidence matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, obviously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a rational person I accept that for which evidence exists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As do I, as we all should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and decline to consider that for which evidence does not exist / isn&#39;t presented. That&#39;s it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is illogical, as you are shutting down logical possibilities that could be true. Just because you have not yet been introduced to evidence, does not mean that evidence is not out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the classic turning it around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that is spinning it, saying that requiring you to also present your evidence for your stance as being &quot;turning it around&quot;. I know that game man, just listen to your own words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In rational discussion, the burden of proof lies upon the individual making the claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. God is real. God is the only logical way that the universe exists no matter how you boil it down, because the only thing capable of being greater than all is that which can control all and exist outside of all. God is that power.</p>

<p>Something is greater than nothing, nothing can not create something.</p>

<p>There are scores of logical proofs to prove the existence, and you can feel free to continue to not believe in them, though I advise against that strongly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case, that&#39;s the claim of the existence of a deity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, many of which are easily refuted with ample evidence, but not so in the case of the God of the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you choose to make that claim, I&#39;m willing to consider the evidence you present with that claim. Please make sure you understand what evidence is, first. Hint: The Bible isn&#39;t it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very snide remark. The Bible is evidence, as it is the word of God. Again, you are choosing to believe that it is not the word of God, and apparently do not even consider God because you do not consider the Bible to be evidence nor do you appear to consider the logical proofs.</p>

<p>Come back when you understand what the word &quot;evidence&quot; means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as it is the word of God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prove it. No, you can&#39;t use The  Bible to prove The Bible is the word of your god. That would be like using the novel, Harry Potter, to prove Harry Potter is a real boy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not put &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;God&quot; in the same boat. </p>

<p>Religion was man-made, rewritten, and retold to suit the time and place. A way for people at the top to control the population, (oh you&#39;re afraid of the unknown? Well we know what God wants and we speak through him, so do exactly as we say).</p>

<p>But God, the idea of a universal entity is not the same thing. You can be spiritual without being religious. </p>

<p>In fact just earlier today I saw a great quote by a German physicist somewhere in this subteddit. I think it read something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you&quot;
-Werner Heisenberg </p>

<p>Just because religion is shit, don&#39;t disregard your own personal spiritual journey. </p>

<p>As was every single one of the approximately 2,800 deities humans have invented over the thousands of years we&#39;ve existed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In this case, I would assume that &quot;God&quot; is &quot;can&#39;t figure out how that works yet.&quot; Sort of like earthquakes and thunderstorms used to be. The ever receding &quot;god of the gaps&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Define &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot;.</p>

<p>This is an honest question, but how much seperation is there in a state where service in the armed forces is mandatory? That&#39;s like brainwashing 101 for every citizen.</p>
