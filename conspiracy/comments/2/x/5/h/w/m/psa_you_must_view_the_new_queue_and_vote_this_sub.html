       reddit "weights" the votes made the first few minutes after it's posted, meaning that just a few downvotes within the first 5-10 minutes of a post's life pretty much guarantees that it'll never reach the front page.  A small number of people/accounts upvoting or downvoting specific posts can have a relatively huge effect on the content, which to me is the main problem.

       As for the lack of comments, I simply don't want to be called a shill for having a differing opinion than what the majority believes. I'm just some random hick oil worker from a buttfuck town in Alberta but I do have worldly opinions that sometimes happen to coincide with the lizard people. That doesn't invalidate my point of view as much as they wished it did. There's hardly any debate to be had either. No friendly exchanges. I've had some really heated arguments on reddit and they've ended with a thank you to each other for a civil debate. I'll continue to lurk, upvoting the odd post, but that'll be it. Anything beyond that is just too frustrating.

       Couple that with the data that can be derived by the up and down votes from a user's IP over time and you could learn a great deal about the user. Reddit is an extensive, perpetual poll where the user self-selects which material to offer his opinion on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why someone who spends most of the day, every day, marginalizing the Snowden data would want people to answer as many poll questions as possible, is an interesting confluence.

        Couple that with the data that can be derived by the up and down votes from a user's IP over time and you could learn a great deal about the user.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Can you really? You can not tell unless you analyze the content which is being upvoted or downvoted and actually are capable of obtaining the reason why which vote was cast, which is more or less impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, how are you going to determine that a person voted something down because they did not like the way that the title was worded?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's that, you can't? You would need to have content which actually confirms it like a written comment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hm, it's like comments are far more important than upvotes or downvote, and that those are only secondary as efforts to marginalize comments as people still browse through and view hidden downvoted comments to see what they said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find myself agreeing with quite a few heavily downvoted comments quite often, and it is because those comments are being specifically targeted for the correct information which they retain.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Reddit is an extensive, perpetual poll where the user self-selects which material to offer his opinion on.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The user partially self-selects which material to offer their opinion on, as much of users content is brought to them through other channels wherein they then comment, if they feel like it, which is truly where the self-selection comes in. Do I really feel it is worth it to make a comment, and obviously I do.

      <p>
       An interesting confluence, wow, way to play your hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       False Equivalence, you are falsely asserting that all shills ( which include paid and non-paid government, private, and public sector ) are working for Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who view and analyze the comment data with the intent of controlling how people think, do not have a conflict of interest by employing agents to marginalize people who think freely and wish to make others think freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it also makes sense that they engage in disinformation and propaganda campaigns to keep the people they wish to control under control by "arming" them with rhetorical weapons with which to avoid critical thinking.

        reddit "weights" the votes made the first few minutes after it's posted, meaning that just a few downvotes within the first 5-10 minutes of a post's life pretty much guarantees that it'll never reach the front page.

       That is an incredibly stupid system.  All votes are created equal, with an unalienable right to upvote/downvote memes.
