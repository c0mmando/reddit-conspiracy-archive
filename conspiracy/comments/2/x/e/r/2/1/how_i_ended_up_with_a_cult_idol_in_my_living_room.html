        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">57</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-02-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/GOpencyprep.html">GOpencyprep</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I grew up in a tiny town called Oracle, about 20 miles north of Tucson. About 3 miles outside of Oracle was “The Biosphere 2”. The Biosphere 2 project was essentially to test an entirely sealed off environment for stuff like “closed biomes in space colonization” etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2">Here’s the wiki if you want to learn more about it</a></p>

<p>My dad worked at the Biosphere 2 for most of my childhood (from 1985-2004) – he started as a construction worker before they even broke ground on the project and was employed through its entire construction, and both times they “ran” the project. Later he moved to maintenance and was eventually in charge of maintenance. </p>

<p>I was a kid so, I didn’t pay a lot of attention to it, but I remember overhearing my dad talk to friends and coworkers about how the leadership at the Biosphere were up to some weird shit. <a href="http://imgur.com/iOKmKku">Then one day he came home with this creepy wooden face</a>.  He told me it was their “idol” and hid it. I thought it was creepy and awesome, but didn’t think much more about it. Until I remembered it last thanksgiving and asked if he had it still, he said yep, dug it out of an old storage shed and let me keep it. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So here’s the story as I’ve gotten it from my dad, and supplemented with my own research: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Allen">John P Allen</a> was, according to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/24/science/as-biosphere-is-sealed-its-patron-reflects-on-life.html?scp=1&amp;sq=As%20Biosphere%20Is%20Sealed,%20Its%20Patron%20Reflects%20on%20Life%20&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times Article</a> “born in Oklahoma and raised, as he once put it, &quot;in the lingering traditions of the frontier,&quot; Mr. Allen received a B.S. degree from the Colorado School of Mines and a M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School. After managing a uranium-processing plant, his interests turned unconventional. He traveled across North Africa on foot. He founded an acting troupe, the Theater of All Possibilities. In the 1960&#39;s in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, he directed theater and wrote poetry under the name Johnny Dolphin. He studied the teachings of the mystic G.I. Gurdjieff. He preached the imminence of nuclear Armageddon and held that Western civilization had already collapsed. What was needed was a new civilization, he said, based on a more enlightened relationship among man, machine and nature.” At some point Allen ended up establishing a counterculture group at “Synergia Ranch” 15 miles outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Ed Bass, heir to a Texas oil fortune, had just abandoned his studies at Yale and ‘set out to explore the world’ – and ended up at Synergia Ranch. My dad says that Bass was pretty much indoctrinated by Allen and the “counterculture” group, and essentially talked into bankrolling Biosphere 2. </p>

<p>The NY Times article says “In New Mexico, Mr. Bass became a regular visitor to the Synergia ranch and participated in the group&#39;s drama workshops. He was struck by Mr. Allen&#39;s philosophy and hired Synergia ranch hands to help him build condominiums in central Santa Fe. He became a director of the Institute of Ecotechnics, founded by Mr. Allen and other Synergia veterans to carry out bold ecology projects”
My dad mentioned the <a href="http://ecotechnics.edu/">Institite of Ecotechnics</a> several times. He said, it was basically a bullshit “school” and that it was a way for Allen to vet potential “recruits”, and set up bizarre projects.  And the “bold ecology projects” are things like the RV Heraclitus, essentially their version of Sea Org, but with one vessel - (more on Heraclitus in a minute).</p>

<p>So, essentially, Allen talked/brainwashed Bass into funding a scientific venture which he was to be in charge of, despite having no qualifications for it (his credentials being Colorado School of Mines, Harvard Business School), and then staffed it with members of his Synergia theater/cult who were also totally unqualified – for example, he named Margret &quot;Firefly&quot; Augustine as CEO and &quot;co-architect&quot;; she was previously the company&#39;s wardrobe mistress. </p>

<p>At one point my dad worked at the “green houses”, which were made as representations of the biome components of the biosphere so that tourists could experience what the biomes inside the project were like (at this time the biosphere was sealed because an experiment was in progress), and part of his job was that he would be working with a constant rotation of candidates who were vying to be part of the next sealed experiment. One of the benefits of that rotation was my dad would hear about all the bizarre shit Allen and his fellows were up to.   </p>

<p>The group had established a commune “dormitory” style living area in an old blockhouse that was an old tuberculosis commune (back in the late 19th / early 20th century, many who had TB were instructed to move out west where it was “dry”…or so I understand, I’m no expert on this). The group would get together every Sunday and have breakfast at the blockhouse along with all the candidate hopefulls – Allen would select one candidate to pick on, he would verbally abuse the person, insulting them and making them feel like trash, and also hit them. My dad said this was some kind of bizarre motivation tactic. Which sounds like it might be a carry-over Allen’s time in The Theater Of All Possibilities - according to this article I found from The San Francisco paper <a href="http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle1.pdf">“The Progress” in 1978</a>, “Allegations have been made by one-time members of the Theater of All Possibilities which suggest that the theater group has cult characteristics using psychological humiliation and corporal punishment to keep members in line”.  This 1994 article from the <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&amp;dat=19940724&amp;id=SgBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wlUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6918,3691431">‘Kingman Daily Miner’</a> supports that as well, stating that “John Allen held a cult-like sway…requiring members to perform group howling, eat in silence and absorb physical abuse”. </p>

<p>My dad says that the cult also had ties to several celebrities. Once Timothy Leary visited and shortly after the group started hosting private “psychedelic” plays at the block house. Another time my dad was in the foundation tunnels of the block house and discovered a weapons cache (AKs) donated by Marlon Brando, whom my dad met and said there was no legit or official reason for him to be visiting a large scientific venture in the Arizona desert. </p>

<p>He also said that candidates used to be taken out on cruises on the ‘Heraclitus’, and when they returned they were indoctrinated members. The Heraclitus is especially weird, <a href="http://rvheraclitus.org/">it’s homepage</a> states “Since it was designed and built in 1975 by the Institute of Ecotechnics, the crew of the Heraclitus has studied oceans, coral reefs, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and explored the origins and futures of human cultures”. The site mentions a lot of ties to the Institute of Ecotechnics, and says it’s a ‘research vessel’, but there are no specifics, not to mention it looks nothing like a research vessel (not that I’m an expert) – however it does state <a href="http://rvheraclitus.org/the-heraclitus/theater-art/">the following</a>: “Theater and art are an integral part of all Institute of Ecotechnics projects, alongside science/ecology and enterprise, as sources of inspiration and a means to digest experience. Theater also serves as a training device, where ‘ensemble’ and ‘crew’ are interchangeable concepts. It offers the opportunity for participatory, non-hierarchical expression in a small group, while developing the discipline of conceiving, preparing and presenting an idea within a given time limit, when ‘the show must go on.’ Since theater, dance and song figure in most traditional cultures, the Heraclitus crew practices them as a vehicle of cultural interchange in ports and islands worldwide. During the Amazon Expedition in 1981, for example, the ship travelled hundreds of miles through riverine communities whose only encounters with foreigners had, for centuries, resulted in exploitation. Arriving in a village, the crew performed a dance drama with music, as did their village hosts. These performances overcame language barriers and created the trust necessary for reciprocal exchange, in this case the sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge.” So, basically, it’s a naval-borne traveling theater troupe with ties to a biospehere 2 cult.…seriously the whole site is super bizarre…and John Allen is listed as the “Expedition Chief Emeritus”.</p>

<p>Anyway, things fell apart at the Biosphere in 1994 – Bass apparently started to come to his senses and <a href="http://www.sharonlbegley.com/in-the-desert-big-trouble-under-glass">“asked a federal court in Ft. Worth to dissolve the partnership between the financial arm of Biosphere 2, which he controls, and its managing arm, run by the controversial team of Margaret Augustine and John Allen”</a>. Other affidavits describe &quot;threatening and irrational&quot; behavior by some of the managers. All of this was enough to persuade the court to place the partnership&#39;s assets-primarily the 3.15-acre terrarium complete with desert, ocean, rain forest, savanna and marshland-under the control of receivers. Federal marshals swooped down on Biosphere 2 on Good Friday and barred Augustine, Allen and other leadership / Synergia members. They were suspended by a judge pending a review of Bass&#39;s charges that they are guilty of gross, even deliberate mismanagement of personnel and money. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/11/us/ecological-experiment-becomes-battleground.html">Project auditors are checking unexplained expenditures, like improper use of expense accounts and credit cards</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, near the Biosphere was a wash with a firepit and in the center of it was a tree on which the head in the picture was carved out, where they would go to do whatever weirdness they did. My dad knew about it, and the morning FBI showed up in 8 unmarked cars and began arresting the leadership (read: Synergia members) of the biosphere, my dad went down to the wash and cutoff the cult head and brought it home. </p>

<p>And that’s how I ended up with a cult head in my living room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be interested in an AMA as well. And seeing a pic of the carved head. There was a huge exodus here in the late 70&#39;s early 80&#39;s of spun out folks looking to get off the grid so to speak. Terrance McKenna also moved here. My friend and I were just talking about similar subjects the other day. Many folks we know were byproducts of the San Fran 60&#39;s or members of the Merry Pranksters, founder of the hemp fest, etc. And many of them own and operate interesting vacation rental/spiritual retreats/ party properties here. Some with very cultish undertones.</p>

<p>I think we have to consider that a myriad of drugs come into play, many created a path after transcendental experiences and realized that many others were looking for another way, so they capitalized on that. Shepard/ sheep type energies. And with that form of perceived power comes an illusion of control, egocentric behaviors and a &#39;holier than thou&#39; mentality.</p>

<p>As far as the odd and bizarre motivational tactics/mental torture, the Biospere sounds dangerous. Often in indigenous cultures using plant medicine, this is seen to some as a way to break the ego. That&#39;s not to say I am condoning abusive relationships or dictator behavior. But many in psychedelic cultures, those of indigenous cultures who use plant medicine, neopaganism, and some other cultural traditions believe that breaking the ego can lead the self to the soul or higher consciousness. Certain plant medicines are used or rituals performed of native peoples specifically to purge past programing, detox physically and mentally, face the shadow of the self and ego. (Ayahuasca, Datura, and specific mushrooms all come to mind) </p>

<p>And I believe this is where that subject gets twisted and potentially scary. Those that have perceived power in communities using drugs and plant medicine may twist the original meaning of dying a shamans death/awakening the inner self/and releasing the ego-only to use that as a way to control others looking for truths. Again, what was happening there at the Biosphere doesn&#39;t sound good or healthy. Perhaps they were taking a traditional belief and twisting it to their benefit.   </p>

<p>Edit to add- Another project/community I have an uneasy feeling about is the Venus project</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really interesting story. I remember reading a longish article about those guys in Texas Monthly some time ago. I&#39;d never heard about this wooden head.</p>

<p>A question-- did the Synergia members have kids at replacement population levels? Did they manage to continue recruiting from outside?</p>

<p>I have a bit of experience with a similar group, and my mental picture is of mostly childless 60+ year olds who are bent on trying to live forever.</p>
