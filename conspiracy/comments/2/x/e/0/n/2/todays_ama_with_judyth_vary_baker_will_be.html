    <div class="md"><p><strong>The Truth</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judyth&#39;s story consists of two parts -- the love story with Lee and the bioweapon plot.</p>

<p>The love story is not impossible. They did work together at Reilly Coffee. However, even Judyth does not claim they met there. There is no documentation of anyone seeing them together there. In addition, there are no photos, no postcards, no love notes, no love letters. There is, in fact, no objective documentation that they even had a personal relationship. Judyth contaminated her own witness, Anna Lewis, by refusing to allow her researchers to speak with Anna first. Nobody knows how much of what Anna said was tainted. 60 Minutes saw through Judyth after giving her a psych eval. She is that good. And Judyth brags that she is smarter than everyone. Those who simply believe her without researching the 15 years of controversy she has caused on the newsgroups are proof of her claim.</p>

<p>The second part of Judyth&#39;s story is the bioweapon plot. Ed Haslam, who conveniently happens to be from Judyth&#39;s home town of Bradenton, FL,wrote &quot;Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus&quot; in the mid-90&#39;s. He created an alternate universe of possibilities, of &#39;what-if&#39;s?&#39; Judyth walked right into it and tried to make it real. She never told anyone about the bioweapon plot prior to Haslam&#39;s book coming out. I find that highly suspicious. Nor did she come forward until after that book was published.</p>

<p>In addition, Judyth declined to come forward with her evidence during the Clay Shaw trial. I cannot imagine a more willing ear than that of Jim Garrison to anything that would &#39;exonerate&#39; Lee. Nor did she come forward during the ARRB. She waited until after the movie JFK had come out and then came forward, not with witness testimony and verifiable evidence, but with a dramatic narrative which she claimed was &#39;real&#39; and &#39;evidence&#39; which she twisted and cherrypicked to create a Judyth-centric version of the assassination.</p>

<p>It is easy to perceive that she is not credible source and in the end obfuscates what really matters in the JFK investigation.</p>

<p>Edit: due to the popularity of this post and the conflict it has created I want to clarify that I did this post on my own accord and not one user here conspired with me. No one should go down with me for exposing more BS AMAs from <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>. I&#39;m here alone to help stop this sub from distracting and discrediting itself.  The mod axol has a history of BS</p>

<p>I am CoincidenceTheory who exposed <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> for his terrible moderation and was subsequently banned. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What? She knew Anna Lewis for decades, what does this even mean?</p>

<p>This seems like the only thing the &quot;skeptics&quot; can think of to dismiss the fact that Judyth has actually provided a living witness who confirmed she went on double dates with Judyth and LHO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>60 Minutes saw through Judyth after giving her a psych eval.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I know about 60 Minutes.</p>

<p>Don Hewitt, legendary executive producer and creator of 60 Minutes had this to say about Judyth&#39;s account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I brought that woman to New York...[we] were convinced we were about to break the biggest story of our times...The door was slammed in our face...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t sound like your version of events at all...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She never told anyone about the bioweapon plot prior to Haslam&#39;s book coming out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s because she was raising a family and didn&#39;t want to get killed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, Judyth declined to come forward with her evidence during the Clay Shaw trial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judyth was young, terrified, and a newlywed. </p>

<p>She had had an affair with Oswald. After his death, she returned to her husband and began to raise a family.</p>

<p>She was warned to never speak of her activities again.</p>

<p>Can you imagine her being like &quot;oh btw hubby, I just had an affair with the accused assassin of the POTUS like right after we got married&quot;?</p>

<p>She waited until she divorced and her youngest left the house to return to her memories.</p>

<p>She didn&#39;t wait until &quot;after the movie JFK came out&quot; she waited until she no longer had the responsibility of raising a family.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to perceive that she is not credible source</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it now?</p>

<p>Have you <em>actually</em> read her book?</p>

<p>She provides some pretty damn incredible evidence to support her story.</p>

<p>Do I think her word is gospel? Of course not...she&#39;s admitted to mistakes in the past.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that you created an account today for the sole purpose of calling her story into question.</p>

<p>You even mimicked her user name.</p>

<p>Why the anonymity? Why did you have to create a new account just to write this hit piece?</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to do better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard her story on a podcast called Caravan to Midnight hosted by John B. Wells. It was an incredible story that does stretch your mind a bit. The most interesting part to me is about her telling of the strange cause of death of Dr. Mary S. Sherman and how it is consistent to a particle accelerator she was working with. </p>

<p>Look the JFK assassination has so many stories tied to it; Robert &quot;Tosh&quot; Plumlee&#39;s account of hired foreign assassins, M Weasley Swearington&#39;s account of a CIA trained mafia hit; he died at Dallas, he faked the death, the autopsy photo is J.D. Tippit. My point is so many tangents how could you possibly figure out which one is the truth. 
One thing is for sure is that there is overwhelming evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald did not shoot the president. 
Remember an episode of X-Files named &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;; it chronicled that characters life as an assassin for the government. In a part of the episode he set up Oswald as the patsy, he than gained access to the storm drain system off of Elm St. in Dealy Plaza and shot the president. 
Lots of crazy stuff, I love it.</p>

<p>Actually that&#39;s not true. <em>All</em> of the evidence points to Oswald. You can claim it is all faked, that&#39;s your prerogative, but there isn&#39;t a shred of evidence that points to anyone <em>but</em> him. </p>
