        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the end of WW2 the American government, intelligence agencies, and corporations have been up to very well documented shady shit. </p>

<p>Since Reagan there has been massive deregulation and policy reforms more often than not influenced by trans-corporations. These corporations own the election process and they own the elected. </p>

<p>They influence issues like global warming by paying leading academics to lie about results. They pay and silence major news networks. The pay credit raters to give their predatory lending schemes AAA ratings. Now they are influencing a major bill in secret, TPP (I&#39;m absolutely sure they are influencing Canada&#39;s Bill c-51 as well). </p>

<p>To me it is more than clear. People absolutely need to wake up soon. A fascist regime of corporate kings is real and it is happening. </p>

<p>They will not bat an eye when they destroy the environment, raise wealth inequality, lead us into a depression, operate immoral sweatshops worldwide, create a police state, and continue greed driven American foreign policy. This is clearly their intent, this is clearly new world order in motion. </p>

<p>So how can you not be a conspiracy theorist?  </p>

<p>&quot;The man who has no sense of history, is like a man who has no ears or eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great liars are also great magicians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is always more difficult to fight against faith than against knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The greater the crime perpetrated by the leadership, the less the people would believe the leadership capable of such a crime.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It also gives us a very special, secret pleasure to see how unaware the people around us are of what is really happening to them.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to wake up my mother for twenty years. She tried to debunk every single thing I showed her.</p>

<p>What finally got her was this:</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2009389.1415889519!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/article-king-1113.jpg?enlarged">http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2009389.1415889519!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/article-king-1113.jpg?enlarged</a></p>

<p>Granted, she had a rather personal stake in the events regarding what this document shows. The man was a personal hero for her. Seeing undeniable proof that the United States government tried to, and a reasonable reason to believe that they <em>did</em>, murder one of the most loved men in American history opened her eyes real fast. </p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the same thing will work for your wife, but know this - <em>everyone</em> has their braking point. Everyone has something that they just can&#39;t ignore. Something that means something to them. Maybe it&#39;s not 9/11, maybe it&#39;s not Chigago, maybe it&#39;s not the NSA or MKULTRA or flouride - but <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily I have friends who are ready and willing to discuss.  It&#39;s interesting that they are on different places on the political spectrum, some liberal, some conservative, I&#39;m libertarian - but they find it easy to believe that politicians lie about almost everything.  Not a one of them believes in the official fairy tales about the murders of JFK, RFK, or MLK, and they all know that virtually every war has been based on lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here with my wife. Some stuff she listens to but on others I can tell she doesn&#39;t like. For some reason Snowden annoys her, she thinks he&#39;s a spy. &#39;If he was a true patriot he would have stayed in the US&#39; is her argument. Honestly sometimes I wonder what it would take. Theres no alternative for an adult with a family. What are you going to do? Vote for some non-establishment candidate? Prolly get assassinated anyway.  Civil disobedience?

<p>Before I was married and had kids I used to wonder at the &quot;cowardice&quot; of the adult generation.  Once you have kids they&#39;ve got you by the balls.  Go ahead and do that brave thing, maybe you can take the torture - but the thought of them fucking up your kids is just too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to sell cars and it is practically an essential tactic in car sales to wear people down.  If they aren&#39;t sold on something you keep giving them options,pricing,etc.  Eventually the husband stands up and says fuck it Cindy the car they are recommending is the car that we are buying, we have been here way too damn long.  When people get tired, thinking becomes too much of a hassle and any logic goes out the window.  This means that they don&#39;t care if they could potentially save 2,000 or are missing out on some really cool options.  People are programmed to do this daily.  The media gets em&#39; when they go to bed, and they get em&#39; with their bullshit when they wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people don&#39;t understand what empathy is. It&#39;s understandable because it doesn&#39;t have a place in our societal value systems. The system beats it out of us. It&#39;s an incredibly powerful tool though. It&#39;s starts with simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlJpRhmldY4">imagining</a> what it would be like in someone else&#39;s shoes.</p>

<p>To get on point here, empathy might help connect those dots. I&#39;m not trying to say you need it or anything. Just a friendly thought. </p>

<p>It&#39;s okay though, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t think the government would be willing to kill thousands of their own citizens to further foreign policy goals. I can get on board with the LIHOP theory, and I certainly think the the US government is partly responsible for 9/11, in different ways though. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not like the post 9/11 world looks any different to me than it does to you, 9/11 skeptics think that everything the US has done abroad and at home is as a result of the US planned 9/11 attacks, whereas I just think the 9/11 attacks were exploited for political purposes. There is common ground, not much, but some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise I&#39;ll not try to convince you, nor try to sway your opinion with the things I link you to. But what I can do, if you wish, and if you &quot;believe&quot; in the scientific method and Newton&#39;s laws of motion, is help you to <em>convince yourself</em> that a tall structure cannot possibly totally, symetrically disintegrate from top to bottom, absent a very clever domino mechanism (intent), magic, space laser beams or steel-eating termites. I&#39;ll sell you no conspiracy theory involving da juice or psyoinism. </p>

<p>All I need to know is whether you prefer the practical approach, with models, experiments and comparisons with other structures, or if you prefer the theoretical approach, in case of which I would use Z.P. Bazants <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf">Mechanics of Progressive Collapse</a> and his assumption that &quot;W[g] &gt; W[p] by an order of magnitude&quot; as basis (in layman&#39;s terms: the official story says that the towers were three times heavier than their structure could support). </p>

<p>In the first post I would bring to your attention that to this day, there is not one physical model of a tower collapsing from top to bottom without some trickery, that there is not one scientific computer model (fancy animations don&#39;t count without parameter files for the physics engine) and that such a collapse mode has never before nor after been seen (again, Barad-DÃ»rs demise in LotR does not count).</p>

<p>I could argue from your standpoint, I was there: meh, LIHOP at worst, exploitation at best (in the sense of Naomi Klein&#39;s Shock Doctrine - 9/11 was an opportunity too good to leave unexploited), although I knew all the arguments for and against MIHOP. It was not until 2011 I finally understood why and how buildings do or do not collapse - with scientific certainty. I thought I was prepared, but it was quite a ride, so this goes with a little warning also... </p>

<p>All I can, will and wish to do is to invite you to follow the steps I took to come to the conclusion that the towers did NOT collapse because planes crashed into them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what you listed are facts?</p>

<p>What I believe is that money is power. Therefore rich people and corporations have the most power, and influence congress through lobby firms which promote interests served over that of the american people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a power struggle. And considering a quietly <strong>EPIC</strong> battle just got won on behalf of the people by classifying the internet as a utility just yesterday? It&#39;s not all bad. Because what just happened facilitates the access to information the likes of which we&#39;ve never had before. They&#39;re winning the battles, don&#39;t get me wrong. But that was an epic win for We The People winning the war. </p>

<p>Problem is. Not all information is created equal. So as much as you can find great access to knowledge online you can also find people that make convincing arguments that the earth is flat, literally. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are a distraction born from the admirable gut instinct that &quot;what is is not what it seems&quot;. Where I disagree with is the conclusions that are made. Problem is the real &#39;conspiracies&#39; are far less sexy than the ones theorists come up with.  </p>

<p>Because - and this is important if you really want to pull of evil in first world countries? You do it in broad, fucking, daylight. And the <em>way</em> you do that is make it <em>realllly</em> boring. That&#39;s how it get&#39;s done. Because no one bothers to actually <em>read</em> The Patriot Act, or the hundreds of porked up bills with nefarious additions. Alex Jones isn&#39;t making an exhaustively researched book about corporate corruption, because it&#39;s boring. Anyone read Matt Taibbi? Didn&#39;t think so.  </p>

<p>The government isn&#39;t actually all bad, if at all. It&#39;s normal everyday people doing their best. But <em>corporations</em> influencing governance, and narcissistic politicians are the bad apples spoiling the bunch. Instead of bribing pol&#39;s with cash these days? Corporations offer them jobs after they retire from governance - no better way to influence than from the inside. Or fracking corporations hiring former military psy ops pros as consultants. Or *<em>individual</em> sociopaths that have enormous corruptive influence on our country like J Edgar Hoover (FBI Founder), Dick Cheney, or Dick Fuld and Angelo Mozilo. An example of only four enormous assholes with immeasurable influence over our Justice, Governmental, and Financial systems. So it&#39;s not &quot; Bilderberg, or the Jews, running everything&quot; but rather sociopaths <em>ruining</em> everything. There is no such thing as absolute control, rather power struggles and everybody wanting some. Meanwhile the average citizen is fucked. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/27285.Our_Only_Enemies_Understanding_The_Sociopath_">https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/27285.Our_Only_Enemies_Understanding_The_Sociopath_</a></p>

<p>TL;DR The truth is boring. That&#39;s what some conspiracy theorists don&#39;t necessarily understand anymore than &#39;sheeple&#39;. It&#39;s basically individual sociopaths and corporatism that are ruining shit, quietly, in broad daylight. Elaborate, sometimes false conspiracy theory often distracts capable minds from from the real problem - psychopaths in suits influencing and corrupting <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>An ego can affect/effect (yea idk) how people view everything. If they feel a certain view/idea/thought goes against what they believe, especially what society has &quot;told&quot; them as being true, they shut down, clam up and can&#39;t accept another view and go into defensive mode. Their egos block them and protect them from outside views/ideas/thoughts, that are outside the social norm, like a cocoon. Congrats on shedding yours, most of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;be a conspiracy theorist&quot;?</p>

<p>I believe the government has done and is doing shady things.  I think every government does that.  I think almost anyone who has any power will probably do some shady stuff and try to influence people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the moon landing was faked.
I don&#39;t believe that 9/11 was an inside job.
I don&#39;t believe WTC7 was demo&#39;d.
I don&#39;t think Shady Hook was a hoax or a false flag.
I don&#39;t think the Boston Bombing was a hoax or a false flag.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because the &quot;evidence&quot; conspiracy theorists have for any of that is shaky and circumstantial at <em>best</em>.</p>

<p>WTF?  How did <em>we</em> &quot;win&quot; by allowing the same entity (federal government) that spies on its citizens and collects all of our personal data without a warrant to take regulatory control over the internet?</p>

<p>The argument over net neutrality was nothing but the shoe horn to allow the FCC to take control over the net and our communications.  That was specifically engineered to sucker gullible dip-shits like you.</p>

<p>&quot;Net Neutrality&quot;... The noble cause with all the evil trimmings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should say thank you and fix it and move on, keeping our spelling and grammar on point (I seriously just did type that as &quot;grammer&quot;) is part and parcel of being taken seriously. No need to be snippy with grammar police - in our line of thought, given all the pushback, we should be on-point as much as we can.</p>

<p>Nothing irks me more than &quot;Captain Chemtrails&quot; running around with shit grammar and spelling posting stupid nonsensical memes discrediting everyone else and providing low-hanging fruit for statists to poke at. I often think some of those folks are plants.</p>

<p>So we should thank those who correct us and be gracious, though it ain&#39;t easy sometimes. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, I totally agree and get hypersensitive myself, way too often...and I can see it especially in this case when the person correcting is just doing it to be a jackass (I wasn&#39;t 100% sure of that until I saw the &quot;take your meds&quot; comment from the grammar bitch, which is hallmark derailing arsehole whereas a grammar fix can be ambiguous). </p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s part of the reason for my little preachy garbage up there - OP had a point, someone dodged and derailed with a grammar pecadillo, and OP bit back snippy, thereby kind of screwing his/her own credibility and giving credibility to the grammar derailer.

<p>Yes, there are shady, corrupt government officials who do more harm for the greater good than they do good. But that&#39;s not the majority of them. If it was we&#39;d have been lookin at a Mad Maxx existence long ago. Yes, big corporations have lots of money. They make stuff we want to buy. Way better than most others. So we buy it. That&#39;s why they have lots of money... What major corporation did you help fund when you bought whatever device you&#39;re using right now as a digital soapbox? Apple? Google? Lenovo? Sony? Or did you fashion your smartphone out of recycled tinfoil hats that Reagan never touched like the rest of you clear headed theorists? </p>

<p>You see all sorts of things going on behind the curtain... Well, stop looking back there. Things will happen back there. Always. It&#39;s up to us to pay attention to all the good things going on as well. Or else why are they going on? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re thing is to ignore everything going on other than a simple spelling error. </p>

<p>First of all, half of the world is living in an awful society due to foreign policy. 2.3 million Palestinian&#39;s are living in what I would call worse than the dystopian world Mad Max presents.</p>

<p>The middle-east is vilified. People can&#39;t trust a blue sky because a drone can come out of nowhere. I&#39;d rather take searching for petrol in the Australian desert than have to worry about my entire village being bombed indiscriminately.    </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got most countries intelligence agencies collecting meta-data on you, even your keystrokes. You&#39;ve got major corporations in the pockets of anybody who wants to become a high ranking government official.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think that maybe one day you won&#39;t be getting a job because a corporation bought access to your metadata? </p>

<p>Also this world is completely fucked because of the exacerbation of global warming, and this isn&#39;t even an issue for most people. </p>

<p>Corporations are just going to become more and more powerful until there is in fact a group of elites that run the world. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t worry about any of that, worry about my spelling error, it is far more important.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I came at you a little strong before (the Internet really brings out our dark side, doesn&#39;t it?). You do make some good points. I guess we just sail in two different ships. 
Corporations denying me a job because of the keystrokes I&#39;ve made is totally illegal. I support small businesses, so I would never apply for a job at a corporation in the first place, but if I did, I wouldn&#39;t want to work for one that thinks it&#39;s above the law (and I don&#39;t think those exist). 
Yes, there are serious problems around the world, but you know what? There are already plenty of groups of people who are way smarter than I am who are dedicated to solving these problems. I&#39;m just one guy. I can&#39;t solve those problems. I can however try to correct a grammatical mistake (rather rudely, I admit) that a fellow redditor has made. So those are the things I focus on worrying about (since this all started with the things that we choose to worry about) that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corporations are just as above the law as, say for example, the entire food service industry work staff. Servers, bartenders, anyone who makes a living off tips, are all required by law to declare their cash tips so they can pay taxes on them accordingly. NO ONE declares their tips. How many millions, if not billions, of tax dollars are lost to the inherent greed we all harbor? Children, old people, even your dear sweet mom at some point will all display a bit of greed if they know they won&#39;t get in trouble. </p>

<p>I could keep going, but I just go back to my original point. I&#39;m not going to stress about things I have no control over, nor have a direct impact on my life. (I said direct, I know there are a trillion arguments for indirect). </p>
