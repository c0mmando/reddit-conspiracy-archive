       Since the end of WW2 the American government, intelligence agencies, and corporations have been up to very well documented shady shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Reagan there has been massive deregulation and policy reforms more often than not influenced by trans-corporations. These corporations own the election process and they own the elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       They influence issues like global warming by paying leading academics to lie about results. They pay and silence major news networks. The pay credit raters to give their predatory lending schemes AAA ratings. Now they are influencing a major bill in secret, TPP (I'm absolutely sure they are influencing Canada's Bill c-51 as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it is more than clear. People absolutely need to wake up soon. A fascist regime of corporate kings is real and it is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will not bat an eye when they destroy the environment, raise wealth inequality, lead us into a depression, operate immoral sweatshops worldwide, create a police state, and continue greed driven American foreign policy. This is clearly their intent, this is clearly new world order in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how can you not be a conspiracy theorist?

       I heard a family member on the phone with her sister overseas recently.  Casually gossiping about "terorrists" because the conversation got stale and said some of the most ridiculous shit I have ever heard in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       "they want to destroy everything in their paths", "they all hate Americans", "they just destroyed 10,000 ancient documents",  "these terrorists are ruining the world"," they only want to kill us", "etc".  If they just looked at some basic statistics and did some basic math then they would maybe be able to see why the hell we are in this situation to begin with.  The real terrorists are not Muslim, that's for sure.

       This is the exact sort of response I receive from my family and a majority of my friends. "If it's serious then the judicial system will take care of it." Clearly they don't believe/don't want to believe that the system is rigged. Then they just find some variant of bread and circus to take their mind off of the topic. It's much easier to tune out than examine a problem that "seems" impossible to solve.

       I tried to wake up my mother for twenty years. She tried to debunk every single thing I showed her.
      </p>
      <p>
       What finally got her was this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2009389.1415889519!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/article-king-1113.jpg?enlarged">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, she had a rather personal stake in the events regarding what this document shows. The man was a personal hero for her. Seeing undeniable proof that the United States government tried to, and a reasonable reason to believe that they
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       , murder one of the most loved men in American history opened her eyes real fast.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the same thing will work for your wife, but know this -
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       has their braking point. Everyone has something that they just can't ignore. Something that means something to them. Maybe it's not 9/11, maybe it's not Chigago, maybe it's not the NSA or MKULTRA or flouride - but
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       .

       My wife is somewhat open-minded about it, more than your wife, but she does reach a point where you can see she just doesn't want to hear it any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily I have friends who are ready and willing to discuss.  It's interesting that they are on different places on the political spectrum, some liberal, some conservative, I'm libertarian - but they find it easy to believe that politicians lie about almost everything.  Not a one of them believes in the official fairy tales about the murders of JFK, RFK, or MLK, and they all know that virtually every war has been based on lies.

       Same here with my wife. Some stuff she listens to but on others I can tell she doesn't like. For some reason Snowden annoys her, she thinks he's a spy. 'If he was a true patriot he would have stayed in the US' is her argument. Honestly sometimes I wonder what it would take. Theres no alternative for an adult with a family. What are you going to do? Vote for some non-establishment candidate? Prolly get assassinated anyway.  Civil disobedience? Go to jail and lose your job and house and spouse and kid.

       Before I was married and had kids I used to wonder at the "cowardice" of the adult generation.  Once you have kids they've got you by the balls.  Go ahead and do that brave thing, maybe you can take the torture - but the thought of them fucking up your kids is just too much.

       Maybe just me but a woman that is incapable of even acknowledging the flaws within the system because she is too tired is not worth your time to even engage. I hope you don't have an intimate relationship with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       If so I am sure you have your reasons but just don't put yourself thru that torture. My wife will engage me on some topics. Others she won't. She never just dismisses it cause she is too tired.

       I always compare it to the movie the Matrix. Remember when Morpheus apologized to Neo because there is a rule about not unplugging people after a certain age. It's like that, after about I'd say 17 or 18 if someone hasn't begun to wake up they probably won't. They've been brainwashed and will never accept reality. Ignorance is bliss.

       I used to sell cars and it is practically an essential tactic in car sales to wear people down.  If they aren't sold on something you keep giving them options,pricing,etc.  Eventually the husband stands up and says fuck it Cindy the car they are recommending is the car that we are buying, we have been here way too damn long.  When people get tired, thinking becomes too much of a hassle and any logic goes out the window.  This means that they don't care if they could potentially save 2,000 or are missing out on some really cool options.  People are programmed to do this daily.  The media gets em' when they go to bed, and they get em' with their bullshit when they wake up in the morning.

       I think most people between the ages of 18 and 40 who are interested in history, politics and world affairs could be considered a conspiracy theorist to some degree, they just might not be your type of conspiracy theorist. At the end of the day, no one really trusts their own government or any other government, for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider myself a conspiracy theorist, I don't trust governments or the media, not all of the time, I know about Operation Northwoods, MK Ultra and I am all too aware of the military industrial complex, but I also get accused of being a shill on this forum.

       I have you tagged as slickshill.  But with a question mark.  You are hard to pin down.  I remember that you are knowledgeable about many conspiracies but not committing.  Maybe you are struggling.  Are you still unsure about 9/11?   It also could be that you are very good at infiltration and subtle conversation tweaking, like to play devil's advocate, or enjoy ruffling feathers.  Like I said, tough to pin down.

       I'm a conspiracy theorist who happens not to believe in a few mainstream conspiracy theories, notably the 9/11 demolition theory, global warming, staged shootings, Illuminati related theories, few others that I can't think of right now.

       For me when I had my awakening on 9/11 was when I was in Afghanistan firing artillery at locals who were defending their homeland. They weren't terrorists. We were terrorists. That whole event enabled what is happening now.

       I think a lot of people don't understand what empathy is. It's understandable because it doesn't have a place in our societal value systems. The system beats it out of us. It's an incredibly powerful tool though. It's starts with simply
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlJpRhmldY4">
        imagining
       </a>
       what it would be like in someone else's shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get on point here, empathy might help connect those dots. I'm not trying to say you need it or anything. Just a friendly thought.

       Cheers.

       It's okay though, it's not because I don't think the government would be willing to kill thousands of their own citizens to further foreign policy goals. I can get on board with the LIHOP theory, and I certainly think the the US government is partly responsible for 9/11, in different ways though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's not like the post 9/11 world looks any different to me than it does to you, 9/11 skeptics think that everything the US has done abroad and at home is as a result of the US planned 9/11 attacks, whereas I just think the 9/11 attacks were exploited for political purposes. There is common ground, not much, but some.

       I promise I'll not try to convince you, nor try to sway your opinion with the things I link you to. But what I can do, if you wish, and if you "believe" in the scientific method and Newton's laws of motion, is help you to
       <em>
        convince yourself
       </em>
       that a tall structure cannot possibly totally, symetrically disintegrate from top to bottom, absent a very clever domino mechanism (intent), magic, space laser beams or steel-eating termites. I'll sell you no conspiracy theory involving da juice or psyoinism.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I need to know is whether you prefer the practical approach, with models, experiments and comparisons with other structures, or if you prefer the theoretical approach, in case of which I would use Z.P. Bazants
       <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf">
        Mechanics of Progressive Collapse
       </a>
       and his assumption that "W[g] &gt; W[p] by an order of magnitude" as basis (in layman's terms: the official story says that the towers were three times heavier than their structure could support).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first post I would bring to your attention that to this day, there is not one physical model of a tower collapsing from top to bottom without some trickery, that there is not one scientific computer model (fancy animations don't count without parameter files for the physics engine) and that such a collapse mode has never before nor after been seen (again, Barad-Dûrs demise in LotR does not count).
      </p>
      <p>
       I could argue from your standpoint, I was there: meh, LIHOP at worst, exploitation at best (in the sense of Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine - 9/11 was an opportunity too good to leave unexploited), although I knew all the arguments for and against MIHOP. It was not until 2011 I finally understood why and how buildings do or do not collapse - with scientific certainty. I thought I was prepared, but it was quite a ride, so this goes with a little warning also...
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can, will and wish to do is to invite you to follow the steps I took to come to the conclusion that the towers did NOT collapse because planes crashed into them.

       I mean, as far as the environment goes. It could get a lot worse. I'm not believing this carbon shit effecting things, I'm more worried about the trash and waste we have going on which is the result of globalism/consumerism. I watched these two documentaries and it kinda changed my mind on how I see what consumerism/globalism is doing to the planet. I'm not a hardcore environmentalist, far from it. But, it disgusts me and I know we need to change this shit or it could be devastating for us as a species.

       True.  What scares me is the idea that by keeping this charade going for so long, it's actually been "beneficial" in some ways, at least in the sense that open violence hasn't decimated the people.  As revolutions go, the American Revolution was an outlier, usually they become very murderous affairs.

       I wonder why people trust the government without question to. History has numerous examples of them committing crimes for profit. Why trust them at all anymore. They strip away our privacy yet their bills must be conducted in secret. Their motivation is not the health or well being of the people. It's only about profit.

       Why
       <em>

       Because the reality of it all is too much for most people to take. It's easier to float along in a stoned/drunken state and ignore all the red flags than it is to own up to what is really happening. Realizing that everything you've ever been told about how this country operates is a lie.

       The longer I think about it, the more I believe it's all tribal behaviors.  Humans lived in tribes for much, much longer than we have in large societies.  Unfortunately, behaviors that  worked relatively well in a tribe, where you knew everyone, do not extrapolate well to societies of millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a tribe, you might disagree with the chief, you might even hate him, but in a dangerous situation you generally went along with what they said.  Otherwise you and your family and your tribe were doomed.

       They been conditioned by our society to be slaves. Huxley said it nicely in Brave New World "...most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution". Our society tries to dumb us down or distract us from what is going on thru media, consumerism, and even the garbage many are forced to eat. It's no mistake everyone, that Huxley and Orwell knew how the future would pan out.

       Because what you listed are facts?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe is that money is power. Therefore rich people and corporations have the most power, and influence congress through lobby firms which promote interests served over that of the american people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a power struggle. And considering a quietly
       <strong>
        EPIC
       </strong>
       battle just got won on behalf of the people by classifying the internet as a utility just yesterday? It's not all bad. Because what just happened facilitates the access to information the likes of which we've never had before. They're winning the battles, don't get me wrong. But that was an epic win for We The People winning the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is. Not all information is created equal. So as much as you can find great access to knowledge online you can also find people that make convincing arguments that the earth is flat, literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories are a distraction born from the admirable gut instinct that "what is is not what it seems". Where I disagree with is the conclusions that are made. Problem is the real 'conspiracies' are far less sexy than the ones theorists come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because - and this is important if you really want to pull of evil in first world countries? You do it in broad, fucking, daylight. And the
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       you do that is make it
       <em>
        realllly
       </em>
       boring. That's how it get's done. Because no one bothers to actually
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       The Patriot Act, or the hundreds of porked up bills with nefarious additions. Alex Jones isn't making an exhaustively researched book about corporate corruption, because it's boring. Anyone read Matt Taibbi? Didn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government isn't actually all bad, if at all. It's normal everyday people doing their best. But
       <em>
        corporations
       </em>
       influencing governance, and narcissistic politicians are the bad apples spoiling the bunch. Instead of bribing pol's with cash these days? Corporations offer them jobs after they retire from governance - no better way to influence than from the inside. Or fracking corporations hiring former military psy ops pros as consultants. Or *
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       sociopaths that have enormous corruptive influence on our country like J Edgar Hoover (FBI Founder), Dick Cheney, or Dick Fuld and Angelo Mozilo. An example of only four enormous assholes with immeasurable influence over our Justice, Governmental, and Financial systems. So it's not " Bilderberg, or the Jews, running everything" but rather sociopaths
       <em>
        ruining
       </em>
       everything. There is no such thing as absolute control, rather power struggles and everybody wanting some. Meanwhile the average citizen is fucked.

       TL;DR The truth is boring. That's what some conspiracy theorists don't necessarily understand anymore than 'sheeple'. It's basically individual sociopaths and corporatism that are ruining shit, quietly, in broad daylight. Elaborate, sometimes false conspiracy theory often distracts capable minds from from the real problem - psychopaths in suits influencing and corrupting
       <em>
        everything
       </em>

       I read an article about people and the role their egos play in their lives. Needless to say its detrimental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noun: an alert cognitive state in which you are aware of yourself and your situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       An ego can affect/effect (yea idk) how people view everything. If they feel a certain view/idea/thought goes against what they believe, especially what society has "told" them as being true, they shut down, clam up and can't accept another view and go into defensive mode. Their egos block them and protect them from outside views/ideas/thoughts, that are outside the social norm, like a cocoon. Congrats on shedding yours, most of you.

       I think the definition needs to be made between a 'conspiracy theorist' and, 'realistic world view'.  Conspiracy Theorist - Believes in shape shifting reptilians who control the government from behind the scenes and manifest in peoples dreams through hallucinations.  Realistic World View - there are number of powerful Human Beings on this planet who control world political and economic agendas according to their own personal gain.  The two are verrrrry different on the spectrum, and i feel we all get thrown into the crazy conspiracy theorist bucket.  PS - I am not suggesting either is the necessarily truth, just the view from the outside world of

       What do you mean by "be a conspiracy theorist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the government has done and is doing shady things.  I think every government does that.  I think almost anyone who has any power will probably do some shady stuff and try to influence people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the moon landing was faked.
I don't believe that 9/11 was an inside job.
I don't believe WTC7 was demo'd.
I don't think Shady Hook was a hoax or a false flag.
I don't think the Boston Bombing was a hoax or a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the "evidence" conspiracy theorists have for any of that is shaky and circumstantial at

       You should say thank you and fix it and move on, keeping our spelling and grammar on point (I seriously just did type that as "grammer") is part and parcel of being taken seriously. No need to be snippy with grammar police - in our line of thought, given all the pushback, we should be on-point as much as we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing irks me more than "Captain Chemtrails" running around with shit grammar and spelling posting stupid nonsensical memes discrediting everyone else and providing low-hanging fruit for statists to poke at. I often think some of those folks are plants.

       Oh yeah, I totally agree and get hypersensitive myself, way too often...and I can see it especially in this case when the person correcting is just doing it to be a jackass (I wasn't 100% sure of that until I saw the "take your meds" comment from the grammar bitch, which is hallmark derailing arsehole whereas a grammar fix can be ambiguous).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that's part of the reason for my little preachy garbage up there - OP had a point, someone dodged and derailed with a grammar pecadillo, and OP bit back snippy, thereby kind of screwing his/her own credibility and giving credibility to the grammar derailer. Cede no Internet points to dodging derailers, y'all, no points!

       If you don't even know the difference  between affect and effect, or at least don't care enough to use the right one when making your point, how do you expect people to take you seriously? I'm surprised your post wasn't "0mg u guyz! We r fuqd! U shud no dat!"

       Yes, there are shady, corrupt government officials who do more harm for the greater good than they do good. But that's not the majority of them. If it was we'd have been lookin at a Mad Maxx existence long ago. Yes, big corporations have lots of money. They make stuff we want to buy. Way better than most others. So we buy it. That's why they have lots of money... What major corporation did you help fund when you bought whatever device you're using right now as a digital soapbox? Apple? Google? Lenovo? Sony? Or did you fashion your smartphone out of recycled tinfoil hats that Reagan never touched like the rest of you clear headed theorists?
      </p>
      <p>
       You see all sorts of things going on behind the curtain... Well, stop looking back there. Things will happen back there. Always. It's up to us to pay attention to all the good things going on as well. Or else why are they going on?

       The middle-east is vilified. People can't trust a blue sky because a drone can come out of nowhere. I'd rather take searching for petrol in the Australian desert than have to worry about my entire village being bombed indiscriminately.

       You've got most countries intelligence agencies collecting meta-data on you, even your keystrokes. You've got major corporations in the pockets of anybody who wants to become a high ranking government official.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that maybe one day you won't be getting a job because a corporation bought access to your metadata?

       Also this world is completely fucked because of the exacerbation of global warming, and this isn't even an issue for most people.

       Corporations are just going to become more and more powerful until there is in fact a group of elites that run the world.

       But don't worry about any of that, worry about my spelling error, it is far more important.

       I'm sorry I came at you a little strong before (the Internet really brings out our dark side, doesn't it?). You do make some good points. I guess we just sail in two different ships. 
Corporations denying me a job because of the keystrokes I've made is totally illegal. I support small businesses, so I would never apply for a job at a corporation in the first place, but if I did, I wouldn't want to work for one that thinks it's above the law (and I don't think those exist). 
Yes, there are serious problems around the world, but you know what? There are already plenty of groups of people who are way smarter than I am who are dedicated to solving these problems. I'm just one guy. I can't solve those problems. I can however try to correct a grammatical mistake (rather rudely, I admit) that a fellow redditor has made. So those are the things I focus on worrying about (since this all started with the things that we choose to worry about) that's all I'm saying.

       Corporations are just as above the law as, say for example, the entire food service industry work staff. Servers, bartenders, anyone who makes a living off tips, are all required by law to declare their cash tips so they can pay taxes on them accordingly. NO ONE declares their tips. How many millions, if not billions, of tax dollars are lost to the inherent greed we all harbor? Children, old people, even your dear sweet mom at some point will all display a bit of greed if they know they won't get in trouble.

       I could keep going, but I just go back to my original point. I'm not going to stress about things I have no control over, nor have a direct impact on my life. (I said direct, I know there are a trillion arguments for indirect).
