       This has been going on for a while now in the UK, and I'm surprised
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       hasn't talked about it much yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1437596/sex-gangs-may-have-abused-hundreds-of-girls">
        Here's the most recent news story concerning this
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One victim described how she turned up at a police station
        <strong>
         covered in blood
        </strong>
        in the early hours, but was
        <strong>
         ignored
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         One girl said: "I turned up at the police station at 2/3am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch. They dismissed it as me being naughty, a nuisance."
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Their trial detailed how they "actively targeted" girls from
        <strong>
         the ages of 11 and 12
        </strong>
        ,
        <strong>
         the majority of whom had been sent to live in care homes
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The girls were plied with alcohol, introduced to drugs, then sold for sex in guest houses, private houses and hotels, and abused by multiple men, some of whom had travelled to Oxford from "far afield".
       </p>
       <p>
        The humiliation and degradation involved
        <strong>
         knives, meat cleavers and baseball bats.
        </strong>
        The girls' ordeals sometimes lasted
        <strong>
         days
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Like similar cases in Rotherham, Rochdale and Derby, the report states the victims were white girls and the perpetrators mainly men of Asian heritage and Muslim culture, but says "no one was aware of evidence of any holding back due to ethnicity".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There's something really disturbing about this.
       <strong>
        What psycho cop would turn away a blood soaked 11-year old girl in the early morning?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's only really one answer, a corrupt cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, as usual, the vast majority of the public are being myopic here. To them, it's all about Muslim gangs 'getting lucky', because the police force are just too inept and/or 'politically correct' to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That maybe the case in Kyrgyzstan, but this is the United Kingdom. Although the time of us being a world superpower has long since passed, we still have a world-class law system and police force, and I struggle to think of any other country which has a fairer one (just a shame about the privacy abuses). So although instances of police malpractice is to be expected once in a while, this level of ineptitude is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       suspicious. I can't just accept that a police officer will turn away
       <strong>
        at least 373 'children'
       </strong>
       because of appearing 'racist'. No Englishman is that sensitive,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       police officers, who at times are known for racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this brings me to the conclusion that certain individuals of the police force are being paid to turn a blind eye to this sort of behaviour. Who has the money, influence and connections to infiltrate all levels of the police force in Oxfordshire county? Certainly not some ghetto Muslim gang. I think this goes to the top, to rich bankers and low-tier politicians. The Muslim gangs are just a front for the public to direct their anger and emotion towards, enabling blinkered vision and miss the action happening behind the scenes, because they're Muslim/Pakistani (how convinient!). I'm not saying at all that said gangs are blameless. They are after all the ones who facilitate such acts of cruelty. But the real perpertrators who finance the protection of the gangs, pay off the care home owners and police force will go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my thoughts. Please tell me what you think.

       If you really want to look for the rabbit hole, look at the woman who was in charge of child welfare at Oxfordshire County Council, Louise Chapman, and who is also the daughter of David Cameron's election agent, Barry Norton.

      </p>
      <p>
       She's still on the council.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a story about how all of these children were troubled and well known to the police and other social care services, but, there is something very, very wrong with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no wild conspiracy, there's something wrong with England at the moment. There's paedophiles everywhere it seems, and some of them are being aided and abetted by the councils and police.

       Well, there's an investigation into paedophile rings (yes, plural), in parliament and there was an active ring at the BBC at some point in the seventies, so I would probably be quite comfortable saying yes, yes there is.

       Well the rotherham scandal was high up wasn't it? So it wouldn't surprise me if powerful people used these girls at one of these houses. It is a fairly common thing actually, rich and powerful doing what they want, things many people wouldn't consider doing not because they might not want to but they wouldn't get away with it

       It's been like this for a while, ever since Madeleine McCann. The problem is not only are the majority of the population too lazy, but they just don't care. Being told what to do and what to think requires no critical thinking. And critical thinking in this situation requires effort and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was just a one-off thing, I would expect the Muslim gang to get the harshest punishment possible and that would be that. But it's not. Someone is obviously being paid to keep their mouth shut, and I highly doubt a mentally ill Pakistani would have the resources to create such a conspiracy.

       What do you mean about Madeline McCann? I am British so know what basically happened but I would say that many people actually were discussing what might have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is weird to me how it was kinda hushed up. Much less than the Rotherham and jimmy saville cases. Also the news never called it a race driven crime, as all the girls (I believe) were white but all of the men were Pakistanis (those who we know about anyway)

       Oh right. Stick to facts just so people don't call you out on it and no believe your entire argument
