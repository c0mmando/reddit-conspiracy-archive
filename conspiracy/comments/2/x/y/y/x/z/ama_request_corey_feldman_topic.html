       I've read his book and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go 100% and out the people. Not to be rude(seriously), but its not like it would ruin his career. If anything it would probably revive it.

       Or come home one day to find that his family had an "unfortunate accident in the swimming pool" or something.  I can understand the pressure men like him are under, it isn't an easy decision to put yourself and your family at risk, especially when you're doing so pretty much on your own.

       If you want to try to get in touch with him go for it, I doubt it would happen though - he's already written a book in which he would've exposed names if he was ever going to and he held back.  There's no doubt that he
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       some things, I just doubt that he would ever reveal them out of fear for his family and probably some other reasons as well.

       My thinking is, he must have some sort of proof. Maybe a video or some photos. He's been blunt about the fact that he was molested by Hollywood heavy-hitters, yet they haven't suicided him, they haven't destroyed his reputation, and they haven't bankrupted him. He has to have some sort of leverage.

       I mean he was kind of a laughing stock "Hollywood junkie" for a decade or more and now he's out of the spotlight pretty much entirely, I think it may be a case where he's not taken seriously by enough people and is easily ignored/dismissed and so nothing needs to be done with him.  The last thing they'd want is to do something obvious and make it clear that he's onto something.
      </p>

       The leverage angle is interesting, but it's seemed like in the past those with evidence (or who are about to get some) are often the types of people who
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       suicided (i.e. Michael Hastings, Danny Casolaro, etc.).  I guess the threat of their evidence is worth the risk of killing them and being exposed.

       I would love to hear from him too but let me say this. He has already said what he needed to say and if he pursues this further I fear for his safety. Perhaps we should just take what he has already said to heart and leave him be. I don't want to read a headline in the future that has his name in it with the words
       <em>
        suicide
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        drug overdose
       </em>
       in it. Seriously folks...just stop watching that Hollywood propaganda black magic crap!

       Best thing to do is message the mods about it.  Or try to make contact with him yourself and message the mods when you have it set up.

       Or come home one day to find that his family had an "unfortunate accident in the swimming pool" or something.  I can understand the pressure men like him are under, it isn't an easy decision to put yourself and your family at risk, especially when you're doing so pretty much on your own.
