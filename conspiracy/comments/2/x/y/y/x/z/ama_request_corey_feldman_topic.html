</blockquote>

<p>Corey Haam said <em>&quot;Why did you let me go over to that guy&#39;s house knowing what you knew would go down?&quot;</em> ...and Corey Feldman&#39;s face just goes white for second then he tried to one up Haam by claiming his rape was even worse by Jewllywood pedo&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to try to get in touch with him go for it, I doubt it would happen though - he&#39;s already written a book in which he would&#39;ve exposed names if he was ever going to and he held back.  There&#39;s no doubt that he <em>knows</em> some things, I just doubt that he would ever reveal them out of fear for his family and probably some other reasons as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thinking is, he must have some sort of proof. Maybe a video or some photos. He&#39;s been blunt about the fact that he was molested by Hollywood heavy-hitters, yet they haven&#39;t suicided him, they haven&#39;t destroyed his reputation, and they haven&#39;t bankrupted him. He has to have some sort of leverage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean he was kind of a laughing stock &quot;Hollywood junkie&quot; for a decade or more and now he&#39;s out of the spotlight pretty much entirely, I think it may be a case where he&#39;s not taken seriously by enough people and is easily ignored/dismissed and so nothing needs to be done with him.  The last thing they&#39;d want is to do something obvious and make it clear that he&#39;s onto something.</p>

<p>The leverage angle is interesting, but it&#39;s seemed like in the past those with evidence (or who are about to get some) are often the types of people who <em>are</em> suicided (i.e. Michael Hastings, Danny Casolaro, etc.).  I guess the threat of their evidence is worth the risk of killing them and being exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to hear from him too but let me say this. He has already said what he needed to say and if he pursues this further I fear for his safety. Perhaps we should just take what he has already said to heart and leave him be. I don&#39;t want to read a headline in the future that has his name in it with the words <em>suicide</em> or <em>drug overdose</em> in it. Seriously folks...just stop watching that Hollywood propaganda black magic crap!</p>
