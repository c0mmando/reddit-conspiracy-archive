        subreddit admin DonTago denies ANY of the posted shill accounts are 'new' - even when given the evidence, Users from
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy

        need to write DIRECTLY to the reddit admins and ask for investigation on that subreddit ASAP. Here is the link:

        At the bottom, message a reddit admin. When the own fucking MODS of
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        IGNORE and DEFEND shill accounts, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SUBREDDIT. These accounts were not populated or used, until suddenly. DonTago is leading users to believe that the users of these accounts are 'suddenly' using them. Even when accounts are only 9 hours old:

        EDIT#2: Moderator of
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        , DonTago, found it of personal responsibility to come to our fantastic subreddit and explain his position. DonTago, however, failed to realize we can smell through bullshit easily. He posts the following:
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WKLwPSO.png">
         http://i.imgur.com/WKLwPSO.png
        </a>
        On claims that I had only given him "one" account to investigate and he found no inconsistencies with the account, he claims that I have no basis for my position. Too bad DonTago forgot that I had screencapped out previous discussion in which he admits to checking MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS - Quote "None of those accounts" Odd that he is backtracking now, no? Apparently, according to DonTago, since none of the accounts are posted - literally - in the same post tree, he cannot determine if they are shill accounts. I have already messaged the admins, and am actually keeping in touch with one specifically who is doing an investigation. Message the Admins directly. Mods like DonTago who allow obvious shilling efforts need to be removed of subreddit moderator privileges; if not right out banned from using Reddit. A fat child who displays tendencies of bullying should no longer be given candy. This is not the first time we have found, as a community, that mods are complicit in vote brigading scandals and censorship (see below). Though it brings a smile on my face to have a mod of
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        come crawling into our fine subreddit to explain himself, it should not be forgotten that this is the very thing that we as a community strive to end - propaganda, manipulation, subversion of REAL democratic ideas and the sharing of voices between people all over the world. When someone like DonTago abuses his position of power, it should not be treated lightly. It is obvious they are afraid of the
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        community. Message the admins. Take a stand. Ban shills, and more importantly, ban the people who DEFEND shills.

       So the world was hit with another Jewish campaign of pro-Israeli nonsense yet again; alas this time, it hit Reddit hard. With the international refusal to accept the talking headpiece of Israeli/Jewish politics that is Netanyahu when he visited the US Congress, the defenders of all things Israel took to manipulating Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       First piece of evidence: A redditor attempted to undermine the demonization campaign of Iranians in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       by addressing his concern; followed up by another redditor who claimed he has Iranian cousins and has visited Iran. Though "he" agrees Iranians are not the problem, their government is one of the worst and pledged to kill millions.
Because I'm aways skeptical of people who make certain claims, I did some investigation. Turns out, this guy who claims to have Iranian cousins and has visited Iran, well weird thing is he also has a history of posting pro-Israeli comments and even admits to being "An Agnostic Jew" in another thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0OTxQP4.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/0OTxQP4.png
       </a>
       - Ofcourse, my post calling this guy out gets deleted by the mods. Its better to let someone lie than to post the other end of the story and let people make up their own minds. Makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within 20 minutes of me calling out this guy for his lies, the infamous Bipolarbear0 decides to personally respond to my post - which was later deleted by himself:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3q9EOS0.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/3q9EOS0.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone of you don't know who Bipolarbear0 is, he was a JIDF Jew Shill who was at one time a mod for many popular subreddits including
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       . He was even vote brigating anti-semitic content to smear
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - because you know, we are all anti-semites. He was later stripped of his moderator status from almost ALL important subreddits. Bipolarbear0 was such a shill, that even salon.com wrote an article about the censorship and noted the reddit communities overall disgust with bipolarbear0 in censoring threads:
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/">
        http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Its interesting that a known propagandist would attack MY post where I called out an obvious shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems that many "new users" who are very pro-Israel suddenly came to join the propaganda mix, this one apparently is half-Iranian and even born there:

      </p>
      <p>
       As well as this character who was responding to every one of my posts in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , who just ALSO happens to have a brand spanking new account:

        http://i.imgur.com/ZghP8yz.png
       </a>
       - Suddenly became a 'primary' account
      </p>
      <p>
       And another one day old account:

        http://www.reddit.com/user/generictossaway
       </a>
       (Account is registered for 11 months, yet has just started posting?? Okay - how long has this been shilled out for?)
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread in question is this:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As with all these new Jewish posters chiming in their opinion full blast, we also have the same set of Jewish shills that have been around for months now. Mods are silent as always, and have deleted all my posts calling out specific users. Though they never seem to delete the propagandists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with everything, I implore the users of this fine subreddit to do their OWN investigations into my allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit In an interesting twist, subreddit mod DonTago denies that these accounts are new:

      <p>
       None of those accounts in that specific comment tree you linked to were brand new accounts (is that what you are talking about?). Are you saying we shouldn't allow users to post comments that could be construed to be 'pro-Israeli'? If you feel you have evidence of vote manipulation or brigading, you need to take that to the admins. We do not have to tools or capabilities to deal with such things... only the admins do. We can only handle issues that specifically violate the rules or policies of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of post - I am not going to make a full detailed list of the significant amount of other accounts on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       that repeatedly post pro-Israeli comments to nothing but
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       - I'm sure you are aware of those ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you wonder why Shilling happens so often on that subreddit.

       In my experience, their post histories are predominantly in sports-related subs.  (
       <a href="/r/nfl">

       ,
       <a href="/r/mlb">

      </p>
      <p>
       Are all posters in sports subs shills?  Of course not. ( I shouldn't need to explain that but will do so for the inevitable trolls/shills.)

       You're right.  I forgot those. The dead give-away is when you see months of comments in one or more gaming subs and then, bam, out of nowhere they suddenly have an interest in world politics... and only on submissions related to israel.

       The instant gold on the nfl post gave it away for me. Look at front page threads now. Gold is used as a means to instill a false sense of credibility upon comments of any nature. It works for the majority of the viewers too. All they do is read headlines and check the comments. If they see the little gold star next to a comment, it will appear more interesting than all the rest.

       You will have to prove it to yourself, I think.  Doubt there's an inarguable link to share about it.  Keep digging, though.  There's patterns to see....  I used to deal with them back on Digg and now have more important things (for me) to deal with.  Glad more are seeing those patterns of behavior, though, as it is important people understand this particular form of pollution on the internet.  The Agendic Shepherds are all over now.

       The problem here is that shills accounts are like Hydra... cut one down and two more take it's place. I've noticed something weird going on there in the last 2 weeks. I used to get plenty of karma from my comments at worldnews... maybe two or three thousand a week. But in the last two weeks it's dropped to practically nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because I still post comments based on what I think is common sense and my own personal values. Lately that seems to be going against some kind of undeclared narrative that's been put into effect on most major stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk sense about Russia/Ukraine, Israel, Iran or a number of other stories right now... get ready to be downvoted.

       Just to clarify Persian's accusation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In an interesting twist, subreddit mod DonTago denies that these accounts are new
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...and:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         DonTago denies ANY of the posted shill accounts are 'new' - even when given the evidence
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...that is inaccurate. There was only
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       user I commented on, (the one Persian cites
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tL9tZ6N.png">
        HERE
       </a>
       ), who Persian accused of being a 'brand new' account. The only thing I said about that user was that I did not think it was a 'brand new' account (since it was 7 months old). That was literally the only comment that was made about any other user to Persian. However, for some reason, Persian did not feel it was relevant to include copies of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1yfhPPH.jpg">
        those modmails
       </a>
       ... probably because they literally contradict what he is accusing me of having said. No other statement about any other user or their 'legitimacy' as users were made in any statements to Persian. His insinuations that such statements WERE made are not accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Persian's concerns, I repeatedly informed him that mods have no power over brigading and vote manipulation... and that messaging the admins and taking his evidence to them was the only advice I could give. Nobody likes vote manipulators or brigaders (especially mods), but unfortunately, the admins have not felt the need to bestow upon mods any such tools to investigate them or to combat them.

       Hmm interesting - so DonTago is now changing what he clearly said in this post:

       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6ZKyJfk.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/6ZKyJfk.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where he explicitly states "none of
       <strong>
        those accounts
       </strong>
       " - but suddenly he just refers to "one" account...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh the backtracking...
      </p>
      <p>
       Its okay DonTago - I forwarded the Reddit Admins the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a hilarious day when I force a mod of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       to come crawling to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to make up lies about his excuses with obvious shill accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You messed up. You knew very well I posted more than one account, and you saw that NONE of them were suspicious - and I happened to screen cap it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That awkward moment when you realized you done goofed. You should be stripped of your mod status. You are not worthy to moderate a decent subreddit. No wonder your subreddit has been shilled to shit and you sit there as a blind bystander claiming no shilling exists, no shill accounts exists, and you have no power.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have power. You let those shill accounts post 24/7 on your garbage toilet paper quality subreddit.

       And btw, My name is not "Persian" you goofy ape. Its PersianPenisBox.

       Edit: also, that first modmail message of mine you quote above is ONLY you inquiring about 'brand new users' (you hadn't even mentioned specific accounts yet), and when I was saying none of those accounts were brand new users, I was referring explicitly to the users in that linked thread above. I hope that clears things up.

       Since you now have a chance to address the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community about the very topic of shilling - an issue we as a subreddit are most concerned with, even to the degree where we simply tell people to avoid your subreddit as a whole simply because the "opinions" are rather narrated by a select few, why don't you take this opportunity to explain to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       the very initiatives you are taking on that subreddit to rectify what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one: Do you even believe in shills or is that some craaaazy conspiracy theory to you? If not, why not. If so, what steps are you taking. And do not say "we don't have power" - that is simply saying you aren't doing anything. What steps are you taking within your power to ensure that vote manipulation DOES NOT happen, even though there is significant literature pointing to the opposite - even from mainstream sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for creative solutions, I suggested to a mod a few weeks ago that
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       make a sticky describing the idea of vote brigating, what it is, and links pointing to how you can find it and what steps can be taken. Alas, nothing was even considered. It was a creative solution to a problem that you may/may not believe in, but the problem won't go away simply because you're only a lowly little mod and not a real admin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Address
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about shilling. Maybe, just maybe, you're not equipped to be a proper mod. It would take a big man to admit that, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my stance, I should not have expected much honestly. You mods there have what appears to be a templated response to any vote manipulation accusation with literal zero fucks to give about the dignity of your own subreddit.

       to have to ask for permission. So I will exercise my right to deny YOU of something. When you stop denying users who request answers from mods about their standards for stopping shilling, you can expect to get dialog from us.

       We have sufficient evidence as well as your PM's of mod mails already posted. You can keep your supposed specificities and how they contradict any of the accounts being posted as fraudulent to yourself. Nobody here is taking what you have to say seriously, anyway. Its pathetic when a moderator has to cross post in hopes of 'clearing his name' no?

       Between the two of you, you are the only one not extensively posting links to anything. They've posted multiple links, and you have posted none. If you think you've ended up coming off as the one who seems more credible, then you're sadly not able to admit some obvious truths about reality.

       The user was demonstrating how stupid it is when your methodology for claiming people are paid government agents is nothing more than finding people who disagree with you and then finding ways to confirm your delusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your posts you haven't demonstrated any positive proof that a single user, (including Bipolar) is a shill. You pick people with a different view then dig through their comment history until you find an excuse. The fact that you are so incredulous when someone decides to fuck with you and apply the same method on your comment history is hilarious.
