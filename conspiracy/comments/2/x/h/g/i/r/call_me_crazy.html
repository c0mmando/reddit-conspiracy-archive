       So the guardian came out with this article on the 24 Feb 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site">
        http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It made the front page of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after the news came out, social media explodes with pictures of some dress. News agencies like Fox and CNN report about the dress as if it's major news. Maybe I missed it, but has any large American news network even touched the Chicago story?

       You're not allowed to call me crazy! lol!  Yeah, a trigger associated with some sort of mind control technology.  To do what? I don't know.  What kind of tech? I don't know. However, what I do know, is the news casts (any network) are FULL of hypnotic circles rotating within half circles inside of rotating circles, and countdowns, that's all hypnotic mind control tech.  And please remember, that's just a passing thought, I have only dedicated as much time to it as it took to type this message.

       It was multiple things: an advertisement for a dress, a distraction from real stories (Chicago police, net neutrality), a coverup (by flooding social media), and a divide-and-conquer event. All you saw on social media was white/gold vs black/blue.

       Social media explodes with random irrelevant crap on an almost clockwork basis.  It is usually as organic as fashion trends or shitty "musicians" getting popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government does so much fucked up shit that one thing or another is constantly being revealed.  It only makes sense that the two regularly overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think that people would be significantly distracted from real news by a stupid gimmicky meme?  Do you really think that the few people that were measurably distracted by it are the people who would pay any attention to the Chicago news anyway?  No and no.
      </p>
      <p>
       But downvote away, because for two years or more, most people in this sub have been sure that anything that becomes popular
       <em>
        must

       be a manufactured distraction from [insert government malfeasance here].

       So let's assume it was some kind of experiment. What was the visible results?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Division. Accordingly to the Media, the people were violently arguing about the dress color. Couples broke up, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Doubt. You can't trust your eyes no more. Everything is a mind trick. After the event the same media that spread the dress meme, started to post optic illusions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Control of the talk over the internet. Suddenly EVERYONE was talking about it. It could be a way of silence other subject (the Chicago black site?) or a study on how effective the intelligence could be in infiltrate any subject into people conversation.

       like what FB did? what's

       we have to ask ourselves, why are silly distractions deliberately 'headlined' in the "news", especially right after the debate about online security, the black site in Chicago, the measles etc.,
      </p>
      <p>
       it sure doesn't take much to divert attention.

       i feel the same way at times; then i remember what my Grandfather used to say: some people have to be smacked with a 2 by 4 to realize the truth,
      </p>
      <p>
       when those that don't
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       or refuse to see are confronted with what's real, they will either breakdown or accept it, should it come to that, it's important that people be aware, it's happening now, some people display inappropriate anger/violence, like road rage, (seems to come out of nowhere),
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know if it's because they've always had a mental issue or not, best to be safe than sorry, if shtf, just be careful.

       I think you are probably correct. They are experimenting on how easy it is to distract the population. People arguing with each other, people saying "I can't trust my eyes", etc etc. Seems like the perfect psy-ops.

       this dress comes in more than one color, i've seen: white &amp; gold, black &amp; blue, black &amp; red
      </p>
      <p>
       "Roman Originals began selling the dress in November 2014. It currently
       <strong>
        comes in four different colors
       </strong>
       , pink/black, red/black, white/black, black/blue, although the company is now considering selling the dress in white and gold. "

       I found the dress to be mildly amusing. Just like tons of other content I look at every day. But it became a "thing", and I noticed that, so I decided to share it so that other people I knew could be in on "the thing". People like feeling included.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's inoffensive content. It's something you can share with anyone. It doesn't require the person you're sending it to to have any background knowledge for it to be relevant to them. The "trick" with the dress is something people can verify first hand. If I told you, "There's a picture of a dress, and sometimes people see it as black and blue, and sometimes people see it as gold and white," would you believe me? Would we have to go into deep discussions about color theory and the like, as you'd need evidence that this might be true? Why should you have to believe me or why should I have to argue with you, I can just show you the picture. Without the picture, it's just like any other story where you're relying on someone else to both know what they're talking about and be honest with you. But what color the picture of the dress is is something you can verify with a simple imaging program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacksite torture? Well, I assume it's true, I'm pretty cynical about the government and what it's capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, the dress went everywhere. Some things just happen to strike a chord in people. It's nice to know that people's attention can all unite around something, even if it's not something important.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works for important things, too. Like Ebola-Chan.

       It came out a couple days before the dress story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was never covered by the news in the U.S. media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was willful compliance to not mention it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the worldnews subreddit the anti Russia/Putin narrative continues. People say the Russian media is state run and that America is way different and is completely reputable. LOL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the mainstream U.S. news is talking about cold weather in winter and dress colors.. It amazes me people can't see through this shit and demand more from the media. Ridiculous!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Who could forget the llama story that got mainstream media, prime time news coverage, over the Chicago black site story... this is why people call people sheep

       I don't think there's any "falling for it", I legitimately thought it was white and gold at first, then saw it edited next to a couple other pictures and it switched to black and blue permanently in my brain.

       It's Chicago so I'm not surprised. New York, LA, Dallas-Fort Worth, and a few more cities have them as well.

       What I'm curious to know, is what type of people go there. The article mentions that a protester, part of the "Nato Three", was kep there, but other than that, it only mentions that they're usually poor and black. It's being suggested that political reasons are behind it, but I could see people like child killers and molesters, other murderers, and rapists being held there. I just find it interesting that there's no mention of what type of crimes resulted in staying at Homan Square. Is it intentional? Or do they just not know?

       I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. The story about the black site in Chicago doesn't have any solid proof. At this point, it's just people saying it's there. I don't doubt that it's there, but there needs to be evidence that it's there for news agencies to start covering it.

       If they're outed they should face outright termination for that alone. People have compared the cops to gangs for years, and now they're hiding their faces and running pure intimidation tactics on journalists?

       Looks like it's not a comparison anymore, it's a fact.
