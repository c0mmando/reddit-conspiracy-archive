    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m involved in the highest levels of the industry.  This doesn&#39;t happen.  People tend to think that every oil refinery is owned by a company that pump/produce crude oil.  That&#39;s not the case at all.  Refiner&#39;s profit isn&#39;t all that dependent on crude oil prices.  It&#39;s dependent on the &quot;crack spread&quot;, which is the difference in cost between a barrel of crude oil and what they can sell the refined products for.  Right now crack spreads are good, and competently run refiners are making good money.</p>

<p>Gas prices tend to go down in the winter.  This winter has been especially cold in a few different places with big refineries, for example Philadelphia.  In the Philadelphia refineries there were a few incidents directly caused by the freezing temperatures.  This caused them to have to shut down a few units and scale back production.  They&#39;re making less money because crack spreads are great for them right now and they can&#39;t run at full production.</p>

<p>The bigger factor is that there are big refinery strikes going on right now, which has cut about 15-20% of US production.</p>

<p>There are plenty of valid conspiracy theories about the oil industry, but this isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in different refineries regularly. I can say you are 100% correct. Gas prices do not have a ground level effect on the operations of a refinery. Safety in a refinery is drilled into your heads as the highest priority but isnt exactly true in every plant.  Between all the contracting companies in a plant and the operations staff themselves, there are a lot of people working and as in any industry, accidents happen. Especially during shutdowns or turn arounds where the amount of people in the plant is quadrupled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also just close them for maintenance or permanently.  Dave McGowan correctly predicted a huge price spike of well of 50% some years ago when he noted that production and reserves were abundant but that a lot of refineries were closing for repairs/upgrades that largely seemed unnecessary and that (I think it was) Exxon was closing a recently retrofitted Bakersfield plant that was making them nearly $1 billion/year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that legitimate refinery accidents are fairly common for obvious reasons but when coupled with odd market behavior one has to wonder.  Still, these companies are within their rights to close these facilities for no reason and then don&#39;t have to pay settlements to employees, their families and municipalities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bakersfield refinery that shutdown isn&#39;t owned by Exxon.  It is a ~66,000 barrel per day refinery which is small when compared to other refineries.  There&#39;s also NO WAY it was making $1 billion dollars a year.  The MOST profit it could really hope to make was about $100 million per year, but in reality it was losing money which is why they shut it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was actually a little over $100 million and a Shell property, this was 11 years ago, so you&#39;ll have to forgive me.  Given that it was making around $10,000,000 in <em>profit</em> every month, how was it  &quot;in reality losing money&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The $100 million I&#39;m talking about is the theoretical maximum a <em>perfectly</em> run 66,000 barrel per day refinery could hope to make, given <em>perfect</em> market conditions, no debt, 100% uptime and competent management.  Refiners just don&#39;t shut down refineries if they&#39;re making money.  For example, Sunoco owned a 335,000 barrel per day refinery in Philadelphia that was losing $2 million dollars per day.  They were going to shut it down since it was losing so much money, but a competent management team bought it from Sunoco and made their money back within a year.  Now they&#39;re making ~$150,000,000 per year income on the refinery on $10,000,000,000 revenue.  The point is that everyone assumes an oil refinery is a license to print money, but it&#39;s not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t assume anything that complex and capital intensive is a license to print money, but at the time this refinery was profitable well into the millions per month.</p>

<p>&quot;Aamir Farid, the general manager of the Bakersfield refinery, was asked the reason for the plan to reduce output at the time of peak demand. Farid claimed that he was not aware of any such plan, but he added that if there was such a plan, &quot;there is a good reason for it.&quot; However, he also added that, &quot;off the top of my head, I don&#39;t know what that good reason is.&quot;</p>

<p>And why would he? Certainly the manager of the refinery can&#39;t be expected to know why his facility is planning to dramatically reduce output, can he? The best explanation that Farid could come up with was to speculate that there &quot;could be maintenance planned or projections for a shortfall of crude.&quot; Neither of those scenarios are very plausible, however.</p>

<p>Bakersfield, whose suburbs include Oildale and Oil Junction, won&#39;t likely be facing a shortfall of crude anytime soon. And as for the notion of planned maintenance, I doubt that anyone actually believes that Shell plans to perform two months worth of maintenance work on a facility that will be permanently shuttered just one month after that work is completed.</p>

<p>To be fair, I suppose it could be the case that Shell, being the benevolent giant that it is, wants to get the place in tip-top shape for the new owners -- except that there are no new owners, primarily because &quot;Shell didn&#39;t search out potential buyers for the refinery once it decided to shutter it.&quot; Indeed, Shell actively avoided finding a buyer for the plant (which became a fully-owned Shell asset just three short years ago [before]), since any new owner would probably object to the bulldozers and wrecking balls that Shell plans to bring in just as soon as the refinery&#39;s doors have closed. (&quot;FTCR uncovered a timetable showing decommissioning and demolition are set to begin immediately after the refinery&#39;s shut down date.&quot; <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=114-04062004)">http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=114-04062004)</a>&quot;</p>
