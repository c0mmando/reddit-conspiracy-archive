<p>The Final Jihad;
Martin Keating, brother of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, wrote a manuscript for The Final Jihad in 1991. This manuscript lays out a story of terrorists based in Oklahoma City who decide to bomb a federal building. One of the key terrorists in this fictional story goes by the name of &quot;Tom McVey&quot; and the terrorists are ultimately stopped by an Oklahoma highway patrolman for a broken tail light. On the day of the Oklahoma City Bombing, Timothy McVeigh was pulled over by an Oklahoma state trooper because of a missing license plate. Martin Keating struggled to get the manuscript published prior to the Oklahoma City Bombing, but on June 1, 1996 the 597-page manuscript was published under the title &quot;The Final Jihad.&quot; His seemingly prophetic novel also predicted the downing of a TWA 747 (which occurred on July 17, 1996) and an attack on the World Trade Center.</p>

<p>Little bit about brother Frank, in my opinion is the epitome of statist neo-con. He has been in nearly every branch of federal government, I&#39;m sure his brother had lots of hand written notes following every thanksgiving dinner. He now heads up the ABA for christ sakes. The top banker/the dark lord. lol </p>

<p>It sounds like he rewrote the book after the attack and added the OKC-related material to market it as a prediction rather than a generic thriller. Much like the guy who had the idea of making a movie about what if the 9/11 attacks were faked and he decided to call it a documentary at the last minute. The controversy sells better. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>True. Lazy ass that I am, I grabbed the first link I found that appeared to support my position. </p>

<p>I heard about this a few years ago and could find no good source for the date of the first publication of the book then or now. People who call it a prediction say it was published in 1991 or 1994. Others say it was published in 1996, a year after the bombing. That gives plenty of time to improve the marketability of the book, which seems a more likely probability than either the governor having a psychic brother or someone with knowledge of a conspiracy in which witnesses died (Terry Yeakey, Kenneth Trentadue, etc) being allowed to write a detailed book about it. In any case, none of the sources appear to be in a position to know the truth.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, a reviewer on Amazon &quot;modestproposal&quot; says that the bombing in the book originally took place in Chicago and the location was changed to OKC after the real-life attack. This information is not sourced any further.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard of this, in school. We were talking conspiracies during History, and my teacher mentioned this. She said that the original was an attack on Chicago, and not OKC. I&#39;d never heard of this before, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he changed stuff around following the bombing. People have done it before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say that this could easily be faked. Unless if someone finds a physical source from twenty-ish years ago, I&#39;m going to go with a neutral path. It appears to be a very good piece of analysis, but if he actually predicted this stuff, that&#39;s unlikely. Even Tom Clancy couldn&#39;t pull it off.</p>
