<p>both google and duck duck go track your usage, startpage does not. </p>

<p>copy any link from a search result on startpage and you only get the URL of where the link will take you.</p>

<p>start typing letters into the search field on either google or duck duck go and watch your router&#39;s activity light blink with each keystroke - startpage doesn&#39;t blink at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: To the DDG fanboys who keep trying to get me to give DDG a break. Please stop. Convince someone else. I advocate startpage at present, because it does nothing but send your search request to Google on your behalf, and then gives the results back to you - it contains automatic porn filters and stuff to make your results more relevant (which you can change quite quickly and easily if you want to search for that content). The points I&#39;ve made in this comment are valid on their own merit. My point here is that if Google starts &quot;ministering truth&quot; with their search results, I&#39;d like startpage to route through DDG. In its own way, it is a tribute to DDG, not an attack upon them. Lighten up with the defensiveness, please.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not true. If your system is clean, your router light indicates activity. In the case of typing letters into the search field, it&#39;s quite obviously auto-complete, because the result is the associated drop-down menu of possible searches (they make the front-page of reddit 3-4 times a week). This doesn&#39;t require Wireshark and it&#39;s not brain surgery or rocket science. And, Wireshark will <strong>not</strong> tell you what duckduckgo or google do with the end result of your typing, so it&#39;s useless and irrelevant to the assertions I&#39;ve made here. You may be familiar with the tools available to the ignorant, but that doesn&#39;t make you smart.</p>

<p>You are correct that we cannot know what our data is being used for on the search servers, but this is true of any service, even if it does not attempt to be smart with search auto completes or search suggestions. </p>

<p>I made no further claims. Yet, you continually imply that I have.  </p>

<p>DDG admits to some amount of usage tracking to establish popularity/relevance in it&#39;s search results - although it may not be as personalized as what google does - I neither know nor care at this point. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand what startpage does. Startpage isn&#39;t a search engine. It&#39;s more like a search proxy to google. Which is why I made the VERY FIRST STATEMENT I made.

    <div class="md"><p>Here, in the E.U.S.S.R, HUGE government subsidies are being ploughed into renewables. Apart from the middle-classes who can afford their heavily subsidised solar panels, to earn heavily subsidised tariffs, the biggest beneficiaries are the energy and engineering companies (DONG, Eon, Siemens etc). 
These companies are often getting deals in which they don&#39;t have to pay tax, while receiving tax-funded investment and netting all of the profits. Any money that they do invest is largely protected, with government guaranteed prices on &#39;green energy&#39;.</p>

<p>Through my work, I have met many engineers that are working on wind farms. Many are skeptical of the efficiency of the technology, but the industry seems to afforded them all a new Mercedes or BMW. Once in a while there&#39;ll be a renegade in an Audi, but.. well maybe I&#39;m just jealous.</p>

<p>Even the oil companies are going green these days.
I&#39;m lucky enough to live within 2 miles of a BP chemical refinery. They send leaflets periodically, to update us on how safe the pollution is, and how they are most definitely a forward thinking, green company. It&#39;s quite convenient, as their logo stays the same colour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iv got no skin in this game, but I can help you understand the argument. The solution to global warming is a more powerful government. To reduce carbon output the government needs the ability to regulate carbon output. This is a tremendous amount of power over business, basically akin to deciding who gets to do business and who doesn&#39;t. To the oligarchy that controles the US government this is a way to prevent competition from springing up.</p>

<p>Why does the government push the idea of terrorism? To justify more power. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s follow the reasoning here:</p>

<p>A team at Google creates an improved method of scoring websites based on the accuracy of information contained therein that&#39;s noteworthy for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s less susceptible to errors because it is more capable of recognizing the difference between erroneous extractions like (elephant, weight, Curtis LeMay) and actual incorrect information like (elephant, weight, 3 ounces).</p></li>
<li><p>It gives a better picture of a page&#39;s credibility when KV is unable to extract many triples by treating its score as a function of the credibility analysis applied to the set of triples from multiple pages on that site.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(the whole paper is actually pretty interesting and really quite easy to understand; if you know what summations and products are and have some basic set theory + probability, you&#39;ll be fine)</p>

<p>This is obviously useful for Google even if you don&#39;t assume they have any nefarious intent: if they want to be able to accurately answer questions like &quot;who is Joe Biden&quot;, they don&#39;t want to pull information from The Onion just because it has a high pagerank, nor do they want to ignore information from sites that have low pagerank.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all kinda cool and interesting, and although I&#39;m not a conspiracy person (just browsing for entertainment), I can see how it&#39;d be fun to discuss (if I were doing it nefariously, though, I certainly wouldn&#39;t publish a paper on it!). That said...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The article&#39;s tagline is &quot;The trustworthiness of a web page might help it rise up Google&#39;s rankings if the search giant starts to measure quality by facts, not just links&quot;, which is fairly reasonable; nowhere in the paper do they say that they&#39;re actually using this, but it makes sense that they might want to at some point.</p></li>
<li><p>The article&#39;s <em>headline</em> is &quot;Google wants to rank websites based on facts not links&quot;, which they appear to have made up wholesale without even thinking about it (why would Google throw out their entire search algorithm because they invented an improvement to Knowledge Vault, which is just a source of information that serves as one of many factors that go into rankings?), much less fact-checking it: <em>nothing</em> in any of their sources makes that claim.</p></li>
<li><p>You, in keeping with the spirit of the headline writer, tack on an extra bit in your title to announce that they&#39;ve already modified their algorithm when nothing you linked supports this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m kinda surprised the mods of this subreddit allow ultra-low-effort linkbait posts like this when it would take <em>a single minute</em> of skimming the article and paper to go from wild sensationalism to something much more conducive to real discussion. Why not &quot;A proposed improvement to Google&#39;s Knowledge Vault could be used to make websites it deems less-trustworthy less likely to be used as the source for KV queries&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good reply. Not only is the article that was published more link bait than anything, it&#39;s also incorrect. Google actually uses over 200 different factors to rank a page - not just links. I highly, highly doubt that Google will overhaul their current model. They might add something like this in, but it won&#39;t be such a defining factor that the other 200 factors are irrelevant. </p>

<p>And, Google has tested algorithms before that didn&#39;t use links as quality signals. They failed in comparison to the current model. Although that model is still flawed (And Google are a bunch of wankers), it&#39;s the best they&#39;ve come up with so far. </p>

<p>This won&#39;t change the algorithm as much as people think it will. It&#39;s more sensationalism than anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. </p>

<p>Well, the thing I mention most with Google is the fact that their algorithm updates unfairly cause small businesses to fail without a reasonable cause. These businesses usually just get all caught up in the algorithm and smashed in the rankings. So these businesses will have to spend tons of cash just trying to get out of a penalty. This is my biggest gripe with them. They hand out penalties and your only real recourse until you get out is to spend money on their AdWords platform and try to get back into Google&#39;s good graces.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, it has unfair advantages in the marketplace. It&#39;s 80/20 or so in Google&#39;s favor, and that creates a lot of problems for smaller search engines like DuckDuckGo and even Bing/Yahoo.</p>

<p>Of course, they are at the center of this whole NSA thing that&#39;s been happening. I don&#39;t think they do enough to combat how the American gov&#39;t grabs search info. They say that they fight as much as they can, but I think that&#39;s more a marketing gimmick than an actual strategy. </p>

<p>And some people might think about saving searches, but I can understand from a business perspective that Google wants to use this information for marketing. Businesses do this every day. all over the world. The crappy part is when they reveal that information to people that shouldn&#39;t have it without due process. But I love DuckDuckGo for this. </p>

<p>And they&#39;ve grabbed up companies like Boston Dynamics, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something there. But that&#39;s conjecture... </p>

<p>At some point during this process, there was a sit-down, casual sort of thing where they&#39;d ask seemingly innocuous questions (hobbies, interests, blah blah blah). During this &quot;session&quot;, they asked him &quot;What&#39;s the coolest thing you&#39;ve ever seen on the internet that we might not be aware of?&quot; </p>

<p>The responses to this question (among all new employees) are sorted, studied, etc. and anywhere from 1-20% of them get further pursuit. If they find anything really novel or interesting, they develop their own &quot;clean room&quot; version of it as fast as they can with dozens of programmers working on it. </p>

<p>This allows them to steal ideas (IP) without giving credit or paying a dime to the person who thought it up, further adding to their overall arsenal of &quot;features&quot; that are part of &quot;what it means to be Google&quot;. </p>

<p>They threw &quot;Don&#39;t Be Evil&quot; out the window seconds after they agreed to have it as an unofficial motto.</p>

<p>I actually think, from a Google ranking standpoint, that having facts won&#39;t help you even if the algorithm is updated to include this new factor.  Rather, I think that pages with bad facts, specifically ones that contradict the small percentage of high confidence facts in the KV, will be pushed down.

    <div class="md"><p>Shock horror! You mean to tell me the fact I can&#39;t just blindly believe whatever I read on the internet is actually a problem that needs fixing!</p>

<p>Using vaccination as an example for why we need to rank websites according to truthfulness is a pretty underhanded move to get people siding with google. It would make a <em>lot</em> more sense to teach people how to be critical thinkers when it comes to what they are reading rather than spoonfeeding it to them in a way that makes them think they don&#39;t need to fact check. This is a <strong>majorly</strong> fucked up idea.</p>

They might add something like this in, but it won&#39;t be such a defining factor that the other 200 factors are irrelevant. </p>

<p>And, Google has tested algorithms before that didn&#39;t use links as quality signals. They failed in comparison to the current model. Although that model is still flawed (And Google are a bunch of wankers), it&#39;s the best they&#39;ve come up with so far. </p>

<p>This won&#39;t change the algorithm as much as people think it will. It&#39;s more sensationalism than anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see startpage route from duck duck go, instead of google.</p>

<p>both google and duck duck go track your usage, startpage does not. </p>

<p>copy any link from a search result on startpage and you only get the URL of where the link will take you.</p>

<p>start typing letters into the search field on either google or duck duck go and watch your router&#39;s activity light blink with each keystroke - startpage doesn&#39;t blink at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: To the DDG fanboys who keep trying to get me to give DDG a break. Please stop. Convince someone else. I advocate startpage at present, because it does nothing but send your search request to Google on your behalf, and then gives the results back to you - it contains automatic porn filters and stuff to make your results more relevant (which you can change quite quickly and easily if you want to search for that content). The points I&#39;ve made in this comment are valid on their own merit. My point here is that if Google starts &quot;ministering truth&quot; with their search results, I&#39;d like startpage to route through DDG. In its own way, it is a tribute to DDG, not an attack upon them. Lighten up with the defensiveness, please.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Your router light doesn&#39;t indicate anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. If your system is clean, your router light indicates activity. In the case of typing letters into the search field, it&#39;s quite obviously auto-complete, because the result is the associated drop-down menu of possible searches (they make the front-page of reddit 3-4 times a week). This doesn&#39;t require Wireshark and it&#39;s not brain surgery or rocket science. And, Wireshark will <strong>not</strong> tell you what duckduckgo or google do with the end result of your typing, so it&#39;s useless and irrelevant to the assertions I&#39;ve made here. You may be familiar with the tools available to the ignorant, but that doesn&#39;t make you smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is getting a lot of attention in SEO circles, and I decided to write my first article on it.  I was searching for other&#39;s opinions on it, and found yours.  Thanks for the link to the PDF!  It&#39;s a good one!  I may need to amend my article based on the information in the PDF, since I based mine on other web results.</p>

<p>I actually think, from a Google ranking standpoint, that having facts won&#39;t help you even if the algorithm is updated to include this new factor.  Rather, I think that pages with bad facts, specifically ones that contradict the small percentage of high confidence facts in the KV, will be pushed down.  My full thoughts are here, as there are a lot of them: <a href="http://www.seosciencelab.com/googles-new-truth-algorithm-is-frequently-misunderstood/">http://www.seosciencelab.com/googles-new-truth-algorithm-is-frequently-misunderstood/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s always interesting to hear thoughts on something like this from outside of the SEO world.  I enjoyed reading your thoughts.</p>
