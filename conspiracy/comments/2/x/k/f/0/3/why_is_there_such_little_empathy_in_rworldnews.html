       A militia is the natural response to oppression, stop the oppression and you'll guarantee peace, only through Israels continued illegal expansion will you continue the war. Israel is the more developed country granted but they sure as hell are not the bigger people in the situation in Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the people who are going to scream anti-semite I leave you with this: why can the jews have a Jewish state, the Christians have theirs so why can't Islam have theirs? It's not because they're religious beliefs conflict with the western ideology of capitalism, debt and interest is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       My Muslim friends (yes you can have them) give the interest they earn each year to charity, why? Because they don't believe in interest, that is the difference between the Jewish and Muslims one wants you to pay them interest the other doesn't and would only give it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your allies close and your enemies closer, hit it on the head there Israel

       Down vote this, it's what I expect. JIDF are a go; we are but goyim to them.

       I'd be careful labeling it Jewish control. We can get away with it here but it should really be referred to as a Zionist agenda. Dehumanizing the Palestinians and the glaring overuse of the anti-Semite card are very old tactics of the Zionist organization. Because not all Jews are Zionists, but virtually all Zionist are Jews.

       Half my family falls under this category. I try to explain it to them, but it goes over their heads. They've been taught, Israel is good and everyone else is bad. They fail to read their bibles though. When you realize that the tribe of Judah were all black some of the things mentioned in the book of Revelations start to Make sense. Like Rev 2:9 for example. Read it and weep all you zionist. You were marked a LONG time ago.

       Well, I think it's mainly due to the fact that reddit is mostly frequented by those in the 18-25 age group, and for as long as they could remember Muslims have been made out to be the enemy of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add that to the whole Holocaust being shoved down the throat of every school child in history class each year, and you have a huge group of people who are sympathetic with the Israeli people, and borderline hatred towards the Muslims who are at odds with them.

       Most of the people I know are Protestant Christians (including myself) and yet they think all Muslims are horrible terrorists. I remember being taught to love and care for all others as if they were all my closest neighbours, and I do. I try my hardest, even with the ones that name names and disrupt my education, and yet I fail to realise why everyone hates Muslims so much. Every Muslim I've met so far had almost identical morals to me, followed a similar religion than me, and actually had a heritage that was located much closer to the holy lands than me (I've got dutch/boer heritage). All in all Muslims are very nice people, and are actually open to see the world through other peoples eyes, unlike most westerners. Muslims have faced horrible living conditions simply because of America's anti Muslim propergander. I don't think this is right, and yet like most; I can't simply do a thing to stop it.

       Just a thought but perhaps its because any criticism of Israel is considered anti-Semitic.  Next thing you know people are comparing you to Hitler.  Who wants that.

       I've asked why nobody cares about the Palestinians in many, many subreddits that were filled with people discussing how horrible the holocaust was. The holocaust is over now, it's irrelevant; just get on with your life. Also If you're busy complaining about how horrible the holocaust was for Jews and how it still affects them today, then why are they committing similar war crimes daily against their smaller, Muslim neighbors.

       For the same reason people had so little empathy for jews in WWII. Because the establishment's propaganda tells them they're dangerous/undesirables. That is why.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not hard to understand(unless you're a moronic neo-nazi idiot who thinks the jews run everything and secretly run the earth - then this analogy is hard for you to comprehend because you are stupid as pigshit).

       Ok, I said that because there is a presence in this sub known by regular conspirators that manipulates it, this was done to try and negate their presence because it's not something they're going to down vote because it would only give me proof. I'm not pointing the finger, just covering all bases.

       If you know that people will use these types of words against you, why write them?  I'm failing to understand the logic, you're well aware there is a "presence in this sub" that will manipulate what you're saying, so why create such invective about the difference between Jews and
       <del>
        Christians
       </del>
       Muslims?  It's playing right into those people's hands, don't you think?

       Additionally, a rational observer will tend to look more critically at your behavior if you're going to make these kinds of statements about others.  You're setting yourself up for failure.  Or, you're preaching to the choir.

       Because it is the sickening truth about the war in Gaza, I didn't really compare the Jewish and Christians, just saying if one religious group can have a state why can't another of equal or greater size have their own? Vatican, Israel so why not an Islamic holy country or city?

       I'm merely asking questions and poking holes in the accepted narrative whilst instead of questioning Hamas' actions, I'm looking for the psychological reasons as to why they would do such things and the answer isn't a surprising one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is the same as this: The Jewish during the second world war revolted because they were being oppressed, the Palestinian's are merely doing the same

       You're not "merely" doing that, right?  You know that.  That's why you caveated your post with an acknowledgement that you'll be downvoted.  You're being remarkably polemic.  You can't write things like "the difference between the Jewish and Muslims one wants you to pay them interest the other doesn't and would only give it away" and then backtrack and act like you're "just asking questions."

       I was acknowledging that I was going to be Downvoted because I am going against the accepted narrative. I was stating that difference because it is the truth, not because it's my opinion or for the hell of it, because it is the truth nothing else.

       Think of it like this: if you were a Jewish person, and someone wrote what you had written about Jewish people, even if you have no opinions about Palestine and Israel, you could see how charged and borderline insulting some of your statements are.

      <p>
       This society hurts; because for someone who views everyone indifferently and completely equal, every death in the pursuit of material gain is a complete and utter waste. Looked at from the perspective of a more advanced sentient being having stumbled upon earth our global society is feudalistic in nature and so utterly destructive it has no rightful place in the ecosystem of the planet; we are essentially an invasive species, a parasite, no better than a cancerous tumour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most terrible terrible truth is that we are a sentient tumour which knows what's it's doing and has the choice to do otherwise; we know the last thing left for us is changing the entire thing but we're all so scared we're gonna have less afterwards than we do now so nothing is done.

       Ok, I guess I can't appeal to your empathy, so, I'll try a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep using the "truth" but, I feel like there exists some lateral interpretations to your statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the difference between Jews and Muslims, I'll use the fact that it's absurd to claim that Jewish people don't donate huge amounts of money.  It's as equally absurd to believe that your small cross-section of Islamic friends represent all Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it's not like banks in the middle east that practice Sharia Banking are entirely non profit and altruistic in nature.  They make money off investments and trading like any other banking institution, they just can't charge interest on loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your assertion that Palestine is the only Islamic state in the world is flawed.  Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, these are all, in name, Islamic republics.  While you use "truth" as your shield, it should be obvious there can be, at the very least, differing interpretations.

       They don't but they are from many places around the world so it's worth something.

       Ahhh but that fact alone if it were applied to our banking system in West would benefit the majority of the population; if applied to countries...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never stated palestine is the only Islamic state; it would be incredibly ignorant to say they are, not just because of the countries you've mentioned, but because you need to aknowledge the non-muslim inhabitants. Regardless though, they are not a recognised state.

       I have seen very little agreement with Israel's actions on r/worldnews and a lot of sympathy for Palestine, in the past six months or so. Anecdotal for sure, but so is your claim, unless you have any data to back it up? I'd be curious to know.

       R/worldnews condemns Hamas as if they are ISIS regardless of their actual origins or what they stand for; also the now accepted belief Hamas is terrorist organisation when it is a political party before anything, yes they have an armed decision but what modern democracy doesn't?

       Most of the people I know are Protestant Christians (including myself) and yet they think all Muslims are horrible terrorists. I remember being taught to love and care for all others as if they were all my closest neighbours, and I do. I try my hardest, even with the ones that name names and disrupt my education, and yet I fail to realise why everyone hates Muslims so much. Every Muslim I've met so far had almost identical morals to me, followed a similar religion than me, and actually had a heritage that was located much closer to the holy lands than me (I've got dutch/boer heritage). All in all Muslims are very nice people, and are actually open to see the world through other peoples eyes, unlike most westerners. Muslims have faced horrible living conditions simply because of America's anti Muslim propergander. I don't think this is right, and yet like most; I can't simply do a thing to stop it.

       Idgaf about the Holocaust and the "war on terror" is meaningless in terms of a political perspective.

       I just have no sympathy for any muslims or kebab of any kind. I've witnessed sweden go fucking 3rd world status in my local communities bc of Palestinian/syrian/somalian/Iraqi "refugees"
