       Putin waits 8 years to kill this guy, now at the points where he is on an extremely high approval rating? I just don't buy that it's not even looking like an accident. In central moscow? Less than 4 minutes walk-time from the damn Kremlin?

       The truth is I doubt any of us will ever really know - so it's silly to jump to conclusions at this point, because that would make our assertions no better than the "Putin did it" crowd. Only our hypothesis conforms to our worldview, and theirs to theirs.

       Agreed, but on a "balance of probabilities" scale, I would say it this particular hit was unlikely to have been ordered by Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Putin has no qualms about eliminating those he deems "traitors", be they journalists whose investigations threaten him (Politkovskaya) or FSB agents who defect to MI6 (Litvinenko). But this clumsy, very public mafia-style hit on a political opponent is too blatant, too obviously going to be blamed on him (by the Western media). For me this is another MH17 scenario - a crime committed by western intelligence agencies to be pinned on Putin.

       I'm pretty sure the Litvinenko hit was very clumsy, very public. If it was Putin, then it can be assumed he would do the same with Nemstov, since he's already shown he doesn't care about being covert. And since Nemstov is in his home turf, it could very well be that if Putin ordered it, he didn't care about how obvious it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that agencies like CIA and Mossad have done a lot of dark things in the past, but considering events right now, I just don't see any reason that they would take out Nemstov.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, consider this. It's Putin's home turf, where he controls the media. He doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks of him and Russia, as long as they're scared. This means he could just spin the assassination whatever way he wanted at home, putting the blame elsewhere.

       Dropping polonium into the target's tea in a swanky hotel might have been in plain sight, but it wasn't clumsy. It took some inspired detective work to determine that this was what happened. I don't think there are any previously recorded assassinations using polonium, so the FSB agents, Lugovoy and Kovtun reasonably assumed that their modus operandi would not be discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a judgment call. If you know that the CIA and Mossad are inordinately fond of false flag type interventions in which innocents get murdered, then they are the joint prime suspects. Other intelligence agencies (French DGSE, Mi6/SIS) tend to have stricter internal guidelines - but still possibles. Putin/FSB are obviously on the suspects list, because they have previous, and can't be ruled out, but I still think it very unlikely.

Everything is ISIS, Iran, China and Russia and how they are all ready to kill us innocents at any mushroom-cloud moment. Conditioning 101.

       My gut feeling is that CIA had a hand in it, though I wouldn't be surprised if it were just some ultra nationalists who didn't like the guy and shot him. Either way Putin wasn't involved in the hit.

       Shot four times in the back by someone in a passing car, left for all to see. Sounds like a mob hit to me. If they wanted it done clandestinely he could have just been kidnapped or his car or residence wired to blow up. It was meant to be seen, and given the situation between the USA and Russia right now (my opinion) its not much of a stretch for the USA to do this in order to further defame Russia. Remember, we should all be afraid of the Ruskies! Red Dawn! OMG.....

       Obviously we have no evidence one way or the other, but for people on here to just dismiss Putin as a possibility when he clearly has something to gain by installing fear into opponents just shows how ingrained people are with their anti-US narrative.  They look at Putin and think he's a good guy because he opposes the U.S. whereas in reality he is just as fucked up as those in the U.S. Government.

       Yeah because the country under his leadership doesn't have numerous examples of the same thing happening to other dissenters.

       political system and this doesn't excuse the "West." This might not be Putin, but randomly calling it some Western attack to make Putin look bad is just as presumptuous as saying it was Putin. Nemstov recently was terrified he was going to be murdered. Was he a part of the conspiracy too?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unlikely that there will be a transparent, impartial investigation. There hasn't been any precedent in similar affairs in Russia in the past. There has been precedent for extrajudicial and judicial crackdowns on dissenters of the status quo that Putin and his associates.

       Why I think this case smells funny is the instant and massive reaction of the controlled media to use the event for another propaganda attack, even on a weekend. That looks like a certain organization wants to push this and not like some natural reaction to me.

       It is an extremely significant event in a politically volatile nation, and the response is huge in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before, there is a significant precedent for this kind of thing happening with ties to the Kremlin. Yes, it is in the Wests interest, but that is not in itself evidence of their complicity. Unfortunately innocent until proven guilty isn't a reality. People are naturally going to suspect the organization is part of a corrupted oligarchy in the country and with the past precedent to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one way that they could vindicate themselves in the eyes of their critics would be to have an independent and transparent investigation into the incident. It is unlikely this will happen and even more unlikely that a positive suspect would be identified.

       This isn't about if Putin is ruthless enough to get rid of people who are dangerous to his position or worse, the national/system goals. Sure he is but he wouldn't be in the position he is in for 2 decades if he couldn't play the game. Putin is smart and not arrogant. He knows the media message of any move he does and we've seen how careful he handles the Ukraine situation vs. how the West wants him to act, aka direct War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime there is an instant massive media response with direct finger pointing you can bet on an organized effort by the P2B based on an agenda. Cause&amp;Effect. It's just too blatant. That was my argument.

       Trying to get the western public to think of his as a bogeyman. Wouldnt surprise me if it was the work of the CIA/MI5 etc. You know they're trying to get putin to back down cause he's getting in the way of the Western Empire trying to control the world's resources so they can remain in power.
      </p>

       If they cant get him to back down they'll try to take him down. They're already stirring stuff up in Ukraine or putting sanctions against him.

       Agree.   Not a Putin chess move.   I hate to say it,  but this is more like something the west would engineer.   Lately,  the west has been happy to create failed states where ever it can,  Libya,  Iraq,  Syria,  and if we could Iran.   It fits in with the current groupthink.   And its not incompatible with the long term energy strategies of the key Fortune 500 players and their political stooges.

       My guess is that they will immediately find the killer, and uncover that he is an "extremist" or "terrorist" that has nothing to do with Putin.  He will be found guilty in a swift trial and get the death penalty, or the equivalent of  the Russian Witness Protection program and a ticket to France....

       I just hope they killed the assassin afterwards to hide it. I'm sick of these psychotic wet workers. Best to use them once or twice then send them in a backup helicopter into enemy territory after filing their flight plan with side-straddling mercenaries.

       Putin is too smart to do this, especially while everyone is watching him so closely. If he wanted to take out his opposition, he would have done it where no one would ever notice. Why would Putin kill him in broad daylight at basically the damn Kremlin?

       Underestimating the Russian mindset as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think ahead, you know this guy will become a thorn in your side and you know that at some point you're going to have to remove him.
So you say "at some point in the near future there will be a false flag of this nature perpetrated against me." Which Putin is on record as saying two years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then  when you need to you whack the guy, right on your doorstep.
Naturally everyone goes apeshit pointing the finger right at you, this is expected. Then you merely wait until cooler heads (such as those in this thread) start to say "well surely he wouldn't be stupid enough to whack the guy on his own doorstep, knowing full well everyone will blame him... besides he said two years ago a false flag of this nature would be perpetrated against him, I don't buy that he did it, but of course the west is jumping on this opportunity to blame him, it is just too convenient to be credible..."
      </p>
      <p>
       You are saying he wouldn't be stupid enough to do it on his own doorstep... I say he is SMART enough to do exactly that.

       Either way we will never know the real truth.. We all know Obama is fudging numbers who is to say Putin is not fudging his approval rating numbers? Remember everyone has a price or something that can be used to blackmail them. But that is just playing devil's advocate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont believe Putin would risk everything he has done in the last years by putting a hit out on this man.. I believe it was something else entirely. (what that other issue is that cause him to be gunned down no idea though) Putin is trying to get away from the Rothchilds family banking cartel. Thats why Nato is trying to ruin them because we are backed by this banking cartel.

       Agreed, but on a "balance of probabilities" scale, I would say it this particular hit was unlikely to have been ordered by Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Putin has no qualms about eliminating those he deems "traitors", be they journalists whose investigations threaten him (Politkovskaya) or FSB agents who defect to MI6 (Litvinenko). But this clumsy, very public mafia-style hit on a political opponent is too blatant, too obviously going to be blamed on him (by the Western media). For me this is another MH17 scenario - a crime committed by western intelligence agencies to be pinned on Putin.

       Well, let's go back to basics. Cui bono? Who benefits? Unless Putin is a living caricature of an evil mastermind, I don't see how gunning down a vocal opponent in broad daylight a mile from the Kremlin furthers his interests.

       Why I think this case smells funny is the instant and massive reaction of the controlled media to use the event for another propaganda attack, even on a weekend. That looks like a certain organization wants to push this and not like some natural reaction to me.

       sub is a laughing stock. People have lost any type of real critical thinking and revert straight to mossad this mossad that... Blizzard in New York obvious mossad operation, Abraham Lincoln assassination you say? Typical mossad.

       I'll not speak for others but believe that many in here would never
       <em>
        parrot
       </em>
       Putin is Pure!

      <p>
       Myself, I just don't see this as something Putin, nor his minions would have done and honestly they will figure out a way to
       <em>
        shape the narrative
       </em>
       as the NWO desires.

       Putin didn't lose any sleep over this assassination, anymore than American Presidents lose sleep when TPTB assassinate allied Dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       When TPTB take down Assad, all bets are off and Iran will be
       <em>
        naked

       We're all in the grinder, globally, while these Psychopaths Rule over these corrupt Leaders.

       You want an investigation of
       <em>
        thug life

       daylight hit in front of the Kremlin and we can't get answers to the Obvious of 9/11!
