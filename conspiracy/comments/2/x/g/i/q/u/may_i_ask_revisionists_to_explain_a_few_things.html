       So, I've seen it here more than a few times, that the number of 6 million Jews exterminated is inflated, that there couldn't possibly have been that many Jews in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe all the numbers were inflated? The other 4 million homosexuals, handicapped, Gypsies, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Hitler given any "credit" as being framed, or demonized? Or do revisionists agree that Hitler was on a race-cleansing, land-claiming spree? Was Hitler's spiritual and symbolic fascinations part of the conspiracy? Why did Hitler and the Nazis take and fake so many pieces of fine art?
      </p>
      <p>
       What part did the US play in the "popular narrative"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Hitler considered the worst man in history, while comparatively, Stalin was killing just as many people (if not 10x more!) before, during and after the same time period?
      </p>
      <p>
       For what agenda is the Holocaust used to conceal, or elicit sympathy? To protect Zionists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not asking to be "educated in the superiority/inferiority of any race", that's not my intention with this post and any comments that violate Rule 1 will be swiftly reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more interested in the theories of why such a grand conspiracy, which is replayed in our media, often on a daily basis, would need to occur. Who benefits and how is that related to our current geopolitical climate, seeing as though we're hitting the Crusades 2.0 now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance for mature and non-biased responses.

       I think the "six million/gas chambers/Hitler's orders" myth serves multiple purposes.  For the zionists, it's prophecy come true, and it serves as a tool that allows them to steal Palestine. For the allies, it exonerates them for Dresden, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, the Eisenhower death camps, and other atrocities.  And for anyone who wants to make an easy buck, all they have to do is add some hollywood-style imagination.

       Everyone agrees that propaganda occurs during times of war, and the lies we tell ourselves to mobilize and organize an entire to country to war seldom get recanted.
Combine this with a clear agenda in creating the state of Israel and Zionist control of central banks and that's the short answer

       I am nowhere near as knowledgable as the other revisionists on this board, but i'll give it a good shot. Also bear in mind that you're asking a lot of questions which I can only briefly cover. I'll leave the rest to the more capable revisionists.

      <p>
       Yes. And to encourage the establishment, settlement and financial support of Israel. The creation of Israel was largely conducted in response to the holocaust.

       My answers really don't do justice to revisionism, but I hope you find it helpful. Here's a much better place to start learning about revisionism:

       I think it's also very important to also discuss the events leading up to the war. I had a history teacher in sixth grade, the first Iraq war, who was teaching us about those events for a few days. That Thursday it stopped, we went back to the book to learn what was written in it, our questions were avoided, and that Friday we had an open book 5 question quiz graded on a curve so it was impossible to fail and we were allowed to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       After researching what I was taught, I found an ant colony worth of avenues in libraries and came to the conclusion that Hitler was trying to avoid the war, allowed murder of God people to avoid it, and was forced into it. Should he have kept going? Maybe not. Was he right? Everyone else was wrong should right and wrong be redefined? It was a bad situation that got out of control. After interviewing a Jewish man for a highschool history assignment who was at Buchenwald, I knew that it wasn't just the minor details that were wrong in the books, it was most of it. The Jews were worse to each other in the camps than the Germans ever were, and there were no death chambers according to him.

       The best way to try to understand these questions is to start to read some articles -- there is
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/articles">
        a large list here
       </a>
       at the
       <a href="/r/holocaust">
        /r/holocaust
       </a>
       wiki. In particular, I'd suggest you read:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/intent-funct">
          'Intentionalism vs Functionalism'
         </a>
         -- as there is no evidence of any orders, plans, budgets (etc), mainstream scholars disagree as to whether the Holocaust was planned or not.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/495/">
          The "Final Solution of the Jewish Question" - Extermination or Ethnic Cleansing?
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Edit: and perhaps
         <a href="http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2014/volume_6/number_3/the_great_holocaust_mystery.php">
          'The Great Holocaust Mystery'
         </a>
         , which offers a fairly comprehensive overview. (But as others have pointed out, not all revisionist researchers have reached the exact same conclusions.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Regarding [the theft of art], read
       <a href="http://barnesreview.org/pdf/TBR_2014_no6_6-11.pdf">
        (pdf) 'The Real Story of WWII’s ‘Monuments Men’'
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm not asking to be "educated in the superiority/inferiority of any race"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's kind-of a weird thing to say -- do you actually think people who understand the case for revisionist historical analyses about WWII and war crimes must therefore be racists? Or is this just what primarily comes to mind when you think about "Nazis"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly suggest you read Dr Gregor's short essay
       <a href="http://home.alphalink.com.au/%7Eradnat/gregor.html">
        'National Socialism and Race'
       </a>
       to understand what German racial theorists were actually saying about this subject, and how that evolved over time -- e.g. Dr Walter Gross, head of the Office of Racial Policy, in 1939:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We appreciate the fact that those of another race are different from us [...] Whether that other race is 'better' or 'worse' is not possible for us to judge. For this would demand that we transcend our own racial limitations for the duration of the verdict and take on a superhuman, even divine, attitude from which alone an 'impersonal' verdict could be formed on the value or lack of such of the many living forms of inexhaustible Nature."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The propaganda version of "Racist Evil Nazis" (which persists, still, after 70+ years) is a cynical caricature of the pre-1935 version of what was going on in racial thinking in Germany. In most ways, Germany was a less racist society than the US in the 1930's. (For example, consider the expulsion of 2m Mexicans during the 30's -- of which 1.2m were citizens -- or the treatment of black people -- Jessie Owens had favorable things to say about a comparable lack of racism in German society after his visit for the 1936 Olympics.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry I don't have time to make a more detailed answer. Ultimately, if you're serious, the only way to learn what the best revisionist researchers are saying is to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/books1">
        actually read their books

       Hitler is demonized because he fought the bank. He fought the Jews who run the bank. In 1933 international jewry declared war on Germany. He completely turned Germanys economy around. Hitler loved his people and wanted whats best for them. Hitler is one of the greatest men to ever live. He's a nationalist who loved his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews created a billion dollars a year industry while they milk sympathy of the holocaust. It's the greatest lie ever told. The red Cross said that the Jews were well taken care of in the camps. To demonize a man because he went against the bank and kicked out the usurers and communists. In the end though, as we know, communism won. Hitler is demonized for the way he turned around the German economy. The people will learn the truth one day of how great of a man Hitler was. One of the greatest men to ever live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler didn't believe in a superior race. He respected cultures that were pure. He considered the Japanese honorary aryans. He gave Muslims mini qurans. He had correspondence with gandhi who called him " my friend." See this video from Hitler to see one of the reasons why he's hated. He spoke the truth which is still relevant today.

       The allies did a great job cutting supply lines. When the people running the camp don't have medicine or food, what do you think the inmates get? I don't think the western governments really wanted to come out and advertise that they did such a good job , that disease and starvation were rampant.
      </p>

       I'm not a denier in the sense that I think it's all a lie, I just doubt certain aspects of the official narrative and would like to see a more factual account .

       I think the Germans had a very organized system of forced labor, I believe that people were probably worked to death. I also think that those who were unable to work were most likely executed.

       Babies, children, and the elderly were found in the camps, and the death certificates of Auschwitz also contradict this claim.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Over the years, Holocaust historians and standard Holocaust studies have consistently maintained that Jewish prisoners who arrived at Auschwitz between the spring of 1942 and the fall of 1944, and who were not able to work, were immediately put to death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with the alleged German program to exterminate Europe's Jews, only able-bodied Jews who could be "worked to death" were temporarily spared from the gas chambers. Holocaust historians also agree that no records were kept of the deaths of the Jews who were summarily killed in the camp's gas chambers because they were too old, too young or otherwise unable to work.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, Auschwitz camp death records – which were hidden away for more than 40 years in the Soviet Union – cast grave doubt on these widely accepted claims.

       It's the definition of unable to work that I wonder about. Look at sweatshops today.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to the systematic extermination angle it doesn't make sense to me from a business standpoint. Fuel was a valuable resource , so were construction materials. Why would Germany spend that much in labor, fuel and raw materials to round people up and transport them to a central location just to execute them?

       I think a couple things should be considered:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the 1940s racism was much more prevalent than it is today across the board.  Just remember how blacks were treated in the usa at this time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wartime propaganda was much easier to put out and be believed. There was no internet and people had relatively few sources of information back then.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wars were carried out much more brutally. They didn't have guided missiles and collateral damage wasn't really a concern.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lying to rally support for war or to justify a current or past wars is nothing new for governments.   Americans were lied to on many occasions along these lines.  That being the case once a war is over there isn't really any desire to clear up any of that wartime propaganda/lies to set the record straight.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Jews at that time were seen to be largely supporters of communism.  Behind the overthrow of the czar in Russia.  Seen as a hostile internal threat in Germany.  Even in America there was the communist hunt in Hollywood.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None of these things prove or disprove anything but if you want to consider the holocaust you have to consider a lot of context and be objective.

       Why did such a "grand conspiracy" (as you put it) need to occur? Well, let's see.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, it wasn't a conspiracy. Myths are not planned, they evolve organically.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the myth of the Nazi's "final solution" and death camps originate? It came about because Jews wanted and needed it to exist. The Jews had been asking for the Holocaust myth for a century (at least) before WW2. You will find references to the "six million Jews sacrificed" going back well into to the 19th century. The Holocaust was not something imposed on the Jews -- it was something created by the Jews, because they felt a (largely subconscious) need for it to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then, how could such a bizarre mythology ever get started and sustain itself? The myth of the Holocaust was bred in the ignorance and secrecy of the Nazi concentration camps. The Jews did not have a clear idea of why they were there, what the Germans intended to do with them, or what was actually going on around them. Rumors were rife throughout the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious example of a wild rumor is the myth of the bars of soap made from human fat. It has been proved totally untrue and without any foundation whatsoever. Yet it still persists today. Why? Because some Jews want it to be real. In brief, the Jews at Auschwitz and elsewhere began to believe that the Nazis were such inhuman monsters that they were rendering down dead Jews for their fat so that they could make soap for Jews to wash with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This myth of the soap made of human fat is absurd on the face of it. Why on earth would the Nazis do something so strange and pointless? Well, the answer is, they didn't do it. But a consequence of this myth of the soap was that many Jews refused to wash themselves with soap, and this bred vermin, and this contributed to disease in the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see a similar myth in Africa today, where some Africans believe that the vaccinations given to children are intended to kill them, and refuse to get the vaccinations. Or they believe that certain foods given to them by charity organizations are poison, and refuse to eat them even though they are starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that makes the Jewish mythology of the Holocaust different is the need Jews had to be victims. Jews have always felt a pressing need to be, not victimized -- no, they defend themselves vigorously -- but to be perceived as victims, both by non-Jews and by other Jews. The Holocaust is the ultimate victimization of Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The myth of the Holocaust has grown and been sustained for over seventy years because Jews find it very useful, as a social and political weapon against non-Jews. They can manipulate the minds of non-Jews by invoking the Holocaust, and thereby use it to get what they want from non-Jews.

       Its always refreshing when you guys don't bother pretending you aren't insanely racist. It makes its easier for people less familiar with all this shit to steer clear of your poisonous ideology. While it is obviously unintentional, I think you are doing a service by removing the smokescreen you denialists try to create by claiming you only care about historical accuracy.

       As you can see if you read the context of my previous comments, I try to base my responses based on the tone of those who respond to me.

       sensitive much? i say this because i am agnostic until proven otherwise, so the jew this, christian that, muslim blah blah blah makes absolutely no sense to me. i was never christened, and was

        casually
       </em>
       brought up Church of England, COE or any other, mean absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to me. i am a white australian that looks ethnic, so i cop crap from randoms all the time. This whole bullshit, from both sides about the holocaust is fucking stupid. OP asked a well structured, proper, un-racist question, and people get all emotional and start talking shit like they were there when the holocaust happened. The
       <em>
        proper
       </em>
       racists that hate jews can go crawl up their own arse and die for all i care, and the same goes for Jewish people that utilise the holocaust for their own selfish purposes, whether its the inflated figures, or using it to label someone a racist to win an argument. to tell you the truth, i wish their was a completely different sub for this. The zionists are bad. period. white supremicists are bad. period. STOP GETTING THE HONEST PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE MIXED UP IN IT. in other words, stop using the holocaust to justify whatever agenda you have, on both sides.

       back to this. i have had one account here. i dont give a fuck if people think thats bullshit but its the truth. i dont feel the need to hide or anything like that and i take the downvotes when they come. i find it sneaky and deceiving that that account switching is allowed on here. and i find the people that do it distrustful.

       Sorry, but considering members here recently stalked a daycare and have doxxed plenty of people in the past, I'm going to take the precautions before arguing with people on this sub. You never know, and I'd rather take the precautions.

       Regarding your other point, the person I'm responding to is a racist, the last comment alone makes it clear. I don't know why you are implying I am stifling discussion. You also seem to be implying that I am using the holocaust for my own purposes, a claim which is unfounded.

       you sound paranoid. and i think both you and i know that you are using that excuse for the sheer convenience of it, and dont let the truth get in the way of a good story right? that incident with the daycare didnt originate here and the bulk of the discussion was in
       <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">
        /r/SaltLakeCity
       </a>
       , some of it branched off to here, after it was removed from SLC. and no actual evidence of doxxing in that instance (presented or people getting banned) and theres doxxing all over reddit, you have more of a chance of it in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       than you do here, as were under the microscope from so many critical assholes and the fact that we keep our house pretty clean here, so to speak. so theres that. and i dont think you are being truthful about why you changed accounts. you just used those past events as excuses, and were convenient to do so for you here. i think you are a coward and you like to come here, do your drive by shooting style, hit &amp; run attack, then you retreat safely into your other profile(s) and talk about what you did in another subreddit to your buddies, even citing your discussion links as examples. am i wrong?

       You seem to be rambling a bit. Can we condense this into a point? From what I can figure, your problem with me seems to be the frequency I switch accounts, which is none of your business. Am I being overly cautious? Probably... but its better than risking my sanity, and possibly my livelihood or safety.

       Maybe youll take more care about what you say then, and, you get a shitload less from this sub than the other 99% of reddit, lets be honest here. even then, report it and our mods take care of things pretty quickly and fairly, i dont always agree with them, but they are transparent. they dont try and hide stuff from you, not that i know of anyway. dont try and act like switching accounts is going to stop someone stalking you in real life, it doesnt make any sense. i think you are trying to portray yourself as a potential victim taking care when talking to the psychos. you have no basis for that. none at all.

       .
if you want to be taken seriously, dont use an alt account, and think about what you are going to say before you press 'enter'. having the one account makes you think a bit more about what you are saying so you have to take responsibility for your online actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR   Using an alt account is a bullshit way of talking online because you can say what you want without any consequences and being called out. its a cowards way of participating and you should be man enough to do it. and all your excuses are BULLSHIT.

       so, let me get this straight, you have multiple accounts (for YOUR safety apparently), you only comment on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       with this account (not confirmed), you mostly comment on jewish-orientated posts, you "I'm going to take the precautions before arguing with people on this sub." 
so you are, in fact prepared for an argument, like its inevitable.

      <p>
       alt accounts are the cancer of reddit. i respect and thank you for admitting it, although it isnt hard to figure out. in order to gain respect for your opinion, you must be transparent. you arent being transparent. fuck me for wanting that huh?

       i still stand by what i said earlier, even though you like to sound like you didnt read it, i know you did.

      <p>
       as for the holocaust, look through my entire history, and you will not find one racist comment, or anything to do with the holocaust. its because i dont give a fuck. honestly, i dont. it was 70 odd years ago, and if i met a survivor, i would give my condolences, but it pretty much ends there.  the time has come for you and the deniers to grow the fuck up and put it in the past. 
you are no better than the people you hate, but you cant see that. people like you like to be the knight in shining armour that puts them down, so you feel good about yourself. well, how about looking to the present? how about Israel stops killing palestinian children playing on the beach? how about palestine stops knifing israeli citzens? how about israel stops their kids from signing 105mm artillery shells before theyre launched over the border to kill predominantly civilians?  how about palestine stops the suicide bombing? HOW ABOUT YOU ALL GO AND GET FUCKED. YOUR GOD AND THEIR GOD ISNT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSES YOU DUMB FUCKS. GOD DOESNT EXIST. IF THERE WAS A GOD, HE'D ASS FUCK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A HEINOUS PIECE OF SHIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, thats a little piece of my mind. i await some witty retort to it, because thats what im going to get. that or something questioning my sanity or something. so go ahead, bring it on man. show me whatcha got.

       Yeah anyone that likes to actually think for themselves is racist.  Funny though it's the Jews that call themselves the special chosen people and they sure don't seem to like Arabs very much.  But Jews can't be racist right ?

       Did I say Jews couldn't be racist? See, I exist here in real world, where folks realize that judging an entire group of people based solely on their religion or heritage is fucking ridiculous and pointless. This is most of the population, regardless of race. It is so prevalent, in fact, that if you said anything half the people in this thread have said at work, you'd be fired. It isn't some sinister plot or ignorant people, it is adults who realize you can't pidgeon-hole people based on broad categories as a means of validating your hate.

       Me pointing out that the commenter said something racist does not exonerate any single person of Jewish descent of any wrongdoing. I am aware that members of any race can be racist, because it generally arises from societal factors, (e.g. lack of education, religious differences, historical animosity between groups etc.). So when someone who clearly does not possess the intelligence to understand this very basic concept, They say racist things. And I express my disagreement

       Implying this behaviour is present in all jews or exclusive to/more common among the Jews is racist. If you agree with him, it is likely you are a racist. I understand that you don't appreciate having a mirror held up, but I am just as free to express myself here as you are are.

       Let's declare the death of 1 Million Vietnamese during the US occupation of South Vietnam a holocaust.

      <p>
       Let's declare the genocide of natives in the America's during the colonial and post-colonial years a holocaust.

       And lets allow a continued investigation of who was killed,  and where,  and how,  during WWII.

      <p>
       Lets blame the people who committed atrocities across the board for the atrocities that actually are researched and documented.    A science of atrocities,  with updates for every decade since WWI would be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now,  the way the Nazi holocaust is presented,  it paints a distorted picture of who the monsters were and are.   And it continues the motif of exceptionalism that certain groups like to claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that the banal inhuman monsters that modern political leaders so often become is easy to hide behind when you parade the holocaust around the way we have seen in recent decades.   There are plenty of holocausts still happening,  just under revised terms.

       Greek sacrifice
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Holokautein (ὁλοκαυτεῖν) was one of the two chief verbs of Greek sacrifice, in which the victim is utterly destroyed and burnt up, as opposed to thyesthai (θύεσθαι), to share a meal with the god and one's fellow worshippers, commensal sacrifice. In the latter, the edible parts of the sacrificed animal were roasted and distributed for festive celebration, whereas the inedible parts were burned on the altar, those being the god's share. Although not actually obliged to do so, Greeks would rather sacrifice a domestic animal to a god or hero and then proceed to use its flesh as food, as animals were thought of as sharing in the sanctity of life - in addition to their secular usefulness (milk, eggs, ploughing). This did not apply to game, fish, and other seafood, which formed a far larger proportion of the diet then than they do today - fish was the major foodstuff sold in ancient Greek marketplaces. A sacrifice need not be a public function involving priests and altars; they could also be held privately, domestically or individually.

       Echoing  what
       <a href="/u/holocauster-ride">
        /u/holocauster-ride
       </a>
       said, "revisionists" has become a blanket statement with a lot of baggage (negatively connotated) attached to it.  It has even been somewhat co-opted by certain movements.  Basically what I'm getting at is that "revisionists" are not a solid group (unless one limits the definition) and believe many different things for many different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, it seems extremely likely that there have been embellishments both of numbers and conditions in the official narrative.  HOWEVER that doesn't make it any less awful, or more forgivable.  BUT the same can be said for the people that USE the embellished or even real narrative to justify more violence and hate (for whatever).  Many revisionists would say I do not go far enough on so very many fronts, but many guardians of the official narrative (aka propagandists) would say I've already gone way to far.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end I find it all to be rather pointless, there are so many other good easy hard and fast facts that utterly destroy the fallacy that our governments, corporations, and TPTB belong in power.  We need to rise up, regardless if 6million were killed, or 2million or 1million or none.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making it even more irrelevant is that regardless of how many were killed etc, it still WOULD NOT JUSTIFY VIOLENCE BY EITHER SIDE, so anyone using it as an excuse for such actions (I'm looking at you Israel and neo-nazi's) is already a complete joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to revise history and get the actual narrative straitened out, institutional and systemic change is needed.

       A lot of Jews were killed for being partisans, communists and committing numerous acts of terror against the German people. These people

       killed by the einsatzgruppen for their crimes.

       The Holocaust, IMO, is the greatest of all conspiracies because it shows just how much the government and world jewry have been lying to
       <strong>
        all of us

       and taking financial reparations. This affects everyone financially and psychologically as we've all been brainwashed since school about the holohoax.

       So if that was the case, does that mean you believe the genocidal gas chambers just magically appeared, even though you claim there was no order for a mass execution of the Jews? You can't just cherry-pick this. These camps were guarded, had regular visits by the red cross and German officials. Some psycho guard can't just build a homemade gas chamber and try to throw all the Jews inside. For the existence of gas chambers
       <em>
        specifically designed for mass extermination
       </em>
       , there
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       have been an order from the top. Yet there is no evidence of this (links with point #1)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilberg, the author of the definitive book on the holocaust, 'the destruction of the European Jews', doesn't believe 6 million Jews died. Does that make him a holocaust revisionist just for agreeing with #3? Of course not.

       It's odd that you can't understand that there doesn't need to be an order of mass execution to allow for the existence of some gas chambers.  Is that what your argument is going to be based on? Cause... I really hope not.

       I have to disagree with you. I don't call myself anything, but I see no reason why I can't participate in a discussion about Holocaust revisionism. Yet I am not yet convinced that there were no gas chambers -- I increasingly tend to believe there were no gas chambers, based upon the information I have researched over the past couple of years, but I'm not certain about it. Am I then to be denied a chance to debate the question of the Holocaust?

       Everyone's allowed to discuss holocaust and holocaust revisionism. My point is, if you don't believe in those three points, then you can't call yourself a holocaust revisionist because the entire holocaust revisionism movement and every work concerning it is based upon those three points. If you still believe in one (e.g. Genocidal gas chambers exist, Hitler ordered the extermination of European Jewry, and/or 6 million Jews WERE murdered), then you're going to have a real hard time finding a revisionist source to back up your claims, whatever they may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying this in response to people thinking that revisionism is all about just revising the numbers down from 6 million to 4 million.

       Admittedly, I haven't researched the arguments against the popular narrative. It's more apparent to me, as time progresses, the popular narrative is far, far from the truth. I mean, compare the technology many possess currently, but the Truth is still suppressed.

        Many revisionists would say I do not go far enough on so very many fronts, but many guardians of the official narrative (aka propagandists) would say I've already gone way to far.

       <p>
        In the end I find it all to be rather pointless, there are so many other good easy hard and fast facts that utterly destroy the fallacy that our governments, corporations, and TPTB belong in power. We need to rise up, regardless if 6million were killed, or 2million or 1million or none.
       </p>
       <p>
        Making it even more irrelevant is that regardless of how many were killed etc, it still WOULD NOT JUSTIFY VIOLENCE BY EITHER SIDE, so anyone using it as an excuse for such actions (I'm looking at you Israel and neo-nazi's) is already a complete joke.

       No they really, really, really don't.  Perhaps your little movement has taken a liking to the term, that doesn't make it yours.  Revisionists simply feel there is some revising to do to get history as close as possible to what actually happened.  The OP wasn't refering to (or at least didn't word it to seem like he was refering to) one specific limited set of revisionists that have attempted to take the term as their name.  He seemed to be addressing anyone who main-streamers would term "revisionists" aka anyone who questions the official (propaganda) narrative.  If he had asked about the revisionist board etc, you'd be quite right, but it doesn't seem as if he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, no your movement doesn't own "revisionists" and the term doesn't only encompass you whether you like it or not.

       You don't see anything, you didn't see my original points in my post, and you still haven't.  You don't see any side of this issue but your own, and you definitely don't see what I'm doing with or without straws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the OP was addressing holocaust revisionists, but again you do not own the term holocaust revisionists, you do not get to define what they do and do not believe or what you have to do to be one.  The simple definition stands, if you question the official narrative you are then a revisionist.  Just because you would like it to be X or Y, or just because your movement believes X or Y, doesn't mean that the definition now only fits you.
      </p>
      <p>
       To argue otherwise is beyond hilarious and strait up wrong.  Its like claiming Catholics are the only true Christians, or you cannot be a true christian unless you believe in saints etc.  Your thinking is medieval at best.

       Obama is to the USA what Hitler was to Germany. A spokesperson.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish leaders put Hitler in 'power' to sacrifice their people under the German name in return for a stolen nation in Israel as no one would question it through all the guilt and empathy. How many were sacrificed? Were any sacrificed? I know it was a lot easier back then to pull the wool. They just erased the character known as Hitler and put the person playing him on a plane to Argentina to live out his years in paradise. I imagine theyll do the same for ISIS. Israel was what they needed in order for today's world ownership to happen. Israel is the center of evil, the heart of the beast. Those Jewish leaders arent Jewish at all and more than likely lead other sectors in the world under the guise of whatever they need to be. The same group of people who run Israel also run Saudi Arabia, also run the US, and any other nation with a Rothschild bank. They probably run the Vatican. Remember, its called 'Saudi' Arabia because that's who runs Arabia at the moment.The Saudis are just some bullshit family that got put into place by these people. They control through deceit and irresponsibility. Its gone to far. They need to go.

       Not even close. Obama is a complete puppet of the bankers and the status-quo. Hitler on the other hand, was trying to remove the influence of the world bankers from Germany, many of whom happened to be Jewish, which is why western media propagandized and demonized him. They are owned and funded by the very people he was trying to get Germany to obtain sovereignty from.

       I've lurked this sub for a while because it provides a good way to look at media stories and events from all angles. I even believe in some theories. But the one I can't believe is holocaust denialism and revisionist history of nazi germany. The evidence for it is mostly postulation by people who claim to be "historians" and documents that are taken out of context or easily refuted. Shit like this is disseminated in this sub by stormfags who seek to make the ideology of nazism, along with its racism, anti semitism, And lust for war an acceptable political ideology once again.

       As to answer your questions
1. The numbers  are likely accurate 
2.Hitler was on an racie cleansing, land grabbing spree. By the time of around 1935. The race hating was evident by the way he treated the bastard babies of allied troops or Rhine babies. Also things like kristillnacht didn't happen spontaneously or the Jews didn't burn down thier own property by purpose. He also sure as hell didn't conquer Slavic lands and plan on sharing them. Also the first concentration camp, Dachau, opened in 1933, the very year hitler took power. If you look up speeches, a lot of them talk about an eternal battle between races and how they must come out on top. As for land grabbing, he practically outlined in his autobiography that the German people needed living space. Not only that, mid way through 1935 he had built and army almost twice the size of the ww1 German army, which was the largest army in the world in 1914. You don't build an army that large and not intend to use it. 
3. Denialists say it because they want to demonize Hitler for fighting the banks and stir up sympathies with the Jews.
A
4. As for your last  post, thier  is no grand conspiracy being brought on here.  Like I said earlier,  people here try to white wash nazism to make it acceptable again.  It happened Thier leaders, our leaders., our soldiers and generals, the survivors, and even thier soldiers all have testified along with supporting documents of this occurring. The holocaust sadly, is as real as it gets.

       It's very clear that OP was addressing holocaust revisionists. I see you're just clutching at straws here, so it's best if you give up now.

       Maybe youll take more care about what you say then, and, you get a shitload less from this sub than the other 99% of reddit, lets be honest here. even then, report it and our mods take care of things pretty quickly and fairly, i dont always agree with them, but they are transparent. they dont try and hide stuff from you, not that i know of anyway. dont try and act like switching accounts is going to stop someone stalking you in real life, it doesnt make any sense. i think you are trying to portray yourself as a potential victim taking care when talking to the psychos. you have no basis for that. none at all.

if you want to be taken seriously, dont use an alt account, and think about what you are going to say before you press 'enter'. having the one account makes you think a bit more about what you are saying so you have to take responsibility for your online actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR   Using an alt account is a bullshit way of talking online because you can say what you want without any consequences and being called out. its a cowards way of participating and you should be man enough to do it. and all your excuses are BULLSHIT.
