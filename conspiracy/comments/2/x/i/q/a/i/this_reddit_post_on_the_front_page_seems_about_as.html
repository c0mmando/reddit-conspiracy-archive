    <div class="md"><p>Cuz that&#39;s what casually gets brought to the top of reddit.  We will do a little test here to prove something to you.</p>

<p>Go create a brand new account.  Take the same exact thing that he posted and post it to <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>.  I guarantee you don&#39;t get 200 upvotes.  A lot of people have their accounts set to see new posts first, so getting new upvotes will be absolutely no problem at all for you assuming this wasn&#39;t artificially brought to the top.  Everyone will think that you are actually the initial person to post this and will in turn upvote you.</p>

<p>Do this, come back, and see how artificial upvoting on reddit actually fucking works.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think people know what&#39;s currently the top post in the sub they&#39;re browsing?  It says how long ago something was posted right under the title.  Is this the kind of critical thinking you&#39;re capable of?  That would explain a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people have their accounts set to see new posts first</p>

<p>What?  Bullshit.  Got any facts to support that?</p>

<p>It was a fucking joke, and you decided to be Debbie Downer and bring your agenda into it.  That&#39;s why you got downvoted, because no one wants to hear the same shit they&#39;ve been hearing for 13 years.  People can dislike you without being paid to, especially when you make yourself so unlikable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Entirely wrong.  He wouldn&#39;t get it out of the new section to begin with ( and these are entirely fresh views).  If he got his post over to the hot/rising sections  then he would be receiving sooooooo many new views it wouldn&#39;t be funny.  You do realize how many people view this website?  </p>

<p>Taking that all into account, Majority of redditors do not actually read the comments.  They just click, view and go on with their day.  It should be a walk in the park to get a few hundred upvotes on such a &quot;high quality post&quot;.  The only problem is that it was entirely artificially upvoted for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Let me run you through some basic math here on some terms that maybe you can understand.  This is about as basic as it gets.  </p>

<p>OP of that post has 2 submitted posts with a combined  total of roughly 6600 upvotes.  This is all on a brand new account (keep in mind here that PR and Marketing firms do HUGE business on reddit)</p>

<p>You have submitted two posts with a combined upvote score of 223.</p>

<p>Does this mean that OP adds 29.6 x better content than you to reddit?  According to logic, and assuming reddits algorithms are correct, then his overall quality of thought is that much better.  Do you want to know why this actually occured?  Because it was artificially upvoted.    </p>

Her 2 posts were in <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> and <a href="/r/Funny">/r/Funny</a>.  2 subs that upvote shitty content all the fucking time with massive numbers.  They&#39;re 2 of the highest trafficked subs on Reddit.  Getting a lot of upvotes in those subs isn&#39;t proof of anything, having a 2 and a half month old account isn&#39;t proof of anything, and you getting a lot of downvotes for being a pain in the ass isn&#39;t proof of anything.</p>

<p>What would shills have to gain from trying to reinforce the narrative of planes hitting the towers?  Everyone&#39;s already got their minds made up on what happened by now and aren&#39;t going to change them, it&#39;s a 13 year old story.  Why the fuck would there be a massive conspiracy effort to upvote a standup comedian&#39;s joke to the top of <a href="/r/Funny">/r/Funny</a> for a few hours that would have little to no impact on people&#39;s opinions?  You&#39;ve obviously got your mind inflexibly made up, would the right joke make you change it?  Exactly.  Shut up.</p>

<p>Stop taking your assumptions so seriously, then being a dick to people that disagree with them.  Your opinions aren&#39;t worth what you think they are, you&#39;re not special.  People can dislike you without being paid to, especially when you make such a complete ass of yourself like you did in that thread.  Why would anyone upvote the guy that&#39;s freaking out over a few downvotes, then insulting people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what you need to research.  There is a reason the filthy rich print their own money and rule every single last one of us.  I could literally explain for 24 hours straight why terrorism is marketed out of control right now,  but none of it makes sense if you don&#39;t have a base understanding.  The problem here is that people see something that they don&#39;t understand and automatically disregard it the second it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>I suggest starting with the Rothschilds and which countries had centralized banks after 9/11.  Look at who has the power over a nation once they own that centralized bank.  Look at all of the shares these people own, and what effect they have on banking and govt control.  Look at where your and I tax dollars have gone.  I guarantee your struggling family didn&#39;t see a dime.  Look at what happens after a market crash, and the amount of control the banks have over you when you are in serious debt.  Look at every single right/privacy issue that has occurred since &quot;terrorism&quot; has been an issue.  Look up Operation Northwoods, JFK, The federal Reserve and its owners.  Look at the odds of the JFK witnesses being dead by February 1967.  They were one hundred thousand trillion to one.  The same people who killed him are the same people ruling over you today.  I guarantee 98% of the population haven&#39;t researched any of this despite it all being highly documented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am actually a descended mixed Ashkenazi Jew myself.  Using &quot;Jews&quot; is a pretty broad term here.  I would say the &quot;Jews&quot; own the majority of the wealth in  the world.  I would also say that there is a given branch of Judaism that stems into satanism.  These are not actual Jews, and go against everything that the religion is comprised of.  I suggest looking into satanism and the pedophile rings.  It is rumored that Satanism is the force behind the wealthiest powers on this planet.  If you really want to go balls deep, look into why the founder of reddit was murdered.</p>

<p>Do you know who controls the world price of gold and silver on a daily basis?  Where&#39;s a credible source?</p>

<p>Do you know the shareholders of the companies who have a monopoly over military spending?  Let me geuss, you want a source for this too?</p>

<p>Sorry but you have years of research ahead of you my friend.  If you  don&#39;t understand even the BASICS then there is nothing I can prove to you.  It&#39;s like sticking a 6th grader into a professional hockey game and expecting them to just &quot;get it&quot;.  Sorry but this is a broken conversation.  </p>

<p>Edit 1: Looked in the second paragraph for the financial crisis. All I really took away from it was that there&#39;s a lot of reasons it happened and a lot of people on all sides fucked up. Stupid yes. Sinister? Not really I think you&#39;re just reading too much into it. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Now that I see it I remember seeing something about this a while ago. It was something proposed during the Kenedy administration for action against Cuba. Last time I checked we weren&#39;t blaming Cuba for acts of terrorism and we hadn&#39;t invaded them. </p>

<p>Edit 3: What are you getting about gold fixing there? They sound like a legitamate business to me. Although they have been around for a long time so they must be evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into who does the gold pricing, and their tactics for the past few hundreds of years.  It is rumored the Rothschild&#39;s have financed every war since they have been in business.  Each one of these topics stems into about 1000 other things that take a while to explain, so it&#39;s difficult to answer all the questions at once.</p>

<p>The financial crisis is key because it stems into a time period where there is a LOT of oppression.  We have more taxes and laws against us today than when we initially left England.  The Government is constantly making ways around the constitution to take our right away.  The crash essentially put a good portion of Americans with disposable income into debt.  This along with the current education bubble, and pushing all of our taxes towards wars is completely destroying our economy.  Today we are financially worse off than we were when England was ruling us.  The only difference is that our technology makes it so that we live comfortable lives.  If the banks wanted to give us a Utopia tomorrow they could.</p>

<p>Why JFK is so important is that he was supposedly the last good president.  He firmly said no to the Federal Reserve (privately owned by the Rothschilds), and no to Operation Northwoods.  He was unwilling to work with the financial controllers of the nation, and was not viewed as an asset to the real powers of the country.  He was assassinated shortly after both of these events.  Another interesting fact that I learned recently is that all of the witnesses who were going to testify in court for JFK&#39;s murder all wound up dead.  The chances of this happening were one hundred thousand trillion to one.  </p>

<p>I strongly suggest looking up Eisenhowers speech warning the country/world about the Military Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>Your &quot;fact&quot; about the <em>hundred thousand trillion to one</em> odds of JFK assassination witnesses dying...it was retracted by the paper that did the study...in the 1970s.  That was 35 plus years ago.  You can google that fact and the retraction of it comes up in the <strong>very first result!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the <em>Bell Forum</em>?  Who is &quot;TruthIsAll&quot; and what training does he have as an actuary?</p>

<p>Why is he limiting the sample size to a thousand witnesses?  The Warren Commission conducted over 25 thousand interviews in the months after the assassination...why the arbitrary &quot;one thousand&quot; number?</p>

<p>Which 15 witnesses are being specifically referred to?  Is it the ones at the bottom of the original link?</p>

<p>There are 2 heart attacks listed among the 15.  Heart attacks are not &quot;unnatural deaths&quot;, they are directly health related.</p>

<p>Eddie Benavides was shot in February of 1965, not 1964.  The list of &quot;suspicious deaths&quot; is off by a year.  It also means that Eddy was shot <em>after</em> his brother had already testified to the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Why is DeLesseps Morrison listed as a suspicious death?  He had nothing at all to do with the assassination in any way.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, most of these witnesses are only connected to the assassination in very periphery ways.  Some of them are only on the list because they knew someone who happened to be involved.  By that rational, everyone who knew Lee Harvey Oswald, or Jack Ruby, or JD Tippet, or was related to ANY of the thousands of witnesses has to be included in the original figure we are using as a comparison, which when you add the 25,000 Warren Commission interviews, makes the original &quot;one thousand witnesses&quot; figure complete and utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Sloppy sloppy sloppy.  Complete bullshit.</p>
