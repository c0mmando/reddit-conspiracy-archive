       This has been attempted in the past, but it didn't catch on. What's hard with the 9/11 "Truth" movement is that the "official" story is also a conspiracy theory with a lot of information omitted from the public record, so that means the 100% honest-to-goodness truth isn't known by anyone.

       If you go and ask the average person, they are going to tell you that the "truth" is that muslims were behind 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is their truth. That is what they
       <em>
        know

       What are you basing it on, numbers in agreement? She'll have you beat.

       ?

      <p>
       I'll tell you what's real. Whatever you believe is real. Same goes for everyone else. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we don't. But there is no such thing as an objective reality.

       Once you understand this, you can change your reality into whatever you wish it to be.

       This is absurd, and very harmful to believe. If you believe there is no truth, you are open to believe any lie your enemies may tell you, in order to control your mind and manipulate you. Indeed, the very fact that you believe as you do indicates that you have already been controlled.

       The fact that you don't understand the nature of reality shows that you have been brainwashed and programmed. You believe your power is very limited because you believe in the reality that has been sold to you by THEM.

       See, this is why you need to be kicked in the balls. Then you can grimace before spouting more bullshit. Then I'll rinse my foot and repeat. Eventually, you'll either be forced to admit we live in an objective consensual reality where me kicking you in the balls is an inarguably painful reality, or you'll hemorrhage and bleed out through your urethra, leaving me in a slightly different reality where I'm still just as right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And FYI, it doesn't follow that I'm engaging in a logical fallacy just because you only have arguments about semantics to fall back on. You're just being a pedant.

       Definitely works. It takes quite a state of denial to not even question
       <em>
        any aspect
       </em>
       of the official account, especially when treating anyone who does as a 'heretic'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if your opponent is intent on starting flame-wars instead of debate, respond to 'Truther' with 'Faither', as in; "Faithful to the dogma of 'official' narrative" -A person I respect uses this infrequently and it never fails to amuse.

       It's weird man.  Just about every person I know is openly distrusting of the government.  Think they're lying and scheming in every way possible.  But when it comes to things like 9/11 or other 'conspiracies' they won't budge on any part of the official story.  That cognitive dissonance post that hit the front here the other day really holds true.

       I think, with everyone, it's a galvanizing issue on so many levels. To categorize it:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You were either personally effected by the events of that day, so you're flooded with emotions whenever it is discussed, which may affect your ability to even consider anything outside of the official story.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have what might resemble a religious faith in the 'scientific method', so of course anything proposed by the NIST will remain impeccable for eternity. To question any aspect of their findings is 'anti-science', and therefore discredits all other research within the 9/11 truth community since [insert sweeping generalization here].
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Through a systemic form of social engineering, you have been raised to fear being labelled a 'conspiracy theorist' and hate anyone you decide
         <em>
          is
         </em>
         one. You essentially have come to ostracize anyone who questions authority while unknowingly defending it yourself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then there's the people who aren't afraid to discuss any aspect of 9/11. None of the above applies because you've gotten passed the threshold of wondering whether the 'Government' is capable of things like 9/11. Whether you think they did it, let it happen or just aren't sure doesn't matter, you just recognize that there is less to trust them about and more to criticize them for and that people doing the latter aren't the problem.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are variations of these but this is how I can best approximate the situation.

       Solid points, pretty much sums it up.  I live in the upper midwest so the first 2 don't exactly apply to the people I was referring to.  People were indirectly affected here, and religiously scientific people are few and far between around here but that antiquestion mentality still exists.  The last 2 are more prevalent in my experience.

       Thanks. There are definitely factors I'm leaving out and location is certainly one of  them, especially outside of America I imagine. Since I'm in South Ont. I'm not too far from NY, so I know some people that were directly effected, surprisingly a few of them do not believe in the official account.

       As for #2, I really only know one 'science acolyte' personally. You are correct though, it's more likely you'll encounter more like them online.

       Yeah I wasn't saying the first 2 are wrong, and I have met people they describe.  I just don't see them often around here.  #2 still works without the science acolyte.  Could be religious faith in media,  faith in official reports, or just in ruling opinion.

       What does sexy have to with questioning perceived truth? The strange thing about society at large is that we wish to have things labeled in simplistic dramatic polarized terms. So one to three words max draws attention. Anything over that three words looses interest IMO. If I was to label myself it would be something along the lines of- skeptical altruistic seeking deeper truth through observation, life practice, willing to see all sides of a narrative, shifting paradigms, and believing in all beliefs. Most folks lost interest after skeptical altruistic. OP has a good point in that labels can often create an opposing reaction. Skepticism/skeptic and denier have powerful meanings. These labels in the base form often bring opposing reactions and views, similar to conspiracy theorist.

       I feel you man, I really do - but at some point you gotta realize that to have any effect in this information war (
       <em>
        and make no mistake, there is a reason AJ coined the term
       </em>
       ), which we are in, you gotta take a step back and consider how to effectively get your message bout there. The truth is the greatest weapon, yes sir but the delivery (unfortunately) is almost equally as important to the proles these days.

       How do I address your comment efficiently without coming off as egotistical? James I have been questioning the narrative and the supposed definition of the information wars for well over 30 years now. How do I get my message out there? I do what I believe. I believe sustainability in the self and the community is key. I assist others physically not just on the internet in achieving this. Sure I will mail out heirloom seeds and assist in gardening online. I also give away hundreds of pounds of organic fruit, vegetable starts, and produce weekly, plant over 300 seeds a month for my farmers market, and volunteer in many ways. But  its the lessons from elders that inspires the most. I am here to break the chains of the past. They teach me in a lot of ways just how not to repeat the mistakes. Going deeper is parenthood. This is my main mission.  Having children shifts you in ways unimaginable to those without. Those children born to us that depend on us are looking for new ways to live freely.

       technically you are correct.  however, i think most people would agree that there are themes that are found commonly in broad ranges on perspectives.  these common threads are we were humans call "truth".
