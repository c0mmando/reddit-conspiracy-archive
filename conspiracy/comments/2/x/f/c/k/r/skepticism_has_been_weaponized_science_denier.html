<p>It&#39;s weird man.  Just about every person I know is openly distrusting of the government.  Think they&#39;re lying and scheming in every way possible.  But when it comes to things like 9/11 or other &#39;conspiracies&#39; they won&#39;t budge on any part of the official story.

    <div class="md"><p>I think, with everyone, it&#39;s a galvanizing issue on so many levels. To categorize it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You were either personally effected by the events of that day, so you&#39;re flooded with emotions whenever it is discussed, which may affect your ability to even consider anything outside of the official story.</p></li>
<li><p>You have what might resemble a religious faith in the &#39;scientific method&#39;, so of course anything proposed by the NIST will remain impeccable for eternity. To question any aspect of their findings is &#39;anti-science&#39;, and therefore discredits all other research within the 9/11 truth community since [insert sweeping generalization here].</p></li>
<li><p>Through a systemic form of social engineering, you have been raised to fear being labelled a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; and hate anyone you decide <em>is</em> one. You essentially have come to ostracize anyone who questions authority while unknowingly defending it yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there&#39;s the people who aren&#39;t afraid to discuss any aspect of 9/11. None of the above applies because you&#39;ve gotten passed the threshold of wondering whether the &#39;Government&#39; is capable of things like 9/11. Whether you think they did it, let it happen or just aren&#39;t sure doesn&#39;t matter, you just recognize that there is less to trust them about and more to criticize them for and that people doing the latter aren&#39;t the problem.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What does sexy have to with questioning perceived truth? The strange thing about society at large is that we wish to have things labeled in simplistic dramatic polarized terms. So one to three words max draws attention. Anything over that three words looses interest IMO. If I was to label myself it would be something along the lines of- skeptical altruistic seeking deeper truth through observation, life practice, willing to see all sides of a narrative, shifting paradigms, and believing in all beliefs. Most folks lost interest after skeptical altruistic. OP has a good point in that labels can often create an opposing reaction. Skepticism/skeptic and denier have powerful meanings. These labels in the base form often bring opposing reactions and views, similar to conspiracy theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you man, I really do - but at some point you gotta realize that to have any effect in this information war (<em>and make no mistake, there is a reason AJ coined the term</em>), which we are in, you gotta take a step back and consider how to effectively get your message bout there. The truth is the greatest weapon, yes sir but the delivery (unfortunately) is almost equally as important to the proles these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do I address your comment efficiently without coming off as egotistical? James I have been questioning the narrative and the supposed definition of the information wars for well over 30 years now. How do I get my message out there? I do what I believe. I believe sustainability in the self and the community is key. I assist others physically not just on the internet in achieving this. Sure I will mail out heirloom seeds and assist in gardening online. I also give away hundreds of pounds of organic fruit, vegetable starts, and produce weekly, plant over 300 seeds a month for my farmers market, and volunteer in many ways. But  its the lessons from elders that inspires the most. I am here to break the chains of the past. They teach me in a lot of ways just how not to repeat the mistakes. Going deeper is parenthood. This is my main mission.  Having children shifts you in ways unimaginable to those without. Those children born to us that depend on us are looking for new ways to live freely.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moonpur, call me Jim, please.</p>

<p>And your comment about children is spot-fucking-on. Total game changer. A big part of me seeing things differently.</p>

<p>You say to yourself - sure - shit isn&#39;t <em>okay</em> but it&#39;s <em>good enough</em>, but then when you see what we&#39;re trending towards I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll answer to my little one what I did to try and stop things, and why we all sat idly by.</p>

<p>Your contributions regarding self I sustainability are also right on - and more power to ya for affecting <em>real people</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my goal for this year - and all other years to follow.</p>

<p>/cheers and I hope we can share many more positive stories throughout the rest of this forum&#39;s lifespan.</p>

<p>Long days &amp; and certainly pleasant nights,</p>

<p>-Jim.</p>
