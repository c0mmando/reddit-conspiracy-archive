       I tried to submit an interesting fact I found about Edward Snowden today on
       <a href="/r/todayilearned">
        /r/todayilearned
       </a>
       . The moment I clicked submit, I checked the 'new' tab and my post wasn't appearing. I thought I might've made a mistake, so i resubmitted it with a different source.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time I was able to see my post in the new tab for a second, but after not even a minute I refreshed and it was already gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I searched for any other Edward Snowden posts on
       <a href="/r/todayilearned">
        /r/todayilearned
       </a>
       , and found there are exactly zero to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear to me the mods of TIL are deliberately censoring Edward Snowden posts on
       <a href="/r/todayilearned">
        /r/todayilearned
       </a>
       . I'm not sure why they would do this, I just thought I'd post this to let everyone know reddit censorship is very real.

         It is by now a "public secret" that if you post negatively about certain topics, especially the NSA, the moderators will removed or moved it to an obscure sub-Reddit. Sometimes the Moderators will simply delete/manipulate votes or allow "professional PR Firms" to down vote and trolls you comments and posts. No need to pretend otherwise.

         I have seen it done to other people and myself 100's of times. Constructive criticism died a long long time ago on Reddit. No need to pretend otherwise.

         Reddit is a privately owned firm. They employ people. We call those people Reddit Moderators. The Moderators do what they are told to do. It works exactly like any other branches of the corporate owned media. No need to pretend otherwise.

         Every single year the USA government spend at least $ 80 billion to keep the NSA running. The NSA employs 1000's of people whoÂ´s only job it is to influence the public debate and consensus. The Reddit Moderators are a part of that. No need to pretend otherwise.

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All the time, we see posts critical of the current US hegemony getting removed or people getting their accounts shadow banned. The Intelligence Community has a firm grip on the mass media. No Need to pretend otherwise.

       How many people need to tell you that your #3 and #4 are inaccurate statements before you edit this copypasta?  Moderators are not paid by reddit, at least not in theory, though I wouldn't be surprised if certain ones in some of the "key positions" are (but that would be strictly off the record).

       you don't think there are moderators (not admin) part of that gov't NSA program?  I would bet my mortgage that there are.  I'm not saying Reddit employs them, just saying it would be naive to think there are no mods employed by them.

       I think there are mods involved in some nefarious activities on this site regarding content manipulation and censorship, possibly corporate/government interests are involved there, so yeah I do agree with that.  Not for nothing but did you read the final part of my last comment where I pretty much said that these types of mods definitely do exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just saying that the other guy's post is factually inaccurate and implies that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       mods are paid employees of reddit and/or working for the NSA to influence public debate.  Which is totally untrue (although it most likely is true for

        certain

       I did read that last comment, but you said "moderators are not paid by reddit...though I wouldn't be surprised if certain ones in key positions are."   My comment was regarding gov't workers manipulating reddit.  Maybe I don't think of gov't interests as the same as actual gov't workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I honestly don't believe you really think that he meant , EVERY SINGLE MOD.  I think you dramatized what he said.  I get it, he said "the reddit moderators," but I'm 100% sure he didn't mean "ALL."  To point that word indiscretion to point out that it was" factually inaccurate" was a little over the top.  I don't think anyone here thought he meant "all" moderators where gov't shills.

Now, of course, it most likely doesn't work that way, and some mods most likely are compensated to manipulate and push various agendas, but I was just pointing out that the other guy's comment was misleading from where I'm sitting and I've seen him copy/paste it in multiple places with the same inaccuracy.

       Who's David Chandler?  The name sounds familiar, I'm assuming he's a member of 9/11 truth but how is he relevant to the faked Gage AMA?  I mean there's no doubt that the AMA was a total failure.  I wasn't a mod of this sub when that took place though and I personally will do all I can to prevent something like that from happening again in the future.

       the main issue isn't the reddit admins, its the sub mods.  There are also companies that buy high karma accts.  Also, there are companies where you can buy votes, in increments in the thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the cognitive infiltration element.  And as the Snowden leaks told us, there are gov't agencies that specifically target social media, and we all know how readily that happens on reddit.  Its something that just really can't be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are mods in several subs employed by the NSA, but not so sure if reddit admins are.

        1) It is by now a "public secret" that if you post negatively about certain topics, especially the NSA, the moderators will removed or moved it to an obscure sub-Reddit. Sometimes the Moderators will simply delete/manipulate votes or allow "professional PR Firms" to down vote and trolls you comments and posts. No need to pretend otherwise.

       That's a surprise, I'd think they'd like your kind of posts. Perhaps they're not 'liberal' enough? Which is in itself hilarious as there can be no real progress with bi-partisan politics while they only answer to corporations.

       Um...no, not so fast. When and under what circumstances have 0 tolerance policies ever worked before, at all? Everyone's definition of what a "shill" is, is going to be at least slightly different, in most cases probably
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different. Discretion is always a necessary tool towards fair policing.
      </p>

       I don't understand why people never seem to mention that a power check against the admins absolute power would go a long way towards solving a lot of the problems we all complain about. How about introducing a democratic element into how the admins are chosen?

       Well then you just need a 51% attack to take over the admins, and the shills have a budget while normal users don't.

       I wasn't thinking that normal users like you and I would vote. That would be awesome, but anyone can have multiple accounts, and then what you said is very correct. So my next idea was that mods would vote about things, publicly, but then again, a lot of mods are obviously corrupt, but it becomes easier to see what they are doing and hold them accountable. Several ways that could be done.

      <p>
       Genuinely curious, what would be the basic design of a system that wouldn't need admins? A type of "open source" reddit?

       as i said, if we have mods who can't or won't stop shills we need mods who can. i can and i would lose zero sleep over anyone i banned. but since in the last few months freshly funded pro-shill programs have been publicy announced
       <em>
        on both sides of the atlantic
       </em>
       the problem is only going to get worse, much worse, not better. the "proven beyond a reasonable doubt" and "i'm only playing devils advocate" criteria may have to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       if it walks like a shill and quacks like a shill -- it gets fucking banned.

       What's your definition of a shill? Seriously, let's see if we can even find agreement on that. For me, that definition would have include very technical things, like duplicate comments and posts etc, but only those things. If someone's obviously taking the time to write out responses, even if it seems pretty clear they are a shill, I wouldn't argue for banning them.

       I think there are better ways of defeating those accounts than your eloquently worded "banhammer".

       It can't be stopped. If you want unfiltered pure free speech you can't stay in one place for Too long. Eventually Voat will go like Reddit, and another impersonator will pop up and we'll all migrate there. We can't grow to attached to these sites

       The model depends on the principles of the admins.  Reddit has gotten so bad because the admins don't do anything about site-breaking subs, mods, and mod-cliques.  The Voat admins have voiced a strong commitment to free speech and non-censorship and have explicitly stated that they will not allow power users and mod-cliques to gain undue influence over the site.  If they are true to their word, Voat could work out better than Reddit has.

       My political opinions and comments on subjects such as mandatory vaccination usually bring forth a comforting volley of downvotes.

       Not so anymore.  For the past few days many controversial comments I have posted bring  ... 0 response.

       I'm thinking Reddit has raised the censoring a notch once again.  Downvote brigades were overloaded and not always that efficient.

       Sandboxing makes sense as to the odd behaviour. So too would a flag for shill/pr/''safe'' accounts to see the ''subversive'' tagged accounts.  Who knows, though.  If such a thing is real we would.need someone from inside the system to say so.

       Keep in mind it isn't always manipulation.  There is a like self selection bias that creeps into many posts.  If the article or post is.too hyperbolic it draws opposing voices, if it is sensible it usually draws voices of agreement.  Even a.slight change in the title could change the kind of people that will click through to the comments.

       Agreed. Sad thing is ... anyone denouncing the illegal wars, Ukraine / Russian propaganda, the pressure for mandatory vaccination is "an obvious troll' for many of the folks in those subs.

       On TIL, the third rule is "No news or recent sources. News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed." So it's possible they consider him recent news.

       Reddit used to have a "search bug" that would allow submissions containing the word "reddit" or "Obama" stay in the new queue for 2 hours before they would be deleted. This would let users find just enough new submissions to fill a page of search results, but wouldnt let posts stay long enough to gather any momentum. Reddit admins adamantly insisted it was a real bug and not auto-censorship. Obviously I thought they were lying.

       They can claim it's 'political' or whatever bullshit excuse they have. It's McReddit - don't be surprised when you see evidence of censoring and manipulation.

       McReddit is a synthetic viral marketing platform based off the fundamental idea of organic user stimulated input.

       It was already shown by William Binney. However the media wouldn't cover him because they were told not to.

      <p>
       But when the NSA has a toy the CIA doesn't have, all of a sudden the media has a big green light to say what they want.

       Also, look up Snowden, he worked at the CIA before the NSA. People never really leave the CIA. Hell if you're the husband of a CIA agent, they'll use you!

       Keep in mind it isn't always manipulation.  There is a like self selection bias that creeps into many posts.  If the article or post is.too hyperbolic it draws opposing voices, if it is sensible it usually draws voices of agreement.  Even a.slight change in the title could change the kind of people that will click through to the comments.

       The tactic is used heavily here.  Not very effectively, and the known suspects aren't smart enough to keep it subtle.

       Shill - sorry...

       What's your definition of a shill? Seriously, let's see if we can even find agreement on that. For me, that definition would have include very technical things, like duplicate comments and posts etc, but only those things. If someone's obviously taking the time to write out responses, even if it seems pretty clear they are a shill, I wouldn't argue for banning them.

       I think there are better ways of defeating those accounts than your eloquently worded "banhammer".

       It's a way to silence people without notifying them. Super-cowardly behavior, but could be useful for obvious trolls.
