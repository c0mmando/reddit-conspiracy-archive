       I was the person who reuploaded the pedophilia and ritual UK video, with the two kids. The video was eventually, and predictably, deleted. I attempted to re-reupload it, but when I tried Google said "We've detected unusual activity in your account. Please enter in your phone number." and there is no other option, no second email, anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the next weird bit. I tried to log into my Facebook account, where I actively post videos/articles that contribute to the exposure of government crimes/conspiracies, and it would not let me access it. I KNOW I entered in my password correctly (I did it three times).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I tried to send a verification email. Guess what? Can't access it without my phone number. So now I have zero access to these things that I use every day. Is there something wrong? Am I being paranoid?

       Part 2. Before installing Linux (or just do this anyway) install and run Malwarebytes, Malwarebytes anti-rootkit and Kaspersky TDSSkiller as there's no point using a compromised system. After installing Linux install and run chkrootkit to be sure.

       They tend to leave that level of compromising to the big players is my guess, ordinary internet users probably wouldn't even realise they were rootkitted, other Govts. would. The big question is was your bios compromised before it even left the factory?

       i really don't get that HD firmware spyware, a harddrive can't do shit but read and write data, if the data i send to the hard drive is already encrypted, i don't quite get what the spyware is going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: ok here is a potential usage, it sends other executable data to your computer than the one you requested, and then it controls the computer and can intercept the data before encryption, but the spyware on the harddrive itself surely can't do much more than that?

       they keep different code base for different platforms? that's weird, seems like a security fix would be applied across all platforms, what's an argument against this?

       Hehe, computer noob since 1985 ;) I'm not an ubergeek but I try to keep up with issues, there's not a great deal of difference between the codebases TBH, I found this on oracle papers though 'All of the development and bug fixes happens in OpenJDK and then they are propagated to the Oracle JDK' but if you google 'Java vulnerabilities 2015' you can see how many issues have been found and fixed

       it's all good, i was just thinking that many people already have java going anyway, the tool didn't seem like much of a threat on its own, and a p2p search engine is among the priorities, so it seemed like a strong reaction against it, but if java is shit then that's fine, hopefully different versions of the client will come later

       I tend to avoid newer software as it hasn't had it's bugs ironed out yet, doubly so with java. p2p software would probably also be an infiltration priority to those who hate our freedoms...

       They can find out your IP address easily. Then it's just a matter of contacting your ISP correlated with that particular IP address, to find your actual physical address. Then they get your name and know exactly who you are, all your phone numbers, credit cards, email, regular mail, employment history, family, and so on.

       The only way to get around it is to use cash only, for everything. Use a burn and go cell phone with no paper trail, no connection to who you are. Buy a clean laptop with cash, never use it at home, only ever through public wifi, it's best if you go somewhere that doesn't have video cameras. Never use FB, email , or anything else identifying on that laptop , ever. Not even Darknet is wholly secure.

       I would say whoever it is already knows every little detail about OP.  Unless extremely technologically savy, this will really do no good unless OP is purely trying to go into some sort of hiding.  Assuming they traced OP from this account/one particular post, then they are far more advanced/have access to far greater data than your average tech savy redditor. If they already have OP's facebook/gmail accounts secured then chances are they know everything.  Unless they are planning on hiding their internet whereabouts only temporarily, then it really won't do much good.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all really comes down to who and why they are doing the hacking. (assuming it was directly associated with this post)

       To be completely honest though, I doubt anyone is actually hacking or following him. I use a VPN for torrents, and it always gives me a suspicious activity warning. Plus it's possible that someone else tried to log into his account. Google keeps track of where you log in from, and if there's something weird, it'll ask you to verify, by whatever other means of contact you have in your account.
      </p>

       It would be far easier and cost efficient to just take down the site that he linked to, rather than remove the link from reddit, or stalk him. I mean, if you post a link, and it immediately 404's, that just discredits the poster.

       I think it all depends on how tech-savy OP is, and what he can conclude about the information in his immediate situation.  A hired hack is fairly cheap/easy.  If it were government related, they have easy access to a lot of email and password lists along with readily available information on breaking certain accounts.  If it were one of the suspects in the case, they could have also hired someone to gain access to these accounts.  It could also very well be someone from reddit who wants to scare the shit out of OP.  It could also be coincidence and OP just messed something up.

       I run an e-Commerce business so I am pretty aware of what happens with all of my accounts, website, etc.,
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been hacked on 3 different occasions.  Based off of what had been happening in that given period of time I was able to identify one of the hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hack number 1 -  We had recently fired a brilliant programmer because he was racist.  It just so happened that he was a brilliant hacker as well.  All of the signs led us to him in that window of time. - Recent signup/badmouthing with an email account that we found posting in similar forums that were related to his other accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hack number 2 -  Based off of recent incidences we identified this one as either our main competitor or the previous employee who was fired.  We are still unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hack number 3 -  We still have no idea who this was.  We were actually able to locate the hacker through forums.  We contacted him and asked why he hacked us and he that it was purely to show us that we had a hole.  To this day we are still unaware of if it were a hired hack, someone looking for database access, or someone testing out new vulnerabilities in websites.

       Do you use a VPN?  Highly recommend it.  Not perfect, but it's a start.

       Never use Youtube.  I don't know why people still use it and think they can get away with posting whatever they want.  Youtube is the most censored video hosting site on the internet.  There are many others to use.  Vimeo, LiveLeak, Ustream, DailyMotion to name 4

       Remember that VPN flags you as being avoidant and the traffic will likely be stored and attempted to be decrypted.  It is likely any encryption scheme is already cracked as well.  God damn it.

       According to Snowden, all traffic is stored and decrypted.  That's the whole point.  So no, there's no avoiding it eventually, it just puts off the inevitable for now.

       Hiding your IP behind a VPN is a short term solution.  Other, better, long term solutions have been suggested.

       Is your email displayed in your facebook? Online brigades have been known to try and take over accounts, they probably insisted too much. This being said, you should stop linking your thoughts and identity all together.

       did you publish your email address anywhere that could be used to associate any of your usernames with that email account, it sounds like some douche just found your email address somehow. quite possible some of those friends over at that other sub that love to troll "conspiracy related media".
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are constantly logging into your accounts from different IP's, that could explain why facebook and google chose the "lock account" option?
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think it is any spy program related activity going on here, you would never know they were in your gmail account unless you were checking your activity log constantly (i had some very suspicious entries magically vanish on my gmail account, right around the whole anonymous/occupy thing after posting a bunch of controversial ideas in a chatroom somewhere, early nov. 2013. i only caught it because i habitually check activity every time i log in, also right around the time my phone started dying really fast, and (still to this day 2 phones later) sometimes disappears off the network untill i reboot it)   i'm pretty sure by now they have worked those bugs out, and i still have not received payment for my beta testing services. i don't know where to mail the invoice to.
      </p>

       this sounds like somebody is just fucking with you and trying to make you scared and stop spreading information, or someone wants more personal information for other reasons.   i would advise against providing this information, but if you do chose to use a "burner phone" or something, do it away from home, and discard it.  bluetooth has a range of like 10+ meters, wifi is even longer, all of your devices have signatures that can be identified, and later located (if you are actually dealing with a sophisiticated wouldbe intruder and they have a ballpark guess of where you live)   /p
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr  it's most likely somebody trying to scare you, do not be persuaded by these sad attempts at information supression, don't let the terrorists win,  and keep it classy.
