       It is obvious that the United States shows an insurmountable amount of favoritism and biased to Israel. My question is why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this subreddit can be full of memes and click-bait at times, so I want to take this opportunity now for anyone with legitimate knowledge and sources to please share with the rest of us. What are the direct links between the United States and the embarrassingly blatant influence Israel has on our politics, culture and military?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the people? How is the money distributed? How did it get this way? And, where will it lead the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't ask this to start argument, I earnestly ask this to be informed. Thank you in advance.

       Between AIPAC, rich Jews owning all the American media, a large portion of our American politicians with dual Israeli citizenship, and a large percentage of zealously religious conservatives who believe that Israel must exist in order for Jesus to return, Israel can get away with whatever the fuck it wants to.

       Those are Jews, not Israeli citizens. Barbara Boxer, for example, never held an Israeli citizenship. So, again: name two.

        quoting Stephen Steinlight
       </a>
       (Senior Policy Analyst at Center for Immigration Studies):
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll confess it, at least: like thousands of other typical Jewish kids of my generation, I was reared as a Jewish nationalist, even a quasi-separatist. Every summer for two months for 10 formative years during my childhood and adolescence I attended Jewish summer camp. There, each morning, I saluted a foreign flag, dressed in a uniform reflecting its colors, sang a foreign national anthem, learned a foreign language, learned foreign folk songs and dances, and was taught that Israel was the true homeland. Emigration to Israel was considered the highest virtue, and, like many other Jewish teens of my generation, I spent two summers working in Israel on a collective farm while I contemplated that possibility. More tacitly and subconsciously, I was taught the superiority of my people to the gentiles who had oppressed us. We were taught to view non-Jews as untrustworthy outsiders, people from whom sudden gusts of hatred might be anticipated, people less sensitive, intelligent, and moral than ourselves. We were also taught that the lesson of our dark history is that we could rely on no one.

       And the question was about dual Israeli citizens, which is apparently something folks here think is endemic while being unable to produce a single example. Coming in to say the point is irrelevant because of one quote that demonstrates "many" Jewish Americans aren't completely loyal to America is either goalpost shifting or derailing. Feel free to pick one.

       It's not even that complex.  It is nepotism by similar people of similar backgrounds that has gained a gradual control over "privileged occupations".  This control over these crucial areas has allowed them to gain power and shape public perception.

      <p>
       It's not even "Jewish people"... it's more like far right extremist jewish people.  It would be similar to saying that Christians are all as crazy as the policy positions of the bush family.

       Upon looking into these people, it is seen from their alumnus and Papal knighthood statuses and connections that they are all loyal hofjuden working to revive Rome's Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of  bankers are in fact not Jewish, but are white gentile Knights of Malta.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York Stock Exchange on Wallstreet was directed by Edward L. Hennessy, Jr. - a Knight of Malta (and member of other Knighthoods), and former financial adviser to the Vatican!
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the media, Redstone, the owner of Viacom received training from Jesuit Georgetown University. Rupert Murdoch is a Knight of St. Gregory. Director Emeritus of Disney until his death was Roy Disney, who was also a Papal Knight in the Roman Catholic Order of St. Gregory. Also notable is the fact that since 1996, a man named Leo J. O'Donovan, S.J. has been on the board of Disney. O'Donovan is a Jesuit priest and the former President of Georgetown University, the Jesuit stronghold of Washington DC. NBC's key people including its CEO are Roman Catholics and Bob Wright who served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at NBC , having had one of the "longest and most successful tenures of any media company Chief Executive" is also a Roman Catholic who was educated at Jesuit Holy Cross College. CBS is owned by Viacom, which we've already covered. As of 2009, one of the directors of CBS Corporation, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., is a Roman Catholic man who was also Jesuit-trained at the College of the Holy Cross, the Jesuit fortress of Massachusetts. Califano is a Papal Knight of Malta. Another of their directors, Charles K. Gifford, was Chairman Emeritus of the Bank of America, which is 51% owned by the Jesuits and was founded by a Knight of Malta (A.P. Gianni). Another director is Robert D. Walter, who is Roman Catholic. Etc..

       The center of power in the US are the privately owned Federal Reserve Banks with their relationships to Wall Street Mega banks. If you don't understand the Feds role, (with the Mega Banks) in your economy you cannot understand who owns/ controls your political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first and only study that revealed its owners was done by Eustace Mullins more than 65 years ago. It turned out that they were all Jewish families from Europe, the Rothschilds being the most powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mullins at the time had to virtually camp out at the library of Congress for many months to get this information, which he put into his book "Secrets of the Federal Reserve".
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much all "conspiracy theory" especially Anti Zionist stuff on the Internet today derives from Mullins' work. Pretty much all of it, either repeats his work or is bogus, (most of it).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case the Rothschilds were behind the Balfour declaration and the formation of the State of Israel by writing off war debts in exchange for political favors.

       Today who owns the Federal Reserve banks is a secret more closely guarded than advanced nuclear technology. Those who talk don't know and those who know don't talk.

       But it is highly likely that the Rothschilds are still major owners. And while a one to one identity between that family and the state of Israel is almost certainly untrue, it is clear that Israel is the Rothschild family's favorite charity.

       From a military standpoint, by now the American and Israeli Military Industrial Complexes are completely interwoven and the CIA and the Mossad work as brothers, (who sometimes bicker) to do jobs for each other.

       What it all boils down to however, is that your congress and political system is a giant whore house which sells itself to those with the most money. And the uber rich Jewish financial families have more of it than pretty much anyone and are for your politicians their very best customers.

       Currency likely holds 1/100th of the worlds wealth.  There is an estimated $65 Trillion if you add all currencies together, electronic and paper.  The LIBOR scandal is believed to be at least $330 Trillion in derivatives, the precious metals scandals at least double that, $660 Trillion.  These people don't need money.  Look higher.

       Perhaps you are confusing currencies with the production of money. I think of currency as printed paper money. As you said that might represent 1/ 100th of money that exists as electronic credits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The enormous numbers you gave for derivative scandals, must have been of notional values. The actual monetary values of the underlying contracts must have self canceled or they would have blown the world's banking systems sky high.

       It is hard to know exactly, but I would hazard a guess that the same families control all of the Anglo 5 nations plus the EU. I call this group along with Israel and Japan- EMPIRE. In their endless hubris they call themselves "The World Community"

       I usually just say globalists or world elite, those who use ideologies and countries and groups as tools and commit their crimes by proxy and by shadow.  It becomes very confusing if you try to narrow it down to one specific group that shares a common bond because I think the NWO is made up mostly of
       <em>
        individuals
       </em>
       , powerful individuals.  The only common bond they share is their desire for power and control and their willingness to work together to achieve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but if I had to go with one specific group, the international central banking cartel would probably be a good place to start.

       The military industrial complex makes way more money from an unstable middle east than taxes sent to Israel.  Israel plays a massive part in keeping the ME unstable(as do their own religious and political problems).
      </p>
      <p>
       A stable or semi stable ME would eventually become a viable competing economy that values its resources and, as history has shown, the big boys don't like competitors.  Russia's moves away from from the Anglo-American economy, the petrodollar, the SWIFT payment system etc is a good example of this.

       if you are going to bring up Russia, it helps a LOT that the oligarchs in America have a lot more free reign than the oligarchs of Russia.  You have oligarchs in America investing in disruptive technologies such as bitcoin and solar energy (intuitive against the petrodollar) whereas oligarchs in Russia have to goose step whatever Putin tells them to do which includes moving away from the petrodollar.

       Jews are intelligent and ruthless. They like to secure power. They have been able to gain control over many important areas of American life, such as the media (almost all of it is controlled by Jews), banking and finance, the legal system, the universities. Jews have also bribed Congress and corrupted it, so that it no longer serves the interests of the American people. Jews use their wealth to interfer with and determine the outcome of presidental elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are able to do all this because Christians are compassionate, generous, and fair-minded. Christians permitted Jews to gain this power over Christian societies. It was a mistake, of course, a suicidal mistake, because Jews hate white Christians and want to subjugate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is really just an extension of this Jewish power game.

      <p>
       So you're saying none of them even have this thing - but they MIGHT, so we should stop it. But people who have other passports, Canadian ones and such. That's not a conflict of interest? Why is it only bad if the country hands over a passport for being a Jew? They probably do that because Jews are like 10 million people, it would hardly be a useful system for canada or the EU.

      <p>
       I haven't met many Jews who think this. Israel is the most multicultural place in the middle east and the only place with freedom of press, religious freedom, etc. I'd rather live in Greenland than the middle east too. But short of Istanbul I'm not sure many other cities in the middle east I'd want to go as a white guy other than Tel Aviv

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I know an Australian who left Australia specifically to go join the IDF and never came back, and I never heard from him again. People vary a lot. I think there are a lot of right wingers in Israel but it's the Jewish homeland, peolpe will gravitate towards it. You'll see it with comedians - some talk about going to ISrael as if it was amazing, some hate it. I figure it's the same amongst most jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see how having two passports would effect anything, I don't think the US congress could become any more pro-israel or anti-muslim at this point.

       The US and Britain practically created the modern state of Israel. Also the upper elites in the US government have traditionally been evangelical Christians for the last 50ish years, for whom the state of Israel plays a large role in end time prophesy theology. Of course this is changing as younger generations come into power.

       I can't speak for direct sources, but I do know the Evangelical population of the US has a positive religious bias towards Israel. My grandma's church hosts an event called "A Night to Honor Israel," and I'm 99% sure my Pentecostal parents take it literally when God says to the Israelites, "I will bless those that bless you, and curse those who curse you," in the Bible. I'm paraphrasing, so no precise scriptural reference, but they think that still applies to the Israeli population in the middle east today. Since they make up maybe a quarter of the US population and tend to be more vocal about their beliefs they tend to have some sway on American foreign policy in that arena.
       <br/>
       Googling the event just now brought me to
       <a href="http://www.cufi.org/site/PageServer">
        this website
       </a>
       for a group called Christians United for Israel, which has what it calls "The Israel Pledge" on the bottom of the page:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         We believe that the Jewish people have a right to live in their ancient land of Israel, and that the modern State of Israel is the fulfillment of this historic right.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         We maintain that there is no excuse for acts of terrorism against Israel and that Israel has the same right as every other nation to defend her citizens from such violent attacks.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         We pledge to stand with our brothers and sisters in Israel and to speak out on their behalf whenever and wherever necessary until the attacks stop and they are finally living in peace and security with their neighbors.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That jives with a lot of what I heard in church growing up whenever this topic was broached, so it's probably somewhat familiar to enough of the Christians in America to be relevant.

       1/3 of Americans identify as being some form of Evangelical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evangelicals believe in biblical prophecy including the rapture. To make the rapture happen they believe that the Jews must return home to Israel and be the sole owners of that land once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically religious fairy tales

       It all starts with the fairly recent theology called "dispensationalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispensationalists believe that the nation of Israel is distinct from the Christian Church,[2]:322 and that God has yet to fulfill his promises to national Israel. These promises include the land promises, which in the future world to come result in a millennial kingdom and Third Temple where Christ, upon his return, will rule the world from Jerusalem for a thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, promises to Israel from the Bible are still waiting to be fulfilled, and it is evangelical's belief that they can assist this by helping Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find out how this happened, look at C. I. Scofield and the "Scofied Study Bible" which gives a very Protestant worldview, including a lot of  eschatological speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Bush believed this and supported the Iraq war in part to do his part of defending Israel against the biblical foes Gog and Magog.

       1) Idealogically speaking. the U.S. is generally committed to supporting democracy. Israel is a committed democracy in an area with a strong trend towards theocracy and dictatorships.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Religiously speaking. the American Evangelical Right tends to support Zionism because the existence of Israel is a part of Revelations and the End Times prophecy. Many American Jews also strongly identify with Zionism out of a desire to have an ancestral ethnic homeland, even if they do not hold dual citizenship with Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Morally speaking, I feel like most Americans would agree there's a human rights justification for supporting Israel, notably as a reparation for the ethnic cleansing they faced in the holocaust and a duty to protect a minority Jewish population from the often-hostile Muslim majority that surrounds their borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Militarily, Israel's need to fend off attacks from nearby hostile states and political groups represents a pretty large market for the newest, most expensive, and most profitable military equipment. American defense contractors and the politicians who count those defense contractors among their constituency would not want to lose Israel as a strong market for weapons, so pandering to Israel has potentially large correlations to revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I don't put much stock in the angle that Wall Street and the Media are controlled by a secret cabal of Zionists, though I suppose there are likely just as many Zionists there as anywhere, and definitely a lot of moneyed interest and influence, so there will be some notable overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id also like to point out the moral case in (3) resonates much less with today's American youth - the horrors of WW2 are a distant piece of history, Israel seems perfectly capable of defending itself without us, and the plight of the occupied Palestinian territory and their struggle for independent democratic statehood makes Israel look like a hypocritical anti-democratic bully instead of the much bullied champion of democracy they claim to be.

       Pure lip service. The US doesn't give a fuck about democracy unless it can be used as a rallying cry to topple a government, remove or install dictators, use sanctions, or invade countries.

       Seems the 'grip' is mutual. I'm thinking maybe capitalism has a lot to do with the US/Israel relationship, and sometimes these dividends take time to fruit, and are sometimes unrecognizable as currency to outsiders.

       Cold War policies would be your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East has been a hotspot for decades, and with Israel being the only ally we could count on over there, we just funneled money into them, and they became dependent on us. It's logical with a dependency on us for money, weapons, protection even, that they would put money into influencing us.

       A Christian friend recently told me that it was blasphemous for me to state that Israel did not exist as a nation before 1948.  Other Christian neighbors &amp; friends have told me their ardent support of Israel is because their end time views involve that nation.  They believe their rapture requires Israel even though they couldn't find that nation on a map.  So they are happy to support foreign aid to that nation along with anything else asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, my anecdotes are not proof of anything.  However, enough Christian politicians trek over to Jerusalem for photo-ops that maybe the reporters following along should ask how their rapturous views of Israel are influencing their foreign policies.

       Israel plays a huge part in Biblical end times, which is literally playing out in front of us.  In a nut shell, and I'm no Bible scholar, Israel will be left to stand against her enemies (read Islam whose DOCTRINE is to kill Jewish people), and the people will call out to God to save them and Jesus will return and defend Israel Himself.  It's also prophesied that whoever turns their back on Israel, or deals with her treacherously, will have to answer to God.  The conflict is more spiritual than anything else.  !!!This is an answer to OPs question, I'm not trying to start an argument either, nor do I want to argue islam's doctrine,  the existence of God, or the accuracy of the Bible!!!

       I do get frustrated that Christian folk in the US seem to worship Israel as a manifestation of the likeness of Jesus Himself. In reality, all throughout the Bible, God constantly condemns Israel for turning from God, allowing its enemies to rule over Israel when it is especially far from God. Obviously God never gives up on Israel, but allows them wallow in the free choice of sin like any other sinner. I see current times as no different, Israel, for the most part, does not hold the Christian Messiah as authoritative and certainly does not turn to God alone, given that the land is becoming more secular by the hour. Much like the united states.

       Here in Latin America, if the Bible says "the people of God", christians don't think it's about Jews. They think it's about them. (Ironic, because there's a chance it's talking about jews)  So, I'm not sure about your comment.

       I agree.  I think, though, that when her allies leave Israel to defend herself, the common thought is that the remnant who believe will cry out to God, and He'll hear them.  Then the you have the two witnesses who show up and preach repentance and Jesus to them.  And wow, there are some arguments about who those two are too lol! However, God made some promises to Abraham, Jacob and Isaac and God has said for His own name's sake, He'll save His own.  If you know anything about prophesy, the signs are all around us.

       I do believe it is considered blasphemous to speak for God. Did God really make them all of these promises, or did they just assert it?

       I'm going to ignore your first paragraph there because the way I read it, you're accusing me of claiming I speak for God.
       <br/>
       The two witnesses can be found in the Book of Revelation chapter 11.  They will proclaim their testimony and witness to Israel (and the world). They will have the ability to keep it from raining, turn water to blood, and generally be all Biblical with the plagues and unkillable until they have fulfilled what they were assigned to do.  Then their dead bodies will lay in the street for 3.5 days and all the world will celebrate like it's christmas because these two get all judgy on them and no one likes it. Then the two will stand up, come alive again and ascend into heaven when God calls them.  The argument is who are these two.  Is it Moses and Enoch; Moses and Elijah; Moses (old testament) and Paul (new testament), James and John (Sons of Thunder); two random believers; the old testament and new testament itself; did it already happen during the French revolution?  Etc. Quite the debate.

       Just want to point out that your point on Islam is incorrect.

       However that being said, Islam is actually what Judaism and Christianity were originally. When Jesus peace be upon him comes back, he will be amongst the Muslims.

       Excellent question. The religions that don't have an answer to this simply cannot be true. How is it fair that everyone who lived before Judaism and the Torah simply goes to hell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Islam explains this as being that in total there were 144,000 prophets sent to mankind in total.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among them include Adam, Lot, Abraham,Moses, Joseph, Jesus etc and finally Muhammad (peace be upon them all).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is not much use for us to know every single Prophet, so only 25 are mentioned in the Quran. But Allaah states that every nation and community was sent a messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       So every single civilisation preceding Judaism etc, was sent a Prophet. However they have all changed their message. But we do not know who these prophets were.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that ancient Sumerians, the Mayans etc all had prophets sent to them, but over time then people changed the message and it devolved into the things we knew them to believe in last.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final Prophet was sent to the whole of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muhammad peace be upon him.

       Actually, this is what muslims believe.  The jews are waiting for the savior to rise.  The muslims are waiting for the 12th imam and the Chrisitains are waiting for Jesus to return.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Christians believe the Anti-christ will rise to power and the jews will follow him.  The muslims will also follow him thinking he is the 12th imam.  The chrisitans believe the rest of the world will be decieved into following the anti-christ and only the most elite in Christ will be saved from the tribulation.

       Not arguing... more so adding. Israel was prophesied to come back. Christian folk seem to assume Christ was the Jewish messiah that they had been waiting for on earth when in actuality he wasn't. They denied him. He didn't come to bring the old and new together like the CHURCH did. He came speaking against those in power and control at the time... who brought back Israel? Why should Christians stand with the gov't body of Israel? Seems anti-christ to me. I stand with all the people of Israel. Not what these men have brought back. It is not of God.

       I agree and disagree with you there, I agree about standing with the man-on-the-street in Israel, and that trusting in government isn't always the best course of action.  However, the scriptures do tells us that Israel has been blinded to who Jesus is so that the message will travel and the rest of us (gentiles) have to opportunity to be saved.  When "the fullness of the gentiles is come in" is over, God will deal with Israel.  We're just about there.

       Re-reading your comments, I guess we don't.  Usually I hesitate to comment in such a Biblical way, because they're so much hatred on here for Israel.  And I mean venomous, blinding hatred.  I tend to stay away from that.  The spiritual aspect of the whole thing really can't be ignored though, cuz it's going by what's already written down.

       I would like to chime in and say, even though I post a lot of anti-Israeli things on this sub, my posts are generally directed towards the Government of Israel and it's racist and elitist policies.  I have no hatred to Jews as a people.  Hell, I hate my own caucasian brethren more than I hate anyone else.  I guess the purpose of this post is to clear my own conscious, because I do post a lot about Israel, and it bothers me.  I don't want to be viewed as a racist.  I don't hate tge people, just the government.

       And to be honest with you, and please, please take no offense, the way I see what you're doing is already written down to promote people turning their backs on Israel then they will be forced to stand alone and rely solely on God. Therefore you're (like it or not) promoting their redemption.

       I take no offense to that.  I understand it's meaning :-) That's just not my intention lol.  Yet I understand that sometimes there are underlying effects to our actions.  I speak out against Israel because I feel it needs to be done.

       Haha!  I appreciate your efforts.  Honestly, I really do.  Someone has to do it. I point out occasionally that Bibi is a 33rd degree mason, and that connects him to a bigger thing than just the government of Israel, but that's just the earthy implications.  You won't catch me bad-mouthing Israel because I don't want to have to answer for that.

       I have a theory.  Israel has, or wants the US to think they have, the Ark of the Covenant.  This sacred object, said to hold the tablets of Moses in legend assured victory to whatever army held it.  Perhaps Israel uses this as a bargaining tool?  "Protect us and the Ark is yours if you ever really need it."

       Perhaps you are confusing currencies with the production of money. I think of currency as printed paper money. As you said that might represent 1/ 100th of money that exists as electronic credits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The enormous numbers you gave for derivative scandals, must have been of notional values. The actual monetary values of the underlying contracts must have self canceled or they would have blown the world's banking systems sky high.

       Vatican?  Not Jews.  CIA/NSA/most of the MIC?  Not Jews.  Skull &amp; Bones/Freemasonry/etc.?  Not Jews.  Chatham House/Tavistock Institute/Bilderberg/etc.?  Not Jews (at least not all).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying, the problem is far beyond the scope of just "the Jews".  Plus I doubt many of these powerful Zionist Jews even practice Judaism at all, they're probably kabbalists and secret society members if anything.
