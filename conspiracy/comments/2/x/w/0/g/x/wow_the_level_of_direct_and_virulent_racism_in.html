    <div class="md"><p>I might not agree with what someone else says, or thinks. But I do respect their right to say what they think. That&#39;s the greatest thing about this sub right now. You can express whatever controversial thing you like. Of course that means others are going to do the same.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that some of us will say controversial things even by our own standards. But it&#39;s better to let them say what they think. That&#39;s the true test of Free Speech. </p>

<p>As soon as you start regulating what can and can&#39;t be said, you no longer have Free Speech.... you&#39;ve got controlled speech instead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of free speech.

    <div class="md"><p>Now I don&#39;t want to offend you in any way, but using that term, &quot;race&quot;, is quite outdated and a little backwards... The cientific community made it clear a while back that there is no such thing as a race when it comes to human beings, all of us carry a different ethnicity. Just think about it, every single human being has a pyramid of ancestors below them, first your parents which are 2, then your grandparents who are 4, then your great grandparents who were 8, and the number keeps multipliyng by two until you reach the end... If you go 10 generations back in your pyramid, that&#39;s 2044 different people, and you can&#39;t be sure about their origins either. You might have in those 2044 ancestors one out of every continent and still be &quot;caucasian&quot; because most of your family had white skin. I don&#39;t know how many different ethnicities there are, but there&#39;s a lot of them throughout the world...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks but no need for that, your appreciation is more than enough actually! And I honestly don&#39;t know the word race and racism still gets thrown around everywhere anytime, all this hate is simply a tool to distract people of more important stuff going on in the world in my opinion, because basically and technically almost everyone on the planet has different ethnicities... Only your brother or sister will share your exact same ethnicity for example, if we put things in the perspective i mencioned before.</p>

bullshit i see here on a daily basis. Oh, the jews control
everything, well if that&#39;s true, how come this antisemitic
crap is even allowed? and why is israel surrounded by it&#39;s enemies,
surely if we jews controlled everything, we could send in the
marines to clean out hezbollah, hamas.</p>

<p>People need to come to the realization that all this jew
conspiracy nonsense is just the same old diversionary

    <div class="md"><p>Umm, the statement you quoted is completely accurate and true. What we call the &quot;modern world&quot; was created by whites. You may not like it, but that&#39;s the reality. You remember reality, don&#39;t you? It&#39;s the thing that political correctness cannot intimidate or influence.</p>

<p>Blacks as a race have produced nothing of significance that contributes to Western civilization. That, too, is the reality. I know you like to feel all warm and cuddly about Black History Month, but most of what is said about the contributions of blacks are outright lies or gross distortions of the truth.</p>

<p>Look at sub-Saharan Africa, where the negro race originates. What civilization did negroes produce over the past ten thousand years? <em>They didn&#39;t even invent the wheel.</em> Every advancement came from the Mediterranean, where there are Mediterranean whites, not blacks. Egypt was a white nation. So was Carthage. They were not negroid.</p>

<p>Blacks in America have been a drain on the nation from the beginning. At the same time, American blacks have benefited enormously over African blacks, mostly by interbreeding with whites. When a black breeds with a white, the black&#39;s children get a ten point increase in IQ. African blacks have an IQ of around  75. American blacks have an IQ around 85 (white IQ is 100). We&#39;re speaking here of average IQ levels by racial division, not individual IQs.</p>

<p>Look, you&#39;re black, so I understand why you are so defensive about the role of blacks in the world. You don&#39;t want to face reality, and you have the convenient dodge of modern political correctness, which maintains the absurd fantasy that blacks are just as intelligent or just as capable of creating a civilization as whites. <em>They are not!</em> Come to terms with this truth. Your race is intellectually inferior to whites and Asians, significantly inferior. That is not a racial prejudice, that is the reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell? You must be inbred if you make a statement like this and think you can back it up using these &#39;clever&#39; remarks. You sir are an idiot, and you just wrote some of the dumbest shit I ever read.</p>

<p>Firstly, what you call &quot;the modern world&quot; or &quot;civilization&quot; is the reason the <strong>HUMAN RACE</strong> is a plague on planet earth. The system creates poverty, polution, unsustainable growth, human animal and environmental slaughter, and it promotes &quot;values&quot; like ignorance hate and fear. I am what you call &quot;white&quot; as in I have a &quot;white&quot; skin tone and I feel offended when you make these dumb statements and generalizations you dumb fuck, some people that have &quot;white&quot; skin may have pushed the agenda towards the world we are living today but I&#39;ll bet that the people who helped globalize the system and the ones that are in power don&#39;t all share the same skin tone.</p>

<p>Secondly, african people have a beautiful culture and history, and yes Egypt was a &quot;black&quot; nation, just go look at the nubian people and if that isn&#39;t enough for you, guess what, what you call &quot;brown&quot; people or north african people are still what you call &quot;black&quot; you fucking pig! The egyptian civilization is one of if not the most advanced ancient civilization there is record of. And don&#39;t even go on about how african people have been a &quot;drain in the nation&quot; in your country, they have been marginalized ever since they got there in the first place, if you ever lived in the same conditions some of those people had to live in your &quot;land of the free&quot; you wouldn&#39;t say such a thing, and I&#39;m not here defending african people because some were slaves once, because slavery was a worlwide thing milleniums before.</p>

<p>And to finish, no man or woman&#39;s &quot;intelligence&quot; can ever be limited or granted by their ethnicity, you pathethic excuse for a human being! To even discuss anyone&#39;s &quot;intelligence&quot; is idiotic in the first place, as it is a relative value nowadays in the shitty world we live in today. And <em>this</em> is reality, you cocksucker.</p>

No one is saying let&#39;s flood Africa with Asians
No one wants to live in African because the whites have fucking destroyed it to such a huge extent. And this is not some sort of &quot;racist conjecture&quot; here. This is 100% proven, historical fact.&quot;</p>

If we look at the negro part of Africa, we see ... nothing. No civilizations of any significance, no  great building works, no important contributions to human science or culture. All advances in civilization came from outside, and Africans were unable to use them effectively without the support and guidance of whites.

<p>Or consider India. Or China. Huge civilizations that aren&#39;t Caucasian. </p>

<p>Or research the actual dates of the pyramids and the Sphinx. I&#39;ll give you a hint, they predate ancient Egypt by tens of thousands of years. And remember that Cleopatra existed closer to today than even the shallowest dates on the pyramids.</p>

<p>Or consider the Aborigines in Australia. The hands down oldest civilization on the books. They will probably outlast modernity, as Australia could benefit from climate change and is likely to enjoy lower radioactivity after us dumb &quot;high civ&quot; folks nuke ourselves into extinction.</p>
