    <div class="md"><p>The front page of Reddit is a good way to find out what is bullshit news anymore. I wouldn&#39;t even call it journalism myself.</p>

<p>Look at the front page posts accounts. Most being the first post they make. And accounts that are new and old. Its a real tell to me when you have no history and then boom a front page post. </p>

<p>It takes so much to get there. I mean even hitting front page of the sub in which you post is impressive most the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a good way to check the pulse for the 18-34 male demo.</p>

<p>I agree about front page too.</p>

<p>Best I have been able to do is get a /bestof or two and one comment got 4k+ and a few golds about a month ago, but that was a strategic post that I knew was going to rise to the top based on the user and content in the link.</p>

<p>I refuse to pay for upboats, although it is obvious that many do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you get 100 comment and link karma you can post freely within any sub. When it drops below that you can&#39;t. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I care about. It sucks you have to wait. Got into an srd fight once in their sub. It was a one sided argument all the way cause everything I said was down voted to negative 100.</p>

<p>Its the way some are thou they want to know they are right. Me thou I don&#39;t mind being wrong and even admitting it when I am. But fuck man pet someone have a say. </p>

<p>Oh well dust in the wind right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dust in the wind, surely. It is the only big flaw I find in the reddit sphere - where you can be effectively silenced. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be OK with it regarding the links submitted, but being able to be silenced/hidden is awful.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve hit the -20s and -30s before - and that&#39;s when you know you have to change tactics in subs to get people to start listening to what you have to say. If anything, it&#39;s given me experiences into how to shape arguments in different ways and be as versatile as possible, with sources in both main and alt media sites, to be able to back up your shit.</p>

<p>It has made me far more effective in my wordsmithing (if that&#39;s a verb, probably not), but it can be mentally exhausting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the 2 years of Reddit have tought me how to be tactful as well. Still can&#39;t spell for shit or punctuate worth a fuck. Oh well. </p>

<p>I still like how every so often you get one person that actually knows how to debate. Happens more in conspiracy then one might think. It is painful to see so many in here that are violent but only because they don&#39;t know what else to do. They see all the shit in the world and realise its too much.</p>

<p>I gave up saving the world I want to save 2 now. My wife and son. Makes it easier to manage. If I help some others great but its by chance and not design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do what I did. Get lego...... Its very therapeutic believe it or not. Also rewarding with some of the sets that are out.</p>

<p>We share our collection with our community. Kids love it and its even better to see adults interact with their children. That&#39;s why we do it. We started the program with a bit over 100 sets now we have over 1000. Never stop learning things. </p>

<p>Some of the models I leave at the library that hosts the event once a month. The kids ask questions on how it works and such. So they begin thinking about stuff. Instead of it just being a toy they gain an understanding of its workings.</p>

<p>Really cool way to reach youth of today.</p>
