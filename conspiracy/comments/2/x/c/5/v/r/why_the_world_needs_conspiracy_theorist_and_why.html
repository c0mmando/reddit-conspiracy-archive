        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><pre><code>   I am going to explain to people why it is so hard to convert a conspiracy theorist to what i will call the traditionalist and why right or wrong the world is a better place with them in it. 
  So firstly we would not have the magna carta, the bill of rights or the constitution without people that believe there needed to be checks and balances on government powers if people in high positions never attempted to hurt their subjects or populations or conspire against their best interest we would not need them.
   So conspiracy theorist have been around a long time through out history  government powers and traditionalist called them many names they were called a subvert, usurpers, heretics, apostates, iconoclast, witches, traitors, pagans, outlaws,savages,renegades. The argument I hear a lot is that conspiracy nuts slow down progress; to that i say better to progress slowly with someone criticizing you all the way then to progress with blind zealotry and pride. You are more likely to see where you may go wrong and avoid pitfalls.
    How come when i use science i cant change my conspiracy theorist friend&#39;s mind on (insert conspiracy theory)? The answer to that is simple science changes and makes changes quite often, I&#39;m sorry its &quot;corrected&quot;. What does not change in the mind of a conspiracy theorist is the fact that people threw out time will and have lied,cheated,stole,bribed, scammed, and killed people for their own gain that has not changed and will never be corrected it is also an experiment that is repeatable that garners the same results. 
    When you put people in power over others they will abuse them most of the time. When you put a person or set of people in the power of saying what is true or is not true according to science or religion they will use it eventually for the same purposes and ends; to a lot of conspiracy theorist, scientist are the priest class of our times as most of their works are directly funded by public universities and thus government and will even go so far as to call a lot of publicly funded science as &quot;scientism&quot;. 
     Another argument is that &quot;Conspiracy theorist hurt moral and our countries image this helps our enemies.&quot; Most of the enemies you speak of would not allow any decent or free speech of any kind. Popular speech does not need a first amendment be careful not to become your enemies to defeat them.

    <div class="md"><p>The world needs conspiracy theorists because conspiracies actually do happen. I don&#39;t think anyone (reasonable) is opposed to checks and balances or connecting relevant thoughts. It used to be called &quot;investigative journalism&quot; and it used to be the duty of the media which was regarded as its own institution of public service. Now, however, we&#39;re slowly sliding back to a time when yellow journalism rules. The high point, imo, of American journalism was from the mid 20th century to the end of the Clinton administration. We&#39;ll never get another Walter Cronkite or Dan Rather, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the two major problems people have with conspiracy theorists are that they 1) have a tendency to give equal credibility to grains of truth and demonstrably false accusations, and 2) turn conspiracies into battles against large (usually innocent) groups of people. Let me explain: how many times have you heard a conspiracy theorists accurately talk about the false pretenses of the Iraq War, the corrupt media, the militarization of the police, and then fall down a tangent of Bush being behind 9/11, lizard people ruling the world, or Bush Sr. killing JFK? It really gets to be too much at a certain point. Its like watching an Alex Jones video. Alex starts off simple, pointing out inaccuracies in some government statement and then sliding into a messianic rant. He so eloquently defends his views on the 2nd amendment during his shows, but when being interviewed by Pierce Morgan he completely loses his shit. </p>

<p>The other issue is incredibly troubling, given the fact that some of the groups conspiracy theorists turn against are persecuted. This subreddit, for example, has some troubling undercurrents of anti-Semitism, and while its not reaching Stormfront proportions, its unnerving to read. Other, slightly more comical assertions are that the Freemasons are calling the shots, or Bohemian Grove, or the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, whatever that means. Its the inability of many conspiracy theorist to understand that what rules the world is usually a concentration of mass wealth and mass consensus that does them in. People wealthy enough to be educated, and educated enough to amass meaningful power are not stupid enough to follow silly tribal lines. That might have worked for a while (the Freemasons were a serious threat during the founding of the country) but I liken these artificial tribes to the mafia. </p>

<p>The mob had a code of silence, and that code, that went as far as not speaking to each other while being in the same room alone with each other to avoid possible listening devices, was what made the mob so powerful. Nobody &quot;ratted&quot; because of this assumed quasi-divine allegiance to the group. However, in every group you&#39;re going to encounter people who are not as deeply committed as everyone else, and as soon as one mobster talked to the feds, the stack of cards fell and the mob has never been the same since. The same is true for all of these artificial tribes. The minute one rich person or politician breaks ranks, the whole thing falls apart. </p>

<p>Society was set up so that certain upper class elites retain most of the power while the lower classes retain the illusion of choice and individuality. Thats the whole point of the &quot;Century of the Self&quot; (hope its not the first time you&#39;re hearing that name). It just makes more sense that people who are more educated and move more money around have a higher say in the outcome of things. Its not that the lower classes don&#39;t matter, its just that they&#39;re (usually) not smart enough to figure out whats even being discussed (what Jonathan Gruber was trying to get across) or have little to nothing invested in the outcome if anything goes wrong. Money rules the world, not the Jews, Masons, ancient bloodline, etc. Of course this system can be abused, like Sheldon Adelson getting Lindsey Graham to campaign against online gambling in order for him to eliminate his competition, but this system has remained fairly stable and beneficial to he lower classes (compared to Russia and China&#39;s autocracy, European socialism, and South American totalitarianism).  </p>

<p>Boy that went on longer than intended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great rant man. I&#39;ve had come as twice as long and half as lucid. </p>

<p>You pointing out the decline of journalism is especially poignant. It is often that I get real news in this sub, compared to major outlets, and value the people&#39;s take here on issues far more than anyone on the telescreen - because we&#39;re dumping our thoughts for free consumption. Sure, we all have an agenda, but most try and keep it in check or their ulterior motives are hardly malicious. Most here want the world to be a better place, somehow, and we&#39;re working on how to get there Individually and collectively. </p>

<p>Thanks for the comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. The biggest problem with televised media and politics is the concessions you have to start making almost immediately in order to keep your job. You can&#39;t keep true to your values when your occupation is to push the &quot;values&quot; of other people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an interesting video, just under two minutes, where Chuck Todd slips up, and reveals a bit of the fear journalists have when it comes to confronting corrupt politicians. You should take a look.

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m at the service of anyone on the sub who wants to learn more about this stuff. I&#39;ve been following for years and am sure I&#39;ll post another rant someday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that. Cronkite returning from Vietnam and basically saying the war was a complete failure and pointless gave credence to millions of people who were slandered as traitors or unpatriotic for refusing to go along with the government narrative.</p>

<p>Dan Rather was the only legitimate mainstream journalist to touch on George W. Bush&#39;s sketchy record during his time at the Air National Guard, and faced complete career and reputation destruction for doing so. </p>
