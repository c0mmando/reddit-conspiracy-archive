        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whether you should be forced to vaccinate or not is a debate on individual rights.  It depends on your opinion. There is not enough official evidence for either side of the polarized vaxer/antivaxer movements to make it anything but opinionated.</p>

<p>Instead of fucking around with this bullshit, can we not just be a logical? Simply stay away from people if you are sick. If you have a fever, stay home. If you are coughing, sneezing, puking, excetera, use proper sanitation. If you are immunocompromised, understand that when you enter a crowded area you are at risk for catching many diseases. There are many things which are not vaccinated for that you have to be fearful of. Take proper precautions. Yes you are sick, but the world does not revolve around you. You have to decide whether you want to live riskily or not.</p>

<p>Instead of all this polarizing and hating on each other perhaps we should just help educate the public on proper sanitation. </p>

<p>This seems like a cheap and effective way to avoid disease spread.</p>

<p>If you still feel like pushing your view, provide clear, unbiased scientific evidence to back it up. No confusing propaganda. Educate people... do not perpetuate their indoctrination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get a load of this kid, throwing expletives telling a quarter million people how to think and live. You might have an undiagnosed personality issue something along the lines of narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;People with narcissistic personality disorder often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why would anyone take life lesson from someone like that. You show only disdain through repeated disrespect, for anyone who doesn&#39;t think like you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would motivate one quixotic tween to take on a hundred thousand subscribers with hateful, respect-less language and lessons on how to live? Someone who thinks he knows better than every other stupid fuck in the audience. Why? So he can say he did and inflate his sense of self-worth.</p>

<p>I think you should make an appointment before you become a cop or politician or parent.</p>

<p>The very idea of hospitals it&#39;s a strange one. Why put a bunch of immunocompromized sick people all in one building. There is literally s*** everywhere.</p>

<p>If you work a shift as a nurse at a hospital... You have sick person shit particles on your shoes despite all the cleaners and special precautions. The regulation and bureaucracy is not foolproof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not advocate for advanced nutritional support for systems most at risk for compromise, the young, instead of taxing them with inoculations? Why would you advocate for inoculating a 6 months infant, whose system then has to fight off and build antibodies against, introduced infection like MMR? </p>

<p>Optimum nutrition is how the human organism, and all organisms, best fight disease. Introduction of disease, attenuated or not, taxes the unprepared system that is still suckling at the tit.</p>

<p>Elderly people are susceptible to clostridum and e. coli and staph because their systems are weak and compromised and the viruses have been hardened-off against anti-biotics. They are compromised for obvious reasons, there isn&#39;t a reserve in the old body to sustain the immune system&#39;s fight against an organism that is stronger.</p>

<p>Defending your stance with &#39;omg doctor&#39;s offices and hospitals are the dirtiest places evarr&#39; is an immature one and ineffective because that&#39;s where children go to get their shots, that&#39;s where they&#39;re born and the same lack of sanitation and control can affect the vaccines that require stringent care to maintain effectiveness. The MMR vaccine has to be kept freezing cold and in the dark from production to administration. If a hospital can&#39;t keep feces out of the blood of it&#39;s patients, you expect the same folks to keep live vaccines in the dark?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the end of today&#39;s session. 5 cents please.</p>
