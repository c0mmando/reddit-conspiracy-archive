       how deceptive Jewish media outlets can be in nature: The 'JP' posted a brand new headline article today in which they made claims Iran made a mock up of an American Aircraft in orders to have a little circle jerk about it and shoot off missiles:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He added that "the Americans, and the entire world, know that the American Navy is one of our targets, and it will take us 50 seconds to destroy every US warship."
       </p>
       <p>
        During the military exercise, titled, "The Great Prophet," the Iranian military booby-trapped the Strait of Hormuz and fired surface-to-surface Fateh-110 missiles some 300 km.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Its basically your average Jewish-made non-sensical its another holocaust if we don't do something rant. What they conveniently ignore is that this is a movie prop:
       <a href="http://time.com/34963/iran-aircraft-carrier/">
        http://time.com/34963/iran-aircraft-carrier/
       </a>
       made to televise an event that happened a long time ago when the US shot down an Iranian civilian aircraft killing everyone on board.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as you should know by now, Jews do not want truth to come out. They take a tragic event that happened to Iranians, flip it around to be anti-American, because its all inherently anti-Jew, for the sake of preventing 'anonther holocaust'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let it sink in the layers of deception that are on-going with Israeli Jews. Next time you reflexively throw the word anti-semitism out there or feel embarassed for being a part of a sub that questions these notions, realize that we have all been conditioned not to question it.

       FYI dude no one with a brain in America supports Israel - only crazy religious nuts/irrational fundamentalists support or view Israel kindly, the rest of America views it as a little apartheid state full of crazy jewish people out in the deserts currently in the process of systematically brutalizing the human beings they violently stole the land they're on from, and that's almost the "mainstream view" in non-christian-fundamentalist land America(because it's just an obvious truth, it's equatable to a bunch of arabs coming and stealing Kansas because the OPEC council told them it was "theirs now").
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think there are very few rational adults who believe anything that comes from Haaretz or JP is anything other than propaganda coming from a people terrified that other people are going to visit upon them the violence they are visiting on others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas Iran is frequently described as "one of the friendliest places to travel on earth" from people who have been there and you guys currently aren't systematically brutalizing your neighbors.

       I figured that story was utter bullshit.  Of all the world governments, I rank your country next to Russia as one I trust the most.  Iran is constantly facing a smear campaign by the Israelis trying to get their lap dog the United States to attack.  Even going to such ridiculous links as this.

       Be careful about Russia.  Member of the UN, member of the IMF, and its central bank is a member of the BIS.

       Of course there is caution, but by simply examining the way Putin handles his business compared to other world leaders, he at least appears to deserve more respect than the rest.

       Wait really ? You should check out putin's rise to power documentary, it's what made me actually doubt the official 9/11 narrative and see truth in some theories, putin is as bad as they come, if anything he showed bush how effective his false flags were, he was the first foreign leader to contact the white house in the wake of the event saying something along the lines of "Russia knows your pain".. yea no shit you used the exact same play book to start a war on "terrorists"

       To counter this, find me another world leader as honest as Putin.  Seriously.  Besides the Ayatollah of Iran, there aren't many.  Of course he was KGB.  To me that's a credit for him.  He understands how shady business works.  He's watching himself be framed by the United States and he's handling himself with dignity and class, considering the situation.

       Honest ? Because he says shit like "it's ok for the us to meddle with smaller countries but when Russia does it's bad" and so on ? Come on man putin is full of shit in equal if not greater amounts than an erdogan or a bush, and it's much easier to see as his methods and propaganda are years behind that of the western bullshitters

       But he defended Bashar al Assad against the allegations of chemical weapons, and he was right.   His support if Assad as well as Iran has unwavered in spite of all the war horse propaganda spewed out against them.  Of course Putin is going to try and use propaganda, that's how you play the game.  As far as meddling with smaller countries, I don't know where you're getting that.  Is there something I'm missing about the Ukraine situation?  Is Russia really invading Ukraine, or is that what's being perpetuated in the media?  Some of the videos I've seen show Ukrainians bombing their own villiages trying to blame it on pro Russian rebels.  To me, that says a lot.  It's actually quite vital to consider this into the conflicts in the Middle East.  How important is it to make Russia look bad?  Extremely.  They support the governments of Syria
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       Iran.  Who doesn't like those governments?  I'm sure you can tell...

       I can't believe the love for Putin on this sub.  As you said he is as bad as they come.  Seriously people read up on The Moscow Apartment bombings and how it was clearly a false flag.  Then read up on the assassination of Litvenenko.  Putin was the top of the FSB (never heard of the FSB? then you sure as shit shouldn't be talking about how great Putin is).  He's a fucking intelligence agency oligarch (a little like George Bush sr.)

       I'm an American, actually.  I resent this country so goddamn much.  There's so much wrong with everything here, but I can't garner enough support to make a difference.  Everyone is too complacent ib allowing the shadows dance in their own way so long as it doesn't affect them in a way that they're aware of.  Little do they know that the shadows indeed do affect them directly.  My wish is to slap reality into every single world citizen.  Together we could overthrow the entire world.  It sickens me to think about how conplacent everyone is.

       Agreed, but appearances are often very deceiving when it comes to global politics, especially when they're mixed up with covert organizations and secret societies (which seems to be the case in many situations).  For what it's worth, I hope my suspicions are unfounded - but I see BRICS, and I think one world currency.

       I see where you're coming from.  To me, though, the one world currency is the petrodollar, and BRICS is a way for governments to  politely say "no way".  I could be wrong though.

       That just sounds like a classic Hegelian dialectic, two sides of the same coin - both of them one world currency in their own way and both backed (if my opinion is correct) by the same people.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, a better solution would be to completely open up the markets for currency exchange, allow as many different competing currencies as possible, and let consumers/the market decide which ones are working most effectively and which ones need to go.

       Supposedly but I'll believe that when I see it.  What's the hold up?  Why are they "on their way out" instead of just telling the IMF (and UN for that matter) to fuck off?

       Possibly better question: why is the IMF
       <em>

       Russia to remain if it's actually acting directly against the IMF's interests as is claimed?

       Yeah but regardless of whatever they are or are not doing, Russia is still a member of this organization it's apparently waging war against (both economic and literal).  To me this makes no sense whatsoever and is at least worthy of some skepticism on all of our parts.  The collusion between east and west has been apparent since at least the Bolshevik Revolution, but now these days there seems to be this idea that Russia is suddenly a sovereign nation who's opposed to the western elite and I just am not convinced of that yet.

      <p>
       But again, fighting a war with them - meanwhile they're all members of the same globalist organizations.  It doesn't make logical sense, at least not to me.

       I think the east and west drama is as fake as the repub versus dem nonsense in American politics.  Just another divide and conquer strategy, but one even deep thinking conspiracy theorists can believe and digest because the ptb and msn sources are clearly unified in their criticism of the east (Russia, china), making it easier for naysayers like us to recognize as bs and oppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am wrong, but I think the true conspiracy is that all the big countries with nukes and other advanced military tech are in cahoots on dividing the world into mini federations.  For example US takes Iraq so Russia gets Iran, etc...  Russia and the US are both dividing portions of the mid east right now for resources and for israel. It's all bargaining.  The only time an authentic beef arises (imo), is when one side goes farther than what they bargained for (ie us in ukraine) or when they can't reach a deal on how they are going to jointly and covertly conquer smaller resource rich or geographically relevant countries.

       I would not blame Iran if they did build a mock aircraft carrier for its defense forces to run drills against.  It seems like sound preparedness to me.

       But why would Iran need a carrier for a movie prop when that plane was shot down by a missile cruiser?

       As an American, I want to tell you, Persianpenisbox, that I just love Iranians. Many Americans have caught on to the jewish bullshit and don't fall for it anymore. They create fake victim narratives and if you refuse sympathy, you are one of them "anti-semites."

       If you are going to judge or dislike a country or group based on select media outlets, you are going to find yourself hating everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the media in any country, bias exists everywhere. Hell, check out the "news" sites commonly linked in this sub. They are unapologetically agenda driven. They don't even hide it or try to say otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is to read from a variety of sources, especially ones you disagree with, and put together a picture based on corroborating and conflicting reports.

       I don't think you're right - you're basically saying you cant make blanket statements because they are blanket statements, but here is a blanket statement about media outlets.

       No. I am saying it is an observed reality that bias exists, to varying degrees, in every media outlet.
      </p>

       To dislike a specific country based on the reports of a news outlet is to ignore this reality.

       No one said you couldn't?

      <p>
       You can dislike those who make these decisions. The OP says specifically in their title that the articles make them dislike "Israelis", as in all the people within the country. He then goes on to say things like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jews do not want truth to come out
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So clearly he is talking about the Jewish people as a whole. This is anti-semitism, with a very poor disguise of taking issue with israeli media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there individuals who will call you an anti-semite for disliking Israeli foreign policy or the things that listed in your post? Yes. And those people are wrongly taking advantage of an actual problem to gain support. No one moral supports that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But...when you take this behaviour and attribute to all individual Israeli's or even further, to Jews as a whole, then we have a problem. This is a distinction that I don't often see considered in this subreddit. Many act that because false accusations or racism and anti-semitism occur, that anti-semitism is some false concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a parallel example, I assume the American members of this community would take issue with being lumped in to American foreign policy.

       Anti-Semitism is just a form of racism specific to Judaism. So in that sense, fucking everyone has something like it. Because everyone can fall victim to racism.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe people hate them is not because of hate but because the Jews maybe are doing something bad?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is racist. An entire Ethno-Religious group comprised of millions of people cannot be proclaimed guilty of anything solely because of their heritage. Implying otherwise is the definition of racism. If you feel comfortable saying something like that, you are likely a racist.

       Is the education you receive in high school the best, or most complete? Of course not. In fact, depending on the school, it may be downright shitty. But compared to the comically ignorant, backwards, insane, hate-driven nonsense you are attempting to spew, collected from historically illiterate cesspools such as Stormfront or various other politically and emotionally motivated sites, I'd say even the worst hight school provides a more effective education. At least school get their textbooks from actual historians and not some bald-headed Fuck who is going to head out and try to earn his red laces after he's finished with his blog post.

       But you are dead on on the other point. I'm totally a conformy conformist hell-bent on conforming. That's absolutely the reason I'm not a Neo-Nazi. Its definitely not because I possess enough knowledge and human compassion to realize how fucking sad and dumb the whole movement is.

       I base my historical knowledge on historians.

       Not Nazis and weird religious books.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your accusations about me being a loser,again these are the type of personal attacks reserved for teenagers and apparently weird Nazi man-children. Hence my original guess of you being high school age or younger. Had you matured mentally beyond that age, you likely would've realized how petty those types of insults sound to actual adults.

       Alright, you are getting redundant now. Novelty has worn off I guess. Have a good one, you've been genuinely entertaining!

       If what you wrote here was ever attached to your name, you would not be able to get a job in most professions. People would laugh at you. The civilized world literally hates you. Have a good night, you impotent ant. You deserve to be spat on.

       No. I am saying it is an observed reality that bias exists, to varying degrees, in every media outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       To dislike a specific country based on the reports of a news outlet is to ignore this reality.
