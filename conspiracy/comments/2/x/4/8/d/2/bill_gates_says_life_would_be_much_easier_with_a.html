        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://theantimedia.org/bill-gates-says-life-would-be-much-easier-with-a-world-government/">From The Anti Media:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent interview with the German publication <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/bill-gates-im-interview-den-taeglichen-tod-nehmen-wir-nicht-wahr-1.2324164"><em>Süddeutsche Zeitung</em>,</a> Bill Gates made some disturbing comments in favor of world government.</p>

<p>Not only did Gates advocate global government, but he also spoke favorably of the UN and NATO, completely overlooking that they are a major force of oppression in the world. NATO can’t even hold a meeting without thousands of people gathering in the streets to protest their actions. Someone as heavily involved in world affairs as Bill Gates should know all about this.</p>

<p>During the interview last month, Gates said, “Take the UN, it has been created especially for the security in the world. We are ready for war, because we have taken every precaution. We have NATO, we have divisions, jeeps, trained people. But what is with epidemics? How many doctors do we have as much planes, tents, what scientists? If there were such a thing as a world government, we would be better prepared. “</p>

<p>Not long ago this subject was considered a total conspiracy theory, but now one of the richest people in the world is openly suggesting that this is a good idea. Governments are generally a pretty bad idea, even when they are small they can still do a tremendous amount of damage. So when a government rules the entire planet, there is no telling what type of atrocities it will be capable of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germanys government was corrupt enough to start a world war.  Twice.  How corrupt are they now? No idea.  Its only been a couple years since iceland had a huge banking scandal involving high ranking government officials. So I guess as corrupt as the rest of them at varying stages. </p>

<p>You need to learn your history. Germany didn&#39;t start WWI and Germany&#39;s government has changed significantly since the end of WWII.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>had a huge banking scandal involving high ranking government officials</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who are now imprisoned and the bail-out was to the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, for him. A world government, even if it was the most divine and perfect government, would lead to all out war, mainly because no one would trust it. But we have seen what governments do by looking at the past, and the present. There&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;good&quot; government in the sense that they can&#39;t make us happy. They can&#39;t bring us happiness because our lives are still up to us. We still have to pick, gather, hunt, fish, build, marry, have kids and raise them. The government cannot do this for us. To me, government is really only there to keep us safe, and that&#39;s about it. We don&#39;t have the time to track bad people down, so we hire police to do it. We don&#39;t have time to train an army, so we pay the government to hire young men to be soldiers. Really, that&#39;s all they are needed for. The rest, we can handle by ourselves.</p>
