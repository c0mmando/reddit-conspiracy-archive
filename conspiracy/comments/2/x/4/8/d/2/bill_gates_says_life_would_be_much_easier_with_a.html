        From The Anti Media:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a recent interview with the German publication
        <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/bill-gates-im-interview-den-taeglichen-tod-nehmen-wir-nicht-wahr-1.2324164">
         <em>
          Süddeutsche Zeitung
         </em>
         ,
        </a>
        Bill Gates made some disturbing comments in favor of world government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only did Gates advocate global government, but he also spoke favorably of the UN and NATO, completely overlooking that they are a major force of oppression in the world. NATO can’t even hold a meeting without thousands of people gathering in the streets to protest their actions. Someone as heavily involved in world affairs as Bill Gates should know all about this.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the interview last month, Gates said, “Take the UN, it has been created especially for the security in the world. We are ready for war, because we have taken every precaution. We have NATO, we have divisions, jeeps, trained people. But what is with epidemics? How many doctors do we have as much planes, tents, what scientists? If there were such a thing as a world government, we would be better prepared. “
       </p>
       <p>
        Not long ago this subject was considered a total conspiracy theory, but now one of the richest people in the world is openly suggesting that this is a good idea. Governments are generally a pretty bad idea, even when they are small they can still do a tremendous amount of damage. So when a government rules the entire planet, there is no telling what type of atrocities it will be capable of.

       Do you have actual scholarly work to reference or just lame videos? For someone that needs to correct another's spelling, you seem lacking credibility and want others to share your views on faith, not solid evidence. Good day.

       I feel exactly the same way. I want a one world government. It's the best and only option for our survival as a species. I, however, fear that the current organizations who support this cause are not benevolent, but are malevolent in nature.

       The wording of my post may have changed the meaning to some. I'm not saying that a Zionist one world government would be a good thing. However, a one world government with priorities like taking care of this Earth, worldwide peace and the spiritual/technological development of the human race would be a step in the right direction.

       Bill Gates is a eugenicist. His father was head of Planned Parenthood. He wants to reduce the world's population and he thinks vaccines will help accomplish this. His vaccine programs have caused tens of thousands of cases of flacid paralysis in India. Vaccines laced with HCG have caused miscarriages and infertility in Kenya, Mexico and the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
       A one world government would definitely make Gates' goal of depopulation easier to accomplish.

       I can't tell if you're joking or not but I'll bite.  Your statement makes zero sense since Bill Gates focuses on diseases that have long been eradicated in 1st world countries.  Why would he need to use 3rd world population to test medicine that we don't even need in the 1st world?

       NATO are bound to use comp programmes designed by windows are they not? same with UN. could this be a factor in his lack of impartiality? Im not sure, but I dont trust any of these supposedly philanthropic ''do gooders''. As OSHO says , ''watch out for the do gooders''. Hes also a proponent for a one world Govt though, but I think he means government in a  spiritual and autonomous way.

       This isn't a shocking new idea or a bad one. I don't understand why you think this so scandalous. Sad that people try to demonize a great guy like Bill Gates. He does great things for world health, hopefully he can put a few more pathogens on the list of extinctions.

       Yeah, for him. A world government, even if it was the most divine and perfect government, would lead to all out war, mainly because no one would trust it. But we have seen what governments do by looking at the past, and the present. There's no such thing as a "good" government in the sense that they can't make us happy. They can't bring us happiness because our lives are still up to us. We still have to pick, gather, hunt, fish, build, marry, have kids and raise them. The government cannot do this for us. To me, government is really only there to keep us safe, and that's about it. We don't have the time to track bad people down, so we hire police to do it. We don't have time to train an army, so we pay the government to hire young men to be soldiers. Really, that's all they are needed for. The rest, we can handle by ourselves.

       I wasn't say all governments are currently corrupt.  I said they all eventually get corrupted.  Pointing out that one is not considered corrupt now doesn't matter.
