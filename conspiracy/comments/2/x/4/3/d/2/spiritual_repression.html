       I replied with this on another post (

       ) and thought I would share it here since it has since been buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were talking about spiritual repression in our society and I just wanted to share some of my own findings that I have read about over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly feel like all the answers to everything lie in quantum physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will make you an athiest, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you." - Werner Heisenberg (Father of Quantum Physics)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if I can elaborate, because I too believe there is some spiritual repression going on in some form and I have followed the rabbit hole quite a ways down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, first I started readin about fluoride and the effects it has on the brain, or more specifically, the pineal gland. The pineal gland has been called (Descartes was a huge proponent of it) the principal seat of the soul, is viewed as the third eye, and has visual similarities to the eye of Horus. Fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, causing it to not function properly and ultimately dulls it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading about pineal gland calcification led to me other readings on other things that calcify the pineal gland. And that's when things really started to take an interesting turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally everything in our day to day lives seem to serve in some way to calcify the pineal gland. Deodorants do it with their aluminum, body sprays/perfume/cologne do it, hormones, food additives, excessive sugar and sweeteners, even radiation from your cellphones/microwaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that everything about modern society has something to do with stripping the body of its pineal gland spiritual awakening and is leading us to be a spiritually repressed society.
      </p>

       Flouridation is only the tip of the iceberg in the "spiritual repression" category. All "Christian" institutions are corrupt and following the wrong path. The 8th meeting of Constantinople formerly eliminated "spirit" from the spiritual make up of man and said that man consists only of a physical body and a soul "with some spiritual qualities". That was over 1200 years ago. Not many people will understand today that man's spiritual makeup consists of EGO, SPIRIT, and SOUL...the EGO portion being the one thing that makes us rise above animals and allows us to express "I AM"...animals cannot do this. SOUL is passion and hate and desire and it's seat is in the blood. SPIRIT is thinking and intelligence with it's seat in the nervous system. Everything we do in the material world somehow contributes to the ego, soul, or spirit or detracts from it (there is neutral activity but that doesn't get you anywhere). When you exhibit compassion and true selflessness you gain strength of soul and spiritu...when you lash out selfishly you weaken your soul spiritual capacities. The DARK powers know this and this is why your TV and your films are full of negative depictions of Americans...specifically white males in leadership roles...and the multiform attack on spiritual progression can also be found in the food we eat and the water we drink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flouridation in my opinion is more a Eugenics or Trans-humanist issue trying to repress the spiritual development of man through physical means. But from what I understand it, and this is important, is that the pineal gland is a leftover from previous evolutionary development of man and is not a necessary component for spiritual development today (it was a long long time ago when everyone was "clairvoyant" for lack of a better term, but today we don't need it to progress spiritually)...but it is if you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       that flouride is calcifying your pineal gland and limiting your conscious ability to spiritual progress, then that is enough to keep people held back...like this picture...it's all in your head.

      <p>
       DISCLAIMER: stop drinking and cooking with flouridated water and start drinking water from a well that is tested regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have to add that the not so recent discoveries of Viktor Schauberger and more recent ones linked to Masaru Emoto, water is alive and an essential element to human survival but not because of it's chemical makeup but for the "etheric" energy it contains by cycling through the water cycle and specifically by getting "energized" from the earth. Dowsers are not finding water they are tuning in to the etheric energy of the water using their body as a tuning fork.

       I have not heard that one. My personal theory on chemtrails is that they are experimenting with putting
       <em>
        metals
       </em>
       into the atmosphere fro various military purposes but in conjunction with practical application of this program it also fucks up the
       <em>
        spiritual
       </em>
       qualities of the sunlight as it passes through these metals...which in turn weakens our connection to the spiritual world.

       I still cook with flouridated water too but I should stop.

       No. Boiling reduces the water so that the flouride is more concentrated. There are ways to remove flouride from water though. I'll link it if I find it again.

       It's not the
       <em>
        faith
       </em>
       that is corrupted but the institutions behind them corrupting our understanding and not allowing for our consciousness and understanding to
       <em>
        grow
       </em>
       . It's not the people who follow the institutions who are corrupt either but if they dim their consciousness or relinquish their free will to accept the church authority's word then that's not so good. We live in the
       <em>
        consciousness
       </em>
       age and everything that we do we have to do with full conscious choice...and that is not easy to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately Christianity needs to re-embrace both initiation science and reincarnation and deepen understanding of the importance of the appearance of the Christ in Jesus of Nazareth for 3 years in Palestine approximately 2015 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes you are right, some of the Protestant and Baptist churches in the US have embraced the compassion and love and forgiveness that the new testament speaks of. But what they don't realize is that the Passion, otherwise known as the Mystery of Golgotha, is "initiation" made public for the first time ever and that nobody at the time noticed! (except the apostles but not until after the Ascension).  I highly recommend deepening our understanding of this event by reading Rudolf Steiner's work found here...

       Try starting out Catholic hardcore, go atheist, study Buddhism, study fractals and chaos theory, research into humanities beginnings and truth of spirituality, come full circle to god again. That quote resonated with me as well.

       Was never religious so at youth i questioned and doubted it quickly, to eventually flat out denying religion due to its toxic nature. Read Buddhism Zen Tao and Tantra by OSHO, the real god was brought to light. It is us.

       As someone who grew up Roman Catholic and was adamant for years (I was an alter boy, if you can believe it), who drifted into atheism for years, this post hits a nerve for me.

      <p>
       The Spiritual Pendulum sometimes swings too far one way or another (one way due to lifeline indoctrination, the other while one deconstructs and rejects previous ideologies in an attempt to find oneself), at some point a balance arises and this pendulum settles in the middle, where I am much more agnostic now that previously, and am content with that.

       as a hard atheist, couple things to note about the post..
      </p>
      <p>
       The third eye is not located at the pineal gland at all, it is rather behind the forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have taken good care, indirectly because for a completely different rationale, of my pineal gland for a couple years now and have not noticed any spiritual change in myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that everything around us is generally aimed at making us sick and dependable, that's not to say there has not been a relentless attack on spirituality (or rather the beliefs of the previous power, you are more than welcome to take yoga lessons hehe) since the Lumières, but i don't think the pineal gland calcification has much to do with it, it probably makes us sick in one way or another though.

       I feel ya. I haven't done much research on the pineal gland stuff - and I am having a tough time articulating whatever
       <em>
        spirituality
       </em>
       I subscribe to at this point (it is still a very small thread of what keeps Jim together these days).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in a more meta sense, science these days pretty much says that we're all made of the same
       <em>
        stuff
       </em>
       if you break down matter in small enough pieces, and for dome reason at this point in life that comforts me - that we all came from something common at some point (and I'm not talking about mitochondrial Eve, although that's interesting too).
      </p>
      <p>
       Its tough to describe. But it's more if an understanding that we are all part of something bigger, and it's up to us to steer that something bigger in a positive direction, and all the religious ceremonies and customs have been coopted and perverted so much that they are used more as social controls (which I like to think I am free of).
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make any sense?

Et je vous sais gré, au-delà de toute autre considération, de votre force d’exemplarité concernant une grande vertu de l’homme : le courage.
Puisqu’il vous a été donné de le conjuguer à l’intelligence, vous êtes un évangile. Ce que je vais vous dire va peut-être vous sembler fleurer bon l’ésotérisme kabbalistique ou oriental, mais
        <strong>
         dans le monde des hommes il y a trois grandes catégories : les sachants, les croyants et les ignorants. Cette tripartition spirituelle est un invariant historique. Une société saine est une société où les sachants guident les croyants vers le Bien, c’est-à-dire l’amour de la Vie. Ainsi les croyants désirent à leur tour élever spirituellement les ignorants. Si les sachants méconduisent les croyants, ces derniers mépriseront le peuple et la tyrannie politique prévaudra.

       I think like Max, spirituality is a tool for few and trap for many. You do make sense but being the emergence of something bigger (or smaller) doesn't necessarily mean that this thing has a purpose for us, or at all, or a sense of good and bad, a very human concept as confronting your goods and bads with other people can easily demonstrate hehe

       I agree with the lack of purpose. However, TPTB have shaped a reality where we do have a purpose - a purpose most here reject.

       Now we're all wondering what it is instead. That's what I'm getting at.

       Totally agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       On my first breakthrough experience on DMT, I was taken to another world and I was welcomed by the entities and told that there was a war going on that stretched throughout the dimensions of the cosmos and that Earth was the focal point of it at this present time. They confirmed that most of what I had been reading was in fact true, that it went much further than that and that I'd have a role to play in it all now that I have been informed of how it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following from that I've delved deeper down the rabbit hole into the ideas of lost civilisations, alien hybrids, secret societies, montauk and philadelphia experiments, MK-Ultra, densities and dimensions, dolores cannon's work, star seeds, bashar, treb, biolocation. It's all there and it's so much more interesting than anything I could have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the findings of my research, it's actually been really powerful in gaining an understanding of the true nature of reality. I've had a series of extremely profound spiritual experiences which have further confirmed all that's going on and have also allowed me to let go of any fear I have of the situation. Ultimately in this spiritual war, they're winning as long as your afraid. That's what this whole game is for. The more we can rise above our collective fears and work together, the more spiritually evolved we become. It's all just a game to offer us these opportunities for experience.

       The culmination of this battle is earth at this point in time and for the last 20 000 years they've been winning but with the internet and the new equinox cycle they're about to be defeated. Consciousness is rising on a collective level, more and more people are becoming aware of their spiritual nature and subsequently the massive deception that has taken place. We're getting assistance from intergalactic partners and over the next few years we're going to experience some insanely transformative events which will facilitate our ascension into higher densities of consciousness.

       Because it's an extremely difficult existence here, relative to the universal neutral/unconditional love that our spiritual aspects are used to. It's a school of hard knox and it the greater scheme of things it's that way for a purpose. To facilitate our spiritual evolution. From my research, the claims are that there isn't another planet like us, that has gone through what we've gone through and is as disconnected from the source as we are. When you look into ideas such as those promoted by Graham Hancock, you see begin to see we truly are a species with amnesia. We had a much greater history with connection to our spiritual and cosmic ancestry. Now we're material atheists governed by fear.

while books out there may have some things that can aid one along the way its better to find the good from many sources and blend it into a personal ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       sort of how like im not Catholic, Christian or Jewish but i still follow the last 5 of the ten commandments since well people shouldn't do those things to begin with .. imo.
(i call it, though shall not be a douche bag)
      </p>
      <p>
       science currently is not at the point of giving us solid evidence into what is beyond this life in regards for consciousness mostly due to how shunned it is for investigating anything on that subject matter.
(though I'm sure all those so called mediums, cold callers etc back around the time of Houdini didn't help much)
      </p>
      <p>
       countless times through history are depictions of
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/1531_Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_de_Guadalupe_anagoria.jpg">
        the aura

        halo
       </a>
       effects and talk about people being able to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       science at least has proven it to exist and is know as
       <a href="http://www.livescience.com/7799-strange-humans-glow-visible-light.html">
        bioluminesence
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and probably much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       as to beings of which could be considered divine or gods even.. I don't doubt any which way there there is.
to what they exactly are and their capability is something left for science to one day discover at the very least.

       Get away from the abrahamic bullshit and embrace Dharmic religions/philosophy. IMO these faiths do a much better job towards cultivating man's spiritual side than Abrahamic religions

       The problem with OPs statement is that the current religion have rules a books and so on. Limiting spiritual and putting a reality into something that is inherently personal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my own spirituality, i do not believ in a current selection of dieties or their affiliated religions. I do believe in things, have faith etc, but it isnt the one that is associated with a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say spirituality is being repressed, sounds off to me. More like the battle between athiesm and religion is focusing people to pick defined sides, instead of allowing personal choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just meditate during a sunset, remenise of a childhood, or think yourself part of a bigger picture. Its a complex subset of human psychie, the soul and personality. How you find the spirituality is upto you, but once rules and books and rituals start to cloud that personal space then religions form and they constrict the inate need for spirituality. I am not well equiped to explain myself fully, as a person of no religion I do not care about your personal sporitual place. But I am not about to tell anyone what they should be doing spiritually for themselfs.

       Good post. I could care less if someone believes in God or not. I'm personally agnostic but very interested in spirituality, but what makes me nervous is that atheism seems to be a new kind of religion. A fundamentalist, intolerant one at that, and what is worse is that the adherents of this new religion refuse to acknowledge that they've formed an organized religion. I can't imagine that ending well.

       Yeah I take huge issue with this garbage.  There has never been any evidence for any religion or spiritual nonsense.  There are plenty of unexplained phenomenon etc, and true scientists are working on it every day.  Atheists, do have, and continue to realize far more than this one unsupported quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of confirmations bias to go around for the deluded, but the truth is TPTB couldn't care less about your spirituality, only your servitude.  So just like in every other realm of life, they strip and ban what makes you less like to be a serf (which some spiritualistic can do, but that doesn't make 'em any more correct).  Why they allow beer, and cigs, but not shrooms and DMT etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but don't attempt to state there is any evidence for your beliefs (there isn't) especially based on one quote by one religious man confirming his bias.

       just throwing it out there bro, one scientist to another, that spirituality isn't about explaining away seemingly supernatural phenomena, but investigating the mind and internal phenomena.

       ....of course is internal, that doesn't make it any more legit.  It is very much "explaining away seemingly supernatural phenomena," just internal phenomena such as emotions, tripping etc, which are all perfectly normal biological processes and have nothing to do with anything other than interactions in your brain.

       I'm not missing out on anything, people who are searching for something that doesn't exist and miss-classifying and mystifying biological and chemical reactions withing themselves are the ones missing out.

       So when I meditate, and feel different afterwards... what then? What is not legit about that? That is spirituality, but doesn't fit any of the weird straw man definitions of it you seem bent on putting up.

       The only one strawmanning here is you buddy.  When you meditate and feel different afterwards....its a biological, chemical, and electrical process in your brain, nothing more IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MORE TO BE FUCKING AMAZINGLY COMPLEX AND AWESOME.  Attempting to try and make it something it isn't is more than just dishonesty, its detracting from how incredible whats actually occurring is.  Of course you "feel" different.  If you understood at all what I was saying, you would understand that this is a perfectly normal natural thing, just like taking shrooms or w/e else.  Its not "spiritual" its reality, its science, and its wonderful, there is no need to invent or desire anything more.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are missing out, you are biased, I am sitting squarely in reality, you are attempting to make things up to justify feeling something when you don't have to, and in doing so are missing truth.

       the fact that there is a biological explanation for it doesn't mean you can dismiss it as just that, a biological phenomena. when a movie makes you cry we could analyze the hormones in your brain and say that you are crying because of those hormones and neural activity, but of course that is not why you are crying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying, what are you arguing about and being so mad about? The fact that I'm saying sometimes spiritual things have value? So what if they're explainable via biological phenomena? What does that have to do with anything? it's totally irrelevant that something can be explained via science. It is just one attribute of something. You wouldn't dismiss someone's feelings about an oil painting because we can scientifically analyze the painting, would you?

       This statement shows some stunning ignorance of both how life and reality function, and what I was trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extremely simple and obvious point that you are missing (and no offense really, but you have to really be quite ignorant not to know this already) is the this universe is deterministic, at least as far as humans are concerned.  This is where philosophy has progressed to as science has progressed.  Compatiblism and similar standpoints are now the default in almost all serious philosophy (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       You are crying because of a reactions to a movie....thats a perfectly normal biological phenomenon.  Your reaction is determined by many things, from genetics, to the sum of experiences in your life to that point in time.  Feelings are not something magical that comes from outside of you, everything you ever "feel," think, etc, are reactions to stimuli via your senses in combination with your brain.  Again this is obvious if you understand anything about human biology and neurology etc.   There is nothing mystical about it, and that doesn't DETRACT from the experience, from the feelings etc, it ADDS to them.

      <p>
       Again, extremely ignorant and reveals much about your uneducated views of reality, human beings, and my points.  This isn't about dismissing feelings, its about understanding how feelings relate to reality.  I would ENCOURAGE people to be inspired and draw whatever feelings they wish from a painting, ESPECIALLY since we can analyze it.  It doesn't dismiss it increases, it doesn't detract, it adds.  Its about celebrating reality, the brain, and FEELINGS within it.

       Also just for the record, I'm not missing out on anything. Science and spirituality aren't incompatible. That's all I was saying basically. If you don't care or disagree that is fine, but I assure you I partake of both fully.

       They are 100% compatible, as demonstrated by the numerous philosophers and scientists who had religious and spiritual inclinations. Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Issac Newton, all the Islamic philosophers and scientists, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Einstein, Heisenberg, Max Planck, Faraday, Godel, but maybe you're smarter than them.

       Given that you have proved, and continue to prove that you are an extremely close minded and ignorant individual, I doubt my comment will help you much.  I will make it for the record, but you could learn from it if you didn't insist upon being so deluded and narrow.

       Not only is this argument a massive logical fallacy, but its also idiotic to begin with.  Of course I'm not smarter than them, but PLENTY of others are, and with the benefit of 50-2000 years of new knowledge especially in the fields of cognitive science and physics, THEY WERE IGNORANT when they made those statements JUST AS YOU ARE NOW (also you argument and most of theirs do not agree).  They were brilliant but didn't have access to the information we do, just as Marx was a genius but couldn't figure out or account for human evolution, because it wasn't his field and it hadn't been thought of yet.  This is such a HUGE whole in your "logic" (or lack there of), and once again demonstraits just that it isn't just that you lock knowledge, you also lack the ability to think critically or form arguments.  Given that you have still not responded to one of mine, let alone identified one, that is hardly suprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, logically they are not compatible, though in life of course than can be (which is what most of the fellow you mentioned argued anyway).  Let me know if you want to engage in a actual discussion of my points (if you can correctly identify them), until then I'm not going to waste anymore time, your deep seeded and heavily entrenched ignorance isn't my problem.

       I agree with this but not in the sense that most christians/catholics would understand - they see god as a man who makes all of the decisions of our physical world, what they don't understand is that we are god, we are everything - everything is an extension of itself.    I watched a documentary "DMT the Spirit Molecule" - I believe it was - and a man spoke about while he was on his trip (DMT - which is actively created and excreted from the pineal glad - during birth, dreaming, and death, also possibly psychic visions) he was viewing the universe as a rythmic array of colors and light, he said it was so beautiful he wanted to reach out and touch it but when he extended himself to it (at this point he was also a ray of beautiful light) it moved away from him because in that moment he realized it was he himself who he was trying to touch, he was experiencing himself at a higher level in connection with the universe - it's very hard for me to try explain as I'm not usually good with words - but it gave me  a turn around on my thinking on life.  We are all one and we should treat each other as so - be beautiful to everything and everything will shine it's beauty and light back to you.  It's hard to find light in a world that's been crowded with so much darkness but collectively we can turn it into the bright place it's needed to be.  As we give more attention to negativity we ourselves become more negative - shut out negativity in life and pursue only happiness, light, and compassion to enhance the light and love of this land.

       This tells me that you're either trying to deliberately deceive people or you just don't know what you're talking about.  Calcium fluoride, the type that can be found in nature, is totally different from
       <em>
        sodium fluoride

       I don't know, I didn't write it, but sodium fluoride is an industrial waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry which is where the fluoride added to water traditionally came from.  Now most of it comes from China, but they still use sodium fluoride (among other things).

       The short answer is that calcium fluoride is highly insoluble and also that calcium (along with magnesium) are natural remedies to the effects of fluoride - but all of this stuff is very easy to look up if you're actually interested.  Check out fluorosilicic acid too while you're at it, which is another of the industrial waste products artificially added to the water supply.

       The ones he made up.  Nearly all societies pre-modern (or still in that phase actually) are more spiritual than todays church based spirituality.

       Couldnt the argyument be made that with a greater understanding of our world the less likely we are to attribute normal phenomena to something spiritual?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think that spirituality is changing, its becoming less dogmatic and more personal.

       I would agree if it weren't for the fact that spirituality hasn't gone away, its simply changed to a more dogmatic, rule based spirituality in organized religion.  Over the last 2000 years we've moved from a spirituality that is more based on personal experience, to one based on rules and organized belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       We here that it is personal, but thats simply not true on its face.  Each sect of religion has its own ways of communing with god.  A god they specifically define.  A communication is specifically defined.  You would not find the use of hallucinogenics to be acceptable in a church even if it was getting visions from Jesus himself that you sought.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a believer nor am I spiritual myself but I enjoy the study of it.  I think there are certain signs pointing to returning to that type of mentality, the idea that people can find spirituality, commune with the gods or what ever, in their own way, on their own terms.  but its been a very slow change.

       So when I meditate, and feel different afterwards... what then? What is not legit about that? That is spirituality, but doesn't fit any of the weird straw man definitions of it you seem bent on putting up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to argue with you, I'm just genuinely saying that you are obviously operating on some biases that are going to result in you missing out on some things. But hey man if that's your thing it's cool, I'm just some guy on the internet.
