<blockquote>
<p>A new study out of the UK shows once again just how dangerous water fluoridation is.</p>

<p>This time, a look at 98 percent of GP practices found that high rates of underactive thyroid were 30 percent more likely to show up in areas with, surprise surprise, the greatest degree of water fluoridation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://fluoridealert.org/news/water-fluoridation-in-england-linked-to-higher-rates-of-underactive-thyroid/">Via Fluoride Action Network:</a></p>

<p>&quot;[The study] found a relatively strong and statistically significant effect, with General Practice (GP) areas being 62% more likely to have high rates of diagnosed hypothyroidism if their drinking water fluoride levels were above 0.7ppm compared to areas with fluoride levels below 0.3ppm.  This was after researchers had accounted for key confounders, which are other factors that influence hypothyroid rates.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11430087/Fluoride-in-drinking-water-may-trigger-depression-and-weight-gain-warn-scientists.html">Via The Telegraph:</a></p>

<p>&quot;…new research from the University of Kent suggests that there is a spike in the number of cases of underactive thyroid in high fluoride areas such as the West Midlands and the North East of England…</p>

<p>&quot;It could mean that up to 15,000 people are suffering needlessly from thyroid problems which can cause depression, weight gain, fatigue and aching muscles.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that, of course, is just the number of people in those areas studied. Obviously, this is a dangerous and underestimated practice.</p>

<p>If weight gain and depression fit the bill, it might help to explain why the United States – the most fluoridated nation on the planet – is also the world’s most obese as well as the world’s most medicated country, with anti-depressants prescribed more than any other drug. Of course, there are many other factors at play as well.</p>

<p>Underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, is a condition where your thyroid doesn’t produce enough hormone. Your thyroid regulates all sorts of processes in your body, including your metabolism, your body temperature, and even your heartbeat. If your thyroid isn’t working properly, your whole body slows down, resulting in a bevy of other health problems the least of which is actually weight gain and and fatigue.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that fluoride inhibits iodine, which is necessary to keep your thyroid functioning.</p>

<p>On top of that, people don’t realize how many <a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/wp-content/pesticides/effects.endocrine.pituitary.htm">pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides</a> we ingest which also contain fluoride on top of what’s in our water. In studies, these have shown to negatively impact the pituitary gland as well, a pea-sized gland known as the “master” of our endocrine system that secretes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</p>

<p>“Underactive thyroid is a particularly nasty thing to have and it can lead to other long term health problems. I do think councils need to think again about putting fluoride in the water,” Lead author Professor Stephen Peckham, Centre for Health Service Studies, said.</p>

<p>And again, these researchers like so many before them concluded there are safer ways of improving dental health these days that don’t involve dumping the artificial chemical byproducts of the fertilizer industry into our water supply, but our governments time and again just keep repeating the motto “safe and effective” over and over like the fluoridated zombie robots they are.</p>

<p>Did you know that not only was the <a href="http://hartkeisonline.com/2011/01/12/the-grand-rapids-fluoride-study/">flagship World War II Grand Rapids fluoride study</a> “tinkered with” to throw out data showing children who did not drink fluoridated water had healthier teeth, but artificial fluoride’s “healthiness” was actually pushed via a massive government <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/fluoride-killing-us-softly/5360397">propaganda campaign run by none other than Edward Bernays?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Almost overnight…the popular image of fluoride – which at the time was being widely sold as rat and bug poison – became that of a beneficial provider of gleaming smiles, absolutely safe, and good for children, bestowed by a benevolent paternal government. Its opponents were permanently engraved on the public mind as crackpots and right-wing loonies.” </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes Bernays, the propaganda king who, among so many other ideas that exploited humanity, convinced women smoking was just a fabulous idea.</p>

<p>Why World War II?</p>

<p>Gee, I don’t know, could it have anything to do with the fact that <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/articles/wastenot414/">huge quantities of fluoride were necessary were to generate the bomb-grade uranium and plutonium essential in atomic bomb production during the Manhattan project?</a> </p>

<p>All that excess fluoride waste had to go somewhere…Why not in your water?</p>

<p>Government documents have since been made public which show atomic scientists were secretly ordered to help provide “evidence useful in litigation” against defendants suing over fluoride damage in court. These are the same government scientists who organized studies showing fluoride is “safe and effective.” </p>

<p>Can you say “conflict of interest?”</p>

<p>The bottom line isn’t even how obviously false the science was that water fluoridation was based on in the first place. We’ve been lied to and for obvious reasons, that much is on record.</p>

<p>Even before we get to the lies, even looking at water fluoridation superficially, how did we ever accept a program that mass medicates the population via a route that delivers the same amount of chemicals to everyone everywhere without taking into account age, weight, previous medical history, and the amount much a person ingests per day? This isn’t just negligent, it’s downright stupid.</p>

<p>Think about any medicine ever, right down to vitamins or over-the-counter cough syrup. There are at the very least dosages based on age, right?</p>

<p>How come water fluoridation is some magical process with a chemical that transcends all logic and reason into a one size fits all policy where nothing else ever does?</p>

<p>And that’s before we even get to the rant about how when you drink a glass of water, it only makes contact with the surfaces of your teeth for a brief moment before it is ingested and makes contact with every other system in your body including your organs and soft tissues. </p>

<p>Does everything in your body need to be fluoridated? Does your kidneys, liver, intestines and brain get cavities? It’s not like fluoride, which can cause dental fluorosis, is somehow such a smart molecule it knows it should quarantine itself to only affecting your teeth and nothing else but your teeth.</p>

<p>How we are still dumping artificial fluoride into our water when studies come out again and again showing the deleterious effects of the stuff is beyond me. Fluoride makes people sick and stupid, but beyond that, it’s a poison. It’s poisonous.</p>

<p><a href="http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/">How much more proof do you need that a poison is poisonous?</a></p>

<p>Purify your water. Stop drinking poison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a Japanese study I think, but look I&#39;m not saying fluoride in water is definitely innocent, just pointing out is not as straight forward as it seems. The evidence in favour of fluoride in water, especially in deprived areas as bring immensely beneficial to dental health is pretty solid, granted that wouldn&#39;t be much consolation of it gave you other problems instead, but I&#39;m not convinced yet. Fluoride is found in toothpastes too, and everyone uses floride tooth pastes.</p>

It does accumulate in the bones and cause deformation of the teeth and bones.  Type skeletal fluorosis and dental fluorosis into Google images and see for yourself.  In smaller amounts it can cause arthritis and other problems.  Why would one think that something that causes problems in small and large doses, that bioaccumulates, that is completely unnecessary for biology, is something beneficial for one&#39;s health?  </p>

<p>The studies that support water fluoridation are dubious and very old.  Yet, there are many studies new and old that suggest harmful effects.  The history of fluoride in industry has even demonstrated those effects.  Before they scrubbed the waste with water, they vented it and the local area was affected by it.  Cattle and people were exposed and visible bone deformations resulted.  </p>

<p>Authority empowered with some of the best propagandists in history has brought us to this place.  It&#39;s amazing the contortions of cognition we will do in order to align our perceptions with the claims of authority.  We don&#39;t want to believe our protectors would hurt us for self serving advantages, but they do regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is it the sodium, a necessary electrolyte, or fluoride a simple halogen found in multiple natural/organic goods, that &quot;kills brains cells&quot;? It&#39;s much much more likely that NaF has no effect on mental health, instead it&#39;s the poor quality of Chinese chemicals. </p>

<p>As a phd chemist, I can speak on behalf of the poor quality compounds Chinese ships out. I learn really quick during grad school that buying from Europe produced cleaner results and great reproducibility, although they cost twice the amount. </p>

<p>NaF in water isn&#39;t at all bad, I may even go as far to say it&#39;s necessary (down votes will rain). Unless NaF disassociates into something other than Na+ and F-, we should be more worried about the quality of our fluoride supply. </p>

<p>For some chemistry y&#39;all may be interested in pertaining to this topic, I recommend the following:
Calculate in grams how much NaF is needed to form a 100L-0.7ppm solution. 
Look up RED40: If carcinogens alter DNA, the molecule must fit in the major/minor grooves (essentially). Try to find a 3D rendering of Disodium 6-hydroxy-5-[(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonate and ask yourself why we dump this shit in junk food processed for children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it bioaccumulates, over 99% of which ends in teeth and bones. The only soft tissue where it accumulates is in the glomeruli of the kidneys, because fluoride excretion is renal. It accumulates, and then gets pissed out. &quot;Bioaccumulation&quot; does not equal toxicity. Besides, there&#39;s this thing called the blood-brain barrier that largely prevents even small amounts of fluorine/fluoride from reaching the CNS. </p>

<p>And for the water as a poison, water toxicity can easily kill. Try taking even an introductory physiology class before you dismiss something as false at face value. The basic assumptions anti-fluoride people make can be easily disproven by simple chemistry and physiology. You make actual, educated skeptics look bad. Your ignorance discredits every skeptical movement that is based in actual scientific reality. Do the rest of us a favor and obtain a basic education before you start spouting nonsense that makes all skeptics look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any proof that drinking tap water treated with recommended amounts of fluoride causes fluorosis? Fluorosis is associated with industrial contamination of water or air that greatly exceeds the amount present in modern, first-world water supplies. Again, you obviously don&#39;t have any grasp of the concepts that actually surround fluoride toxicity. </p>

<p>And speaking about false equivalence, drowning is not water poisoning. Water intoxication/poisoning is a result of hypotonicity and electrolyte dilution within the body, not drowning. Drowning is when water physically impedes the intake of oxygen in the lungs. It has absolutely nothing to do with toxicity. So go ahead and facepalm until your nose bleeds, it doesn&#39;t make you any less ignorant.</p>

<p>Exactly. Fluoride is fucking everywhere. Toothpaste (obviously), table salt, any sort of processed food or beverage (especially mechanically separated meats; chicken nuggets have crazy amounts of fluoride), pharmaceuticals (Prozac is ~96% fluoride, certain antibiotics), factory-farmed milk. Wash your vegetables well, because pesticides contain a ton of fluoride (grapes are the worst for this problem). And, even if you go to the ends of the earth to avoid ingesting the stuff, it&#39;s absorbed by the skin, so every time you wash your hands or shower you&#39;re getting a dose of fluoride (unless you can afford thousands of dollars for a reverse-osmosis system). Oh, and don&#39;t forget teflon pans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zero Water Filter - You can get it at Wal Mart for 30$</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as good as RO but it does get your water down to 0.00PPM dissolved solids. From the website -
ZeroWater filters are not certified for the reduction of fluoride however fluoride is an inorganic compound. The TDS meter is designed to detect inorganic compounds. Fluoride levels in water are usually around 2 to 4 ppm, which will show up on the meter as 002 to 004. So when filtered water reads 000 it is not likely that fluoride is present in water.</p>

<p>The water filter actually comes with a little stick that measures dissolved solids in water, so you can ensure it is working. You can test your municipal water supply with it, and then filter it and see the difference. It really does work very well, and costs less than 40$. I highly recommend it. Even if your water is not fluoridated, you should filter your water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for bringing this up. I know its a bit of a process but I now remineralize with a Santevia water filter after filtering with a Zero Water. Soon I&#39;m going to get a more permanent solution but for now this works for me. Santevia water filters are supposed to filter the water and then remineralize but I dont think they are good enough to filter it as much as the Zero Water, so I use it first. </p>

<p>Personally I would be more concerned of the health effects of drinking raw tap water with chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals and the rest of it than I would be with drinking demineralized water, but I am trying to cover all bases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The degradative nature of hypotonic water certainly don&#39;t affect everyone in the same way. Nor will they be readily apparent in every case. I am happy you have lived a healthy life drinking such water. But I am hesitant to encourage others to do so without being informed of the risks (same as with tap water).</p>

<p>Personally, I find the risks of drinking mineralized/spring water to be less than drinking distilled or DI water. I honestly don&#39;t think most people would ever be able to tell the difference regardless of what they drink (except for taste, distilled water never tasted very good to me). But to each their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned how people are unable to really tell what they drink which is very true. I encourage you to watch Penn &amp; Teller&#39;s Bullshit: Bottled water, for you to see how true that is. As for the taste in distilled water I love it. Its nothing but H2O, the way it should be. Everyone in my family drinks distilled water. Thats 8 of us all different ages including our four legged friend. Ingesting any sort of chemical is just not healthy (i.e.) fluoride, chlorine, etc. You get most of your minerals from food anyway, plus we salt our food with Himalayan Pink salt with its vast amount of minerals. I cook with it as well. I would rather risk any one of the stated &#39;cons&#39; in the WHO article than ingesting any added chemicals in tap water. Yes there will still be fluoride in water we bathe in but I do have a shower head filter that removes 99% of chlorine. Minimizing the exposure is the objective. My family is in great health so I am living proof that all those claims are rubbish. My dog is 12 years old and is still running around with the energy of a two year old, yet you will also find &quot;evidence&quot; that distilled water is terrible for dogs. I would get into structured water but that is a different topic. There you have it my friends, drink up all the distilled you can get! Cheers</p>
