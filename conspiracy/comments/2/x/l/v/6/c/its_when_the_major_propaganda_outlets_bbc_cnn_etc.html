I think this has been planned long in advance. The major news channels are all on board with too much of the same narrative being shoveled onto TV screens. </p>

<p>I could be, and probably am wrong, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. Worldnews seems to be straight <em>salivating</em> at the thought of Russian civil bloodshed.</p>

Whether or not there will be a mass murder attempt remains to be seen, but it sure could jumpstart this whole situation. I guess we&#39;ll find out, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I&#39;d be much happier if nothing bad happens to anybody, but-- these ghouls in Washington and the other anti-east globalists need to seal the deal against Russia, and sharpish. I&#39;m not so much predicting it WILL happen, but it would not shock me. Another Damascus, another Tripoli, another Maidan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not going to stop doing what works.  Putin knows he&#39;s under attack but he also knows that any resistance will be painted as agression.  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t doubt that some of Putin&#39;s agression was not done by him at all.  </p>

<p>The problem is there&#39;s no way of knowing until it becomes really obvious.  Like when they say that country&#39;s leader is shelling his own cities.  </p>

<p>I hope I don&#39;t live to see American troops being sent to Russia.  Those people can fight back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin called them out in 2012 saying they would do exactly this. ffs the opposition in Russia is calling bullshit on the putin did it angle.</p>

<p>meanwhile the western media is hyping this guy like he was an actual threat to him politically  i mean ffs the guys is at 86% approval rating his  &quot;Opposition&quot; is about as powerful as the guy with the cardboard sign by the freeway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this.</p>

<p>Not a week ago it was endless threads on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> about his sky-high approval rating and flabbergasted, foaming neckbeards in the comments who just couldn&#39;t believe it. Because he&#39;s evil, hates freedom, kills airplanes for fun, and invades peaceful neighbors for to make glorious USSR again, komrade. And if the Russian people support him, well they&#39;re all just insane drunks who like his brand of violence so fuck Russia, fuck Putin and fuck the Russian people as a whole, lolriteguise.</p>

<p>So obviously the best course of action for him is to publicly murder some guy who opposed him politically. According to said neckbeard crowd, he did it to instill fear, like the great tyrants of the middle ages.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve figured it all out /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the part that scares me is how ham fisted it was, were in really dangerous territory if this guy was killed just to try and stir things up in russia.</p>

<p>what bothers me is how many people rant on here like they understand Putins motivations etc. when they don&#39;t know a damn thing about him. if anyone has actually read much about the guy the western medias narrative falls apart pretty quickly based on how he has handled things in the past and on just about anyones assesment of him prior to 2010 or so. </p>

<p>Putins getting this treatment simply because he has the balls and the guns to be able to tell the US to fuck off when they try to bully him. </p>
