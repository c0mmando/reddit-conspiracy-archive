        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t care how much flack I get for this, how many people call me an anti-Semite, but this has been eating me up for some time. </p>

<p>A couple years ago, when the US was on the brink of demolishing Syria, over those extremely convenient gas attacks that everyone knew was going to happen, I began reading a lot into Israeli history and the history of the Jews, since so many people at work were all &quot;Murica!&quot; about bombing a nation they knew nothing about. I will go ahead and provide my best source, a book called <em>Israel and Palestine; a 4000 years history</em>.</p>

<p>This was, by far, the most neutral book I could find. Every other book I searched for, had ridiculous names like <em>Israel is Right and Here&#39;s why!</em>, or *Doctors Hate him, Mel Gibson Despises Him and Anti-Semites Want him Dead! Find out This one Neat Trick for proving Israeli, Racist Jew-Haters Wrong!&quot;. All the summaries of the books were equally ridiculous and pretty much painted a picture of some terribly biased analysis as to why Palestinians essentially deserved to die.</p>

<p>The great thing about the book, is that the author wasn&#39;t even swayed by his own research to pick a side. I have yet to find a better, more neutral view on the subject. </p>

<p>With that being said, my goal was to get some good arguing points out of it, so I may better debate the pro-Zionist crowd, but instead, I got something completely different out of it, that recently hit me like a ton of bricks. There is no such thing as a Jew.</p>

<p>As was pointed out in the book, multiple genetic tests have shown that the most Jewish Jew is only twelve percent Jewish, and that Ethiopian Jews aren&#39;t racially Jewish at all. Jews are racially equal to Palestinians (Mizrahi Jews) and Europeans (Ashkenazim and Sephardi). Simply put, the bloodline was wiped out two thousand years ago by the Phillistines, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Europeans, the Arabs, and so on, until today, where Jews have ceased to be as a race.</p>

<p>Now when I explain this to people, they laugh and say something along the lines of &quot;Yeah, but they&#39;re religiously Jewish, ya silly head!&quot;. People need to understand something, according to the Old Testament, Hebrew Bible, Torah, or whatever you call it, Judaism is a race first, and a religion second, and that Jews cannot be one or the other. A Jew can only be religiously Jewish, if they are racially Jewish.</p>

<p>Even more absurd, the Torah clearly states that God himself kicked the Jews out of that land, as punishment for interbreeding with the Philistines. The Jews own holy book even says that the Jews can never have that land back. </p>

<p>In summation, there is literally a mysterious group of people, calling themselves the Jews when they aren&#39;t actually Jews, living in a land, that was wiped out and conquered two-thousand years ago and these people have managed to fool the entire world. They have hid for the last two-thousand years, convincing themselves they are a now extinct group of people that no longer exist. That&#39;s pretty eerie and frightening when you think about it.</p>

<p>Israel is ancient history. Current Israel is an odd, odd thing that makes absolutely no sense, and it will never be the mythical land of Judea, or Ancient Israel, ever again, because, at this point, that is a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>So, my question. Who are these people? Where are they truly from? At what point did this alien group of nomads decide that they were Jews, and how? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having read Ian Carroll&#39;s &quot;Israel and Palestine: A 4,000 Year History,&quot; I&#39;m not exactly sure how you could walk away with the impression that the author was unbiased. Regardless, that particular work is incredibly short, and provides very odd points of unsupported speculation (for example, he argues at one point that Moses was a Pharoah). Frankly, the sheer lack of citations alone should be reason enough not to form your perspective based upon this work.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re honestly interested in this subject, I would suggest that you read either Tessler&#39;s &quot;A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,&quot; or Fromkin&#39;s &quot;A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East,&quot; preferably both. Either of these works are routinely cited as the water-marks for discussion and coursework on this subject.</p>

<p>Moses was a warlord, nothing more, nothing less. The entire Old Testament is a bunch of historical fallacies and straight up lies. Let&#39;s not even mention the Talmud, which just goes to show the real value of the Jewish faith, one of violence, treachery and lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my personal theory - the Rothschilds chose &quot;the holyland&quot; as the base for their hidden kingdom. They set about claiming it by marginalizing European Jews and funding parties that contributed to WWII triggering a diaspora of disenfranchised people to emigrate to the newly created state after the war. Because of the persecution they faced in other nations, the population is fiercely loyal to the state and will be a great base for expanding the kingdom once their banking empire has total control.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to see what will happen when the Rothschilds have their finger in every countries bank in the world. It must be thrilling to be so close to obtaining it - like taking the last country from the last player in a 300 year old game of risk. At the same time, the ramifications of the completion of this goal is unsettling. It could be the start of a one world economy, peace, the post scarcity economy, and the start of scientific progress on an epic scale - It could also be the start of a new genocide, war, or other tragic event to push the next unknown phase through. </p>

<p>I hope they are trans-humanists interested in immortality by leaving the physical world and the first option is more appealing than the latter. Either way, I think the changes to everyday life in the next 20 years will make the way we live today completely foreign and unrecognizable to future peoples.</p>

And no, the &quot;Jews on holy book&quot; does not say they cannot have the land back - in fact, it says the opposite - when the Messiah comes, he will bring all Jews back to Israel and form the Third Temple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re focusing on a funny thing - because the Hebrews of old <em>do</em> exist, they&#39;re everywhere. They were seafarers and ended up everywhere, the archaeological evidence is scattered all over the World; North America, South America, Europe, even Japan - and it&#39;s constantly suppressed, but more is leaked every day. The Bible even provides evidence, though some word choice in the King James Version tries to be tricky; using a trick of translation to say Solomon&#39;s skin is &quot;light,&quot; not &quot;ruddy&quot; or &quot;glowing,&quot; hah!</p>

<p>The Hebrews of old are still around, they just don&#39;t know who they are, for the most part. I keep wondering when more will figure it out. Many have, but they&#39;re branded extremists, crackpots, &quot;crazy Afrocentrists.&quot; A lot of archeaological coverups (and wars) begin to make more sense when you realize the implications of everything we&#39;ve been taught being upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is that the Jews do exist. Regardless of race or religion, they are defined by their culture. Political boundaries for Israel are in place, but political boundaries do not always define the local population. Most of the political boundaries in the Middle East and Africa are from colonial claims and fail to represent the populations that live there The Kurds are a great example of a population that should probably have their own county and don&#39;t. Think about the great empires of the past. What percentage of the Roman Empire population would you suspect was actually Roman? This is all normal throughout history. </p>
