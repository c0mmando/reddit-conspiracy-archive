<p>&quot;I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven... Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I call on Congress again to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its own people - a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syriaâ€™s crisis once and for all.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When US government accused Syria of using chemical weapons, the neocons started screaming for war. Evidence pointed to the rebels as the ones who actually used them and the American people actually called their reps and demanded that the US stay out of Syria. It worked. It was predicted they would try again to bomb Syria.</p>

<p>Now the US, with Israels help, have been using the formula as used in 2003 to shock the American public. Then it was Al-Queda and the  beheading of Nick Berg. This time it&#39;s ISIS and the beheading of James Foley. It worked then, why not now? </p>

<p>Now that they have created ISIS, they will behave as if they are entitled to go into soveriegn countries and kill more people and weaken those countries deemed a threat to greater Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate how quickly changes are coming to the energy industry, as well as the current state of the energy industry in the U.S.</p>

<p>This ain&#39;t our parent&#39;s 80&#39;s oil crisis, where we were importing 80% of our oil. Now we <em>only import 40% of our oil</em>, and only a 1/3 of that (1/3 * 40%) comes from the middle east.</p>

<p>Also the rise of alternatives is really beginning to take off. Germany is what, something like 70-80% wind-powered? Elon Musk predicts the U.S. will be 50% solar by 2025 which, granted, seems a little soon to me, but by 2050? Whole new ball game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. It&#39;s almost spooky that the Syria problems started not too long after Assad declined Qatar&#39;s/the west&#39;s proposal of the Nabucco gas pipeline, which would have ran from Qatar to Turkey via Syria (and bypassing Russia), in favour of the &quot;Friendship Pipeline&quot; from Iran.</p>

<p>Stranger still is that Ukraine contains Russian gas pipelines and their government was overthrown in favour of a pro-EU/NATO government.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure this is all just a coincidence and the US government had nothing to do with any of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If those companies go under, who will replace them and their ability to build technology? That leaves America vulnerable. Because we have a privatized capitalist system, and the government buys their technology from private firms, its actually a national security issue to keep those firms well funded.</p>

<p>It&#39;s totally fucked up. But thats the way capitalism works. Free market libertarians will say &quot;the free market will replace those failed firms with ones that can product technology without needing constant flows of cash from war&quot; and in a dream world they would be right. Although, my guess is if that was possible, we&#39;d have that dream company already because the profits would be astounding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And Tesla&#39;s working on it... if you take my meaning. </p>

<p>Tesla&#39;s using tech advances to create not only a great vehicle, but a vehicle that goes against everything we&#39;ve been doing in automobiles since we started using combustion engines. Yes, a few other electric cars/hybrids have been &#39;successful&#39; but not to the scale that Tesla has. </p>

<p>In that aspect, other tech industries would have giants rise from the dust so to speak. There are other businesses that could take over Ratheon/Boeing/Lockheed/etc... and probably do better. But because they&#39;ve a lock on things (GM/Ford/etc), there&#39;s little reason to compete. Tesla&#39;s bucking the system and it&#39;s working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re actually arming moderate rebels in Syria who are not associated with ISIS but do have the common enemy of Assad. And nobody seems willing to talk about the fact that both those moderate rebels and ISIS have been supported this entire time with Qatari, Kuwaiti, and Saudi funds. It&#39;s <em>painfully</em> obvious that private interests in those countries want Assad gone because of the negated Nabucco gas pipeline deal between Syria and Qatar, and that this is the entire reason that Syria has fallen into civil war for the past few years.</p>

<p>Our intervention has nothing to do with humanitarianism, rather undisclosed strategic motivations driven by energy politics. Everything we&#39;re hearing in the media is irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I LOVE the &#39;moderate Syrian rebels&#39; line.</p>

<p>How many times has CNN/FOXNEWS/BBC/NBC/NPR told you that today and in the past week?</p>

<p>Just think about it realistically for a second. By &#39;arming&#39; the &#39;rebels,&#39; this is what is actually happening within the US Government:</p>

<p>President: I need money to arm some pretty mean brown people to fight other brown people I deem worse.</p>

<p>Congress: With much deliberation, we authorize this action and these funds.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve (a private corporation, by the way) then PRINTS money out of NOWHERE and then loans it to your government AT INTEREST. They do this because they know the US Government will collect money from its subjects (I mean citizens) via taxes.</p>

<p>This money is then spent (via the government) through no bid contracts to weapons manufacturers, then shipped overseas. This makes the people who own (I mean lobby) your politicians (and the banks of course) lots of money. Then brown people fight brown people and eventually natural resources (gas, oil, opium, lithium, whatever) are free to be exploited in the brown people&#39;s country (by other multinational corporations, of course).</p>

<p>So, to recap:</p>

<p>Winners: Banks, weapons manufacturers, any brown people who have gotten the keen eye of the US government and have agreed to let their resources be exploited as long as they are left alone, politicians (they look STRONG on national defense).</p>

<p>Losers: Americans and their children stuck with the tab (and they were not really ins danger anyway) and of course, the dead brown people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything that you have said.  I am a firm believer that the MIC and the big time bankers are running the show.  I think a lot has to do with oil and resources but I think there are a few more aspects.  Ill try to be short and sweet with this.</p>

<p>Terrorism = fear
Fear = control/ taking our rights away ( which also leads to spending our dollars to go to war)
Patriotism= a lot of debt and the justification by the american people to go to war.</p>

<p>I am a believer that the banks are in search for world control.  Take a look at where the Rothschilds have put their centralized banks after 9/11.  Syria is (rumored) to be debt free and have its own financial system.  This means no control for the Rothschilds and other mega bankers.  Debt=control.  Here&#39;s one link I found <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/syria-world-hate-message-604/">http://rt.com/op-edge/syria-world-hate-message-604/</a> ( not sure how accurate).</p>

<p>The elite use our military purely because they are the most powerful in the world.  If another country had the same capabilities, then they would be using their government/military for world domination.</p>

<p>Isis gives US citizens justification to invade Syria.  ( I still agree with every word you said, just thought I would add my thoughts)     </p>

<p>I read different things daily but am still yet to come to any solid conclusions. I think the elite are pushing for something, but I would hope that people would wake up before then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my hope too, which I why I celebrated your seemingly out-of-the-blue comments this morning as a sign that some people are actively seeking out alternative opinions and analysis and are slowly rethinking things. But to me, the rate of those &#39;awakening&#39; is still far too slow compared to the rate of control. Although this is a positive step.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That you&#39;re it, dude. Once you are satisfied with your world view, you are defeated. Constantly challenge things you hear and read, and more importantly, what you are <strong>told</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the elite are pushing for something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re right, and I think it&#39;s soon. Back to what I alluded to above - they usually operate on a Problem, Reaction, Solution paradigm. The challenge is predicting their problems (manufactured or not), predicting the rest of the American peoples&#39; Reaction, and then predicting their Solution. I feel there&#39;s really only one more shot, and it&#39;s going to come down to who&#39;s solution is more agreeable to the majority of the American people: the government&#39;s Solution (which historically is more legislation, to restrict civil liberties, in exchange for security <em>which is usually dramatically unnecessary given the actual threat</em>) or the People&#39;s solution (perhaps a different strategy? Maybe take back control of the country&#39;s monetary policy, end the corrupt campaign financing regulations, and slowly reign in the federal behemoth that has gradually been gaining power since the Constitution was ratified in the late 1700s).</p>

<p>Which worries me, because groups in this country are so fragmented (Divide and Conquer, baby) that we will never agree to any uniform People&#39;s Solution, and we&#39;ll lose out. And we&#39;ll lose out big time. At least right now.</p>

Obama and the government can make any kind of lame excuses they want to justify violence and war.
I am TIRED of it all. I just don&#39;t care what he has to say anymore. These games are getting really old.</p>

<p>It is a never ending cycle of moronic, insane behavior, and I have given up completely on this society.</p>

<p>as a species we are still in a most barbaric stage of development.</p>

<p>As long as we have leaders like Obama, constantly leading us into revenge power plays and retaliatory actions we are fucked.

    <div class="md"><p>The US sees the Assad regime in Syria as a hindrance to their plans in the Middle East, he has to go. In August 2013 a US-backed coalition was on the verge of bombing Syria, but the British ruined the party by letting Parliament vote against it, and the coalition temporarily receded into the shadows.</p>

<p>A few months later, a mysterious jihadi group called ISIS appears out of nowhere, and they are literally the most dangerous group of terrorists who ever lived. They are a threat to humanity, and must be destroyed immediately. And guess what, they just happen to be holed up in...well, wouldn&#39;t know, Syria! </p>

<p>And because the Syrian government, which is also fighting ISIS, has an air defence system, the US will need to take that out before it can start bombing ISIS positions on the ground. So Obama gets to bomb Syria after all...Convenient or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I LOVE the &#39;moderate Syrian rebels&#39; line.</p>

<p>How many times has CNN/FOXNEWS/BBC/NBC/NPR told you that today and in the past week?</p>

<p>Just think about it realistically for a second. By &#39;arming&#39; the &#39;rebels,&#39; this is what is actually happening within the US Government:</p>

<p>President: I need money to arm some pretty mean brown people to fight other brown people I deem worse.</p>

<p>Congress: With much deliberation, we authorize this action and these funds.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve (a private corporation, by the way) then PRINTS money out of NOWHERE and then loans it to your government AT INTEREST. They do this because they know the US Government will collect money from its subjects (I mean citizens) via taxes.</p>

<p>This money is then spent (via the government) through no bid contracts to weapons manufacturers, then shipped overseas. This makes the people who own (I mean lobby) your politicians (and the banks of course) lots of money. Then brown people fight brown people and eventually natural resources (gas, oil, opium, lithium, whatever) are free to be exploited in the brown people&#39;s country (by other multinational corporations, of course).</p>

<p>So, to recap:</p>

<p>Winners: Banks, weapons manufacturers, any brown people who have gotten the keen eye of the US government and have agreed to let their resources be exploited as long as they are left alone, politicians (they look STRONG on national defense).</p>

<p>Losers: Americans and their children stuck with the tab (and they were not really ins danger anyway) and of course, the dead brown people.</p>
