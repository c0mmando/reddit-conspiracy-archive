       I really don't want to watch any of the beheading videos but browsing over Reddit there seems to be some doubt on if they're actually genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are the videos edited in a way that they don't actually show the beheading?

       Yep, nothing gory. I've seen halloween costumes that turned my stomach more. The thing that gets me is how there is no blood spray from the initial cuts and only a neat little pool of blood around the neck. Also, in the first video his sleeves are unrolled yet rolled up after the "beheading". I was watching them and my friend actually asked what movie I was watching and if the "terrorist" was British but that is a more subjective observation.

       I think these videos are completely fake. That being said, I noticed that media switched to "Don't watch the videos" strategy pretty quickly after the first video got a lot of attention about looking fake. So my whole issue is if the agenda is to push these videos to rally the support to go back to war. Why weren't they smart enough to have the videos sent straight to the main stream media company's and have them say "oh, we censored out the brutality of the actual beheading" this would take a lot of pressure off the videos being fake?

       B/c they'd still need to film or fake an actual beheading? This approach is WAYYYY easier to execute (no pun intended).

       I agree... it's crazy but I think they know that MOST people won't critically analyze the film. They'll just take the MSM's word for it. How else can we explain people's UTTER BELIEF in the official 9/11 narrative. It's, like, physically impossible on SO many levels.

       Easy Killer. You're very presumptive on my opinions of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read plenty analysis of the videos and I've seen the executioner's prowrestler speech. 'm not a videographer- I couldn't tell you if the constant uniform breeze came from a fan on a set or if the apparant blurring around the subject profiles is consistent with green screen or with some sort of file compression. I understand that there is a lack of blood, which would be inconsistent with this form of execution,  and that the executioner uses his left hand which I believe is considered haram for this type of thing. I know that these videos have all been retrieved and published by a private israeli intelligence organization which was also responsible for the bin laden video, and that they share an office with the qatar embassy in dc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that foley' s siblings couric interview appeared to be on a set when it was supposedly at their family house. I know that isis just happened to take over an airbase on 911, justifying the nofly zone the neocons have been working towards in syria. I know that the name douglas mcarthur mccain doesnt seem like the name of an american rapper who works be killed in syria whole fighting for isis, but it's potentially helpful seo to anyone else named mccain who might have been documented working with isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       My watching the video would be purely an excercise in emotion.  There's nothing I can,  with my limited understanding of the technical and biological systems involved,  learn from watching the video that I can't glean from reading a variety of analysis.

       because hes assuming there must be something terrible for people to react like this.. and doesnt want to see something terribe. Little does he know.. the most terrible part of the watching video.. is realizing what people have been all upset about.. its dissapointing.. the video was a good probe of peoples intelligence.. and jesus were the results dissapointing. Im waiting for ANONYMOUS or some hacker group to come out admitting they're fake and were just making a point that people will believe anything on TV.. seriously that bad

       or israel or someone else who wants us involved made the fake vids.. i dunno.. they def fake

       It really is not gory at all.. thats not an opinion either.. its not because i have a tough sense of what gore is.. i mean it literally shows zero amounts of gore. Its like something highschool students would make, the guy walks up behind him.. puts knife to throat.. like anyone could safely do.. then it cuts away, cuts back to the guys face on top of an "body" could easily be the guy is just standing under a table with a dummy body and his head stickin thru a hole and he doesn breath for a few seconds.. ridiculous that people even reacted to this video.. i literally laughed and thought it was a joke.. then i thought "Wait.. seriously?? This is what people are talking about?!?!" Im so dissapointed in the avg person.. i mean come on.. even if its real.. its so fucking fake looking that just based on how fake it looks, even if u knew it to be real its not worth paying attention to.

       I used to get annoyed that people obsessed over what justin bieber had for lunch.. but at least that couldnt be used for an excuse to send good soldiers places they dont belong. if ur an idiot, which apparently most people are.. do the rest of us a favor and stay wrapped up in ur little hip-hop fashion world, focus on the kids choice award and mtv shit and leave the real things alone

       to me, it's not about the gore, necessarily.  I can watch a horror flick or cyst removal on r/popping or see the aftermath of a lawnmower accident on wtf without a problem.  The issue is the death- whether or not it's real.  You're convinced that it's fake, so you wouldn't have the same issue that I'm talking about, but I don't want to risk that it might be real because that would mean that I just watched a person get murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear- I'm positive this is an edited video.  And I think it's very likely that they aren't actually murdering the journalists in the video.  From what I understand, if these guys are/were even being held captive by a muslim extremist group called "ISIS"- they probably were put through many mock executions- which this may well have been footage of.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know to be true is that these videos were heavily edited, but that I don't want to risk watching someone get murdered.

       The moment you watch the videos they becomes farcical.
      </p>
      <p>
       They show no killing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me repeat that: those videos do not show anyone dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end of the videos show
       <a href="http://youtu.be/6hVALH7s_Bk?t=1m6s">
        what appears to be
       </a>
       dead bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they cut away from the whole point of their video? They had two cameras, mics and a bounce card. They could've recorded the best and most horrifying event ever in high definition. Instead they cut away.

       Agree with you.

      <p>
       The videos are fake as fuck. They look so green-screened it's an insult to anyone with intelligence. Also I've seen real beheading and mass murder videos by ISIS. They DO NOT GIVE A FUCK about showing violence. They are so fucking violent it's nauseating. So regardless of the bullshit they are putting out that "oh they didn't show the beheading because they'd get taken down on social media"
      </p>
      <p>
       ...... yeah because ISIS' main concern is their facebook account and of course facebook can't shut down your account(s) if you're a terrorist but definitely if you are a concerned citizen pissed off about the countless lies you have been told since birth.

       agree with this. Go spend some time poking around the questionable internet sites and you can find plenty of real isis beheadings mass murders etc. They do not give a fuck about censoring themselves.

       There are images of heads on bodies. Implying that the heads used to be on the bodies. This, however, can be accomplished through CGI. An image of a rotoscoped head atop a body is not proof that the person was killed. The clip I referenced is a pretty convincing shot of a detached head looking up and blinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not convinced by the shots of a still body with a head and a pool of red liquid.

       An authentic terrorist organization would not employ stylistic editing effects, multi-camera set-ups and not bother to show the very thing they're claiming to do. As 4chan would say: "tits or GTFO."

       No, you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen their production studios and they're a very professional group. They're union, you know. I have a buddy who's been a gaffer for the last year and a half. He's even invited me to set on two occasions. Anyway, he says ISIS has probably the best craft table of any 'reality show.' The location shots are a bit much, I've heard, but any time they're in a studio it's just a dream. And I can personally vouch not only for the craft, but also for the catered lunches. Even the extras get a good meal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I still want to see their post set-up. Lotsa talent in there.

       While I'm not gay, I was raised in theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a certain biting silliness that I was exposed to as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the sardonic pithiness of so many gay people I've known comes from a full acceptance that you're always going to be seen as the odd man out. This gives a strange sense of freedom to be as outlandish as you want to be. Since you're already going to be weird you may as well embrace it. I'm naturally strange and so I identify with gay people only in that I feel kindship with people who are viewed as 'different.'

       And of the top five people I've ever personally known, one of them was a flaming queen.

       There are some profoundly disturbing videos of jihadi beheadings on the internet - they are gut-wrenching and give you an almost out-of-body experience at the horror of what you are witnessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three recent "beheading" videos courtesy of ISIS studios in downtown Tel Aviv are NOT like this at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing explicit, no cutting, no bleeding, no close up of wounds in these recent videos. You see a dispassionate speech from the supposed victim, and then you are simply presented at the end with a montage of his apparently headless corpse with his apparently severed head placed upright on his back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our minds are easily fooled by context and peer group pressure. In instances like this where there is no conclusive evidence for your mind to determine the truth of what you are watching, you need to "listen to your gut" about whether what you are seeing is real. With the ISIS videos my gut reaction (or subconscious, if you will) tells me they are not what they seem.

       My exact thoughts... When I heard the news of the first video.. I ended up searching it and came across a real beheading.. then another. I never found the Foley video..but figured I didn't want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watched it..and felt that same wtf feeling I had after watching Indiana Jones survive a nuclear bomb in a refrigerator.  Watch any real beheading (it will really only take one) and you'll understand.  Clearly fake..

       My initial gut, AND rational analytical analysis tell me they are EXACTLY what they seem.. FAKE. They dont seem real in the slightest. Its offensive anyone thought they were haha..
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing these are missing compared to the real beheadings ive seen.. in the real beheading videos.. everyone is amped up.. everyoens adrenaline is ON MAX! The guys doing it is screaming, or talking loud.. i mean hes about to cut someones fucking head off with a knife.. but this guy hes just talking.. the guy about to get his head cut off.. no flinching.. no breathing heavy.. nothing.. clearly not two people who anticipate a beheading is about to take place.. such bad acting.. sooooo bad

       Proof its fake:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It doesnt show it, all real ones show it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Its too produced, filmed with various angles and camera cuts during the scene like its trying to make up for something missing, real ones a re a gritty camcorder video thats just there to show the content, not make a fanfair of nothing.. usually if someones blowing smoke and waving magic bullshit its cus its bullshit
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the most proof of all.. their behaviors... see my above post. THEY ARE NOT ACTING LIKE THEY ANTICIPATE A BEHEADING.. In the real videos, both the executioner and the victim are amped up and nervous.. breathing heavy, and usually the executioner is talking very loudly, angrily and energetically with max adrenaline.. u know.. like hes about to fucking kill someone by sawing off there head.. kinda how ud expect. These guys sound like there reading a script.. shittily i might add.. Its BAD ACTING, and its OBVIOUS
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Proof as to who made the videos.. that I have none.. not sure who or why, i can only speculate on various possiblitites.. likely ill never know which is sad

       They show no beheading.  They all show several draws of the knife across the neck with not a drop of blood spilled.  How they can carve into the trachea and jugular without spilling blood is beyond me.  Aside from this, any true terrorist isn't going to professionally fade their video to black as the act of terror is perpetuated.  It kind of defeats the point.  Even further still, if I were staged for a planned beheading, it would never happen.  The people in these videos are incredibly calm and reading from a script.  Ask yourself, if you knew your head was about to get lopped off, could you kneel before a camera and keep the composure of a news anchor as you read from a script?  I can honestly tell you that I wouldn't be able to.  They'd have to kill me off camera cause I'd be trying to escape.

       PoWs and prisoners are often subjected to fake executions as a form of psychological torture and conditioning. There are enough sketchy things regarding the videos, stop repeating this non-point

       Oh, I think I get it, this is supposed to be some bastardization of "Yessir, boss" isn't it? I'm not you're boss, and you don't have to actually stop saying that. It only makes

       He has ben subjected to repeated fake beheadings before. When he flighted he was probably beaten. He has become a slave to them. That you don't know that makes me wonder what other assumpions you make without knowing things.

       even supposing they were starved, tortured, beaten and or worse (which doesn't appear the case in their speech tone and pattens or physical appearance, they know they are about to die.

       Watch the videos. There's nothing there that will shock you unless seeing a still shot of a head on a body at the end will be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consensus from security analysis is that the beheadings are unlikely to have taken place at the time of the videos. The last thing you see is each man being held on his knees, his captor grasping his head and the knife pressed against the captive's throat. The captor then begins to saw back and forth. No blood - nothing. A small amount of resistence in each video from the men on their knees, but no major thrashing or anything indicating that their throats have been breached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: I've seen a lot of beheadings. There's blood. A lot of blood. All of these genuinely look as though the sawing of the knife is not penetrating the flesh.

       Fake. If the videos are scrubbed from the net there is a reason. In a country that prides itself on freedom and being the home of the brave. We apparently are not free or brave enough to judge the videos for ourselves. Conclusion, the media is hiding something.

       These videos all look green-screened to me.  The colors aren't reflecting the environment right, and the shadows look a little too crisp to be outside in the desert.  Every video we have seen of these alleged beheadings appears to be taken the same time of day too.   I'm not an expert, but to me, these indicate signs of a green-screen. It's as if they are superimposed on some stock footage of a desert scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It reminds me of early FMV on computer games like Wing Commander III, IV, and Prophecy.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And this whole matter begs many questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If these people are real, but not really dead, where are they now and what are they doing?  Will they resurface and join society again? How?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If these people are not real, then their identities are contrived.  Can no one identify their real names based on their faces?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If this is really ISIS/AlQaeda doing the beheading, we know they are vicious enough to do it-- and show it.  Why are they censoring it now? They never have in the past, and we have seen other videos of them brutalizing innocent people all over the world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who stands to gain the most by releasing these videos?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I know this is macabre, and I personally do not want to witness any gore, but these are important questions that nobody in the main stream press ANYWHERE in the world seems to be asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       These questions bother me a great deal.

       Did you just skip over the part where I said I wasn't an expert? I don't think I can. But there is the digital forensics group in the UK who spoke out about the first video.  Maybe you can ask them.

       I won't watch them, either, but the blue screen is really, really obvious, especially in stills. And why do these guys always cover their own faces when they're supposed to be proud of what they're doing?

       I'm not under any big belief that the victims are still alive, but the whole "beheading video" aspect is insanely fishy.

       Both 1 and 3 make a ton of sense. They want as many people to see these people die, so I think 1 might be a little more plausible. 3 could be the case, but I find it hard to believe that they would do this for 3 separate beheading (unless they did them all in the same day and then only release the videos when they feel like it).

       What is this, the MPAA? This is the internet, dude, it doesn't matter. If you don't show it happening, you haven't convinced me it happened. That doesn't mean it didn't happen, but you can't tell me that it DID. Because neither you nor I have seen it. Unless you were there. Were you?

       Not true, these dudes may have had an extreme haircut. They may have not. We can't confirm, nor deny it (thanks Nixon, for the great line).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They don't show the beheading because the events are coordinated in a such a way that the "messages" are filmed at some point in the past, and the victim is beheaded at some point in the future. For example, they film the mock beheading with the message, but keep the hostage alive for an indeterminate amount of time after filming... maybe days or weeks... BUT do still behead the victim and photograph the body. They then add the photo to the end of the video of the mock beheading, implying a false timeline.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But the false timeline narrative it an terrible argument, because they release the entire sequence of events as having happened NOW, in REAL TIME, or whatever. This isn't a fictional series with clifhangers for next week. It's a perfect extension of 'reality of TV,' to get us sympathetic to go to war/bomb Syria/etc.

       Do you work for a competitive beheading video production company by any chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time I saw someone engage in public so weirdly like this, it was some intern working for a competitor asking customers everything they could in order to trounce the subject of conversation (not a beheading video production company, but I'm sure you understand how the behavior can be extrapolated across industries).
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't work. It just made everyone suspicious and creeped out.

       Look along lower edge of bodies in corpse shots and you will see hard black jagged shadow inconsistent with rest of lighting. It's a composite. Sorry you are too naive / simple-sighted to see the manipulation. It's pretty obvious.

       Hilarious.

       You can't call something "expert eyes/expert knowledge", then go on to tell someone they are too 'naive / simple' to see something. That is fucking retarded logic and smacks of naive / simple reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't experts in rocket science just assume you are a naive simple retard for not understanding the exact physics behind the weight/distribution/thrust required of a rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain it if you are so expert, or go away without making yourself look like exactly what you are calling others.

       There is no beheading shown and no blood. Download the torrent dude. It's something you need to see for yourself and decide for yourself.

       I shall play your game!

       These videos were released/distributed/what-have-you by the SITE Intelligence Group, a private, US based firm which has been linked with the older, fatter, OMG-why-is-his-beard-black-now Osama Bin Laden videos in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them show a black-clad, British accented brown-skinned man clad in black from head to toe with a comically small pen-knife (maybe it's 6-8 inches at best, but let's not split hairs) who actively provokes the most powerful military power in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind the fact(s) that he has a nice, nondescript, unidentifiable desert background, a constant windy breeze for their prisoners (in the characteristic Gitmo prisoner garb, a nice touch if you ask me), and the footage cuts off prior to the actual action EVERY SINGLE TIME. Seriously, his small knife imitates cutting the necks of the 3 captors so far, despite any blood escaping with each and every cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the video cuts itselff out, and then pans to poorly placed, 'headless' bodies with the heads rested on the captives backs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note - I am not stating that these events didn't happen - but they didn't happen the way the US MSM reports it as, which is enough (for me at least) to cast doubt on all reported
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       since then and is a great watershed moment for all of my friends, family, and coworkers.

       Why don't you want to watch? There's no violence, only
       <em>

       violence, like the last 2 (and likely the next few), and the script is horrible. Whatever purpose these are supposed to serve (beyond showcasing someone's high school video production skills) is a mystery, because they certainly aren't eliciting the intended reaction.

       There are no beheadings in any of the videos, so I don't see why you wouldn't want to watch. They are fake as hell. One of the main reasons so many people are outraged is because hardly anyone has watched the videos.
