       That's very interesting, but I find that most people who "know a lot about sports" also fall into a category of mainstream propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only speak for people in my area, but relating to Chomsky's anecdote about callers on a sports talk radio network....it's all BS. Most callers are just parroting the same stats they've seen on ESPN or any major sports network. They are just spouting the same trite nonsense that has become the "sports talk show" wherein caricature talking heads "disagree" with each other in fake debate. The truth is, they actually know very, very little about
       <em>
        playing
       </em>
       the sport, especially at the highest level. In fact, most of them have never played the sports they hold so dearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       like world affairs.

       Well, no, I think Chomsky's point was: people are willing to
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       like they believe in having their "own opinion" on certain aspects of sports. Like questioning a coach's decisions, or questioning a player's abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he doesn't account for how many people
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       question their political leader's decisions, or question their abilities. Ever actually listened to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck? Coast to Coast? Alex Jones?
      </p>
      <p>
       While some of those don't fit into "mainstream" the fact is, people still are programmed by others telling them their opinions. People internalize that knowledge that is spoken to them (propaganda) and make it their own opinion. Then they call in to blab about it. It doesn't change the fact that they aren't thinking for themselves, be it about sports, world affairs, gardening, music, whatever the fuck people are "blabbing" about.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, it's not that people know too much about sports, and not enough about world affairs, it's that people believe what they are told, no matter what the topic.

       I agree, from time to time I will flip to a local sports talk radio network in the car if no tunes are on. And it's sooooo bad. It's just the same shit-show any media is.

       pretty interesting, but for me, it's not that I want to live in a fantasy world as much as it is that I can't ever tell who is telling the truth and who is blowing smoke up my ass.  That is why I don't know a whole lot about international affairs, it's just too damn hard to tell who's giving you real info.  But some of it also does stem from the fact that I don't feel like I can impact much.  The only way IMO to make a difference in the world is to obtain a ton of power and wealth.  Which is kind of what I am against in the first place!

       While I had my retail job over the summer, I talked to
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of people. The majority of which are willing to
       <em>
        listen
       </em>
       to alternate ideas than what they've been told in school or the news. They might not consider them immediately, but it's planting the seeds that matter- getting the ideas out into the collective.

       I also agree. I dont think anyone knows what follows a revolution though. The fear of the unknown is what really stalls any shift.

       I think that's why we feel a revolution is close: the government is getting arrogant. They are slipping up- showing their hand. They are being much more obvious because they know they can get away with it. However, there is such a thing as too far, and I think whatever the "next big event" is will be enough to snap people out of their sleep.

       The people who are going to have it the roughest are the ones thinking that everything is okay right now. Thinking the dollar is getting better and the geo-political climate is actually stable. Some people don't want to think that one event could could trigger a series of dominoes that no one saw coming. Within a short time we could be living in a very different world and some people don't want to accept that as a reality let a lone a possibility.

       I engage them in casual conversation and gauge their personality. I highly value empathy, and believe I can easily determine someone's personality within a few minutes of conversation (in real life, internet is much harder). If I feel like they are someone who will be open minded, I lead into it. If not, I go about my work.

       I am seeking converts everywhere I go. The only way we can change things is if we actively do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       My boss doesn't care what anybody in the store does, as long as we're doing our jobs. Engaging customers in conversation is beneficial as long as we don't linger too long / are working while speaking with them (which is what I do).

       I've been doing the same as you. Planting little seeds everywhere i go. Since the subjects of conspiracies are so vast its also easy to tailor which subjects to bring up to certain people. Saying little things like 'Could be an Ice Age coming this way'. 'What, no. The planet is warming.' 'It hasn't warmed in 15 years and the climate is a fickle thing.' Then just leave it at that. Then as the next few years continue to get progressively colder and our growing seasons get shorter and shorter maybe they'll remember.

       Yeah, I've had to fire people at jobs for doing that. Turns out telling someone who lost family in 9/11 that the government was responsible pisses people off. Who knew? Well, aside from them, because I had a pretty similar reaction when they brought it up to me. It's filterable on here, I just don't open those threads if I don't wanna lose some IQ points. At work, short of breaking dude's jaw, I pretty much have no option.

       At IHOP we overheard the table of elderly women behind us talking about not trusting the government.  My wife and I didn't talk, just listened for about twenty minutes.  These ladies were saying that another war is a mistake and we should let the Middle East solve there own problems.  One said "it's all so they can sell more weapons", the others agreed.

       My job takes me all over the place..many people I've spoken to are very open to talk about this now. I believe people are taking notice and an interest in fixing it. They definitely don't subscribe to the ideas at first, but I give them a few places for information (US constitution, executive orders etc) then all of the sudden the media defined liberal becomes a libertarian or has new a view. It's happening, the media won't cover it..but I've noticed the change.

       Yea and your choice of news talks about other issues too. The NFL season just started and as greyharmonix stated both players are superstars in the sport. (however rice is no longer a top 5 running back imo.)

       Ok and last night there was 1. Isis, 2. EbolA, 3. Respiratory sickness in ny right now, weather, and sports. How is this any different of a news cycle than the normal? Seriously you're just being a troll and ignoring any evidence that is being presented to you. Please actually respond to my response to your news segment instead of changing the subject as you have all over this post. Thanks

       Are you aware of how to hold a conversation? I'm starting to wonder if you have selective reading issues or possibly a very real mental/social disorder.

      <p>
       So on one hand your saying they are just spreading fear with Ebola and Isis, but then saying they shouldn't talk about the most popular sport in the country on the other hand because of war? So they should talk about Isis? Dude your argument makes zero sense.

       i can understand how one would feel that way, it might be possible,
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that domestic abuse is not new &amp; happens everyday- everywhere, and is made known, even moreso because of social media, any "celeb" is gonna be "blasted", i don't think that because someone makes "X "amount of money they should get a"get out of jai free card" because the man is a sports professional,
      </p>
      <p>
       abuse probably does occur more often with women of color with a household income way less that what these guys make, imo it doesn't make it less horrible because of her skin color, (which is not to say that it doesn't happen with white people, it does) when this happens (to anyone, every one
       <em>
        should be
       </em>
       speaking out), is it because ppl have become desensitized to violence? does it matter if liquor or drugs were involved? is it relevant that his
       <em>
        job
       </em>
       is to knock down another man?
      </p>
      <p>
       the bottom line is that domestic abuse should not be accepted - at all - 
i wonder if the reason the laws aren't tougher is because white males are at the top of the food chain?

       Sports are always a distraction, thats the fucking point.  No one wants to live full tilt in hell all the time.  Taking time to get away and enjoy yourself is important to your psychological health.  You don't like sports.  But that doesn't mean people who care about sports, caring about their favorite players doing something, is a conspiracy.

       Going to the movies, buying Batman underwear, buying the Lego's of the next Hobbit film, or that awesome Tardis breadbox is the exact same distraction and wastefulness as someone buying a NFL ticket, the jersey, the big head poster and bobble head. it is you giving time and money to something that entertains you, distracting you from the shitty existence that we all live in. And the people that watch/play sports will say the same about you and what you do to distract yourself.

       Its not wasteful to me though.  Its wasteful to you, because you don't like it.  You find no value.  So therefore anything you do that I don't find enjoyable would be wasteful as a hobby.  To me, smoking pot as a habit is wasteful.  I smoke it for pain relief.  To me, just smoking it as a hobby is wasteful.  Investing in a fluxuating currency that will die off if the internet gets shut down is wasteful to me as well.

       But its your hobby and something you enjoy, meaning its not wasteful to you. And thats all that matters.

       The dude who smacked his wife, that happened months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one now happened now, and its a big star, who does a lot of community work and gives a lot of money to community charities, beat his son with a switch leaving lacerations and bruises from mid back to his ankles.

       Considering his status, yes its a pretty huge deal.

       Is war more important? Yes.  But its not like thats gonna be on the news.  Obama says its not war, they parrot it, and in the end no one knows its escalating quickly any way.  Sports news isn't taking the place of real news.  That would imply we would get real news.

       In the grand scheme of things. No. It's not a big deal. They tug on your heart strings with news like this. It's tragic, sad, and sucks.

       but the bombing and murder of Afghanistan is a lot more important than one kid from one NFL player being abused, again, tragic as it is.

       I'm also of the belief that if its not sports, it will be something else, so at least its noise I can stomach.  I don't believe for a second that there is an option for them to start reporting on anything you mentioned that actually is important.

       Sometimes people need a distraction from the important things in the world. You can't spend every waking moment of your day obsessed with how awful the world is...
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you have any hobbies? Friends? Those are distractions too. Are you saying those are bad things because they distract you from your paranoia? There are more important things in the world than fearing the machinations of our elites. You will live your life and then die someday, regardless of what conspiracies exist. Try enjoying something instead of dreading everything.

       Yes, but when looking at sports in the grand scheme of things, is a little child abuse scandal really more newsworthy then whats currently happening around the world?  The fact of the matter here, is the joke that our current MSM is, putting little football scandals at the forefront of credulous minds - when WW3 is currently a possibly, and tens or even hundreds of other more pressing issues can be talked about

       This is not a good argument for anything.  Lots of thinks are distractions from social issues of the time.  Who says I'm obligated to focus on them all the time? Who says people can't multitask? Its not like I ignore whats going on because I watch sport.  This isn't an either or situation like you are making it out to be.  Anything you enjoy doing, as a hobby, is by default not a waste of time since the point of the hobby to glean enjoyment from something.

       As I said in the other response, its not like they would be reporting on us going to war in the first place.  Its a mistake to believe that if Adrian Peterson wasn't in the news, we would be hearing about escalating violence in Iraq instead.

       “The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we … kill those people. "Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up!
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”

       That itself sounds like a better reality. I'm tired of being chained down, mentally and socially. We are just slaves.. that's it. I want to live in a world where I can make a difference. This world is brainwashed into overcoming authority, why is there always a need to overcome authority? Oppression? This world is a broken record with leaders turning into tyrants, over, and over, and over again. I'm tired of that. I just wanna explore and make a difference as in a discovery, or to simply have the freedom to be where I want to be, do what I want to do without anyone telling me I can't.

       Haha I just read something about people who spew insults in regard of things they do not wish to believe. Didn't mean to single you out, all of us are. Even if we don't want to be.. even if you think you aren't. We are literally trapped.

       EDIT: Football is real lol, not saying it's created by the government for mind control. What I am saying is that it is utilized as a distraction by the media. It's a stupid notion to think the nfl isn't corrupt.

       You make an assumption that because a football player's ban is of no interest to
       <strong>
        <em>
         you
        </em>
       </strong>
       , then it isn't newsworthy at all, and therefore there must be a conspiracy behind the decision to elevate news stories you deem not worthy above the news stories you do deem worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you considered how egocentric this whole idea is? The NFL wouldn't be a billion dollar business if there was no appetite for it. News editors are tapping into that appetite, even if you have no interest and aren't the target audience for the stories.

       lol this is totally off topic and a rant but the NFL is really just a show- all the players are doped up because that's what people like to see and they crave it. I never fully understood why someone could say "we won" when they did jack shit to help out the "team" other then in helping full fill their massive contract payouts. If someone enjoyed sports, I don't see why people wouldn't try to be involved in ACTUALLY PLAYING.. unless of course they are disabled or something or the sort. When looking at events, I feel like i'm distracting myself heavily when I watch tons of fitness channels and powerlifting meets n stuff on youtube and the sort and compare it to those who watch sports or other useless shows on television, but then i reassure myself that I'm actually doing something for my own self improvement rather then hollering at a tv with a bowl of chips, my buddies and some beer :P

       This is not a good argument for anything.  Lots of thinks are distractions from social issues of the time.  Who says I'm obligated to focus on them all the time? Who says people can't multitask? Its not like I ignore whats going on because I watch sport.  This isn't an either or situation like you are making it out to be.  Anything you enjoy doing, as a hobby, is by default not a waste of time since the point of the hobby to glean enjoyment from something.
