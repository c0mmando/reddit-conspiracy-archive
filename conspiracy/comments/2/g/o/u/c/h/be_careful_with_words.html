        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some phrases and words are designed to influence your
beliefs and even behaviors. 
This may seem obvious but the application is very
subtle and most of time you do not realize you&#39;ve been
lead.
Be mindful that the judgments and decisions you make are 
controlled by subtle guiding forces of suggestion.</p>

<p>This is very important:
Your thoughts may not be your own.</p>

<p>A good example is unemployed. 
And another related example is when you get &quot;let go&quot; from a job.</p>

<p>Unemployed suggests an abnormal condition. Whereas having a job 
and being employed is normal and acceptable.
A better description for being unemployed would be something 
like &quot;available&quot;, or better yet &quot;free&quot;. 
Imagine that.</p>

<p>Being &quot;let go&quot; from a job, suggest that the employer has 
released you from bondage, you are now free so to speak. The truth 
is no one can &quot;let you go&quot;. You are always free to do as you 
choose in life and the only control others have over you is what 
you allow them to have.
But then they can&#39;t &quot;let you go&quot; to be free without suggesting shame 
and humiliation. So then you carry the shame of being labeled 
&quot;unemployed&quot;.</p>

<p>When you meet people the first questions they 
ask are &quot;what do you do?&quot; This is the criteria by which you are 
judged.</p>

<p>This is all by design mind you. In order to keep the mass 
population in line.
You are conditioned from a very young age to follow this 
command.</p>

<p>&quot;what do you want to be when you grow up?&quot;
You are asked this because you have to be something.
You must be lead to believe that you can not exist without being 
something.</p>

<p>This is how the weak minded are governed.
There cant be free souls wandering the earth, doing as they 
please, because then everyone is equal.
The greatest fear those in power have is losing their power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elaborating on the question of &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; 
This sounds like a simple question, but it is loaded.
When a child is asked this they are being conditioned into a certain mode of thinking.</p>

<p>This question forces the child into a corner, and they have no choice but to make a decision. They put themself into a box, label themself and limit who they think they are and what they think they are capable of.
To label yourself as anything, be it a lawyer, or a doctor, or a policemen you have boxed yourself in to a finite existence.
When you call yourself an engineer, you can&#39;t be a lawyer at the same time.
When you&#39;re labeled a doctor you can&#39;t be policeman at the same time.
it doesn&#39;t matter what label you give yourself, or how many, you are placing a shackle on your self if you do.
But to simply be, then you are without limit or expectation.</p>

<p>Through subtle suggestion in answering a simple question they have been made to limit themselves.
This is how we teach our kids!  By starting out with limitation.
And from there controlling them is easy because all the work has been done by the individual them self.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all about how you define yourself, which I think is the point that you&#39;re getting at.</p>

<p>My answer to that is always father first, husband second, depends on my mood what comes after.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your job?&quot; is an entirely different question and if someone chooses to judge me for that, I have absolutely no qualms about telling them to fuck off to their face.</p>

<p>Same answer as above, sorta. Since I&#39;m an adult already, my answer is a better man / father / husband than I was yesterday.</p>

your opinion is based on the belief that you don&#39;t do something unless you can get something in return.  This concept is the foundation that a credit and debt society is built on.  It is a wholly corrupt way of life.
Nature does not operate on a credit and debt system.
Integrity involves giving without expectations.</p>

<p>How so? My parents are retired and I think they contribue to society.</p>

<p>But why are you assuming that if someone is unemployed they are taking advantage of society? Not only do people pay back into society in many ways including through other forms of taxation than income tax, you can live without burdening society if you have enough money to support yourself. You have fallen into the very trap OP is warning about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! Don&#39;t try and justify the system, it&#39;s a failure. People would be more compelled for a job if they didn&#39;t feel like they had to. We are taught growing up that what life is in America, is finishing school, get a job, make money. Cuz you know.. that&#39;s all we want.. it&#39;s our world, some might die for money. WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO!! I literally just don&#39;t understand why everybody doesn&#39;t get that the biggest thing the establishment has to fear is a revolution of the American people. This could all end whenever we see fit. We need to realize everything OP just typed and move past it, come together! Or we will simply be trapped and told what to do, forever. Now is OUR time. JUST like it was icelands time. JUST  like it was our time in the 1700&#39;s. Those people were slaves to taxation and fought and died for their freedom when GB seemed larger than life. The outcome was their very own independence as a nation. America is larger than life, we are slaves to taxation, we need to be prepared to fight and die for our freedom. Can you imagine America 2020? 2050? This is our last chance, this generation. Our time. Our freedom. Stop pushing eachother away and for once, actually work together to BE larger than life.</p>

<p>EDIT: It goes without saying that many of you will read this, some might favor, some might ridicule. Either way it will be read but we will take no action. We can&#39;t do this alone. We can&#39;t wait for it to just happen, WE have to be the happening.</p>

<p>Having a job is NOT contributing to society. It&#39;s generating a paycheck to hopefully support yourself and family, but there&#39;s no guarantee it&#39;s actually a contribution to society.</p>
