       one thing I've never heard government kooks or anyone who buys the official story...
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK ordered the top be removed from the vehicle at it was being unloaded from the airport...(or so we have been told...I think this order was given by the powers above JFK, with the excuse that he should be out in the open to wave to the people)
      </p>
      <p>
       how would a lone gunman "oswald" know this?
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as anyone was concerned.. JFK would be driving in a bullet proof vehicle

       I've never heard this theory, but it makes so much sense. I have always felt that when a President doesn't do what he is told, "They" bring him into a meeting and ask him how he would prefer to be assassinated and then show them the real footage of the JFK assassination.

       Haven't read it but it's what I believe.  The reason is that there was so much to plan and put into place that it couldn't have come from any low level lone gunman.  This went way up the chain.

       Guys, I think I now know why he was killed. There are many reasons, but this is really the big one.

       I've been telling this story for a while now, so my apologies if you've already heard this, but if not, its worth looking into.  It's the key to everything.

       The bubble top was not bulletproof, but it would have made shooting him more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Jim Lehrer, who was a reporter with the Dallas Times-Herald at the time, the decision had already been made that there would be no bubble top if the weather was nice and he had published that fact in one of the stories he wrote in advance of the president's visit.

       The theory that I subscribe to was put forward by a guy who spent over ten years analyzing ballistics evidence and eyewitness accounts. Can't remember his name but he wrote a book about his findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, he says that Oswald fired two shots. The first of the 3 casings found in the book depository was an empty that he kept chambered to keep his rifle clean. This is something that some Marines would do, or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other evidence is that Oswald's rifle, a 6.5 mm Mannlicher Carcano could not have made both wounds found on Kennedy's head. The entry wound must, by definition, always be slightly larger than the diameter of the bullet that makes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the wounds on President Kennedy's skull was found to be only 6mm. It could not have come from Oswald's rifle. There is also the extreme difference in the effects of the two shots. One shot went through Kennedy's neck and wounded John Connolly, yet was barely deformed. The second shot exploded the President's skull. So you've got one bullet acting like a full metal jacket and  second one acting like a hollow point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is that the fatal shot actually came from a Secret service agent in the following car in the motorcade. He was carrying an AR-15 loaded with 5.56 mm hollow point ammunition. This supposition is based on all the ballistic evidence, coroner's examination and eyewitness reports. People at ground level remember smelling gunpowder.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may have been that this was the ultimate friendly fire accident. The cover-up (yes) originated within the Secret Service itself. They did not want the story to get out that the President was actually killed by one of their own. This does explain their behavior at the hospital, the hasty clean-up of the limosine, missing Xrays etc. This would also explain why top level governments officials in-the-know were all willing to go along with the official Oswald-as-lone-gunman story.
      </p>
      <p>
       There
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a conspiracy and a cover-up, just not the one that most people have suspected.

       Idk, I have a hard time believing JFK accidentally got killed. It was cold blooded murder that was covered up.

       Well, this theory still leaves that possibility open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall that Oswald claimed he was "a patsy". That's a pretty strange thing to say if you wanted to become famous by shooting President Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe he got this idea right after firing his last shot from the depository. The sequence goes like this, eject empty protective cartridge..... Motorcade comes into full view, fire first shot (miss)... fire second shot (Kennedy struck in the neck).... Secret service agent in following car fires 3rd shot (Kennedy struck in head and killed). Oswald would have been watching through his scope at this point, probably lining up for his next shot. Imagine what must have been going through his mind when he sees Kennedy struck and killed by a different shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       He would have immediately realized that he wasn't the only shooter. It's hard to believe that he would have ever considered the possibility of an accidental shot coming from the Secret Service detail. He may have been correct in assuming that he was there as some sort of decoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that op mentioned the randomness of the bullet-proof roof being taken off at Kennedy's request. What would have happened if it had kept on raining for a little bit longer. Would Oswald have attempted his shot anyways? Any other shooters in the area (regardless of their identity) would not have had any success either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible for an accidental shot like this to happen? I can visualize the agent in the following car taking the safety off and scanning the area after hearing the shots. He might very well have wanted to see if the president was OK through his scope. The guy driving guns the motor at that moment to get closer to the President's car. Agent with AR-15 involuntarily squeezes the trigger due to a combination of pure adrenline and momentary loss of balance caused by the sudden acceleration. Shot goes off, history changes forever.

       Yeah but I don't believe the kill shot came from behind.

       Was the book you speak of written by a guy who was at the assassination and had one of the bullets that didn't exist hit the curb next to him scratching his face with the concrete debris? His name is James T. Tague. I bought my first car from him 11 years ago. It was a LeBaron if you wanna know.

       that theory was debunked...
      </p>
      <p>
       there was dallas police riding alongside hickey (the secret service man your talking about)
as well as kennedy aids in the same vehicle who would have seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is only one photographic evidence of hickey holding an AR, which is pointed straight up and well after the assassination.. secret service all carry automatic rifles, and it makes sense that he would have it out after the assassination .. also it was unclear as to the trajectory of the killshot.. donahue pretty much guessed and took someones word, and didn't actually have physical evidence..also.. there was previous attempts that were called off. kennedy was suppose to be assassinated in florida, and there was even a death bed confession by e howard hunt.
