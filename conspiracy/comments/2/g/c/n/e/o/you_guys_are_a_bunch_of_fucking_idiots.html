       Hey thanks man. How about all the false flags that were supposed to happen? What happen there? you know 2012, 9/11 every year since, or how about when legarde alluded to late July being a global currency reset? I guess everyone was just off the mark huh?

       You fallaciously accept the actions of individuals in our midst and generalise into degrading the community, based solely on this false projection you interpret as communitive group think. It's quite fascinating in it's similarity to the persecution of protesters in Ferguson for the actions of looters. how often do you commit to reasoning like this, blaming the actions of a few on the community at large?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rather childish and naive, don't you think? To suppose matters you have no practical knowledge of, to denigrate others you haven't even explored, to limit yourself with such a simplistic policy of hierarchy and importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, you clearly missed the purpose of this place, or wilfully ignore it. As for your agenda, whatever it may be, might I suggest dropping it?

       I happen to find you pretentious, you most likely sat there for a good 20 minutes coming up with this argument. Sad. Another sign of why people like yourself think this way. Go out, interact with other humans. You and I both know this isn't how you speak. You're just trying to impress people you'll never come into contact with.

       As for agenda. I am trying to better my life and the people around me (in real, actual life) so absolutely I have an agenda. And so should you. Not following these idiots on the internet and buckling down for doomsday. Its not coming.

       So you came to an obscure internet forum to which you hold no interest in, to insult a bunch of people you know nothing about in order to better your life and the people around you (in real, actual life). No, that's not ironic at all.

       I came here to let you know you're all idiots. But why change the subject? Do you not have any valid, fact based, argument as to why you're not idiots? I'm thoroughly enjoying you fellas trying to defend yourselves. So yes in a way I am making my life better. You might disagree with it, but trust me I know all about who you guys are.

       Who are you to say we are not trying to better our lives? Who are you to say some of the people that come here do not whole-heartedly believe in half the stuff posted here as much as we pay attention to how these people come to their conclusions therefor learning a new way of thinking. Instead of being stuck in the same mindset and try to learn a new way of thinking? Yet you better yourself by believing people you know nothing about are idiots? You're right i do disagree with it. Even the dumbest person on the planet has a different perspective of something and knowing that perspective may not improve your idea on the subject but can more or less increase your way of thinking about others. You ARE the only idiot i see here.

       Yup, humans have been running this civilization for 7000 years, and not a one of them makes any plans to enrich themselves at others expense.

       That is the thing, everyone does that. Why are they wrong for winning the game? And no fucking way is there one group handling it. Maybe several fighting to control it. But, not one group. There will never be one group controlling it until we have a reason to unite. Like space exploration. It is people like yourself and people like ISIS thatprevent that from happening.

       We have a reason to unite right now: space travel. We[humans]'re not doing that because all of our resources and effort are being siphoned away to pay for the imperialism and fascism of the ruling class.

       I'm sorry i haven't seen the fascism (accept for ISIS). Imperialism you could give an argument for. But, it isn't without consent of major powers in whichever region it is taking place in.

       Mussolini was a minor league dictator, who by default had to go with what Hitler did. Hitler was a fascist, Nazi's were fascist. The United States is not fascist. Were you able to get a cup of coffee and read the newspaper this morning? Yea you were able to. Were you able to go purchase a weapon this morning? Yea, you were. I happen to have plenty of weapons. Have you ever been questioned by the police for doing so? No you weren't. Farthest thing from fascism.

       He or she would be the one pulling Obama's puppet strings, as well as most of the other politicians in the house and the senate. I do not know exactly who they are, as that is the way they want it, it may actually be a consortium of sorts, but believe me, that authoritarian dictator does exist. I could speculate on the identity of who this might be, but that would just be an educated guess. Nothing that I can prove conclusively, which I why I shall refrain from naming any names.

       Who's pulling his strings? Corporations? That not a conspiracy, it's documented fact. So since you have the evidence and proof of whats going on, what will you do about it? Or is this just a sub to document about how they're fucking you in the ass?

       Yea man, I guess you're just a superior person. Let me go back to my sheeple and contribute to my 401k and IRA's. Sorry to feed the machine, us sheeple know the only way is to do what the flock does. It has nothing to do with enjoying retirement.
