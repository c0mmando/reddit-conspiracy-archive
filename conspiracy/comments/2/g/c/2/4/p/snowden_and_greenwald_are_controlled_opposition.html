    <div class="md"><p>Five years ago, reddit was full of insightful comments.  Those comments take time to write.  Nobody writes them anymore because the incentive is gone.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say a high percentage of comments on reddit are from robots, or paid posters who don&#39;t even know what site they are commenting on.</p>

<p>Also, all the popular threads have 1000+ BS comments with nonsense voted to the top.  What&#39;s the point of commenting if noone will ever see  your comment.</p>

<p>Reddit is dead because the actions of reddit admins, not because of widespread paranoia from government propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the government that protects free speech.  It&#39;s the moderators, owners, and admins that turned this website into a joke.</p>

<p>no i dont. all he linked was all the articles that snowden&#39;s documents have produced. </p>

<p>in my mind, its all propaganda pieces designed to educate the stupid american masses about how their 4th ammendment rights are repedateltleylylyl violated. </p>

<p>sources? google limited hangout, google mkultra, google cointelrpo. </p>

<p>limited hangout is too limited a term.. in the beginning i thought it was that simple, then i learned of benthams panopticon theory</p>

<p>Just realize that those of us who believe them to not be genuine and choose to ignore them and reports around them sometimes get annoyed seeing their &#39;reports&#39; all over the place here.

<blockquote>
<p>with the ability to implement oversight and dismantle these programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oversight.. please, you think we the people will EVER have oversight over the MIIC? please</p>

<p>1) how about the amount that has been released.. say 3-4%? how long are we going to wait? 30,40 years? </p>

<p>2) explain pierre omidyar ... hes a fucking billionaire. you think he has his interests with the people? you think he cares about privacy rights? </p>

<p>3) thanks for posting the links... and yes, russ tice and michael drake. you said it yourself.. that &quot;Snowden gave us hard proof&quot; ....</p>

<p>thats all grand, i know he did. believe me, i believed he was the biggest hero ive ever seen and i loved greenwald. ... but.... then i thought about it more.. i read tarpleys article on limited hangouts (im mad at tarpley for not speaking out more on snowden).  then i thought critically. </p>

<ul>
<li>snowden confirmed it all, yes.. but we already knew they record every phone call</li>
</ul>

<p>bill cooper said that in 2001, you know, the video of him predicting tptb using bin laden as a boogeyman in a false flag</p>

<p>... so, can you see <strong>HOW IT MIGHT</strong> all be a scheme to scare americans by reminding them they live in a police state?</p>

<p>4) Snowden toes the official story on 9/11... your thoughts?</p>

<p>5) greenwald to, i believe.  thoughts? is 9/11 not the litmus test? if you heard greenwald say &#39;&#39;those dam 9/11 truthers are crazy&quot;... your thoughts? </p>

<p>6) how about the biggest leak... that they spy on 5 muslim americans? please... thats news?</p>

<p>conclusion: its much fucking deeper then snowden or greenwalds articles... look at the whole picture of how its portrayed in the corporate media sphere.... it was given attention for a reason</p>

<p>Even with the strategy of slowly letting out the leaks, it is being lost in the Zeitgesit. Snowden&#39;s fighting a PR battle against apathy and the MIIC, that&#39;s no easy task. Slow, timed leaks are the key. Whatever Greenwald was stopped from leaking a few weeks back was probably really interesting stuff. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think he saw a business opportunity in Greenwald and took it. Not all news is corrupt, nor are all wealthy people corrupt. Bill Cooper comes to mind with regards the former, and JFK with regards the latter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so, can you see HOW IT MIGHT all be a scheme to scare americans by reminding them they live in a police state?</p>

<p>The only scheme I&#39;m seeing here was to keep all of this information hidden for as long as possible until the infrastructure could be setup; such that it could not be debated. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t toe the line on 9/11, but I understand what would happen to the character of anyone who was attempting to impact change in the public forum and openly dissented from it. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say the man needs to look a bit deeper into the issue. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how about the biggest leak... that they spy on 5 muslim americans? please... thats news?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not the biggest leak. The fact that there is a literal front end data dragnet, via physical boxes in the regional offices of all major American ISP&#39;s pursuant to section 703 was the biggest leak. The fact that Section 703 was being used at all in the manner described herein was the biggest leak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conclusion: its much fucking deeper then snowden or greenwalds articles... look at the whole picture of how its portrayed in the corporate media sphere.... it was given attention for a reason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you that there is most likely a modicum of truth behind the sentiment that the way in which Greenwald has presented the information may not be entirely on the level, but in no way do I agree that it follows logically to conclude that a) we would be better off without the leaks or b) that the Snowden leaks were orchestrated by elements of the US government. The latter two conclusions defy any and all objective reality that I have come to understand surrounding the situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if its on the front page of the new york times or Washingtonpost... it isn&#39;t revolutionary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, the Washington Post went crying to the DOD when Showden first approached them and the Grey Lady outright turned him down. If Snowden didn&#39;t go to the Guardian this stuff was never going to get out.</p>

<p>Also, remember, the press did not want to run this; they wanted to frame it a certain way and that is why the power of a free and open internet is the only chance we have to actively promulgate the most necessary and pertinent information surrounding these leaks to bring about the necessary oversight to see them brought to an end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This previous comment of mine which I think apropos: &quot;Predictive/imposed determinism translates (for the purposes of the NSA) into a regime of political and economic unidimensionality over the entirety of the world and over all the human individuals contained within it; it is a subject that is amply documented in academic sources, and yet there is hardly any mention of it in Wikileaks’ entire archives. On the other hand, predictive analytics/determinism forms the very substance of and the basis for the Snowden revelations; how to explain the yawning discrepancy between the paucity of testimony of predictive/imposed determinism in the Wikileaks archives on the one hand, and its overwhelming corroboration, indeed instantiation, by Snowden’s NSA-centered revelations on the other? </p>

<p>How is it possible, more specifically, for American authorities in the White House, State, Pentagon and elsewhere to say with a straight face that ISIS is “Beyond anything we’ve seen” and by implication that as far as their predictive analytics are concerned it was an inconceivable development, when, for example, Philip Bobbitt seems to have very much anticipated the development of such terroristic “market states” in his book ‘Terror and Consent’? And, in turn, how is it possible for the press to accept such astounding and astoundingly profuse professions of institutional blindness, unpreparedness, and ineptness without nary a published and credited remark of incredulity or skepticism?&quot;</p>
