       Let's be rational about this.
       <br/>
       The latest beheading was justified by the ISIS as payback to England
       <br/>
       for colluding with the USA to destroy ISIS.
       <br/>
       Seriously, what's the logic behind it? "I'm going to kill a white dude to further
       <br/>
       incite other white dudes to come here and kill me."
       <br/>
       Even for a radical muslim, that makes absolutely no sense at all,
       <br/>
       if the goal is to PREVENT western nations from attacking.
       <br/>
       It seems, as if ISIS wants the west to invade (again) and wage war on their soil.
       <br/>
       Well, why would ISIS want that? It is not beneficial for muslim locale,
       <br/>
       however it is very beneficial to western oil corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the members of ISIS are actually western agents, posing as radical muslims,
       <br/>
       to give western countries a pretext to invade and wage war in the Middle-East.
       <br/>
       Therefore, we should ignore all beheadings by ISIS and let them go,
       <br/>
       to prevent us from playing ourselves straight into the hands of the oil corporations.

       No one in the MSM even questioned the authenticity of the beheadings. No one in the MSM dared say they look fake as hell and why they cut away from the act itself if the goal was to shock people into rage and vengeance. Having them look too slick and over produced made them appear much more fake than they needed to be.

       Ferdinand's murder was the excuse sold to the population for the war. It was a false flag like the subsequent lucitania disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are freemasonic fingerprints all over Ferdinand's death, not to mention the Zionist/Rothschild Balfour Declaration as a major factor in both world wars.

      <p>
       They wanted a war to scare the world into accepting a "League of Nations" as well as an Israeli state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither ended up working out, so they created the conditions for another, even more devastating war. They succeeded that time, getting their United Nations and Israel.

       I understand that ISIS has murdered a lot more folks than just those three. I watched the videos of them killing hundreds of young Muslim men, though I wish now that I hadn't. The point I was trying to make, is that the Government is trying to drum up support for a war with ISIS based on the purported beheading videos. Which is three people. Why are they not trying to drum up support for was where many, many more people have been murdered. I just don't understand how any sane person can conclude that those three lives taken in those videos are worth more than the thousands of deaths occurring all over the region. Or that somehow those lives are worth going to war over but all the other lives are not. It sickens me

       Obama drummed up support for airstrikes and troops on the ground due to the potential genocide against Yezidis, the protection of Erbil, a city which completely supports the US and the people in the region who are taking care of over a million people of different faiths and ethnicities. If the Kurdistan Region fell it would have been a bigger disaster than the falling of Mosul.

       ISIS my in fact be the real deal (initially funded by the US of course and then set loose). But that doesn't mean Jihadi John is. I'm convinced its some bullshit marketing crap to beat war drums and stimulate MIC spending.

       I think so too. I feel like the real ISIS is loosely controlled through funding, weapons, some agents in the leadership, etc. It's probably not that hard and you don't have to get your hands dirty.

       Then why wouldn't the real ISIS issue a statement that it wasn't them? As OP pointed out, it isn't ISIS' interest to have western superpowers coming after them. I guess that could make ISIS look unorganized and weak if they contradicted themselves like that though.

       The U.S. and Canada are the only two countries I know of that use orange jumpsuits. The U.S. military would also be considered a user of those same jumpsuits.

       The hooded man is holding the knife with his left hand which means he's left dominant. His gun holster is under his left shoulder. Which means he would fire his gun with his righ hand. Which doesn't make sense. You should be dominant with a gun or knife using the same hand. So either he's wearing the holster for show or they didn't do their research before putting this show together.

       I assume the knife was held in the left hand so the camera could see it  better.
       <br/>
       If it would have been held in the right hand, the prisoners body could have obscured it somewhat.

       Your point that the beheadings make no logical sense to prevent nations from attacking is perfectly stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you jump to: "So, the members of ISIS are actually western agents, posing as radical muslims," you lost me.  Your premises do not guarantee your conclusion.  I am all for Conspiracy theories and questioning the reports, but I think drawing conclusions like that, based on speculation (albeit seemingly logical) is dangerous.

       I agree with you.

       However, the speculation I made before this one was that the Estonian  police agent was kidnapped by FSB agents before the FSB confirmed their involvement. My statement rustled a lot of jimmies, but eventually I was vindicated.

       It all seems so convenient. Remember when they wanted to bomb Syria last year and the public came down hard on the idea? So now we get a beheading a week to try and turn the message around and FOX News and others are gleefully banging the war drums every quarter-hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, giving weapons and training to Syrian moderates? Is there such a thing? What about the reports that these journalists that are being beheaded may have been sold to ISIS from these so-called moderates?

       Do all conspiracy theories start with the phrase "Let's be rational about this"? Reminds me of someone that says "In all honesty" before a sentence. It's like they are apologizing beforehand for being otherwise dishonest, which calls everything they say after that into question.

       because it will obviously bring about the very opposite effect. The West is more powerful than the mid-east therefore does not feel intimidated. This behaviour by "ISIS" and the media coverage only encourages further war and destruction in mid-east-- this is the zionist agenda. It is designed in a way to keep you clueless and supporting the cause- "fighting extremism".

       If ISIS were legitimate, they'd make a video stating that they had no quarrel with the West (even if they really did) and that they just wanted to control their own lands, free from colonialism. Any beheading they did would be kept on the down low for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Bush and Cheney lied about a lot. The idea that all these wars are design to decrease attacks on the West is insane. They are trying to stir us all up against one another with false flags and indiscriminate killing. They want instability.

       I assume the knife was held in the left hand so the camera could see it  better.
       <br/>
       If it would have been held in the right hand, the prisoners body could have obscured it somewhat.
       <br/>
       Since I am familiar with directing a movie, I can assure you from my own experience that the video
       <br/>
       is arranged to achieve the maximum theatrical impact possible.
