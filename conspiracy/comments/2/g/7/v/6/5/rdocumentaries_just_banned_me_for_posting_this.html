        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all,</p>

<p>My company distributes a lot of controversial docs. A few have been featured in this subreddit including <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ao8s3/resonance_beings_of_frequency_this_weeks_featured/">Resonance: Beings of Frequency</a> and <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2013-01-29/now-itunes-hulu-flixter-and-rotten-tomatoes-911-explosive-evidence-experts-speak-out">9/11 Explosive Evidence: Experts Speak Out</a>.</p>

<p>Just now, I posted a new doc we distribute called <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/685881">The Greater Good</a> that is on HULU to r/Documentaries.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/2g7lua/the_greater_good_2012_the_greater_good_is_a/">Link to post in r/Documentaries</a></p>

<p>After posting a proper HULU link and formatted correctly I got banned. No explanation.. I rarely leave comments on Reddit and my 2 previous subreddit posts to R/Documentaries were widely accepted.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/2f9o02/sriracha_2013_in_2012_huy_fong_foods_sold_20/">Sriracha</a>
<a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/2fkazk/crafting_a_nation_2013_crafting_a_nation_profiles/">Crafting A Nation</a></p>

<p>Is this typical Reddit behavior? Sorry if I&#39;m just venting a bit. I thought this community would appreciate the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I kind of feel like people that tie themselves in knots like that because they can&#39;t effectively argue their own point of view are proving my point that their discourse is shitty.</p>

<p>&quot;Mommy, why have all the rich people stopped vaccinating their children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because, dear, have you seen the pro-vaccination people converse? Who wants to ally with <em>that</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if these guys aren&#39;t actually anti-vaccination deep down, because the frothing abuse with no scientific backing really turns people off (and in some case, onto researching for themselves). </p>

<p>It frustrates me, because I&#39;m not actually anti-vaccination, more like anti-pharmaco corruption--I see that many of these vaccines need to get better, some are unnecessary, some need to be avoided in certain populations, and the schedule for newborns seems really too aggressive, especially for kids with immune issues, but these people are incapable of doing anything but spitting bile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s becoming more and more clear to me that they&#39;re not paid and not even investors, and that&#39;s so much more depressing. If you look back into some of the most abusive pro-pharma or pro-GMO posters&#39; reddit history, you see a lot of slurs towards women and people of color. They post about games and they also like vaccines. It&#39;s really weird. Like, if you hate women and black people, you should also be pro-glyphosate-in-all-the-foods and also take your Risperdal and Seroquel? I don&#39;t get it. </p>

<p>It kind of hurts my soul to think about, I used to think they were bots, but the insults are kind of hilariously sad and angry (I&#39;ve dealt with them outside Reddit and on other social media platforms, too--some of them real people I know aren&#39;t bots), so I just blame Dawkins and peer pressure and sadness and call it a day.</p>

<p>For entertainment purposes, there are message boards out there frequented by pharmaceutical workers - kind of like the old FuckedCompany if you&#39;re old enough to remember that. They communicate differently than Reddit pharmatrolls, but not so smart, either. But fun reading. There&#39;s no honor among thieves as far as I can tell! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the belief that many of the accounts you were referring to in your first paragraph here are paid trolls.  They make comments in other subs in order to appear slightly more legitimate since if they <em>only</em> posted vaccine propaganda or <em>only</em> GMO propaganda then they would make themselves completely obvious.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, we should never underestimate the number of &quot;useful idiots&quot; who have been indoctrinated into the cult of Big science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a whole shitshow over there now as someone posted some propaganda doc placing all the blame on parents&#39; for not vaccinating for outbreaks caused by ineffective acellular vaccines. (I would like to know when everyone involved in the film last got their MMR and DTAP boosters, before they abuse parents.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s the standard poo-flinging shitshow around vaccines - parents who experienced adverse reactions are downvoted to hell and accused of lying while angry frothing &quot;Every shot that comes out of the factory is perfect! Inject all the THINGS, you baby murderers! Correlation does not prove causation! MWARRRRRR!&quot; jerk it all over the thread (I&#39;d love to know if these guys keep up with their acellular vaccine boosters, too, or even have children).</p>

<p>Disappointing, but not surprising. I do wish human beings would realize there&#39;s always a middle path and that it&#39;s the only real way forward. The far left and right always loop back to the same entrance!</p>

<p>Yes. Reddit is extremely pro-vaccine, to the point of throwing all rational criticism of them out the window. Even pointing out something like not all vaccines are made equal and some may cause side effects is enough to get you downvoted to hell.</p>

<p>Vaccines don&#39;t work; the popular science behind them has proven to be very faulty, but the researchers who look into this often lose their funding and/or careers:
<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/vaccines_and_immune_suppresion.shtml">http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/vaccines_and_immune_suppresion.shtml</a></p>

<p>Check the links at the bottom of that article as well.</p>

<p>Concerning your wanting me to consider countries who are without polio now, one convenient way to ensure the efficacy and success of a vaccine is to change the name of the disease it is &quot;preventing&quot; or &quot;curing.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are stats for acute flaccid paralysis from the National Polio Surveillance Project in India (sponsored by the WHO); cases are increasing over last year. Also, note Table 4 and the number of cases that presented vaccine polio virus in stool samples (especially vs. wild polio virus): <a href="http://www.npspindia.org/bulletin.pdf">http://www.npspindia.org/bulletin.pdf</a>
...and why that&#39;s important: <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/11/17/smoke-mirrors-and-the-disappearance-of-polio/">http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/11/17/smoke-mirrors-and-the-disappearance-of-polio/</a></p>

<p>Understand that by the CDC and WHO guidelines, if you have received the polio vaccine, you cannot be diagnosed as having polio, even if you do; it must be listed as another disease.</p>

<p>In sum, polio was re-defined as AFP, and the numbers show that the vaccine was causing it. Because this has become an obvious problem, they&#39;ve revisited an old diagnosis of &quot;Vaccine Derived Polio Virus&quot; to explain the matter:</p>

<p>&quot;First case of VDPV&quot; reported in March of 2012:
<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-19/india/31209820_1_oral-polio-polio-vaccine-polio-virus">http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-19/india/31209820_1_oral-polio-polio-vaccine-polio-virus</a></p>

<p>Yet, here&#39;s a report on the same problem in 2010:
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/polio-in-india-many-steps-up-and-a-long-one-back/">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/polio-in-india-many-steps-up-and-a-long-one-back/</a></p>

<p>So, the media is told what is a problem, when it&#39;s a problem and what to call it next. All those poor people who contracted polio from the vaccine were diagnosed with AFP and now VDPV. The polio vaccine is the #1 cause of the disease worldwide, and it would probably have disappeared if the pharmacists hadn&#39;t kept it alive and spreading, and the latest news, as you implied, is that India is now polio-free.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s more on that, and it&#39;s infuriating:
<a href="http://www.omsj.org/blogs/polio-gone-but-vaccines-will-continue">http://www.omsj.org/blogs/polio-gone-but-vaccines-will-continue</a>
<a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/smoke-mirrors-and-disappearance-polio">http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/smoke-mirrors-and-disappearance-polio</a></p>

<p>Have you read the Finnish study showing that the swine flu vaccine causes narcolepsy? <a href="http://www.omsj.org/blogs/polio-gone-but-vaccines-will-continue">http://www.omsj.org/blogs/polio-gone-but-vaccines-will-continue</a></p>

<p>Yet, the CDC, et. al. are mystified as to what could be causing a &quot;strange nodding disease&quot; in Africa, even though Bill Gates and the WHO are on the warpath there with their needles:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvTgsTqKL3U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvTgsTqKL3U</a></p>

<p>An excellent documentary from New Zealand. It&#39;s very easy to understand and heavier on the science than the pathos. All 9 parts take about 1hr40min to watch, and you would be glad you did.:

<p>Here&#39;s a collection of research studies linking vaccines to various diseases. Just look at the titles and journals. Some of these are publicly available online, but most are by subscription. You could find them at the library if you&#39;re more interested in the details of any of them.

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to say thank you for Resonance. This has been massively influential to my brother and I and has helped us change our behaviours at home as well as our consumer behaviours. Simply one of the best documentaries i have seen given that it offers such a huge education which is easy to pick up, apply, understand and even debate with people.  I would never even consider buying an iwatch or google glass or any wearable tech, whether its the &#39;future&#39; or not, im not having this shit microwave my brain or other body parts. I try to never keep my phone on my person these days too. respect and thanks</p>

<p>edit: to also add in what else, we have basically completely got rid of wifi now too, hooked up pretty much every machine in our house via ethernet since watching, the ones that easily can be at least. </p>

<p>If you have a mac, download a program called flux. It gets rid of the &#39;blue light &#39;effect on your computer/laptop that can have the undesired effect of stimulating and confusing the brain for late in the evenings, in turns it more of a pink hue, its nice, haha.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, but we don&#39;t know why you were banned from that subreddit. My best advice would be to leave the mods alone for a bit and then maybe in a week or two try asking them again. If they don&#39;t respond it might just be best to find other subreddits to participate in.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know them inside out, even doctors take advice from me, I show them papers and studies which they&#39;ve never seen.  </p>

<p>The main difficultly is that vaccines are based on junk science and the pharmaceuticals want to avoid filling in the huge gaps as they know exactly what it will show i.e. that vaccines are starting up highly profitable autoimmune diseases, this is exactly the reason why Big Pharma push them so strongly, they profit when we are on drugs for life.</p>
