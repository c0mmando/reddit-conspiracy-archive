       From aliens to jfk, from Princess Diana to Saville, from 911 to NSA/CIA, oil, Iraq, Syria to Isis and Israel it's always appears to be the same people who have the most to gain by this. Isn't tying them all together and presenting them as a whole backed up by evidence the best way to expose the corruption, exploitation and savagery that TPTB perpetuate. I mean if it's actually done and in it is stated which groups are going to try and debunk the theory with evidence of them doing such things before and then release to social media the theory. By release to social media I mean everyone on this sub spreading it all over Facebook and Twitter even if those among us don't have such things to register to said services to sacrifice your own anonymity to spread and promote said theory. Only together can we ever hope to truly reveal to the public what's been going on behind to scenes of international politics. This sub has 250k users if we all spread it and get others around us to spread it it would exponentially increase in the amount of people being exposed to the theory.

       It's only taken me 2-3 years to wake up and see how so much of the corruption and lies tie together under a few shadow puppet masters, and in doing so I've realized just how fucked we really are. A mass population die off is inevitable and will be intentional. The world's resources have been seized while overpopulation and global economic collapse is rapidly approaching its precipice. The stage is set for the NWO.

       Its fucked up completely but we need to do something before we are Doomed if we don't then we're just making it a whole lot easier for them. On another note population control has been in effect for a while it's not just profits they get from perpetual wars

       People already repeat who it is...it's had the same exoteric name for several decades at least in the public mind...the Illuminati.

       It doesn't matter about keeping up its about making a picture of what's happening backed up by evidence. The bigger more evidence we gather linking these facts is what's most important not just ranting that it's the illuminati.

       We can gather some evidence...however the bulk of it that puts the pieces together is down many dark occult avenues that not just the public, but many researchers, are not willing to go nor able to understand.

       a Snowden/Assange/Greenwald  ama is what we need in this sub. We need a single page website that anyone can post relevant information on. No mods not admins a make and leave Webpage where everything is recorded without being deleted and all discussions happening here on r/conspiracy. Being a single Web page website it would be entirely transparent with no deleted posts (obviously no reposting) a place with no clutter or real design where a webpage posted is  simply made into a picture and displayed, as well as audio/video posts being copied to help prevent losing the evidence. It could have a similar set up to Google where it is stored is on multiple servers around the world; meaning if any one server is taken down there's a few hundred more to take its place. With multiple servers any attempt to change the information would easily detected by cross referencing with the other servers to keep the information the same. People like you and me could be the ones to run it keeping a dynamic ip address. Would need a central few servers to direct people to the home owned servers based around the world according to those whose owners are online.

       Imo, pedantic dissemination of these theories is exactly why so many people view us negatively. I counter your claim that it this will exponentislly increase the amount of people being exposed to the theory, and instead, argue thst it will actually exponentislly increase the amount of people who will close themselves off to the ideas... Imo, anyhow.

       I like your opinion, but this is why I said it needs to be done with compassion and the start would be us talking to our loved ones first about it and getting them aboard and then it would be multiple generations backing you up.

       Interestingly, i spoke to my grandfather the other night (hes visiting from Germany... I have dual citizenship due to being the child of an immigrant -- my mother).
      </p>
      <p>
       He is retired from the german navy, and during his career obtained a NATO Top Secret Clearance. He was very intriguing with the things he was saying. He sincerely believes in germanys non-interventionalist doctrine (for obvious reasons), but kept saying that everyone needs to be deploying their troops to help out down in africa because of the ebola virus. He went further and made some startling statements that alikened Putins shenanigens with the Ukraine and not too long ago with Georgia, to hitlers sprawl of conquest in the beginning of the mess we call ww2.

       I couldnt believe it at first. My grandfather, one who always spoke truthfully and quite bluntly (as us germans do), one who has always been reasonable with his political mentionings, was actually supporting a lot of what is discussed here in this sub. Not all of it, just certain things.

       Now, i understand this is anecdotal, so take it for what you will. Im not trying to make you believe an old mans opinion passed along by some random dude on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just offering this anecdote to point out that even some of the older folks know whats up with the world. I guess ignorance is not discriminatory to ones age...
