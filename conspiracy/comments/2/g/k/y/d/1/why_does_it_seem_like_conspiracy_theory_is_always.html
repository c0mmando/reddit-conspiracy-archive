    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;conspiracy&quot; thing fails the common-sense test, IMO.  Politicians and rich people fight each other like dogs; they&#39;re in competition with each other for money, power, publicity, etc.  Even if they&#39;re in the same party or same administration or same company.  Sure, there have been trusts and collusion from time to time.  They always come to light eventually, with hard evidence to expose them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least since the 1970s, the conspiracy-theory label has been applied pejoratively to a wide range of suspicions and allegations of official wrongdoing that have not been substantiated by public officials themselves. The label suppresses mass suspicions that inevitably arise when shocking political crimes benefit top leaders or play into their agendas, especially when those same officials are in control of agencies responsible for preventing the events in question or for investigating them after they have occurred.</p>

<p>Communication scientists Ginna Husting and Martin Orr, both professors at Boise State University, have studied the use of the conspiracy-theory label as a putdown and have explained how the label works to silence suspicion. The conspiracy-theory label challenges the very rationality of persons who voice suspicions and thus shifts the subject of discussion from the suspicions to the speakers’ competency or lack thereof.</p>

<p>DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967. The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money controls the people in government. The industries with the most money have the most influence. The industry that makes money itself has the lion&#39;s share of influence, banking. Most of our wars can be seen as advancing the interests of this top lobby group. Libya tried to make a gold backed currency. They were hosed. Iraq under Saddam started selling oil outside of the petrodollar. He got hosed a few years later. Iran is selling outside of the petrodollar and look at how bad propagandists want to attack them. It&#39;s all about the money. It&#39;s all about keeping the world buying our dollars to get oil so we can keep economically feeding on them by printing more dollars in exchange for their goods and services. If they ever drop the dollar, we&#39;d experience the same thing other nations do when they rampantly print money, massive inflation. For now, the world feels the pain and the bankers, and secondarily the USA receives the gain. Follow the money, find the human parasites behind the misery. </p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t foresee the insurance payouts, how was he going to afford to do this?  If it was by way of investors etc, why don&#39;t we have a look at that viable business plan, please.  I understand a private citizen is under no obligation to publicly disclose their decade-and-a-half-old private business plan, yet it would be interesting and would be rather comforting to know that the official story might be plausible.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is, conspiracy theories are not even shut down that often in our society. Watch the history channel, they have programs on conspiracy theories all the damn time. So the idea that people have been indoctrinated to reject conspiracy theorists is nonsense. In reality, many conspiracies simply are crazy. Everything from Reptilian overlords, to the twin towers being destroyed by lasers just are crazy ideas. And while some may be more plausible than others, ultimately a lot of conspiracy theories are just nuts. As for those that seem more plausible, people most often don&#39;t believe them because there&#39;s no evidence. Conspiracy theories are so far removed from official stories that the conspiracy theorist needs a lot of evidence for his position, evidence that hardly ever exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its an umbrella term created to group all aspects of critical thinking and government scrutiny into one label that every &#39;normal&#39; person sees as crazy. have some doubts about what we are being told in the media? are you opposed to unending war as a means for profit? or what if you just oppose the Federal Reserve?</p>

<p>Well, nope not anymore. As soon as the word conspiracy drops, the everyday folk have been conditioned to think you now believe in everything from reptile overlords to zombie hitler and who knows what else TV and movies are associating with the term.</p>

<p>Its actually very effective at grouping all of the things authority doesnt want people talking and thinking about, and putting it on the fringes of society in the crazy pile. Quite annoying when you try to have a conversation with someone you think is open minded, then out comes all the looney disinfo shit associated with conspiracy theories....drives me nuts sometimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most conspiracy theories are batshit crazy.  Given the number of people that have to be involved in most, but see no benefit from, conspiracies, most are implausible.</p>

<p>Also, when pointing out that implausibility to conspiracy theorists, there&#39;s always one additional thing to explain why so-and-so hasn&#39;t spilled the beans yet.  These plus ones continue to have less and less plausibility until the entire thing is broken down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most people soon realize that conspiracy theorists have no evidence to support what they say.  CT&#39;s just start with a conclusion (usually, govt is evil or corps are evil, or something), and then make up &quot;facts&quot; to support their conclusion.  People see through that behavior.</p>

<p>Some key telltales about CT behavior:</p>

<p>1- When any significant event occurs, within MINUTES there will be N new conspiracy theories to explain it.  No waiting for facts, just right to the theory, and it never goes away, regardless of future developments.</p>

<p>2- Most CT&#39;s I&#39;ve conversed with claim to know the REAL TRUTH about many different events.  JFK, Roswell, 9/11, Illuminati, etc.  Somehow all these things done by amazingly powerful, enormously secret organizations are known by this ordinary guy typing on his computer.  Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear, plain and simple.  It took me several months after 9/11 to really question the official narrative despite one of my closest friends suggesting that about a week later (he had a professor who was immediately suspicious), oh, and despite that and the ridiculousness of the official narrative.  It is fear of realizing how many ideas we grew up with were lies and how much less influence on the world we have than we were brought up to believe.  How non-egalitarian the world really is.  (Edit: Oh, and how stoopid the American electorate has become.)</p>

<p>Later I accepted it and many thousands of hours of functionally useless research later, I have developed a pretty good sense of what I do know, what I don&#39;t know and what I am, and probably always shall be, unsure about.</p>

<p>None of that pyramid magic and alien heritage stuff though.  Also no superhuman powers like telepathy or precognition; that&#39;s all bull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorists can&#39;t handle the truth.  Bad things happen without needing any govt conspiracies.  Some people hate USA because of the dictators we support and the way we use our military, or because of their religion.  Some nut-jobs assassinate presidents or prominent people, for their own twisted reasons.  CT&#39;s just want to pin everything on the govt or the corps or the rich, and will make up &quot;facts&quot; to try to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think its just anger. Its the lies and coverups that get CP upset. Other shit happens all the time but the government is usually right on top knowing they are not accountable or follow the same standards as the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you have it backwards.  The CT&#39;s are angry at govt or whoever long before an event occurs.  As soon as the event occurs (9/11, MH370, whatever), the CT&#39;s jump on it to invent theories and make up &quot;facts&quot; to fit their conclusion.  No wait to see what the official story or investigation is, just right out with the anti-govt theory.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget that plenty of people are making money or political gain out of the conspiracy theories.  They&#39;re writing books, giving speeches, and/or whipping up voters against Obama or whoever.</p>
