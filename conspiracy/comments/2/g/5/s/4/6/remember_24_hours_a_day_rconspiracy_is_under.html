<p>These are my exact thoughts and have been since a few days after Snowden came onto the scene...it does not matter if he thinks he is legit or not, the fear of the digital panopticon has been put in place. And a Limited Hangout has multiple &quot;uses&quot;, this is only one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TPTB used Snowden to let the 99% know just how powerful was/is their surveillance technology.
TPTB&#39;s surveillance technology is so powerful and advanced, that the majority of the 99% didn&#39;t even know about the extent to which they/we were/are being surveilled. How could you hope to scare the shit out of the sheep you control if the power you have over them is so advanced that they&#39;re not even AWARE of it?
You have to make them aware of your ability and power over them first, right?
How else are you going to keep them scared and intimidated if they don&#39;t even know the big bad wolf is always watching them?
Enter a stool pigeon that puts forth just enough of a limited hangout to let everyone know that &quot;Yes. TPTB are that advanced in their technology.&quot; but doesn&#39;t really tell the people anything that wasn&#39;t already available and public knowledge before hand. Just give the pigeon enough of a platform that he&#39;ll be listened to exclusively. This is exactly what&#39;s happened w/Snowden.
That dude has gotten so much frickin&#39; press over this whole issue, and yet he hasn&#39;t actually made any real mention of just HOW advanced the technology really is. What he&#39;s mentioned has kind of been out in the mainstream for a while now. He just consolidated it for everyone to hear.
Now that Snowden has said what he&#39;s said NOW everyone is scared and up in arms about &quot;government surveillance!!&quot; The sheeple are even MORE scared of the big bad wolf now than ever before now that they know that big brother&#39;s been watching them this whole time.
That&#39;s been the main point behind Snowden&#39;s info. He&#39;s an agent TPTB have used to keep the people all the more controlled and scared and agitated and on edge than before. After all, a people on edge and in conflict and agitated are a people much, much easier to control.
And Greenwald? He&#39;s just the delivery mechanism&#39;s delivery mechanism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference in what to expect when you post on a subreddit like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a normal subreddit. Take the recent WTC7 demolition submission as a good example. The top comments had over 200 upvotes and agreed that the tower fell due to fire. This is not what you would expect from a place like this and it rarely happens, right or wrong. Hell, submissions in this subreddit rarely get over 50 replies, let alone the hundreds that post got. You would have to be an idiot to not realize that there are hundreds of people paid to sway opinion on popular social media/news sites or have you just turned a blind eye to the snowden leaks that cover that very fact?</p>

<p>Edit: Looking at your comment history makes me think you are one of these very people. You spend every day on reddit posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and government subreddits with obvious anti-truther rhetoric. Nearly every single one of your comments is trying to deny something a conspiracy believer said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While i agree with your sentiment, particarily your suggestion about the &quot;new&quot; queue, i gotta say that (i believe) a vast number of our subscribers are lurkers. They dont participate much for a reason. Maybe theyre trolls, maybe theyre brigaders, but also, maybe they are legit curious amd trying to discern the truth for themselves. Maybe they are afraid of having their reddit &quot;reputation&quot; hurt by participating in this sub? Who knkws? </p>

<p>But ive experienced the brigades first hand, so i know what you mean. And, lack of participation hurts, but in the end, are we all here to really spread the truth against others will to accept?</p>

<p>I, personally, will provide my insights and knowledge and research and whstnot, but only if asked for it. Im not one to force my position on others, amd i guess this is why it doesnt bother me too much when we get brigaded or whatever. Its easy enough to smell a troll, anyhow. </p>

<p>Instead, id like to encourage our honestly curious lurkers to participate, but i understand if they have their reasons why they havent done so yet. For those of us who are actively on here, i think, we should set an example, and make it easier for folks to feel comfortable to participate in discussion. But, this is just my views on the subject.</p>

<p>And again, i highly agree with yoir suggestion to check out the new queue. I rarely, if ever, check out the &quot;hot&quot; queue. I go straight to &quot;new&quot;, every time. That way i can pick and choose what interests me, rather tham allow some (possibly faulty, or corrupt) voting system to dictate the content thst gets presented to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lurked for a couple of years now,  and the only reason I don&#39;t contribute is because it&#39;s hard for me to keep up with all of the stuff that&#39;s posted here sometimes.  I wish I knew how you guys found useful information so quickly.  This forum has been a real eye opener for me. </p>

<p>Also that and I try not to post anything here because I&#39;m not trying to end up  black vanned in the future for saying to much.  It&#39;s hard to find a good medium on a public forum with topics of serious and questioning nature about how the world is being ran.  I wish this forum was a little more private,  perhaps invite only then I&#39;d feel a little more comfortable posting. I do however take a look at new and upvote unless it&#39;s something that&#39;s been posted numerous times.  Perhaps they should just get rid of the down vote button and have people report stuff they want to be removed.,  or just not upvote it so it doesn&#39;t get attention,  I feel like that would work alot better.  That way the important stuff that gets down voted will be seen and can&#39;t be manipulated. And anything that is posted by a shill, naysayers,  whatever adjective you want to use, can be discussed by the users and removed upon large consensus. </p>

<p>Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am one of those lurkers. I subscribed to this sub because I like to see a variety of points of view, whether I disagree with them or not. Sometimes I comment on here, but since I&#39;m not that big on conspiracies (I don&#39;t read up on much of them) I don&#39;t really have much to add to the conversation a lot of the time.</p>

<p>A byproduct of that is that most of my comments on here are when I am disagreeing with someone. It&#39;s not because I&#39;m trying to discredit everyone or am some &quot;shill&quot;. It&#39;s just because that&#39;s the only time I feel my comment is of use on here since a lot of the time there isn&#39;t anyone disagreeing with people&#39;s theories. </p>

<p>In my opinion it&#39;s a good thing to disagree with them and pick holes in some of these ideas. After all, isn&#39;t standing up to scrutiny the sign of a good theory? As soon as someone gets defensive and starts accusing people of being shills I usually switch off since if the only way they can deflect scrutiny is by flinging accusations at people, their ideas mustn&#39;t be very good in the first place.</p>

<p>what hits the front page</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, honestly, i dont care much for the conformity of the front pages. I guess thats just my personal preference, though. I understand where youre coming from. I jist dont share the same sentiment about the importance of the front pages. Imo, if someone really wants to learn about what we discuss here, theyll investigate on their own merit. I feel like it is a frivolous endeavour to try and broadcast to the unaccepting folks. I feel this is where a lot of the backlash we receive as a community stems from. </p>

<p>Sometimes the truth too overpowering for some to accept, acknowledge, or even give a chance to understand what we mean when we say &quot;TPTB&quot; and other stuff. Theyre more likely, imo, to resent and refuse to listen to the information if we try and force it.</p>

<p>Also, i could care less about the opinions of other subs, specifically the &quot;main&quot; subs like r/news. In addition, i feel folks would be more accepting of the topics we discuss here if they make the journey down the rabbit hole on their own. In the end, they are either going to give it a chance, or refuse to try to understand. I believe they have that as a right. </p>

<p>But then again, this is just how i feel. I understand if others dont share my perspective.</p>

<p>Almost all of it stems from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.  I understand the points you&#39;re making and it&#39;s true that you can&#39;t force someone to care about or look into something if they don&#39;t want to themselves, but lets not forget that shills, trolls, and vote brigades <em>are</em> a reality on this site and this sub.</p>

<p>Yea. I certainly dont deny they exist. Its an unfortunate result of human nature, imo. Ill present my case whem confronted by such, but only if they are willing to listen. And i tend to offer the benefit of the doubt until i hit my tolerance level, then i stop &quot;feeding the troll&quot;. </p>

<p>I know what i am about to say isnt the most popular opinion in our community. But, not all of them over at conspiratard are like that. Of course there are some folks over there that go out of their way to try and discredit or otherwise harm this sub reputation. But, there are some good folks there, too. </p>

<p>In the early part of my redditor &quot;tenure,&quot; i submitted a post to their site. I was surprisingly met with a bunch of respectful amd honest responses. Of course, i was met by a few who didnt give a shit about me. But, i feel it would be disingenuous to discount the entire sub over there because of the mentality of the others there. And whike i do not support that sub in ideology or in any other way, i do believe they have a right to exist. Its just that many of them take advantage of that right. </p>

<p>The same could be said with this sub. There are bad apples, here, too. We have racists amd bigots amd antisemites amongst us. We have closeminded loons here. But we also have a bunch of thoughtful, logically thinking, openminded folks here too. I believe this is apparant in every sub on reddit, where you have the good folks, and then the bad. The openminded versus the radicals. You know?</p>

<p>But, aside from that, i have personally seen some of them over there come over here to fuck with us. For instance, jist a day or two a post was submitted titled, &quot;whats up retards?&quot; With nothing in the details section. I reported that shit in a heartbeat, checked out the users history, And sure enough he posts to conspiratard often. Any posts he makes to r/conspiracy are mocking, ridicule, or argumentative in nature, without any attempt to hear anybody out. I feel that i can agree that a lot of our backlash originates from there. But also feel a lot of it comes from &quot;normal&quot; folk who dont give a shit about conspiracy theories (finding &quot;truth&quot; or debunking) who get annoyed when folks from this sub try and preach to them as to why they arent awake. </p>

<p>Kind of like how some christians wont stop telling you about jesus, even after you politely tell them that you dont want to hear it.</p>

<p>For that reason, i try to not be pedantic. At the same time, if one is truely curious or requests my opinions on certain topics, ill unload everything i got if they want it. Ive found this to be more effective than the bait-fishing of pedantic dissemination. But, of course, this is just me. Im not against my fellow r/conspiracy redditors from doing this, so long as they do so with due respect. You know?</p>

<p>I understand that position. And i dont <em>absolutely</em> disagree with it, either. I just tend to see the end result as negligable, if i were to try and actively disseminate the truth. A part of this is because i am still conflicted with everything. I view myself as patriotic, while understanding that our country and its government are two seperate entities. I do welcome folks to ask me questions, if they are curious. I love constructive discourse. So much so, that i feel compelled to avoid &quot;preaching&quot;, so to speak. Being pedantic towards other than acceptive people tends to nurture their resentment for what they do not know, imo. And i try to avoid this.</p>

<p>But i do support others spreading what they believe, so long as they do so constructively and with due respect. You know what i mean?</p>

The IRS scandal against conservative groups makes it possible for them to come after us next.
