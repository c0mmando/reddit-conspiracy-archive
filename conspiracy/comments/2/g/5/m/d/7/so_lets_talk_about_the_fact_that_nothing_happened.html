        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I listened to the doom and fear-porn ramblings of a large-scale, new false-flag—due today, yet unsurprisingly completely unmanifest—and I would like to say to us all, as a community: can we stop with the perpetual fear-fest of <em>it&#39;s just around the bend</em>?</p>

<p>I once maintained this same idea, which, admittedly, came crashing down as December 21st, 2012 came and went. Something within me shifted that day, and I realized that all of the days—over the span of many years—that I had spent in anxiousness, wondering, and, I am loathe to admit, some fear, were all for naught; I bought the rhetoric, and my mind was distracted by wildly off-course ruminations. I focused on the ethereal and illusory rather than the immanent and extant.</p>

<p>I would like to posit that we are under a collective glamour: the falsity of seeing the world of the future through the enculturation of Christian cosmological, metaphysical, and philosophical discourse. I would posit that while many of the world&#39;s cultures and geographical traditions contain speculations on the future, none contain such a doom and gloom message as that which is contained inside of the book of Revelation. I, for one, was brought up on a diet of end-times—I am not ashamed to admit this. But, I realized long ago that this was due to an erroneously literal reading of the text which had crept into mass cultural consciousness—painting our minds with the fear of the eventual end of the world. I have since come to view the Christian written tradition as simply the collection of writings of a specific religious culture—not greater, nor less than, any of the world&#39;s extant and extinct collections of religious texts. </p>

<p>I would also posit that the Maya end-date of 12-21-2012 (and I acknowledge that this date is disputed), which has come and gone, was jammed into this prevailing, Christian worldview. Seen through the lens of the indigenous Central American mind, I would say that their view of the future might look quite different when not colored by rampant Christian literalism.</p>

<p>Now, without leaning on conspiracies, I would like to point out how nicely this view of immanent doom and world-destruction fits very nicely into the capitalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension"><em>Strategy of Tension</em></a>, employed to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>divide, manipulate, and control public opinion using fear, propaganda, disinformation, psychological warfare, agents provocateurs, and false flag terrorist actions in order to achieve their [imperialist] strategic aims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Strategy of <em>Religious</em> Tension, has proven false <em>time and again</em> (the lyrics of the 10th century Catalan hymn <em>The Song of the Sibyl</em> alone should evidence this). The perpetual mongering of fear should be seen for what it is: a control tactic utilized by a state apparatus, oft-times through the spectre of religion, to maintain public confusion, fear, and uncertainty. The perpetrating of constant fear at <em>the next big event</em> is an arm of this Strategy of Tension, whether it is carried out consciously or not. We have existed within the larger atmosphere of imperial domination for many years, over the course of many centuries, and this strategy is not new. We participate in it willingly or unwillingly, but either way, we perpetuate the discourse of fear by repeating the words of those who seem to be in the know, who, like Gerald Celente, claim that “it is almost here!” We must, if we are to throw off the shackles of the fear which this imperialist strategy implants, rid ourselves of the notion of fear and claim our courage in the face of the horrors of the empire.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be afraid of. Throw off the fear, and look to creating the type of life which stands in defiance and opposition to fear and murderous imperialism. Let no one tell you otherwise. There is no reason to fear. 9/11/14 came and went, as every other date has. There is nothing to fear.</p>

<p>By not being slaves, my friend.

There are ways to circumvent this system; the more people do it, the more established it becomes. </p>

<p>There is nothing to fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I beg to differ. In todays american society, we as a people continue to allow our fundamental consitution to become more and more forsaken with each day that passes. Our rights are being secretly taken away, under the guise of the benefit for the whole. With each day, the pockets of the wealthy grow heavier, while the middle class is on its way towards extinction, and the poor class grows in numbers but diminishes in total assets. The class warfare is something to fear.</p>

<p>As is the undue usurpation of unconstitutional authorities that have become so commonplace nowadays, there is almost zero legal precendence left to fight it. This country is on a straight line path towards tyranny. That is something our forefsthers feared immensely, and is something thst we must also fear, lest we succumb to complacency and the pretty shackles that come with dependency.</p>

<p>Fuck the NWO, the Illuminati, the zionists, the terrorists, ISIS, Al Qaeda, WW3. Fuck all that. While it is interesting to me to read amd speculate about, none of these things are more dangerous to our livelihood in america than what is happened to the constitution. </p>

<p>I agree that it is a bit silly to <em>really</em> worry about isis coming over here and blowing shit up. While there is a real possibikity, and a real threat, with each of these topics, realistically speaking, we are doing exactly whst TPTB wish us to do, when we fear it. Afterall, thst <strong><em>is</em></strong> what <em>terror</em>ism is all about.</p>

<p>But, what we must fear, in my personal opinion, is allowing (intentionally or ignorantly) our country to continue down the path it currently has set its trajectory towsrds. Now, this does not meam we should lock ourselves in the bathroom and look up everytime we take a walk around the neighborhood, in case a drone is flying by or anything. No, thsts silly. They already win if we give in to paranoia based behaviors.</p>

<p>This is not something to fear everyday, in the manner that liberians currently fear ebola. No. But, there must be some level of fear, reserved with perserverence, for the sake of our progeny and their inalienable rights that we, as a people, are currently allowing (again, either intentionally or ignorantly) to slip between our fingers.</p>

<p>We have a duty to ourselvez, our children, and our grandchildren, amd every generstion thst comes after, to hold dear our fundsmental virtues as americans. We have a duty to each of our fellow countrymen to stand against oppression and tryanny in all its forms. </p>

<p>If we give them an inch today, we would then have allowed them to take a mile by the time our grandchildren come of age. </p>

<p><em>This</em> is what i fear, and i what i believe, as my personal opinion, is what we, the people, must fear together. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, this is also the one thing that rarely gets mentioned in MSM, if ever.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>I did want to say, that i enjoyed your post, and found myself agreeing with much of it. I especislly apprecisted your connection of &quot;doom and gloom&quot; glamour with strategy of tension. This was understood amd agreed to while i was typing my response. </p>

<p>I am sorry if i gave the impression thst i disagreed with your entire post, as this previous comment was only directed towards your statement that, &quot;There is nothing to fear.&quot; So, again, sorry if it came off as nitpicky or cherrypicking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your response. And I agree with the majority of your points, but my single, and largest, point of contention has to do with your fear. Why must there be fear? Why do you fear the fact that the self-styled bourgeoisie overlords are working to erode the strength of the common man, the <em>citoyen</em>(<em>ne</em>), the proletariat, and the precariat? While I understand that their methods aim at the induction of fear; if you submit to the emotion, then their strategy of tension has succeeded.</p>

<p>Fear is a weak excuse for anger, which, in turn, is a weak excuse for measured and reasoned action. So, adopt the latter! Create the type of fearless society in which we all should be living.</p>

<p>And no worries, you did not give the impression of nitpicking at all. I appreciate that all of our stances are different. Good discussion and no fear of political correctness makes this sub one of my favorites.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I mostly agree with your point. I do. But, i also tend to believe that the foolish are fearless, while the brave and courageous differ only in that they have learned to control that fear, and tap into the advantages one can extract from its proper nurture.  </p>

<p>I believe we essentially align with eachothers position. Maybe you werent speaking or meaning in the absolute, and in a more generalized fashion? But to clarify my argument, fear is needed in order to act. Should we become fearless, i believe we run the risk of becoming complacent, and thus give way to sloth rather than responsible action.</p>

<p>But, we must do so, as you said, with logic and reason. We must not he afraid of our own shadow because an evil exists that also casts shadows. We mist differentiate between all fear, and act accordingly. I agree that fear can be incredibly detrimental and disadvantageous. We must not &quot;submit to that emotion&quot;, but rather &quot;guide&quot; it towards usefulness. To do otherwise is to panic. And, as a parallel, i would like to say that i was a lifeguard for several years, and one of the main points of training is that even confident swimmers are at risk of drowning, if they panic. Panic is the crux of failure, and fear is the foundation of panic. </p>

<p>So, there is indeed a good deal of importance needed concerning the control of fear.</p>

<p>This is so why i love this sub. Especially when another has a different opinion or &quot;stance&quot; than i do, as it allows me to see beyond my own original perceptions, and gives me the chsnce to see things how others do, and maybe provide me with an opportunity to upgrade my position in a constructive and positive way. </p>

<p>I appreciate your candor, btw. =-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I am kidding you. An economic system based on wild and unchecked greed--one of the basest of human motives--which has since created a resultant cultural apparatus, is completely innocuous. Nevermind that the capitalist system, as an extension of imperialism, has subjugated billions under its pervasive and oppressive mandates; nevermind that the reason for every single war has been to empower private industry. If some of those industrial overlords happen to be Jewish, then so be it; but you are a complete fucking idiot if you are going to disregard the macro-scale issue in lieu of your petty and loathesome hatred for a cultural group.</p>

<p>The Central Banking Jewry is the epitome of greed, and incites more greed by purposely starting wars, dummy. They already got all the money, and now they want all the power too. Starting with taking away your Constitutional Rights, which is all the protection you&#39;ll ever need against Capitalism, if you are so afraid of it, pussy. Also, you are either a New World Order punk, or a lazy dirt-bag fool, who is looking for a welfare check, so go hoist your ass back over to Israel or Guatemala, or wherever your fat stupid lazy garbage ass came from, hand-out wantin whimp.

School is tough; higher education is tough.</p>

<p>But, my friend, your hatred of Jews is actually really embarrassing. I know that your level of empathy is lower than low, but believe me when I say that you don&#39;t know how ridiculous you look. Your idiocy is as patent as your vitriol.</p>

<p>Do you know any other terms besides <em>Central Banking Jewry</em>, or have the several YouTube videos you&#39;ve watched on the subject implanted that term so firmly into your pubescent and pederastic mind, that you don&#39;t have any other terms by which to label your alleged enemy? In one night, I think I have seen CBJ blasted over this sub about five times. Repetition of a false terminology does not make it any more real than the yellow cake which kicked of the second Iraq war.</p>

<p>Your use of &quot;higher vocabulary&quot; doesn&#39;t raise your intelligence, you try to use it as front to hide your retardation behind. Your tactic is to &quot;play the victim&quot; like Jews often do.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the history of the Federal Reserve Bank, that Central Banking is 100% Jew created and owned, jews follow the Talmud and therefore cannot serve the &quot;Goyim&quot;, they should be removed from the US Government, and the Central Banking Jewry must be abolished.</p>

<p>Here, watch this video, and come back:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IJeemTQ7Vk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IJeemTQ7Vk</a></p>

<p>Further, the Central Banking Jewry is the New World Order and runs:
Chemtrails, vaccines, Fluoride, GMO, viruses, false flags, endless wars with terrorists they created, economic crashes, inflation, debt, agenda 21, common core, child prostitution, drug money laundering, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>The Central Banking Jewry / Federal Reserve Bank is a criminal syndicate, a corporation that is running the US into the ground purposely with the above listed evils, because it made up of Jews following the Talmud of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the first year in many years that anyone was &quot;expecting an event on 9/11&quot;.</p>

<p>Why this year?</p>

<p>Not everybody was expecting it on 9/11.  I&#39;m expecting it on 11/9.</p>

<p>You say it&#39;s part of the &quot;Strategy of Tension&quot; and in most years, I&#39;d agree.</p>

<p>But not this year.  This year, we have Neocons crawling out from under their quiet rocks to predict &quot;bigger than 9/11 right around the corner&quot; -- from Cheney to Lindsey Graham to the Saudi King and more.  Why this year are THEY hyping an imminent attack?</p>

<p>Neocons love to predict their own crimes.  They are now predicting their own upcoming crime.  They were not predicting this in 2013, 2012, 2011, etc.</p>

<p>And so, now we have tons of &quot;fearmongers&quot; predicting an attack on 9/11/2014 -- when none of the Neocons have predicted this except one Air Force General.  Is this the basis for the &quot;fearmongering&quot; about 9/11/2014?</p>

<p>Or does a vocal minority maximize the shock &amp; awe when the Great Pumpkin fails to show up on 9/11, then shows up later, after everybody&#39;s declared it to be a dud?</p>

<p>Was the fearmongering about 9/11/2014 part of the psy-op?</p>

<p>What are the psy-op effects when everybody&#39;s expecting the Great Pumpkin to show on Thursday, but he doesn&#39;t show up until weeks later?</p>

<p>You have many good points.  Any other year, I&#39;d agree with you.  Unfortunately, this year bears all the markings of an imminent U.S. Neocon false flag -- one in a series that began with Ukraine &amp; Venezuela Neocon false flags, and continued through the summer with a weeks-long Gaza massacre based on a false flag.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to disbelieve these criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers for the response, but I disagree.</p>

<p><em>Every year</em> it is part of the Strategy of Tension. When has there been a year which has not contained some capitalist/imperialist/globalist atrocity? Every year is <em>the</em> year it goes down. We are in the midst of it.</p>

<p>My contention is to drop the fear. There is no need to fear. Fear, while healthy and natural in regular doses, becomes a complete psychological poison when sustained through the tensive strategy. 11/9 will come and go. Wait and see. Who predicted the date of any previous catastrophe? Besides generalized innuendos, no previous thinker has nailed it.</p>

<p>I would posit that these things happen, irrespective of our claims at knowing the date. They happen on their own time. Granted, they are scripted by major political/state players, but it is up to us to create a society contrary to their wishes. Let us all strive in earnest to create the great collective, participatory, and natural society that we dream of.</p>

<p>It begins with us not acting out of fear; rather, courage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you see the Strategy of Tension as an open-ended psy-op without an endgame.  Whereas I believe we&#39;ve already seen the same people behind the Strategy of Tension repeating their advanced techniques of military coup and extermination of &quot;Leftist&quot; (pro-democracy) leadership (launched as the Phoenix Program, refined and expanded as Operation Condor, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-killings-assassinations-tear-into-iraq-s-educated-class.html">practiced without a name in Iraq 2003-2004</a>).</p>

<p>Your thesis reminds me of the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> version of conflating our skepticism with paranoia.  There&#39;s a difference between vigilance and fear.  You&#39;re conflating the two.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the intent (and extent) of fascism and covert networks is not fear.  It is courage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, friend: you have me mistaken for a facile thinker. I understand the difference between vigilance and fear; can you truly say that the hyperbolic, paranoid posts which cycled through the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> feed prior to September 11th represented detached vigilance and <em>not</em> paranoia? Go back and read them. While some maintained a position of scepticism, many maintained a fearful stance.</p>

<p>I am simply calling out the rhetoric of fear. Individuals who post things such as (and I paraphrase from memory) &quot;I am terrified,&quot;  or &quot;I am truly scared for tomorrow,&quot; and so on, do so out of fear, not the stance of academic scepticism. The stance of paranoia is the very same stance which <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mocks this sub for. And while I loathe <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> generally, in this they are not wrong.</p>

<p>That being said, I conflate nothing. Fear is a fear and scepticism is scepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. However, the New Age texts were rife with doom and gloom, transcendence and eradication; I posit that the event became a sort of rapture, so to speak, for the New Agers, brought up on Christian cultural foundations.</p>

<p>Anyways, we can argue that if you would like, but it was not the point of my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your position that ancient peoples held <em>much</em> more wisdom and intelligence than we credit them with. The prevailing position within academia is that which is linked closely with the discourse of capitalism. The prevailing liquid-modern status quo would not have its dominance challenged by the fact that alleged primitives had figured out a sustainable, long term solution to life on earth.</p>

<p>And your stance is interesting. I have thought about that a lot, but I am just not sure if I buy the coincidence of the dates: why 2012 in specific? Again, this relies upon that actually <em>being</em> the correct date, but regardless, a better date might have been linked with the coming of Europeans to the New World, the onset of industrialism, or many other catalytic periods. 2012 seemed to exist as a mundane perpetuation of the growing, imperial police state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct. The mark of the beast completely described Nero, and was cryptographical code for early Christians.</p>

<p>You make a good point about the Mayans; but why did the Mayans choose the seemingly arbitrary 2012 date, while no other culture corroborates it? I am not certain that it represents any grand spiritual truth beyond it being the end of their long count. Is there a significance of their start date: August 11, 3114 BCE? While I am not disagreeing with you, the anthropologist in me is wont to believe that their calendar system was merely a dating system--happenstance being the only reason for the beginning and end dates; astronomy at best. However, the philosopher in me sees your points, and tends to pontificate a bit too wildly at the possibilities. These things are hard to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, listen up you uneducated troll-fucker: your pace, syntax, and hypercompensating ad homs. say quite a bit about you. I get it: you aren&#39;t completely aware of the complexity of the world, and, rather than actually taking your education beyond the compulsory state education which you barely scraped through, you just &quot;blame it all on the Jews.&quot; I get it, really I do. School is tough; higher education is tough.</p>

<p>But, my friend, your hatred of Jews is actually really embarrassing. I know that your level of empathy is lower than low, but believe me when I say that you don&#39;t know how ridiculous you look. Your idiocy is as patent as your vitriol.</p>

<p>Do you know any other terms besides <em>Central Banking Jewry</em>, or have the several YouTube videos you&#39;ve watched on the subject implanted that term so firmly into your pubescent and pederastic mind, that you don&#39;t have any other terms by which to label your alleged enemy? In one night, I think I have seen CBJ blasted over this sub about five times. Repetition of a false terminology does not make it any more real than the yellow cake which kicked of the second Iraq war.</p>

<p>I am none of the things which you tried to paint me as, but I really don&#39;t feel compelled to defend myself against the likes of you. You see, I am not threatened by you one single bit.</p>
