       I believe the first step in making a change in the world is to focus on creating
       <del>
        unity
       </del>
       a harmonious body. Just as much as we focus on what "TPTB" are doing we need to be creating our own powers, we need to look away from what they have cooked up to distract us with every week and practice looking at what WE want to create. Every time we debate about almost any aspect of the global narrative, the GREAT SPECTACLE, we almost always lose because in the end we still find ourselves divided, arguing endlessly among ourselves about details that can never be proven because the evidence has been destroyed. It's gotten to the point that discussing certain topics actually serves TPTB because they have implanted trigger words that work like a virus to infect and illegitimize any honest argument they wish to protect themselves and their "sheep" from. So, lets not play
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       game any more. Let's create our
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       . LETS become the sorcerers rather than watch passively as the world remains hypnotized. LETS build our own meme machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first stage of this is the simplest, and most powerful. We had a taste of it in OWS, but the second stage of the movement never came into being. I could speculate a number of reasons why that didn't happen but that is irrelevant. It served its purpose, it proved we could still come together. What we need now is to simply figure out how to connect, how to create something of our own and we must do it consistently, amplifying our strength with each iteration until we are as tall as a tidal wave. So that when it is TIME to work together, we will already have a body of people willing to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could simply meet one day a week, on reddit, on a NEW PRIVATE website that WE build... or whatever we wish. But I believe it is time we start thinking outside of their box. It's time we start thinking forward towards a utopia rather than staring at the dystopian future these elitists are trying to implant into the imaginations of the people. It is time to come together and show these people the might of a world united. We MUST figure out how to rebuild our family and imprison those that have spent millienia trying to destroy us.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkMsXcHQYg">
        So come on guys, let's brainstorm.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've built a subreddit that is intended to represent the global vortex of creation at
       <a href="/r/thevortex">
        /r/thevortex
       </a>
       so come help us create a hurricane if you want. It is dark and light, hot and cold, both the utopian dreams of what our future can become, and the nightmares that propel us towards it. This was the place I built to start creating harmony, so lets make it something together, or build something else that better suits the needs of everyone.

       I built a community page on Facebook that you might appreciate. It's called Collectively Conscious (
       <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wearecollectivelyconscious">
        www.facebook.com/wearecollectivelyconscious
       </a>
       ) and has a pretty decent following (112,000 'likes' and 23,000 people 'talking about this'). I schedule 22 posts per day: 6 articles, 10 memes, and 6 questions. With the questions we basically just try to cover all the most important topics within all categories of information (spiritual, psychological, sociological, holistic health, political, economic, societal, environmental, science &amp; tech...etc) and just let people vote on each other's answers, letting the best ones rise to the top, similar to how Reddit works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The website I built myself last winter (
       <a href="http://www.collectivelyconscious.net">
        www.collectivelyconscious.net
       </a>
       ) and it also gets a pretty decent amount of activity. Last month we got around 1.2 million page views, which was the most we've ever gotten before. I use the website to store 7 different post types (articles, questions, videos, documentaries, TED talks, memes, and what I feel is transformative music). I store links to all the questions we ask on Facebook there, each with its own post, and just keep adding links to new iterations of the same questions so people can easily access previous discussions. Every evening I add 4 new articles (aggregated from various independent media websites), the 6 questions I asked on Facebook earlier that day, 3 videos, 3 documentaries, 3 TED talks, 9 memes, and 3 songs. If I don't have any new videos, documentaries, TED talks, or songs to post I just loop the oldest ones back around so it flows continuously no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to our community description:

        www.collectivelyconscious.net/about/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a link to a page which answers the question "what does 'Collectively Conscious' mean?":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://collectivelyconscious.net/what-does-collectively-conscious-mean/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also recently started a subreddit for this community as well:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/collectivelyconscious">
        www.reddit.com/r/collectivelyconscious
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know what you think! I am always open to suggestions. Also, if you're interested I could definitely use some help with building/moderating the Reddit community, coming up with good questions to post, and aggregating transformative multimedia and articles. If you want to participate in our daily discussions all you need to do is "like" the page to receive our posts, manually visit the page, or check the "LATEST QUESTIONS" featured slider on the website to find all the most recently posted questions.

       What we need to do is work on connecting your movement with other movements and focus on creating action. There are PLENTY of people out there that have been exposed to the truth and are plenty pissed off. The world is just waiting for a group to build a movement that will actually get something done... and we are running out of time really, so we need to act as fast as possible.

       We are connected with various other conscious communities like Collective Evolution, Spirit Science, High Existence, The Mind Unleashed, True Activist, Creator Course, Waking Times, and several others. We exchange banners on our websites, share each other's posts (share 4 shares), and even allow each other to comment or post memes (while logged in as the page) on each other's posts to help draw people into our community as well. We also allow each other to republish our original articles, which usually have creative commons 3.0 licenses attached to them anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Facebook pages are playing a much larger role in the consciousness shift than most people realize. Some of these pages have millions of followers and get tens of thousands of shares per post. They spread not only wisdom, but also brilliant ideas and policies which can inspire individuals all around the world to try and make them a reality in their city, state, or country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I focus primarily on asking what I think are the best and most potentially transformative questions because I believe that, ultimately, the revolution begins within the mind. Change the way you think and you can change the world. If we can collectively change the way we think and interact with one another, then we can change anything. All the problems in the world arise due to the way in which we think, which is mostly due to ignorance. Most people are still stuck in the old paradigm of the unenlightened ego (3rd density, if you study the Law of One), which is fueled by self-interest, and have yet to shift to the new paradigm of the enlightened ego (4th density), which is fueled by enlightened self-interest (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest
       </a>
       ). Once the critical mass shifts to 4th density consciousness, the rate of change in the world around you will accelerate exponentially (similar to the Law of Accelerating Returns) until we reach the omega point:

       I like the idea though. I'm all for solutions. Everything on here becomes a waste of time after a certain point. I have a few ideas of my own but I think if you want this to gain traction, don't just rush to the drawing board initially. Keep it simple, focused and build up your numbers first.

       I think when it comes to recognizing the difference between living under corporate oligarchs that have proven time and time again to be indifferent to the needs of the human race and the planet when it effects their profits, any reasonable person will choose another alternative, unless they have an economic gun pointed at their head. Which is the case usually. So sometimes we have to pave a new way before anyone else will begin to walk it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again what we need to do is network humansinc with all the other movements. It's time to just start putting the

       I think we should start using their tactics, as we are all co-creators and they know this. What they do is put out bullshit or lies and then repeat them over and over until everyone "believes". Why not start publishing the same but in our favor like "The Federal Reserve was audited and now owes the American people each 1.5 millions dollars."
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically start a mental movement that is positive for the people but negative for the elite. We really only need to publish the truth but things like this will help shift the global consciousness.

       Of sorts. There is a certain point when you keep going down the rabbit hole where you realize the
       <em>
        real controllers
       </em>
       are not facilitating the abuses of power by whom most people call or think about as TPTB or "elite."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sayin, its an important observation. An to top it off having a dominant systems operative role, for lack of a better term, they probably live under a very different set of "laws" in just their own social structure. Probably under normal circumstances not in or represented in the society at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is important is right now and sometimes what might be soon, any time something "goes down" and you are there, that is where you are when it happened. Just remember to "
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       " when you can in waking life, try because life said fuck you.. An you know fuck that you don't need to be all stressed out cause some collective assbag of beautiful beaten individuals you just happen to be part of is so saturated in bullshit because of other individuals in the assbag that aren't around being awesome at shoveling shit then leaving you with a pile of stuff that isn't shit and teaching you how to shovel shit but expecting you to make a sand castle out of something you have never had to mess with or had in/direct exposure to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR - Like throwing nokia phones near monkeys so they will finish their veggies, the first thing saving you from complete annihilation is their ignorance or their complete understanding of the situation. Either way it helps to stop producing such nefarious weapons for the purpose of being a weapon, but since they are out there and have smooth sides (lookin at you lego) im sure we can figure this out together if we stop throwing them for like 5 min and just try to figure out a way to not throw any more.

       Don't laugh man, I think I gave a low estimate there are many people who have come forward stating that they have no limits on their credit cards and bank accounts. This is pretty much to cover all the taxes, false spending and the cost of needless lives killed over 300 million human lives in the last century alone.

       Who wants to be the first one to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs">
        get up?
       </a>
       What happens if there are no more chairs, what if someone immediately takes yours and never gets up? The only way you can do anything other than whats going on in the chair is to get up, what if you grab another chair but no one else takes the chance to get up to widen the circle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those people live under an illusion and will unknowingly destroy their environment, after all, everyone is out of food and water an the ones who chose to get up and get stuff for everyone are dead or tired as fuck and can't sit down. An the people sitting in their chairs have no idea, you don't either, it was like this when you got there. Is the importance of the situation an illusion or is the situation? What happens if everyone gets up to count/make/replace chairs for those without? You already know what happens if no one or no one else gets up to try and fix the problem, everyone dies.

       Yes as you may have noticed, I'm trying to steer away from anarcho capitalism because I agree with those in the venus project that believe a purely competitive based economy will inevitably lead to the exact same situation we are in now. Tons of division, tons of class warfare, tons of mechanisms of advantage aka control. Anarchy is the natural order of the universe. Or shall it be called "Archy" instead?

       Precisely, I agree wholeheartedly.

       What I think needs to happen first is, NETWORKING. There are sooo many little niche conspiracy, anarchy, sovereignty, spiritual groups... all of which essentially want the same thing, to retain their god given rights and not have to worry about some sort of really fucking creepy 4th Reich government looming over their lives and lying about

       and
       <em>
        transparent

       The problem with democracy though is that every single little thing has to be voted on by every single voting person. That is why America is a republic not a democracy. What we really need is a more transparent government and that can be achieved by getting support for more things the governments does to be publicly available to see.

       Our government isn't inherently bad, it is just the fact they like to keep secrets.

       Yeah but you seem to fail to see the underlying causes that create a government of secrets that exists almost entirely for the benefit of corporations rather than the people or the planet. Democracy isn't the problem,
       <em>
        pure and transparent democracy certainly isn't the problem
       </em>
       , a republic isn't really the problem either... No it's our competitive based economy that is the problem. As long as we live in an economic system that exists under the premise that all things are scarce and that competition is the only way to encourage innovation and creativity, we will always have an ever increasing disparity of wealth, we will always have people trying create an advantage for themselves and disadvantages for others, this leads to insider trading, lobbying, jekyll island meetings, corrupt banking systems, and every other form of deception and control you can think of. That system actually creates a psychology for an
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       nation of people and there isn't much you can do to change it except start completely over and remove the root of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is, if you removed our entire government, picked the greatest, most honest, and truthful men throughout all of history and created the perfect representative government, in time, we would eventually end up exactly where we are now again.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need a government at all, we need a system that serves the needs of the people and the planet, and there will not be any of the problems the government is supposedly protecting us from. Being in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , surely you are aware that the government is notorious for creating the problems it is trying to solve. Al Qaeda and ISIS are great examples of this.

       Not everyone is corruptible. In a fully enlightened society I think just about any type of political system (monarchy, oligarchy, technocracy, republic, direct digital democracy, anarchy...etc) could work. Only some would be more efficient and/or effective than others.

       I disagree. Capitalism is one of the main reasons are country has come so far so fast in only couple hundred years. Yes it means working harder, but you are suggesting burning the whole thing down which only brings anarchy and chaos, the very thing our country is notably absent of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government does create problems put they sure hell make sure those problems don't reach us. Can you imagine if our government was any weaker, you think we would have gone to WW1 or WW2? Or managed to avoid War with Russia in the Cold War? There were many times the very thing you complain about is one of the reasons we can talk about this on the internet today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I can most definitely get behind is transparency, I truly believe if there was more of it, there would be less posts shit talking the government. But beside that I actually like the society we are in, granted there are more financial issues, but that is why people need to be educated on finances early on instead of later.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back on topic, the government is no evil machine, they do what they have always set out to do, try to provide for their people, well intentioned but they don't always get good results. I will say though, corporations do have too much say and lobbying reform along with transparency is my two biggest issues.

       We have never in the history of mankind lived in a society that had the technology to do what I'm saying we do now. We have never lived in a society that has chosen to work together for the common good of humanity and the planet, I assume because either there was never a need, or there was never a belief that it was possible. Now there IS a need and we know it is possible.

       Do you think that just because we weren't part of the 1,000,000 people that died in Iraq that it doesn't matter? We have a huge impact on the economies of the world because our dollar is used to trade oil. We have a private corporation that we can't even audit in control of our money supply creating, literally an infinite amount of debt, that we are supposed to pay back with more money that also has debt attached to it? That's irresponsible and frankly stupid. Technology is going to happen, it is in our nature to solve problems. You'll notice that technology grows around the intentions it is used for... annnnd so you might say war is good! We develop all kinds of amazing technology during times of war! It's great for the economy! and all the other nauseating things we were all told in school, or at least I was. A lot of that technology was by products of weapons and other mechanisms of control. I really don't have an interested in creating technology that might one day destroy the planet personally. I really don't think anyone should. We could still develop technology, just for different reasons and come out with the same results, but
       <em>
        probably better
       </em>
       if we were working with each other rather than against each other.

       Our system will not allow for transparency. We will have to force transparency with people like Assange, Manning, and Snowden, who are obviously all on the run because they are potentially facing death sentences. We need to stop pretending like we are going to turn this ship around, when every year it gets progressively worse. I've watched for half of my life people saying the same things over and over as TPTB turn the water up 1 degree at a time, hoping no one will notice.

       You're right, the government isn't evil, but the psychology it generates seems to be because it is currently streamlining the process of the sixth great extinction and has little concern for the future of our planet or human lives. War is one of the most profitable businesses on the planet. Human lives are just a commodity and a resource to be exploited by financial interests. I bet they even think they are helping to save the world by depopulating the planet.

       I'm not griping, and in fact this post is about trying to change things. Honestly, I'm desperately trying to change things any way that I can, I'm just not trying to change things the way you want, within a system I have concluded is and will always be corrupt. Never in it's history was it not been corrupt to some degree. I don't say this with malice, it played it's role in history, it created a lot of good things we can use, but it's time to grow up and move on. We have bigger and better things to do on this earth and elsewhere in the cosmos and we won't get around to doing it if we are in perpetual war or destroy our environment.

       Well until everything can be transparent, people will always abuse the dark side of the government. It's always going to happen, in a society where people are rewarded for creating advantage over others, people will always create advantages where they think they can get away with it. A dark hole in the government sounds like a nice place to do such a thing. So inevitably it will... and has before. And is flourishing beautifully as we speak.

You DO know this, and that is why it pisses me off to hear such blatant ignorance. These wars are not created by people like you and I, they are created by governments and geopolitical strategies that MUST exist within a scarcity based economy.

       If you know war causes this upsurge in the economy, is your issue with war itself more than the government. By all counts even the war we are supposedly in, does not amount anywhere near actual wars we were in the past, like Vietnam, and Korea. Those were real wars, Iraq and Isis are more like battles than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't change inherently how the world works, war has helped our economy and other nations economy's for hundreds of years. Does not mean I condone war, it just means war is a fact of life, there is no way in hell we can live in world peace, but that is not the fault of our government. It is just the fact humans are inherently flawed that they want war.

       Iraq was a battle, not a war? Are you fucking kidding me? Just because we slaughtered them with out "shock and awe" tactics doesn't mean it wasn't a war and it doesn't mean it wasn't just as fucked up as the previous wars. I'm not sure what you are getting at but I guess you are saying since Iraq was just a battle rather than a war, we didn't get much benefit from it. Well we certainly lost a lot from it! We could have fed the entire world many times over with the amount of money we spent killing innocent men women and children, and instead of breeding hatred around the world we would have had allies across the planet. But fortunately we were fighting terrorists that blew up the world trade center... wait... no that was in afghanistan... wait... no... it was in... where was it again? Oh right we created Al Qaeda. Just like we create all of our adversaries... by blowing people up.

       I find this funny, I thought I was the pessimist and you the optimist? Now it's you saying we can't change anything and me saying oh but all we need to do is stand up and take action! You look at the world and say, "It is just the fact humans are inherently flawed that they want war." and I say, lets look at what creates war and figure out how we can change it. Do you know how often I hear both of these mantras? Do you know where it comes from? Does it have a rational root? Or is it just something people have also repeated to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       OF COURSE WE CAN CHANGE IT. OF COURSE HUMANS AREN'T INHERENTLY FLAWED. That's priest talk. That's government talk. They NEED you to believe that so you will give up your power to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You raise a man in a tribe of head hunters, and you ask him, "Does it bother you that you have a collection of 5 heads on your wall" (or where ever they store them) and he will say, "Yes I am upset because my brother has 20!". It's all about our culture, it's all about the values we are instilled with, it's all about the pressures that society places around us that molds us into who we are. We know this to be true to such a high degree that we know environment actually changes our
       <em>
        genes
       </em>
       . It is called epigenetics. We express certain genes that our bodies think will be advantageous to our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not condone war, but you condone looking away from a real solution and you condone damning the entire human race because you have bought some idea given to you as a child that we are all inherently evil or "flawed" if you want to call it that and those two things will inevitably lead to war and other forms of violence.

       I don't think the world will ever end, but I think we may entrench ourselves so deeply into ignorance that will take a miracle to get us out of it and I'm convinced that we stay here on earth until we transcend. I'm pretty sure an entire universe that we are allowed to create anything we want within as long as we do the work to create it is the only form of heaven that there will ever be and to ask for anything more is not only selfish but ignorant. So there is no getting ourselves out of this unless we take action and make it happen.

       What are the implications of the consciousness of individuals and the world when we are all connected with more information than ever in human history? Do you really think that there will not be a significant change in the way humans think and interact with each other? That there will not be a change in the way people perceive the world and the universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not radical, to recognize that there is something radical unfolding at this point in history. For all we know, the American dollar is going to get dropped as the world's reserve currency, and the dollar will plummet, bit coin will step in and fill the void, and then "the outernet" will be deployed allowing free internet and data transfer worldwide. Liquid democracy, which is an opensource pure democracy platform also exists and could be integrated into the outernet. So much stuff is on the brink of happening right now. This is definitely some sort of new age or aeon that we are moving into.

       Bitcoin is the alpha, altcoins the beta. "Phased out" eventually as collector/history preservation. There are a few other coins that will come out, 2 different forms soonish. I think you will be impressed, there are many benefits of discouraging "real-world money" exchange on the internet including protective awareness of core foundation systems by the peoples.

       The ideas being realized now are for a global scale but cannot be fully understood at this time. The problem is if no one "gets behind it" the problems of today will perform resonance suicide and destruction will follow, the hopes of man crushed. If people do "get behind it" there is a real risk of old world power infrastructure being misused against others, for a little bit at least. Regardless the "change"
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen as this is no different than saying the "change of seasons"
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either understand the phone in your pocket makes you more powerful individually than entire civilizations for a least a very long time or you don't see any reason to actually understand anything. Unfortunately our relations with each other as a group is nowhere near as evolved as our individual relations, this will cause one to turn away from the starving and many to kill. Unfortunately people don't understand enough about the environment they live in to understand civilization has been working to get
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       . What we do from here on out will carry such magnitude that some common minor un/forseen consequences acceptable for thousands of years of social construction will have absolute potential to wipe out everything we ever "gained" in ways we haven't understood for hundreds of years of recorded history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly you either understand the power your phone gives you comes from the collective of individuals, if the collective of individuals on an individual level become "corrupted" so does your "power." Enough deconstructive interference and the social structure facilitating the group will burden and demand to resonate the deconstructive interference.

       You cant partisipate in a system that doesnt belong to you, it was created by people in power. If you contribute to it. it just serves itself. Dark mirrors is right, we need a new model of society or we will be right back where we started. We are for the most part a byproduct of our enviornment.

       We have the power to change things, but from our own foundations, not foundations that were created by people who serve themselves.

       We don't have no kind of power to change government structures. That would require changing the Constitution itself. Stop trying to limo every single person in government together. That is detrimental to your cause which I have no clue what it may exactly be.

       Yeah im gonna have to disagree with that. Centralize power allways corrupts, Government is in essence a centralized power structure where decisions trickel down and very few decisions trickle up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a horizontal structure of soceity modeled off of structures that actually work for everyone, not just the few. The research I have done in Artificial Inteliigence suggests that intelligent decisions emerge when groups of agents work togeather without a central authority. For that to happen you have to throw ideas at the group mind and let a nartual feedback loop happen between all the agents. Leaders could be part of the process that put the decisions into action.
Take a look at this website and it talks about how this process works:

       If you paid attention in school rhea war the point, when the government was created. And you forget there are 3 branches of government. It is no more centralized than State governments which have the same exact structure. Your idea wouldn't work at all for this country.

       In practice, thats not how its working. Congress is being controlled by a select group of people for the most part. Why do you think we are attacking Syria?  Its has nothing to do with the people, and everything to do with power structures in government creating havok around the world for financial or selfish gain. You can tell it doesn't work for the people by the kind of decisions that are being made.

       We live in a system that promotes scarcity and competition, so obviously any form of democracy cannot exist within that system because someone will hack the system to gain advantage, which is what the system demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have to create the frame work for a pure democracy to exist. That framework I believe is a resource based economy, where all of society works together to tackle each of mankind's problems one by one until all of our needs are automated by machines, freeing mankind to focus more on "transcendence" in both the physical and spiritual realms.

       Different regions will be inhabited in different ways. The authoritative transcendence you seek is within and plays the subtle role. The groups physicality manifestations of these frameworks need to be more focused on "transition." There are now many paths available which can be reasonably palatable but not really that great until the transition state is observed by the people.

       A giant portion of our
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       in the "public sphere" of government are not even problems the government should be having to worry about. Not dealing with 50 drunk driving cases (in any form) a week takes a lot of stress off time that could be better used applying group
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       in other areas. The answer isn't to "remove" drunk drivers or "drunk driver potentials" but to analyze the structure of your environments infrastructure and plan/enact changes that enhance all spectrum of a social structures environmental factors,
       <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/27/uber-lyft-explainer/">
        or something.

       There are people who work hard on that stuff as a hobby but never take it past that because in our current environment you can't, kind of like how we use works of the past that were not appreciated then.

       I have been working on the
       <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">
        Commonwealths Proposal
       </a>
       some of you might have heard of, im interested in making the world a better place with people that are P.A.S.T (Partisipitory, Accountable, Skillfull, and Trustworthy)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commonwealths Society is a project that is currently in a proposal stage. The idea is to use web technology to act as the framework for a horizontal, decentralized participation network of individuals working toward the common good for all its members within their own Commonwealth and other Commonwealths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can contribute ideas and proposals to the continued operation of the Society based on a transparent Submission/Answer web based system that tracks whether the idea or person has P.A.S.T (participation, accountability, skillfulness, and trustworthiness.) Ideas and Proposals get voted up and down based on its P.A.S.T and the persons P.A.S.T. This allows people who have good intentions to develop a good reputation and people who have bad intentions to develop a bad reputation. People with motives that don't support the community develop a P.A.S.T that prevents them from contributing at all. For security, the goal is to use social networking verification and time based history building within the system.

       A long time I thought about ways to "fix" how fucked up stuff had gotten.  I did this for almost a decade, until about 2011.  I know now it is futile.  The system will implode or it won't; we have no relevance.

       Both my mother and my best friends have chosen to live in nearly self sustainable and very isolated properties.  Right now, when it's "lead, follow or get out of the way", the last option is probably the best.

       I hate to sound fatalistic, but I started distrusting corporations in '96 and the government a few months after 9/11.  I devoted far more time to understanding this societal infection than I did to college or work.  I stopped a couple years ago.  I need to make what life for myself I still can.  We lost the fight a long time ago and the masses of idiots cheering at rallies for one of our two predetermined overlords are evidence of that.

       Well of course the system is going to collapse. I believe it is inevitable at this point. What we CAN do is, as Charles Eisenstein puts it, "raise the bottom that we're inevitably going to hit," so it's not as bad of a fall as it would be if we did nothing. Yes, this could potentially end in the total destruction of all complex life on Earth due to an all-out global thermonuclear war and nuclear winter, but it doesn't have to. The future is unwritten and we can change it if we wake up in time and realize our power to create the world we want to live in.

       I'm not at all sure there will be a sudden collapse at all.  We've had 40 years of increasing serfdom, and each cycle of destruction/return to serfdom for nearly a millennium has been less destructive to the most elite.  Who says with massively enhanced technology (pretty much all of which we know about), they won't stop another collapse and thus secure their positions as essentially another caste of humans with us as their serfs, distracted by virtual reality internet cybersex video hypnotism crap?

       That is exactly what is more likely to happen. A collapse will never occur, they will lose all of their power if they allow it.

       They might not be able to stop it. The free market (what's left of it) is a powerful thing and will likely re-correct itself at some point.

       We need to wake up now and they won't fully collapse the system I don't think. If it collapses completely then obviously we will reform and create something that will not allow them to harvest our creativity and energy. I think they will let us spiral into a hell that will by all appearances seem like our own creation. We must spin a vortex of our own creation that isn't infected by their deception.

       I've been right there with you, I have found a place of light and hope against all odds... I have found a sanctuary within myself, within the cosmos, within the universe, and our universal soul. I watched the system eat my father up, chew him up and spit him out like he was nothing but a human resource. Oil or gas to be burned alive just to see profits rise for some greedy, ignorant, "job creators". lmao

       How ironic. To live in an age when we could eliminate most of these worthless jobs and spend our time designing our utopia but instead we choose to find an excuse to work in order to fit a system that doesn't serve the people or the planet any longer.
