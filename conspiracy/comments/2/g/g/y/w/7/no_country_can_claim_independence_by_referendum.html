    <div class="md"><p><strong>Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>Czechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. In 1917, a meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the future Czechoslovak president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and other Czech and Slovak representatives signed the Pittsburgh Agreement which promised a common state consisting of two equal nations, Slovakia and Czechia.   </p>

<p><strong>Separation:</strong>    </p>

<p>By 1991, the Czech Republic&#39;s GDP per capita was some 20% higher than Slovakia&#39;s, but its long-run GDP growth was lower.</p>

<p>Many Czechs and Slovaks desired the continued existence of a federal Czechoslovakia. Some major Slovak parties, however, advocated a looser form of co-existence and the Slovak National Party complete independence and sovereignty.   </p>

<p>In 1992, the Czech Republic elected Václav Klaus and others who demanded either an even tighter federation (&quot;viable federation&quot;) or two independent states.   </p>

<p>The separation occurred without violence, and was thus said to be &quot;velvet&quot;, much like the &quot;Velvet revolution&quot; which preceded it, which was accomplished through massive peaceful demonstrations and actions. In contrast, other post-communist break-ups (such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia) involved violent conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons for the division:</strong>  </p>

<p>The people who argue inevitability point to the stereotypes between the two nations, problems with the shared state during communism, the success of the communist state in Czech lands and its failure in the Slovak lands which still resulted in the adoption of communism, because the Czechs had a bigger say in the running of the state than Slovaks, and the 1968 constitution that had a minority veto.[5] There were other more subtle differences, such as religion; most Czechs are atheist and/or irreligious, whereas most Slovaks are Catholics.</p>

<p>The people who argue events between 1989 and 1992 point to international factors such as the breakaway of the Soviet satellite nations, the lack of unified media between the Czech and Slovak republic, and most importantly the actions of the political leaders of the two nations.[6]  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Where does it say &quot;the people&quot; had anything to do with this?<br/>
Besides... there is instability with any country that young.</p>

<p>Norway declared independence after holding a referendum. No  conflict involved.</p>

<p>Malta declared independence after referendum. No conflict</p>

There are quite a few other examples too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;. After some months of tension and fear of war between the two neighbouring nations, negotiations between the two governments led to Norway&#39;s recognition by Sweden as an independent constitutional monarchy on 26 October 1905.&quot;  </p>

<p>As to Malta, yes, that&#39;s an odd case where anything I find about its independence came from a referendum.  </p>

<p>But you must understand that referendums only work when the political pressures are behind them.  </p>

<p>Most of them actually fail: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_referendum</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice quote. I think all of  us remember the &quot;great conflict&quot; of 1905....</p>

<p>I do understand that referendums only work when there is political pressure, I never said otherwise. It is a political method of seperation.</p>

<p>You make bold claims without any evidence; Eg No country can claim independence by referendum.
And you claim that no country has ever done it without great conflict. 
Both these claims are wrong , just look up the situations that I posted.</p>

<p>That they fail doesnt matter, I never claimed that they are successfull...
Im claiming that it has happend, and that it can happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of Britain&#39;s former colonies experienced a peaceful transition to independence. A conflict is not a necessary condition.</p>

<p>Anyway, Scotland is already about as independent as it is possible to be without being a sovereign state (it has its own government, parliament, legal system, education system, police, banknotes, national sports teams etc etc). The transition to full independence is a relatively small step.</p>
