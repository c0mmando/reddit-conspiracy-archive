       --(Just now noticed the typo in the title. Lol. Oh well.)--
      </p>
      <p>
       The usual answer is "thousands of eye witnesses saw the planes, duh!!!" After which any comment or post suggesting the eyewitnesses are a combination of paid liars (harley guy, various TV producer "witnesses") and honestly mistaken lay persons (all other passenger-plane-remembering witnesses) is downvoted into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, what is viewed in the footage from the major networks and
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       amateur footage are physical impossibilities. I know this will sound melodramatic, but I promise anyone reading this right now that the "28 pages" are a limited hangout to keep us from fully "waking up" to this impossible to ignore conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 main red flags from every piece of footage:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The alleged 767s
       <em>
        perfectly
       </em>
       penetrate/glide into the buildings,
       <em>
        without decelerating,
       </em>
       and only after entering completely do they explode. This is not possible! Some part(s) of the plane would
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       be seen, in effect, bouncing off/crumpling up against parts of the building that remained somewhat in tact, parts such as the tips of the wings, the central aspect of the fuselage which lacks material density, and perhaps the tail section. Even if it were a minute quantity of material, we would be able to see
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       from the plane being, in effect, rejected by the steel framework. Yet, we do not.  Some people seem to think the speed would be enough to make these relatively flimsy plane-body components penetrate the building in the exact same way as, say, the extremely dense and robust engine, without evident deceleration. The physical reality, though, is that the increased velocity would simply make the flimsy portions be rejected with a greater amount of violent force! But lets talk about the velocity...
      </p>
      <p>
       2)The planes were supposed to have been traveling at nearly twice what the maximum operational speed for 767s would be at that altitude. At such a velocity and altitude, the planes would be shaking violently, likely nosediving and breaking apart before even striking the ground or anything solid, due to extreme air density. Yet the network
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       "amateur" videos show airplanes gliding in a straight line, with no apparent turbulence effecting the body of the vessel. In our physical world,this can not be. Just as the plane alleged to have struck the pentagon could not have assumed a position parallel to the ground just before striking, and just as flight 93 could not have disappeared into the ground of that field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once all that is impossible, such as the aforementioned physical anomalies, are eliminated, we quite simply can
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that no 767s struck the towers. So...what of the videos? All widely disseminated videos were doctored with CGI. Whatever struck the towers (§-IF anything even did strike them...see edit below-§) was able to penetrate them with no visible deceleration or bodily components being "rejected" and applying logical reasoning to this we can settle upon a missile (§-or nothing at all, again refer to edit below-§). Perhaps the same type used to strike the pentagon (and maybe what struck the field in Shanksville). A plane image was then overlayed on the image of the missiles (§-or empty space-§). The inserted planes were made to look as if they penetrated completely, in order to justify the collapse. All of this correctly assumed the majority of the public was deficient enough in physics knowledge/intuition that largely this nonsense scenario would go unquestioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to the eyewitnesses, the honest laypeople that is, the frequently studied "unreliability of memory" was exploited by way of the doctored footage. In other words, people misremembered and believed they saw planes,
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       that is what they were told they saw by entities (gov't, CBS, etc...) whom at the time they did not believe would lie to the citizens. But, as we know, they did lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the time has come to admit the full extent of that lie. Anything else is at best a half-measure, and at worst a whole new decades-long realm of deception. The 28 pages are a sophisticated sleight of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this: physics (audio analysis, bullet path analysis, analysis of the movement of JFKs body after being struck) is what led to the obvious falsity of the lone-shooter jfk story, and the same physics is what leads to the obvious falsity of the passenger plane 9/11 story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the infiltration of this subreddit by unsavory, dishonest characters will have made this a waste of time. I truly hope that is not the case. Thank you for reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       §§ EDIT: I am seriously considering now, rather than missiles, the absence of anything having struck the towers, as a result of considering the series of vids titled
       <em>
        "911: The Great American Psy-Opera,"
       </em>
       which user reddit2255 linked to in the comments below. Of course this would mean that layperson "witnesses" are stating they saw a flying object, when all there ever was were explosions. While this may seem unlikely, perhaps even impossible, it is not without precedent in the research on the phenomenon of unreliable memory and planted memories/post traumatic insertion of false memories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end though, to reiterate, it is absolutely the case that the videos of the planes are fake and that in no way can it be true that 767s struck the twin towers. The evidence is physics. To those who say this could deflect people away from the truth movement...well...I think it's about time we stop beating around the bush. Those people will eventually come around. §§

       I agree that what the videos purport to show of the Twin Tower impacts is scientifically implausible. Even if the body of an aluminium 767 could penetrate the solid steel and concrete superstructure of the WTC towers, large parts of the wings would be lopped off and fall to the ground.

       the wing of the plane is technically weaker than the structure in question.. therefore they would break away upon impact, unlike the suggested plane fuselage which due to weight would continue forward.. although my thought process assumes that the plane fuselage would break apart upon impact anyway..

       Even if the wings were attached to the fuselage with duct tape and good wishes, the wings are still moving forward and will continue to do so until their velocity is depleted by the impact - At which point the wings were inside the building and likely appear unrecognizable amidst all the carnage.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no point could the wings cease their forward motion the moment the fuselage impacts the building and just drop to the ground.

       Not the entire wing .. I presumed small and large debris would plummet to the ground having their force and velocity halted by the structure.

       If  the planes were travelling slow, then yes, the front of the wings may absorb the impact, terminating forward motion for the rest of the wing and falling to the ground.

      <p>
       However the wings weren't going slow.

       It taught me about structural integrity of buildings. Where's your major? Stop being so condescending and discuss rather than looking for flaws in an open ended argument. Write me up a mathematical equation based on the physics and scan it through. Otherwise your opinion is as valid as my own.

       Lol right. I'm waiting for your argument rather than pointing out flaws. Show me the velocity chart of a Boeing carrier jet according to speed and force and you might swing the reader. As for now you still haven't answersd the question as to why the wings wouldn't be affected by the structure of a highrise, as if the velocity of the plane is the only physics in play. Please argue a point as my finger tapping is becoming increasingly strenuous

      <p>
       If a bird can do that to a small plane, it suggests that a bigger, tougher wing going faster would also crumple upon impact with a harder object.

       However at no point will the wing just snap off and fall to the ground, somehow losing its forward velocity.

       Fast objects hitting hard things don't just snap off and fall. They become rendered unrecognizable.

       You seem to be suggesting however that a 'weak' plane shouldn't be capable of doing any damage to a hard building. Keep in mind that with sufficient force even water can cut steel.

       Water is extremely dense! Very poor analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Just looked it up, the stream of water in a jet cutter moves over 2 times the speed of sound, or around approx. 1800 mph, , combine that with the area of applied force and the pressure is immense. Hopefully this alone makes it clear why speaking of water based cutting in the context of this discussion is basically nonsensical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I made a minor mistake when attempting to hastily respond to this during a work break on my phone. What I was referring to was pressure, (which is, if you will "density of applied force") not density of water vs aluminum. Rather, the concentration of applied force (pressure) of specifically an aluminum
       <em>
        airplane
       </em>
       vs that of water in a
       <em>
        jet cutter stream
       </em>
       , all other factors equal. Because the stream of water in a water jet cutter, which is what I presume rockran is referring to, is immensely pressurized, the water comparison is a poor analogy, as the force of an airplane is distributed over a relatively wide area, and thus, overall, applies much lower pressure than does a water jet cutter. Also, the water jet in such a cutter is moving
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       faster than the plane was supposed to have been traveling. This is where pressure comes from, force divided by area: the greater the
       <em>
        distribution
       </em>
       of an entity's applied force, all other things equal, the smaller the pressure. Or conversely, the lower an entity's
       <em>
        overall
       </em>
       mass, all other things equal, the lower the pressure at a given constant speed/area of force applied
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, in the case of 911 the wide-area of distribution of the planes applied force relative to the concentrated force application of the buildings steel framework means the pressure exerted by the buildings, which is in the reverse direction of the planes vector of travel, concludes with the plane going kabluey, not the section of the building which it struck. The poor water jet analogy, despite not being a good analogy, nevertheless can further illuminate the absurdity of the idea that the plane would simply "glide in."
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically: Try again, or concede that you're grasping.

       Refer to the above edited reply. I was referring to the pressure (ie density of
       <em>
        applied force
       </em>
       ) of the plane vs that of a water jet cutter, which is the only real example in nature where water cuts steel.

       Why do you not think 43 angles could be produced? That doesn't strike me as a large number if we are talking careful preplanning. Sorry, but this doesn't debunk physics, my friend.

       Most likely because it was filled with trolls, blind patriotism, hate speech, pro militant islamic rhetoric, advertisements, and other things of the sort common on any 9/11 video posted to YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanksille and the Pentagon are a little shady. But when hundreds of amateur videos in varying degrees of quality all show the exact same images you can't claim that all of them are doctored without empirical evidence to back your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean that the planes weren't possibly being controlled remotely. Or that elements of our government weren't complicit in the attacks. Both of those scenarios are likely and have some evidence supporting them. I just personally don't like to see people actively seeking truth in the wrong direction. Your rhetoric is more along the lines of the controlled opposition which wants to paint truth seekers as wild theorists giving canon fodder to those that wish to discredit us.

       You are free to believe and think as you will though. No one can tell you how to live your life or which information you choose to pursue. Especially in this subreddit. Have an upvote for visibility so others can have the opportunity to chime in as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       [EDIT: In regards to the 28 redacted pages. If and when they are released, they will most likely show that both Israel and Saudi Arabia had foreknowledge of the attacks, with held that information from us, and/or had involvement with training and funding the "hijackers". If that information ever surfaces the world will view what happened that day in a completely different light and open up more inquiries into other cover-ups revolving around the events that happened that day. Which is the last thing the real criminals who are responsible want to happen.]

       Look, feel free to think my rhetoric sounds like controlled opposition, I really don't care. You seem content with begging the question and posting a video, without attempting to address the foundational issue...the physics. Seriously...the majority of the angles on that video were from a huge distance, many of which conveniently zoom in right after the collision. If you cannot see how this could have been set up then I cannot help you. If the plane was a drone/remote controlled, thats the definition of a guided missile, essentially. If so it was an unoccupied plane made of military grade strong/reinforced materials, not an aluminum plane carrying passengers. It is sad when being on the side of immutable scientific laws makes one's rhetoric, "sound like controlled opposition." Also sadly, it doesn't surprise me anymore.

       PS: It's never a good idea to start a debate with Ad Hominem. Trying to persuade a demographic to your point of view by attacking their character is the quickest way to alienate an audience and open your ideas to dismissal. Instead try showing sources to the information you are presenting and avoid fallacies of logic if possible. Might help you get your message across a little better. I'm not here to argue with you. Just thought evidence to contradict your initial statements might be useful to yourself and others viewing this thread.

       Your condescension is pointless. My source is basic physics. I don't see where I started with an ad hominem, therefore I must conclude that you are a bit too sensitive. Besides, I make no formal flaws in logic, so the argument is sound. You just can't wrap your head around whats really going on here, apparently. Godspeed, doc.

       I don't believe it was a missile with giant wings. I don't not believe that a plane flew into the building. Frankly I don't know what to believe. I am trying to the physics aspect of the situation. From a engineering standpoint regardless of the size of the plane.. The building would not collapse. A missile could probably do such damage however it wouldn't show the same signs (aka falling within it's footprint). I'm not here to say it did or didn't happen. I'm simply asking for evidence, and ps... Pictures and videos are not evidence.. Unfortunately it seems the evidence of any 'plane' or 'missile' was cleaned up in record time. An illegal clearing of evidence in a criminal investigation.

       You've seen movies before I presume. News flash. Movies aren't real they are made in studios. I also assume you've looked at a magazine in your lifetime. News flash the pictures aren't real they are photoshopped and edited. What's real is what you see in the flesh in real time in the physical body you exist in. Even then it can be fake. Open your mind

       That's completely illogical. So because photoshopped pictures in magazines exist, non-shopped pictures don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no eye witnesses who said there were no planes. All the video and photo evidence supports the planes. You need to have a strong argument to dispute that and none of you downvoting no-planets have provided any evidence to the support your theory. Of course you're "just asking questions" though....

       It's very logical. Your argument is that evidence of the attack was caught on camera and in photos. I showed you that said documentation can very easily be faked. Not that IT IS. that it CAN BE. I am neither arguing the point of the planes existence or non existence. The discussion topic if your read your reply to the initial comment was that 'the plane fuselage and wings would either go through the building or not and as a result would/nt leave a plane shaped hole in the structure and would/nt as a result send debris to the ground'. You say that something hitting a large amount of structural force at such a speed would break through that structural force with ease.  Granted in theory you are correct at super sonic speeds the force of a propelled object would break through the structure. however. I emplore you to throw a tennis ball at a wall. Chances are unless you have one heck of an arm is that it bounces back at you. The same logic can be applied to a plane hitting a sky scraper. Due to the force applied on both ends of the impact, logic shows that the plane would at least slow, be halted or even reverse the impact and as a result send debris out of the building. Let me be clear. No one is arguing that there is footage and pictures of a winged flying object hitting the building. The point is that either way, the building would not collapse if the plane would fly into it.. You argue that upon impact the high velocity object (plane) would continue through the first set of structural beams (which again is logically and structurally impossible) and stop before exiting the other side of the building without propelling any debris out of the building. No tail wing, no engine, nothing.. Please help me understand your point of view if this is not correct. Ps who gives a flying fuck (no pun intended) about down or up votes.

       Mhmm. So, id like to remain respectful, and tell you that in my opinion, your understanding of physics (particularily in balistics and aeronautics and filmkgraphy) is flawed. You are obviously free to believe what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im all for the skeptism of the official narrative. All for it. But in this case, the evidence overwhelming supports the notion that planes, not missles with CGI effects, hit the two towers. I did not find you analysis to be condusive to logical application of physics. I did not find you analysis to be convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you are free to believe what you want, and i will respect that. I just disagree with this claim of yours, 100%.

       There is no high speed, high definition footage of the twin tower hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how are you able to make claims that would rely upon such footage? Such as the way the plane crumples, plane shakings/vibrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shooting at 30fps you've got only a few frames between the plane making impact and disappearing inside the building.

       I've never seen a plane crumple hitting the second tower. All they do is melt into the building and then a second or so after the building explodes. If you have a link to footage showing crumpling, that would be great.

       Right.

      <p>
       Think of a can being fisted into a solid wall. Then think of a can being fisted into sand.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both crumple, but it's not the same kind of crumple. The can will actually enter the sand whilst it deforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP seems to think that we should be able to see the plane crumpling as it collides with and enters the building, whereas i'm claiming that you'd need a HD/highFPS camera to be able to see that, so i'm bringing into question how OP can even make that point when the cameras weren't good enough to be able to spot anything like that.

       Lol, you're just going around making ignorant claims, I have the whole thread a read, and only upon this comment do I realize you don't have a clue about anything you're saying. 30fps can barely capture a moving person without motion blur.. You need hundreds or thousands of fps to be able to see details. 
Cgi wasn't even that good in 2001, the planes may have been rigged, perhaps, the buildings were rigged, most likely, but this extreme point of view does nothing but hurt the opposition, because when you go and say shit like this, people who are not awake yet will be scared away and think the theory as a whole is flawed, but the theory that 9-11 didn't take place without prior knowledge by a few is very solid, many of the things happening prior to and after the event point to that.. 
This is kind of like instead of saying I believe there's alien life out in the universe you say.. It's here, they are shape shifting lizards, and the queen is one of them... You'll have much better luck with people if you don't go to the extreme.. But anyway, you are free to believe what you want.

       Uh...dude, it's not about blur, literally no plane material can be seen falling off the surface of the building. Blurry or not, this should and would be evident on the video. Also, knowing the frame rate would allow one to calculate deceleration, and there is none evident, even taking "blur" into account. You are brushing this off
