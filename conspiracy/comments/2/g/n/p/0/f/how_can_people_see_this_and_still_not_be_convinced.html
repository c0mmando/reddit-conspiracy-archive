       In this Miley Cyrus video, there are all kinds of clues that hint to MK-Ultra mind control and new world order and satanic alleigiance. However, people still wish to say that a dark Illuminati force doesn't control Hollywood. How can you say that after seeing this:

       It's all over the place now. Seems like a campaign to desensitize the public to the whole concept and make it trendy. Guess it's working.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people blind themselves to evidence because they irrationally ask why this would be happening and how it would happen before they actually consider the evidence itself.

       On one level or another this is meaningful. However I agree with most peoples assessment that it's mostly just fame whoring.

       "Everyone thinks I'm an illuminati slave. I know! I'll pretend like I'm an illuminati slave."

       At least previous artists tried to encode it. This is just lazy.

       You may be right about the "whoring" aspect. Have you seen the over the top Keisha video? The song sounds light and "bubble gum pop" sounding, but the imagery in the video is clearly pandering to this same whoring or they both are MK ultra/ Illuminati sex kitten puppets.

       Maybe she likes conspiracy stuff, too? She is an artist, so its not farfetched to think she is just applying her interests in media. The illuminati doesnt necessarily have to control hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility is thst she is privy to the consliracy theories surrounding them. I feel like this could explain what your asking about.

      <p>
       She doesn't have any power to make those kinds of decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't write her music, producer her music, perform more than 10% of the music ( she sings and maybe plays guitar, that's hardly 10% of the whole instrumentation of a song which includes bass, drums, keys, and she doesn't perform any of that ), doesn't decide what goes into the music videos they use her in, none of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the credits for her first album in 2006:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Creative Director [Creative Direction] – Steve Gerdes
Design [Album Design] – Add To The Noise
Mastered By – Eddy Schreyer
Other [Executive In Charge Of Music For Disney Channel] – Steven Vincent
Other [Executive In Charge Of Music For Walt Disney Records] – Dani Markman
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Those are the album credits, for each individual track, she is neither the producer nor writer on a single track.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the first album they produced using her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Hannah-Montana-Miley-Cyrus-Hannah-Montana-2-Meet-Miley/release/2087776">
        second album
       </a>
       and it lists almost every person on every track, and oh my guess what? Her name isn't on a single damn credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       She didn't play keys, drums, bass, or guitar on any song. So she played no instruments, did no mixing, no writing, and no production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the album called
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Hannah-Montana-Hannah-Montana-3/release/2005464">
        hannah montana 3
       </a>
       and again she's done nothing for it besides sing and dance on the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a Hannah Montana album from 2009 and
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Hannah-Montana-Hannah-Montana-Forever/release/4325588">
        yet again she did nothing on it
       </a>
       she only sings and dances in front of the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Miley-Cyrus-Breakout/release/2895269">
        an album with miley cyrus
       </a>
       where she is actually on the credits on 8 songs out of 12 as a writer, never the first writer though always the second, third, or fourth writer credited, so she's never the lead writer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we go, finally in 2010, another
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Miley-Cyrus-Cant-Be-Tamed/release/2283861">
        album
       </a>
       where she's actually credited as a song writer.
      </p>
      <p>
       She didn't do anything on
       <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Miley-Cyrus-Party-In-The-USA/release/1985188">
        party in the USA
       </a>
       besides sing and dance in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miley Cyrus is not an artist, she is an industry produced icon, a good singing voice and healthy body with what some may consider attractive features.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that SHE is putting Illuminati stuff in her music videos, you're an idiot, she has no say over any of that, you can see who does have that power though in the credits for the music video.

       Wow. What arrogance you got there, man. Im gonna ignore your weird obsession with her, and only say that i appreciate the depth that you went into, and the effort invested in supporting your case. You make some good points in support of your claim, but, unfortunately your arrogance hinders productivity.

       With that said, i dont wish to feed arrogance. You are free to believe whatever you want, but if you dont abandon that arrogant position, i will not pursue further discourse with you.

       Yea, i can see that. I tried being diplomatic and pointing out that he made good pointz that i was unaware of. I keep an open mind, but i dont feed arrogance, despite whether or not they might be accurate, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer his original question, my response was to highlight the mindset of those who he is talking about. I was trying to offer a reasonable explanation as to why some folks dont believe what he does.

       Arrogance is just annoying these days. We're all in the same boat, nobody is better than anyone. So yeah, feeding arrogance is ignorance. It's good to stay away from that, he had good points but chose an arrogant approach.. ruined a good comment lol

       to offer the benefit of the doubt in most cases, though. As to the ignorance i was referring to, i meant about my knowledge in regards to mileys roll in her music and stuff. But also feel that feeding arrogance is a sign of ignorance as well.

       I even apologized to him in another comment, to try and take the edge off maybe. As you said, he made good points.

       I never ever respond to that user anymore.  Everything good and intelligent they say has to be laced with venom, anger, and insults.  As you saw, they clearly did their research, but its angry and assumes and even states that you must have been an idiot for not knowing what they know.  that user is pretty much always like that.

       I have no obsession with her whatsoever, the topic is about Miley Cyrus, and you alleged that she is an authentic artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thus felt it necessary to post definitive proof of how little of an "artist" she actually is, just because a person can sing and dance doesn't mean they're creative, as if she were actually creative, she would be the first name credited as song writer on all of her songs, but she isn't, because she apparently isn't creative enough to do so, only creative enough to be a co-writer with one to three other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't illustrate how little she actually does in her music without listing the full credits for it. There's no obsession here whatsoever, merely presenting a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only "abandon" the "arrogance" of my view if you can present actual credibility to substantiate your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       What proof is there that she even has the power to make such decisions as to what goes into her music videos? That literally isn't her job, that's the creative directors' job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please do show how there's any logic behind the claim that she purposely puts these symbols in the music videos she is in herself.

       Well, maybe i wasnt clear, but i was answering your original question. My response was meant to explain why maybe people arent convinced. Ignorance truely plays a part in belief or non-belief. What i originally wrote was to portray whst they might be thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittingly, i was ignorant of her roll in "her" music, too. That is why i said i appreciated the depth that you went in to. So now, to answer your original question, i can submit to you another answer that involves ignorance of such things. Also, a lot of folks are probably apathetic towards her in general, not really giving a shit about what she does. They might just write her off as another lady gaga type person. They might never care enough to look into the things that you pointed out. Maybe its all of the above?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will apologize for my "weird obsession" comment. But, understand that i viewed it odd that you seem so passionate about this specifically, and took your prompt reply full of sources and (what i would call) pretty specific knowledge about her roll as support for that presumption. I will also apologize for not giving you the benefit of the doubt, as most folks dont come up with thst many sources so quickly unless they are, to some extent, obsessed with the subject matter. I didnt concern myself with the possibility thst you just might be good at finding the informstion your want quickly and efficiently. For these reasons, im sorry. (The arrogance didnt help, though. Just sayin.)
