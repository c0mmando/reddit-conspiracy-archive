<p>I thought it would be nice to discuss some of these sites with you guys. I believe that human civilization has been around a loooong time ago, and that these ancient sites i will list below are the remnants (directly and indirectly) of their existence. The knowledge they held survived, and passed down along generations by myths and legends, and this forms the basis of modern religions. </p>

<p>I posit that there is a conspiracy to keep this knowledge from becoming widely known. Wars are often fought for control of artefacts and knowledge. Book burnings and library sacking is about erasing history in order to control the future. </p>

<p>In the end, i posit, the idea is to control the knowledge of history, in order to persuade the present civilizations to reach a predetermined future rife with oppression and tyranny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a some decent evidence that that is the case. You also have to remember that humans like to gather in coastal areas because of access to the water. It just stands to reason that since the water levels change around the world there are many sites of ancient civilizations that are under water so we will most likely never find any of their artifacts.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the fact that almost every single culture&#39;s lore involves global catastrophes. It&#39;s gotta come from somewhere.</p>

<p>I actually included one of those in my list! These are some of the most intrigun</p>

<p>, imo. I didnt include bimini, or others. But the one i did inckude was the one off of japan.</p>

<p>I feel like the pattern fits to conclude thst soon enough we will find atlantis. Yep. I said it lol. </p>

<p>Also, there are many articles recently about cities and structures many hundreds even thousands of ft below the surface of the seas... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the amount of resources and tech it takes to investigate underwater ruins like that is the biggest thing holding us back. Even if you had the tech, who&#39;s going to pay for it? It&#39;s not like the discovery is going to pay for the cost of the actual research so you have to find someone with the money to afford it and the passion to pay for it.</p>

Those underwater structures near bosnia (i think), are thought to contain a doorway. Itll be hard as shit to get in there, given these circumstances.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, in an absolute cyclical sense, i dont really subscribe to the idea. But, i certainly feel that catastrophes occured, wiping out much of what was established at the time. </p>

<p>[IIRC] For instance, the mayans refered to five ages, four of which wiped out by global catastrophes. We are now in the fifth, i think. Or tue fourth. I forget exactly, but the mayans did indicate such previous &quot;deconstructions.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, there is a ton of evidence that around the end of the last ice age there was a huge flood. This is noted in the bible, as well as <em>thousands</em> of other religions/cultural myths. The evidence suggests this occured right around 11,800BCE, with some estimates pointing to a little later, around 9,800 BCE, i think. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, this is also when the egyptian pyramids were supposedly built, seeing the erosion on the sphynx pointing to a wetter climate (in the region, the last time the climate produced enough rain to cause said erosion was right around those two dates i stated above). Also, this is when it is suggested Gobekli Tepe was constructed. Many of these sites can he argued to be much older than what is currently accepted. </p>

<p>So, yes and no. I dont believe that we will necessarily follow the same pattern, but i do believe the past has seen human civilization constructed several times, only to be almost wiped out completely.</p>

<p>I recall watching that show called &quot;after people# or whstever it was called. In roughly ten thousand yrs, there would be almost zero trace thst modern civilzation ever existed, according to thst show. The only remains would be whst was built in stones, particularily the megalithic structures and free standing stone circles. Also, whatever was built under the ground (i forgot to include thst one huge underground city, you know which one im talking about?) or were buried like Gobekli Tepe.</p>

<p>I hope all that made sense haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you make sense.</p>

<p>Look into the Hopi Indian belief of the Blue/Red Kachina.  They believe, along with other cultures, that another solar system passes through our system every 3,600 years or so, and the first sign is a Blue Kachina (a blue dot) in the sky, followed by a Red Kachina.</p>

<p>The weird thing about this, is it actually makes sense.  If the orb we see is pulling away from it&#39;s sun, from our perspective, it will appear blue, but then pulling towards, it will be red.</p>

<p>A whole bunch of ancient cultures speak about this other solar system, some calling it a dragon, The Destroyer, Nemisis, and recently Planet-X, but almost all say the same thing; there&#39;s a planet in that solar system that supports life.</p>

<p>Doppler effect at the speed that stars orbit the galactic center is very tiny and can&#39;t be noticed by the unaided eye. Maybe those ancient myths are talking figuratively, though.</p>

<p>For some &quot;star&quot; to be so close to us and be unoticed it would have to actually be an infrarred brown dwarf (or a &quot;superjupiter&quot; whatever). A planet (moon) around it would not be Earth-like, although it could conceivably support life in subglacial oceans and the like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, indeed. The ancient sumerians also talked about nibiru as a planet that orbits every 3,600 yrs. This figure is coming up a lot in otherwise unconnected cultures. This is one of the fascinsting things about ancient human civilization, imo.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe i misunderstood you, but, just as the doppler effect, when it comes towards us it would make sense thst we see it in blue, and as it leaves away from us, we would see it in red. </p>

<p>Im conflicted on this part of ancient astronomh, though. One would think thst, with our advanced technokogy, we would be able to see it by now. So, this confuses me a little bit, and makes me speculate that maybe its not another system or another planet, but instead it is some huge spaceship or something, like a flying city or whstever. This gets pretty speculative, which i love, so ill stop here unless you wanna dig deeper down this particular rabbit hole ;-)</p>

<p>Meh, maybe I got it mixed up.</p>

<p>As for not seeing it, the sun towing the system is a brown dwarf, previously called a black dwarf.  It&#39;s almost impossible to see against the night sky without infrared.  Also, it&#39;s coming right at us, so it&#39;s being blocked by our sun.  Fortunately it also travels in a corkscrew pattern, like our sun, so it is visible from time to time.</p>

<p>Some believe this merging will occur within the next few years, but I disagree.  If we consider ancient knowledge, then this next true Passover will bring us into a new Age of Awareness; both introducing the Age of Aquarius and the Bronze Age of Awareness.</p>

<p>What scares me is Aquarius is the &quot;water bringer&quot;, which hints at another flood.</p>

<p>If the numbers I have are correct, this shouldn&#39;t happen till about 2150, but I could be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats close to the figures ive seen. For instance, niburu isnt supposed to come around these parts for some time still, according to the ancient sumerians.</p>

<p>Bit the astromechanics of it all... Man. I gotta look into this more. I wanna believe all that, but im still kind of skeptical about this, you know? But maybe upon further investigation i could understand the mechanics of it all better. Afterall, the ancients were profoundly skillful with their astronomy. Thats enough to provie reasonable motive to research more, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has a lot of people thinking is this next Passover is heralded by four blood moons, something that hasn&#39;t occurred in a very long time, and Israel is planning on a celebration upon the final moon which falls on Passover.  This all will happen in 2016.</p>

<p>According to prophesy, America will be devastated.  This belief comes from the idea that 1/3 of all will perish, and America makes up 1/3 of the land mass, also many believe America is the new Babylon.  Something I can&#39;t disagree with.</p>

<p>What gets me most about this, is it actually adds up if you consider all the underground bases being built.  </p>

Do a search for ooparts and read about things like gold necklaces and clay pots inside formed coal. Either humanity doesn&#39;t understand how coal forms or our timeline is seriously longer that publicly acknowledged.  I&#39;m pretty certain it&#39;s the later of the two.

<p>Hey it&#39;s an interesting thought. Considering thet there are still some ilsands and areas of jungle where there are groups of people living like they did several hundreds of years ago, with no outside influence and almost no technology, it isn&#39;t a completely absurd notion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a good question, indeed. Already they have found submerged structures all over the place... Some are reported to be like, a few thousand feet below the seas surface (im unsure of the credibility of <em>those</em> claims, though.) But, with all the climatological knowledge we have, amd all the examples of cities and stuff submerged, we can come to the conclusion thst these places were built when the sea levels were lower, which was during the last ice age. Yet, as you asked, wtf have they not gotten deeper into this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my first thought.  Science has placed the Caribbean sea at 5 million years old and the isthmus of Panama at 3 million years if I remember correctly.  The point is, there are ruins at the bottom of the sea and science is also stating that, less than 10 million years ago it was land. That tells me that those ruins are much much older than anyone is willing to admit publicly for fear of being ridiculed. There are things made in ancient times that cannot be replicated. Take Damascus steel as one example and the Mayan crystal skulls as another. One would think this technology is completely lost but, in modern times, some people have done amazing things. Take a look at coral castle and Edward Leedskalnin. He built a megalithic building, alone, move it, alone, and when the door broke, nobody could fix it. </p>

<p>When the ice age ended, the rising ocean levels put these settlements underwater. Personally, I think this concept will become mainstream at some point in the future. There is a site called Gobekli Tepe (megalithic stone monuments) in Turkey that dates back to 11,000 BC. No reason to think that there couldn&#39;t have been equally advanced coastal sites at the same time.</p>

<p>Also, oil companies and undersea cable workers have brought up all kinds of ice age artifacts from the bottom of English Channel. Obviously there were people living there when it used to be dry land.</p>

<p>Hancock has found some pretty good evidence of Manhattan-sized cities offshore from the coast of India. These presumably date back to at least 6500BC, the last time these areas were above water.</p>

<p>The archaelogists couldn&#39;t date it, so they used a number of scientific dating methods which determined that these were human artefacts from 250,000 years BPE, vastly older than any other site in the Americas. It cause a shitstorm and a talented archaeologist had her career ruined because of it.</p>

<p>The Mexican government and the archaelogical community buried it, literally. The site was filled in and a housing development built on top of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Never heard of this one. Though, there is a reasonable explanation contained in the wiki articke:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors stated that they had no definitive explanation for the anomalous results. However, Malde suggested the tool-bearing strata had possibly been eroded by an ancient streambed, thus combining older and newer strata and complicating dating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense, kinda. But then this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1973, Steen-MacIntyre, Malde and Roald Fryxell returned to Hueyatlaco to re-examine the geographic strata and more accurately determine an age for the tool-bearing strata. They were able to rule out Malde&#39;s streambed hypothesis.[6] Moreover, the team undertook an exhaustive analysis of volcanic ash and pumice from the original excavation site and the surrounding region. Using the zircon fission-track dating method, geochemist C.W. Naeser dated samples of ash from Hueyatlaco&#39;s tool-bearing strata to 370,000 ybp +/- 240,000 years.[6]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact the Mexican government buried the site and has refused to give anyone a license to dig a Hueyatlaco in recent years just makes it more intriguing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another interesting site at Rockwall, a town in Texas which got its name from the fact that there is a large, ancient &quot;rock wall&quot; there that nobody can definitively explain. Some think it <strong>may</strong> have been a very ancient and very large structure unlike anything else seen in the Americas. The controversy is similar to the Yonaguni monument, with the dissenters saying it is a natural geological formation, not man-made. </p>

<p>Either way, Rockwall has been &quot;buried&quot; even more deeply than Hueyatlaco - they built an airport over the site. Also, you will need to dig deeper than Wikipedia on this one. Try:</p>

<p>If you think about it, the world only has like seven billion people. Of those, 2.18 billion are christians, 1.6 are muslims, millions of jews, and a bunch of other denominations. It is thought that almost 3/4 of the world population are religious. </p>

<p>Imagine what power can be extracted if you are the leader of these people. That power only exists as long as the people believe in that religion. </p>

<p>And its not necessary for there to be <em>one</em> leader, either. I mean, there could be one for the christians, one for the muslims, one for the jews, etc.etc. This could explain a lot of the wars and conflicts going around. None of them wish for the truth about human origins and the origination of civilizations to be known, as that would undermine their authority over the people that believe in their religion. </p>

<p>I tend to believe thst most major religions essentially have the same stories, myths, and legends, just different interpretations of the same events. So, i dont feel it is farfetched to believe that most of the religions today stem from the same history, which if it is made common knowledge, would shed light on the fsct thst all the religions are based on the same thing, and no single one is the &quot;true&quot; religion. </p>

<p>Chaos would occur then, i would think. Just try to tell a die hard christian that his religion is wrong, and thst islam is more correct. Try that to any religious person. </p>

<p>So, they keep it under wraps, and reap the rewards through monetary &quot;offerings&quot; and oppressive paradigms meant to control thst population in order to extract more power and authority, and thus, more affluence. </p>

<p>This is all hypothetical, of course. Speculative, even. This is just what i posit for an explanation. There could be other explanations, too. I just feel this makes the most sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.  Difficult question to answer.  But how do you think the world would respond if they found out tomorrow that not only did an ancient, technologically and spiritually advanced civilization exist, but that its core teachings were deliberately co-opted and corrupted by enslavers, many (probably most) of them Freemasons in order to trick us into believing their version of history &quot;his (the white man&#39;s) story&quot; which is little more than a house of cards held together by hundreds of years of lies?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m not fond of &quot;the white man&#39;s story&quot; bit.  I would find it increadibly awesome if proof arose to demonstrate that ancient civs had advanced technology, I really would.  That would help everyone.  Sure, there&#39;d probably be upheaval and, in this case, I do think the ends would justify the means.</p>

<p>How would the following: ancient civ A has advanced technology.  Yet, they are destroyed and erased from history books by civ B who has lesser technologies.  It doesn&#39;t make sense.  Wouldn&#39;t A be able to easily defend themselves and if, for some reason, could not then at least they&#39;d have the ability to continue their lineage and story.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is a catastrophic global disaster occured like the stories of Atlantis or lemuria or peeps living inside the Earth.  Now we&#39;re really getting out there.  Not saying this didn&#39;t happen, it very likely did, but then that would take so much more evidence to convince the world of what really happened millenia ago.</p>

<p>Yep, what you&#39;re describing in your final paragraph is most likely the case in my opinion.  &quot;The Great Cataclysm&quot; is kind of a catch-all phrase to describe this but you&#39;ll find descriptions of it in every ancient civilization and religion, even ones that seemingly wouldn&#39;t have had any contact with each other.</p>

<p>I think the two general theories are: 1. An ancient civilization existed that had advanced technology and they &quot;destroyed themselves&quot;, leaving only a small number of survivors who have since re-populated the planet.</p>

<p>Or 2. A natural cataclysm like a flood or asteroid impact or volcanic eruption or some combination of these and/or others hit the planet at or around the same time and the end result was the same - only a small number of survivors.</p>

<p>There actually is quite a bit of evidence already out there to support the idea that humanity is at least a couple hundreds of thousands of years older than what&#39;s &quot;commonly believed&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i may:</p>

<p>There is a lot of evidence for a massive flood about twelve thousand yrs ago.  For speculation, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was an ancient human civilization. As humans, there were good and folks, bit the good ones remained in charge and there was an overall happy world.</p></li>
<li><p>The flood wiped out almstt everyone amd almost every shred of evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>There were few survivors, some of the good folks survived, amd some of the bad folks survived.</p></li>
<li><p>The good folks decided to invest their effort into rebuilding what they had lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The bad folk decided to capitolize on the good folks efforts, and undermine their investments by force and war. Eventually, the bad folks won, probably easily. They then tried their best to erase all evidence of the antideluvial civilization, and set the remaining population toward a long and gruesome path of oppression. They were from then on to be treated like kings.... Or gods.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this hypothetical scenario, it is conceivable that we are, today, the product of such discord and manipulation. The descendents of the &quot;bad folk&quot; surely would wish to remain in power and keep the family tradition going in perpetuity. </p>

<p>If knowledge of the ancient civilization got out, it is conceivable that they would then lose theor tight grip on the minds amd allegiance of the blind yet faithful followers. </p>

<p>Thats worth keeping a secret, imo.</p>

<p>I dont follow the hollow earth theories as they put it, but i cant see why there can not be an underground city or metropolis. If we are to assume the ancients had some awesome technology thst we have yet to discover, i can see them creating these underground cities using geothermal heat (or other renewal source) to provide light for plants to feed animals for sustainence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Even more recently, i read some article maybe two three yrs ago? It was explaining how one of the libraries in iraq was sacked by a bunch of rioters/looters. But the witnesses said this we strange. The &quot;rioters/looters&quot; were wearing earpieces and were moving in packs like coordinated squadrons, ignoring a lot of the most valuable artifacts and taking the ancient ones, like scrolls and the like. </p>

<p>A little before that i remember reading about some muslim rioters or rebels or whatever in mali (or some country in africa) were taking over the city, and alot of the officials and important folk took shelter in the citys museum thst housed a lot of important ancient artifacts. I dont remember the outcome exactly, but i want to say they never got in. Even if they didnt, the fact that they might have been trying is suspicious in its own right.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that if we dig deep enough, these &quot;book burnings&quot; and &quot;library sacking&quot; or, how you put it, erasures, would be in abundance. Even hitler had (alledgedly) an insatiable thirst for the occult and ancient stuffs. </p>

<p>So, i remain fascinated and on the lookout for stories like these...</p>

<p>As in, the real question is if steel had ever been discovered before it was in the modern historical record, or if a radio had ever been constructed.</p>

<p>Over the course of the 250k years the modern brain was evolving, there are bound to be counteless tribes and cities that became advanced in the same way ancient babylon was.  If there were cities like these, I would not be shocked.  </p>

<p>I would only be shocked if there were once like, cars and airplanes, and then ALL of that was completely erased over the course of 10,000 years.  </p>

<p>This talk of coral castle and magic-like powers the atlantians had are pretty fanciful without evidence of actual understanding of the periodic table and electromagnetic spectrum.  </p>

<p>Unless you go the other direction and these visitors were so far more advanced than us, all their technology was like the dramatic-device &#39;technology&#39; of aliens as portrayed on shows like stargate sg-1. (oh this circuit board is really just 20 glowing crystals in a panel in the wall)</p>

<p>If there were aliens that advanced, it is difficult to imagine them having that much trouble with the environment of earth, unless there were so few of them, and there were other equally advanced aliens here.  </p>

<p>And ancient aliens who have immense technology but just let humans go on the way we do, and no one ever visits us again, is well, pretty fanciful.  </p>

<p>This is of course not to ignore or disregard the desire to find all evidence of the most advanced humans at any point in history, but barring truly extraordinary evidence, it&#39;s not going to upset the history we know and sort-of love/have no choice but to accept.  </p>

<p>The vast majority of evidence is that there was no periodic table and electromagnetic understanding before the last two hundred years of human evolution, which, to me, is easy to accept.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the periodic table is not that important as we think? Quantum physics allows to describe the micro-world matter using math equations. So, instead of having this giant table of elements, they could have just known that some function of (number of protons, neurons, electrons) is true for all stable elements, and another function returns the default aggregation state, for example. We are not looking for these equations, nor that we even know how they would look like in an ancient math language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how quantum physics could come before thorough understanding of the periodic table, or relativity, or nuclear physics, for that matter.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re imagining some group of people like kabaala buddhists using mind powers to skip a thousand years of scientific investigation, and I don&#39;t think that has any chance of being real, and so I say, it is fanciful.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We (modern humans) needed just a couple of hundred years to advance from the periodic table to quantum physics. Did we carve the former in stone to be seen by future generations? No. How would people from several thousand years in the future even guess that we know about the periodic table?</p>

<p>Besides, you don&#39;t know the pace at which the ancient people studied technology. Maybe they needed less time, maybe more, or maybe they just skipped this step and leaped to quantum stuff earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to be disrespectful or dismissive, I think it a valid question worth asking.  </p>

<p>It was not just a few scientists, it was hundreds of thousands of scientists who got us where we are, all of the unsuccesful work contributed also.  </p>

<p>To think there was just this city in the middle of africa who was able to do that, and invented transistors even, and that nothing of that survives, it&#39;s just too far fetched.  </p>

<p>Living in Ireland, I am familiar with and have visited some of the examples in your list, as well as a bunch of others which you haven&#39;t included.</p>

<p>You have listed a lot of old monuments and structures, but I feel you have rather overlooked the opportunity to elaborate on your posits.  Do you believe that some conspirators know more about the ancient civilisations that left these behind?  Do you believe that they are keeping this knowledge from us?  How are they doing so?  Who are the conspirators?  Are they the tyrants you envisage in our future?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know which comment thread was most appropriate to mention this, but my dad just wrote and self-published a book (fictional story, but based on all the theories put forth by Hancock, Bauval, Dunn, etc etc).  He ties all the ideas they&#39;ve presented (and a lot of the ideas from this post &amp; comments) together into an awesome story.  I don&#39;t know what the reddiquette is about hawking products, but every single commenter and OP would totally dig it.  It&#39;s available on Amazon - Songs Of Atlantis by Brian Power.</p>

<p>Humanity has been actively lied to for centuries(and likely longer) about how expansive it&#39;s reach has been. The Mormons have been shit on since their creation, because they introduced 3 books, all of which reference pre-Abrahamic stories in one way or another. Including the ideas of Nibiru, reincarnation, and a global civilization.</p>

<p>In Northern Michigan, and Illinois, they&#39;ve found 3,500-4,500 year old brass books telling the story of Moses, and the first Diaspora of the Lost Tribes. Did Smith find golden plates? No. Brass, very likely, and the FLDS movement said that they had brass plates with additional information. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not saying they&#39;re more right than others, however it paints a different picture when you know that other examples of the Mormon doctrine had been found for several hundred years before Smith found his copy, and hidden by the Calvinists(Catholic &quot;Scientists&quot;), because it went against the official dogma.</p>

Even if you had the tech, who&#39;s going to pay for it? It&#39;s not like the discovery is going to pay for the cost of the actual research so you have to find someone with the money to afford it and the passion to pay for it.</p>

<p>That also implies that if we can somehow clean up the cabal and switch to a gold-backed currency or crypto, some really amazing tech will be coming out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly why? Most likely scenario is that TPTB know everything except space travel and the greater interest in space to them is finding a working spacecraft. If they don&#39;t already have one otherwise why would the be sending the rosetta apcecraft to an asteroid with supposed structures on? I mention  rosetta due to its name and the name of the probe onboard philea an interesting choice if you Google it, interestingly it has links to both Isis and Osiris we all know that gig now has something to do with the &quot;antichrist&quot;</p>
