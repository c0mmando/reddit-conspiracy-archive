       One of the oldest philosophies out there, Hermeticism essentially has always stated that this universe (and the countless others that exist) are all a 'mental construct' created &amp; maintained within the mind of The All (their version of God). If all this truly was just a mental creation of some kind of super-cosmic-mega-mind Thing, then there would inevitably be holographic qualities to this construct. It would also mean that everything within this system would show evidence of being part of the same system, and there would be correspondence between these different levels. All of this is actually beautifully pointed out in the so-called 7 Principles of Hermeticism, where everything in life is basically broken down to a
       <em>
        living, spiraling sine-wave
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I promise I'm not trying to pump Hermeticism here. I've always known of it's existence &amp; knew some basic things about it, but just assumed it was some psuedo-religious-Western-cult philosophy, and I just wasn't interested in that at the time. Maybe that's all it really is in the end, but once I started connecting dots &amp; saw that the basis of almost all secret societies &amp; mystery schools the world over, is Hermeticism, I started to take a closer look. And now I think I get it. Now it makes sense about the secret stash the Crusaders Templar Knights came across. How they got rich &amp; powerful afterwards, why the Vatican destroyed them &amp; clamped down on that knowledge. From then on, only them &amp; various mystery school/secret societies were allowed to know this philosophy (&amp; profit from it). Anyone else was probably burned at the stake in those days. In the modern age it's simply been ignored, forgotten, or ridiculed. No mainstream interest for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really? I think Hermeticism is the closest thing to Real Knowledge about our world, universe, ourselves &amp; Everything, that we have on this planet. It makes so much sense, is far ahead of it's time ('everything vibrates'? 'Nothing is at rest'? 'The mind is dual'?!), is eloquent and sophisticated.. And OLD. This might even be from a previous epoch.. perhaps this was basic 3rd grade knowledge in Atlantis lol. Seriously though, people need to
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYTJwgXjb7w">
        give this school-of-thought

       a closer, deeper look. It might surprise you. Especially in light of new discoveries about our universe.

       The suppressed knowledge were the secrets in alchemy.  Alchemy was the practice of attempting to create a
       <em>
        philosopher's stone
       </em>
       , which was a solidified, purified, fixated mental construct that gave someone magical dominion over our plane of existence or reality as we know it.  In our science-dominated world, this sounds like bullshit because no such magic exists or is provable.  But it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       and we're finding that it's quantum physics.  If you perform magic int he world, you'll be the only one who knows, because to everyone else, it will seem as though nothing was changed because from their reference,
       <em>
        it always has been that way
       </em>
       .  This is not mere solipsism, rather, it is moving your own consciousness through an infinite number of possiblities, which one could understand as multiple realities or multiple dimensions.  But even that is wrong, because really you are simply manipulating data in the thoughts of the 'All' which is the masonic 'Great Architect' in whose minds we dwell as lower level consciouses.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, given the long pretext, I would suggest Terence McKenna's history of alchemy in:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjCjwZfyyBM">
         The Alchemical Dream movie
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.matrixmasters.net/podcasts/TRANSCRIPTS/TMcK-ImportancePsychedelics.html">
         The importance of psychedelics
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Mckenna basically says that the mystery schools were killed off by the process of priestcraft.  Basically the church stole the secrets, turned them into a sacrament and started charging admission--essentially turned into psychedelic ticketmaster.  The roman plebes got mad, convinced the emperors to destroy the secrets, and they did.  There is evidence of sacred sacrament (ie: soma, mushrooms, ergot?) among the ecclesiastical elite in Carl Ruck's excellent
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvUUyuvWOMM">
        Heretical Visionary Sacraments Amongst the Ecclesiastical Elite
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I would further search suppression of 'alchemy' rather than 'hermeticism'.  I would investigate the burning of the library of Alexandria and the destruction of the temples of the eleusinians by christian roman emperor theodosias  (sorry if misspelled).  I would read about the destruction of the invisible college.  I would look at any connections with knights templar and masons.  Finally, and most importantly, I would read about, with an open mind, the connection between mushrooms and christianity; soma.

       You are right about Hermeticism being the original source of all arcane knowledge or gnosis.  Here is a mind-shattering intro:

       The way I see it - all conscious entities are simulated universes, and that is all that exists. We are part of a chain of simulations that stretch through infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, consciousness is the most fundamental state, and it's turtles all the way down. However your question is still relevant.

       If my hypothesis is true, the story Earth and its inhabitants fit in an unknown scenario. Maybe the movie the matrix is real, or more likely we're part of something else, maybe we are in a dream, a science experiment, the result of technological innovation, or perhaps some "God" entity created us for entertainment, no one knows.

        Maybe the movie the matrix is real, or more likely we're part of something else, maybe we are in a dream, a science experiment, the result of technological innovation, or perhaps some "God" entity created us for entertainment, no one knows.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Who made the reality that was used to create the matrix? Whose dream are we in? Whose experiment? You get my drift.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a thought a few months ago. I was thinking about the Large Hadron Collider. It smashes two energy particles together to create something different from the result. I thought: What if the Big Bang was just the result of two universe-sized particles smashing together at the speed of light? Being very high at the time, the idea blew my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until the next time that I mentioned this thought that my wife deflated my excitement: Those two particles would still have to have been created.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how something can come from nothing and if not, how there could always have been something.

       yes, this could bring up the collider, i asked (previous post) if the purpose of it (the collider) was to create a star gate, but then i think there are already star gates on the planet, we just never realized it,
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd like know who or what is projecting the hologram? but then what?
what is the purpose, are we a living experiment created by something else, because if we are, it's obvious that we don't

       that's what i'd like to know - but if this is true, then becoming

       can

       this just boggles - in a way it's exciting (altho' scary) because it confirms 'mind over matter' and the law of attraction is real, and we're ABLE to create what we focus on.

       ABSTRACT. This paper argues that at least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation. A number of other consequences of this result are also discussed.

       There doesn't have to be a final 'who' creating anything. The nested holograph could continue to infinity at which point, the nature of the universe itself is a nested hologram. Turtles all the way down.

       Even if like in the movie, your concept of reality shattered around you? Your loved ones gone? Figments of the matrix or as real as you but lost in the biomass that makes up the grid? Even if it meant you would be thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare where humans were driven deep underground and a war rages against machines hell bent on eliminating you? Becoming a fugitive in the world you knew? You know I dont think i would want to know to be honest. The character Cipher, the one who betrays his crew in the first movie, He realized this truth after he was set 'free'. He gave up the life he knew for all of what i mentioned and he regretted it enough to do whatever it took to get back. From a moral standpoint he was an asshole. But i can't say I don't understand. I too love a good rare steak :-)
