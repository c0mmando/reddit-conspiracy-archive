       I think most classified or top secret US government documents stay under wraps for decades and may still have sections redacted when they're made public so we'll mostly just be guessing for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it's reasonable to say US agencies are using the Islamic State as a bogey man to align our support with Israel.  in the same way the CIA is known to have planted agents in various protests to intentionally become violent so public opinion favors using force to dispel the protesters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any of what I just said is the conspiracy, but the conspiracy is that the CIA is
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       funding and staffing ISIS, and that the entire organization is basically astro-turfed from the top down.

       To say it is "directly funded and staffed by the CIA" is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the CIA and all the private arms of the intelligence complex works. If it is, nothing is direct.

       During their early work overthrowing governments in South America, the CIA realized that if one of their agents were ever caught being directly involved, it would blow their cover and lead to an international crisis. Thus the jackals and "economic hit men" were born. They're privately employed and hired by whatever corporation has a vested interest in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of CIA agents do do spy work. They gather intelligence and collect assets and pay those assets to get more intelligence. It's higher up the chain where the decisions to do dirty things get made, and then it'll filter not back to the original Agent, but to someone else. Compartmentalization is key. If you were to have a CIA agent (who is by and large a "patriot" who believes in what they're doing) drop off a bag full of cash to ISIS, the CIA would be compromising their entire mission and objective, and creating a potential whistleblower. It's all about compartmentalization and plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read "Legacy of Ashes" and any of John Perkins' books. Yes they involve themselves in covert conspiracies, but it's far more complex and even boring than an observer might think.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the crux of your hypothesis; it's not really necessary. The US has created the conditions for another wave of insurgency through our actions in the region over the last decade+. People aren't simply going to lie back and accept American backed regimes. And there've been rumblings of "an islamic state" for years and years. I personally don't think it would be the worst thing in the long run, to have the region be able to redraw it's own borders. It would be bloody, probably, but I'm not sure it won't be as bloody if the west keeps trying to prop up the old paradigm.

        Here's an article on who is funding ISIS
       </a>
       . I obviously can't say it's truthful, but it's a more accurate picture of how that sort of thing works. It supports your general feeling in a way. The people funding ISIS are rich in Corporate allied states, they probably got rich because of Western oil interests, which is how the corporatocracy stays powerful abroad. But it also creates the condition for the wealth to hate itself and turn on us, thus funding terrorism, and thus giving the military industrial complex an excuse to continue to pay itself to drop billions of dollars worth of bombs once a decade or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that answers your question. I obviously can't say with 100% certainty I am right and you are wrong. But it's just never
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       simple.

       We'd be just guessing so...

       The important thing to consider is that vast schemes like these depend on the cooperation of many different security agencies in many countries, and of course the backing up of all media. It's a network so pinning the blame on just one of these entities is like distracting ourselves.

       Yes, it's beyond obvious. At this point, it's an invitation for western society to snap and revolt, and when everything has been reduced to rubble the kind hand of the NWO will restore us to universal peace and prosperity, with only a few strings attached and only for a 'little' while.

       Everyone is saying that we saw this coming and called it early on - BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING! We are the minority population of a world filled with people keeping their heads down and eyes diverted, and without them we are nothing. So instead of claiming how early on we saw this process of deceit arise, and bragging about our ability to see through the lies, and our ability to perceive even the most complex of deceptions and connections, let's start asking the bigger questions: what are we going to do about it?
      </p>

       I still see a great many buried in their devices and closed off with their headphones. We are closing each other off to the truth: we are the future. This is our reality to explore and create, and we are allowing corruption.
