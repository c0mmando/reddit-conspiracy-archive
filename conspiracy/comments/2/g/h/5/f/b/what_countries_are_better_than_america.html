        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am 24 years old but seriously considering moving to another country because I do not have faith things will get better in the USA.  I was wondering what countries are better to live in than America. I know we&#39;ve all been brainwashed to believe we are #1 and nothing is better than this country but I am sick and tired of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debt Slavery</li>
<li>Corporate Welfare</li>
<li>Deliberate Poisoning of Water Supplies</li>
<li>Endless cycle and promotion of war</li>
<li>Poisoned Food</li>
<li>GMOs</li>
<li>Terrible jobs and pay</li>
<li>Surveillance and police state</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical industry that doesn&#39;t prevent but only &quot;cures&quot; and keeps you in an endless, costly, sick cycle</li>
<li>Willful ignorance of the majority</li>
<li>Failiure of the political system and big business to care about people and not profits and power</li>
<li>As well as many other things but I am mostly just sick of the garbage food, polllutant filled water, and overabundance of worthless soul-sucking jobs that demand 110% out of you but give you 10% to live.</li>
<li>Finally, I am also sick of the complete narcissim and oversexualization of both genders in this country and the utter amount of promiscuity and infidelity that is promoted through Hollywood, the media, and the music industry</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading about Iceland on here was pretty interesting especially about how they got rid of their bank criminals. I also like Iceland from what I&#39;ve seen because they are more into strength and size rather than the American version of puny and annoying, or fat and loud --&gt; this comes from a documentary I saw on the strong men in that area.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t the most informative post but I was wondering if you guys had a list or countries of mind that were better to live in that the USA. Some things I am interested  in are:</p>

<ul>
<li>are they English speaking?</li>
<li>how free are they really?</li>
<li>quality of food and water?</li>
<li>ease of getting a job and having a quality life</li>
<li>ease of adjusting to the new country</li>
<li>how much money it takes to get there and start over</li>
<li>if there are families looking for people who could help out in their house in exchange for a place to live</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m really just getting started with this but think many people could benefit from a post like this. I definitely feel powerless to change the direction I see this country heading and feel like the true puppet masters have a stranglehold on the balls of this nation.  I&#39;m open to suggestions and hope this post can help other people too since I think we are all looking for a way out of this mess.</p>

<p>The way I have seen the past couple years and the immediate future is just the calm before the storm. None of us can predict exactly when will SHTF but I think we all sense it&#39;s very probable anyday at this point. In a country that views people like us (regardless of how we really are) as complete nutjobs and fearmongerers, I think we would all benefit knowing of some places we could maybe go before things go south. Even if nothing happens (which is not going to happen) then at least we can live somewhere we feel more comfortable in.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the definition of insanity to me is repeating the same cycle over and over again and expecting different results.  This is how I see America at this point; repeating the same cycle only to yield even shittier results and I can&#39;t stomach it anymore. I never liked it, but now it&#39;s impossible to ignore and no amount of entertainment will ever distract me from the unfortunate realities we face.  I wanted to live a great life in this country but it seems to be impossible unless you sacrifice everything that makes you human.</p>

<p>I appreciate any advice and suggestions. I&#39;d give more information about myself but with all the spying I don&#39;t feel comfortable saying anything else than I am a 24 year old white male who is currently a personal trainer but is capable of learning new skills and adapting to different environments as long as the environment and skills are positive and not ultimately destructive as I see most jobs in America and the society as a whole.</p>

<p>Thank you so much in advance. Apologies for any spelling or grammatical errors that gave you a headache.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people were moving to Costa Rica. I don&#39;t like snakes, huge bugs and silly monkeys biting me though,so I&#39;ll pass. I was just reading up on GMO&#39;S last night. The wheat of today is not the same wheat of my grandparents... although denied. High fructose... blah blah blah... you get the drift. I think we are agreed on many of your reasons of dissatisfaction. The rockies are looking mighty fine to me. It&#39;s hermit time! ;-)
You have the advantage of youth on your side to make these personal early decisions on how you would like to live your life and be happy for yourself before sharing that with others. Wherever you decide, do it for you and yours alone. I truly admire those with the guts to break the mold and escape the popular vote trying to dictate your heart, speech and thought thus breaking your spirit. Best of luck. Your words of dissatisfaction do not make you a traitor amid the ruins of something you have no ability or desire to &quot;fix&quot;. To me, it makes you a warrior of life, refusing to buckle down to others. Be happy, stay true to your heart and vision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? Costa Rica kicks ass. Wish I spoke Spanish better, but the locals are patient with my attempts. Land is still cheap, labor is very cheap, and there are thousands of business opportunities for the taking. I&#39;m near the beach, so it&#39;s a bit hot here, but inland can get downright chilly.</p>

<p>Oh, and <em>alllll</em> the ex-pats here know what&#39;s going on. I just had a dinner party where we talked about bankers, Illuminati, the Olympic/Titanic sinking/not-sinking, the whole deal right out in the open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool. Not knocking the country... just not a fan of snakes and bugs. I heard you get quite a bang for the buck down there. Many families have been making the trek to a better way of life who have had it with the USA. Free choice. I would enjoy the warm weather myself. That&#39;s why I mentioned it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d call it 2nd world. It&#39;s different, for sure, but not all developed like the US. Lots of gravel roads still. People don&#39;t have a lot of money, and the incoming expats (more and more as people wake up) inflate prices, so it&#39;s a weird economy where expats often pay double what locals do. I&#39;m actually ok with that. The nature is phenomenal, perfect beaches, volcanos, wildlife -- I have monkeys in the tree out front, flocks of parrots, iguanas, mangos, bananas, plantains, etc. And there&#39;s no rat race pressure to have the newest car or whatever. I drive a 15yo Toyota 4runner and it&#39;s one of the nicer cars around. I live in a rural area but still have city water, electricity, cable modem, and they just paved the road out front.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call it dirt cheap, but cheaper than most places in the US. Nicaragua is similar, but a lot cheaper. Haven&#39;t been to Panama, but I hear the same there.</p>

<p>All the negatives you mentioned? We have those too.  The only saving grace is our health care system, compared to yours.  It&#39;s really the only major difference between us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t mind high taxes, cold, and nanny state try the Nordics.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;perfect&quot; place, unless you are fucking rich of course. Every country has its plus and minuses, besides failed-states of course ! </p>

<p>For work UAE or Qatar are great, you can <em>easily</em> make a 6-digit salary, but life sucks there !! Portugal is great: liberalized drug laws, Europe, excellent food, but no work !! </p>

<p>So OP just try to make the best of where you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t spend a whole lot of time proofreading and apologize at the end. I think the point and topic still stands though and people who downvoted initially (first 5 seconds) couldn&#39;t have read past the title which is about as straightforward as you can get.</p>
