       While this may or may not be true, Kevin Annett and his self proclaimed "The International Common Law Court of Justice", is not a credible source, IMO.

       Fair enough, I just thought it was an interesting story and wanted to see if anyone had any more info.  I think it's interesting that Antony was a clinical psychologist in light of what we know about MK-Ultra and ritual abuse.

       When I first heard about him and his tribunal, I thought he was speaking for an International Court in Brussels. Come to find out that the ITCCS is basically a one man operation consisting of Annett. (Some of his blog posts are done from his bathroom while he is sitting on his toilet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       He has tried the Queen and the Pope of child abuse, found them guily and issued a warrant for their arrest. He represented Indigenous people until they told him to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO he is a globalist Psyop making it difficult to make any real claims against the global elite stick.

       Huh no kidding, that's interesting and very unfortunate.  Thanks for the information.  If you aren't already aware, Ted Gunderson is a former FBI chief who has done some interesting work exposing some of this sort of stuff, there are a bunch of great presentations by him on youtube.

       I've been reading that in Singapore "unnatural death" can often mean a fall or accident.  The weird thing, though, is that the only people who seem to be saying this are the people writing the MSM articles and/or commenting on them.  I can't find any source for this claim outside of these articles and comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what I'm saying here is that I think "unnatural death" means about the same thing in Singapore that it means in the US.  This is one to watch for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that Antony was a clinical psychologist.  As we all
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       know, some of the worst abuses have historically involved psychological experiments and those who work in hospitals.

       I've been reading that in Singapore "unnatural death" can often mean a fall or accident.  The weird thing, though, is that the only people who seem to be saying this are the people writing the MSM articles and/or commenting on them.  I can't find any source for this claim outside of these articles and comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what I'm saying here is that I think "unnatural death" means about the same thing in Singapore that it means in the US.  This is one to watch for sure.

       Also note that Antony was a clinical psychologist.  As we all
