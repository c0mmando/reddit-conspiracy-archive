<p>&quot;In this June 13, 2014 update from Kevin Annett, more evidence from the Brussels trial of Pope Francis reveals how wide the net of child sacrifice by the Vatican and European royalty extends. Also news from the movement to establish a lawful Republic in Canada, and upcoming direct actions around the world to stop forever <em>the murderous actions of the Ninth Circle.</em>&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>When I first heard about him and his tribunal, I thought he was speaking for an International Court in Brussels. Come to find out that the ITCCS is basically a one man operation consisting of Annett. (Some of his blog posts are done from his bathroom while he is sitting on his toilet.)</p>

<p>He has tried the Queen and the Pope of child abuse, found them guily and issued a warrant for their arrest. He represented Indigenous people until they told him to stop.</p>

<p>IMO he is a globalist Psyop making it difficult to make any real claims against the global elite stick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading that in Singapore &quot;unnatural death&quot; can often mean a fall or accident.

I can&#39;t find any source for this claim outside of these articles and comments.</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m saying here is that I think &quot;unnatural death&quot; means about the same thing in Singapore that it means in the US.  This is one to watch for sure.</p>

<p>Also note that Antony was a clinical psychologist.  As we all <em>should</em> know, some of the worst abuses have historically involved psychological experiments and those who work in hospitals.</p>
