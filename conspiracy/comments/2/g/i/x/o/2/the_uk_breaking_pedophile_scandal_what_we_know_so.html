       the rich and powerful exploit those who are not - this is the overall story and it is nothing new to human experience
      </p>
      <p>
       what is newsworthy is the hypocrisy - that so many institutions and people who profess particular views totally violate what they profess to believe in order to have sex with under-legal-age persons
      </p>
      <p>
       this happens all over the world, England is not the exception
      </p>
      <p>
       the real solution is to legalise prostitution and lower the age-of-consent so there are no more hypocrites and ensure good payment and healthcare for these sex workers ... the activity will continue whether there are prosecutions and jailings or not because human beings are human beings

       forget morality, forget laws ... imagine you are an alien studying human behavior as a scientist does - totally objectively, just logging what you observe ... you would find a pattern over time of the rich and powerful exploiting all those weaker, and the young being used for sex ... it is human nature ... so do humans ever ultimately deal with what it means to be human and their nature or simply continue what is essentially a charade of indignation?

       part-time troller ... as for the physical and psychological damage, a great many cultures engaged in or presently engage in youth sexuality and within the context of their society if it is culturally reinforced it is not perceived as abuse and their are no psychological scars (boys sucking off the elder males in Papua New Guinea, sphincter-widening step chairs for boys in ancient Greece, graphic depictions of sex acts as art on the walls in breakfast nooks in homes in Pompeii, Southeast Asia youth sexuality, boys engaging in beastiality in some Central American countries, etc etc)

      <p>
       The British scandal (and the similar Bush I scandal of the 80s) involves the targeting, grooming, and blatant exploitation of children with no advocats (orphans mostly) and it is the coercion that is the sickening aspect - they were used as a commodity

       kidnapping is a crime ... torture is a crime ... ritual abuse if all parties are not consenting is a crime ... but my point is that the exploitation of those under-the-legal age for sex has always gone on, will always go on and the rich and powerful get away with it to the point that they feel they can inject cruelty into he mix ... the coercion and cruelty are the crimes

       So "elites" have always raped and abused young children, thus we should just accept it and legalize it?  I don't follow the logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Raping a child is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       cruel and
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       involves coercion, regardless of whether the child is actually tortured or killed in addition.  Do you understand that you're literally suggesting that we legalize the rape of children?  I mean seriously man, think about what you're saying here -
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think about it - because I'm not sure that you actually have.

       Brevity aside, when it comes to discussing the rape of children and the legality of said rape, actual thought and consideration of the issue is a requirement.  This shit is not a joke - tens of thousands of kids per year (at minimum) are victims of these crimes and have been for centuries (again, at minimum).

       more like tens of millions upon tens of millions, don't forget India, Southeast Asia, island nations, Russia, Eastern Europe, North Africa and Central and South America ... hence my point: if this is something humans do and always have then it is a part of who we are and do we ever face up to who and what we are? - civilisation is but a thin veneer we wear over the savage beast

       Do you rape children and mutilate/kidnap/murder them? Do any of your friends and family?  It's a very specific and organized group of people we're talking about here. You're letting these monsters off of the hook by grouping yourself and everyone else in with them.

       oh no, acts of crime should be investigated and punished and abduction, coercion, torture and conspiracy are all crimes ... I point out that the larger impulse has always been there, and exists within humanity so at some point we need to address it

       How about protecting the children? How about hunting down those in power who are engaging in sex with children, or covering up for those who are? How about stopping the secret services from using pedophilia as a way to blackmail powerful people to get them to do what they want?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we think about the kids here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lowering the age of consent is not going to help the kids, it is just going to help the pedophiles.

       Yes, there is always accounts of Satanic rituals in these pedophilia scandals, in Belgium with Marc Dutroux, or the Franklin Coverup, the McMartin case, Presidio base, in America. It may just be a crazy red herring to throw people off, or they actually worship demons.
