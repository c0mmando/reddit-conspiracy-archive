    <div class="md"><p>Here are some inaccuracies from the video. I&#39;m quoting from the <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/allwarsarebankerwars.php">written version of this, not the video, which may differ.</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the first anecdote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States fought the American Revolution primarily over King George III&#39;s Currency act, which forced the colonists to conduct their business only using printed bank notes borrowed from the Bank of England at interest. After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing bank notes.</p>

<p>&quot;The refusal of King George 3rd to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators, was probably the prime cause of the revolution.&quot; -- Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is completely fabricated. It comes from a hoax circulated by
Congress Binderup in the 1930s. See <a href="http://21stcenturycicero.wordpress.com/fraud/how-benjamin-franklin-made-new-england-prosperous/">this blog post</a>, where the blogger asks a couple of historians about it.</p>

<p>The issue of paper currency was big around 1764, when the Currency Act
was passed, but the furor had mostly died down by 1775. For one thing,
the colonists found other ways of creating usable money besides &quot;legal
tender&quot; acts. Also, the English parliament passed an act in 1773 that
loosened it a little bit.</p>

<p>Neither Ben Franklin nor anyone else at the time suggested that the
money issue was the prime issue. Ask yourself, if it was such a big issue,
why was it not even <em>mentioned</em> in the Declaration of Independence? I
also searched other lists of grievances from that era and found that
only New York mentioned the paper currency issue and it
was not among the top grievances. For example, in <a href="http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1661:1.amarch"><em>The humble Petition of the General Assembly of the Colony of New-York, to the King</em></a>, it&#39;s item 13:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>13. We likewise think the Act prohibiting the Legislature of this Colony from passing any law for the emission of Paper Currency, to be a legal tender therein, is disadvantageous to the growth and commerce thereof; an abridgment of your Majesty&#39; s prerogative, (in the preservation of which we are deeply interested,) and a violation of our legislative rights; and may hereafter disable your Majesty&#39; s subjects, upon proper requisition, and upon certain emergencies, from granting such aids as may be necessary for the general safety of the Empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen <em>anything</em> from the Colonies that complain about the Bank of England or its banknotes. They wanted paper money as an alternative to gold and silver coins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.&quot; -- William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England in 1694</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another fake quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing bank notes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the war, the Continental Congress issued Continental currency,
which ended up worthless because of inflation.</p>

<p>After the revolution, there was no national paper currency. Invidual
banks issued their own bank notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But bankers are nothing if not dedicated to their schemes to acquire your wealth, and know full well how easy it is to corrupt a nation&#39;s leaders. Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous &quot;Let me issue and control a nation&#39;s money and I care not who makes the laws&quot;,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No Rothschild ever said that. It dates from the early 20th century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild&#39;s chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the First Bank was established, the Rothschild was a coin dealer and money-lender local to Frankfurt, Germany. He had absolutely no dealings with Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Founded in 1791, by the end of its twenty year charter the First Bank of the United States had almost ruined the nation&#39;s economy, while enriching the bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were complaints about the Bank, but ruining the economy was not among them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress refused to renew the charter and signaled their intention to go back to a state issued value based currency on which the people paid no interest at all to any banker. This resulted in a threat from Nathan Mayer Rothschild against the US Government, &quot;Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A complete fabrication. This hoax seems to have popped out of nowhere in the 1980s. There is no historical basis for it, whatsoever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress still refused to renew the charter for the First Bank of the United States, whereupon Nathan Mayer Rothschild railed, &quot;Teach those impudent Americans a lesson! Bring them back to colonial status!&quot; Financed by the Rothschild controlled Bank of England, Britain then launched the war of 1812 to recolonize the United States and force them back into the slavery of the Bank of England, or to plunge the United States into so much debt they would be forced to accept a new private central bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another fake quote and completely wrong history. The United States started the War of 1812. Source: every single book about the war.</p>

<p>The parts about Jackson and the Second Bank are based on real historical
facts, but is not entirely accurate and parts are subject to
interpretation—for example, who was responsible for the economic
downturn, the Bank or Jackson? There&#39;s certainly no evidence that the
(attempted) assassin, Richard Lawrence, had anything to do with the
Bank. Jackson suspected that Senator George Poindexter had something to
do with it, but a Senate investigation found that Lawrence had acted
alone.</p>

<p>President Jackson, in fact, trusted the Rothschilds in France with the largest single financial transaction of his administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When the Confederacy seceded from the United States, the bankers once again saw the opportunity for a rich harvest of debt, and offered to fund Lincoln&#39;s efforts to bring the south back into the union, but at 30% interest. Lincoln remarked that he would not free the black man by enslaving the white man to the bankers and using his authority as President, issued a new government currency, the greenback. This was a direct threat to the wealth and power of the central bankers, who quickly responded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Greenback plan was created in Congress, not by presidential authority. Lincoln was an unenthusiastic supporter of the plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If this mischievous financial policy, which has its origin in North America, shall become endurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world. The brains, and wealth of all countries will go to North America. That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.&quot; -- The London Times responding to Lincoln&#39;s decision to issue government Greenbacks to finance the Civil War, rather than agree to private banker&#39;s loans at 30% interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most self-evidently fake quote of all. Why would anybody write that? It&#39;s really a hoax from the 1890s. The Grand Junction News <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ilFfAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=N1YNAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=731,2178763&amp;amp;q=glaringly+absurd">called this</a> &quot;one of the most glaringly absurd forgeries which has yet appeared in print, for it represents the Thunderer using the language of the most rabid type of wild-eyed Populists.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1872 New York bankers sent a letter to every bank in the United States, urging them to fund newspapers that opposed government-issued money (Lincoln&#39;s greenbacks).  &quot;Dear Sir: It is advisable to do all in your power to sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably fake. It was signed &quot;James Buell&quot; and <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9504EFD9143EE63BBC4B53DFBF668383669FDE">he called it a forgery</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Slavery is likely to be abolished by the war-power, and chattel slavery destroyed.  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is from the Hazard (or Hazzard) Circular. It was supposedly from 1862, but it is unknown before 1886, when a Populist politician in Kansas produced it and claimed he had found it in the archives of a local bank. It&#39;s almost certainly fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goaded by the private bankers, much of Europe supported the Confederacy against the Union, with the expectation that victory over Lincoln would mean the end of the Greenback. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Totally without evidence. It was the blocking of the cotton trade that was of greatest concern to Europe. The Rothschilds, by the way, supported the North and didn&#39;t allow Confederate bonds to be traded in Frankfurt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>France and Britain considered an outright attack on the United States to aid the confederacy, but were held at bay by Russia, which had just ended the serfdom system and had a state central bank similar to the system the United States had been founded on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s true that France once considered an intervention and Russia declined to participate, but Russia didn&#39;t take an active role opposing intervention, either. I&#39;ve never heard anything about a Russian state central bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Left free of European intervention, the Union won the war, and Lincoln announced his intention to go on issuing greenbacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln made no such announcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Following Lincoln&#39;s assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and the American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed at interest from the private bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quantity of Greenbacks in circulation was reduced slightly in the 1870s, but they were not removed from circulation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_notes">until 1971.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, in 1913, the Private Central Bankers of Europe, in particular the Rothschilds of Great Britain and the Warburgs of Germany, met with their American financial collaborators on Jekyll Island, Georgia to form a new banking cartel with the express purpose of forming the Third Bank of the United States, with the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meeting, which was in 1910, not 1913, included Paul Warburg, a
German banker who had moved to America in 1902, and was a leading
proponent of central banking in America. The other participants were
Americans, mostly bankers from J. P. Morgan and Rockefeller banks. The
meeting was organized by Senator Nelson Aldrich in his role as chairman
of the National Monetary Commission. There was no Rothschild or
representative of the Rothschilds at the meeting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Owing to hostility over the previous banks, the name was changed to &quot;The Federal Reserve&quot; system in order to grant the new bank a quasi-governmental image, but in fact it is a privately owned bank, no more &quot;Federal&quot; than Federal Express.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plan that came out of the Jekyll Island meeting was the <em>National</em> Reserve. The term &quot;Federal Reserve&quot; was created for the rival Democratic plan that was written in 1913.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve system includes 12 quasi-private corporations, but they aren&#39;t organized like any other private corporations. The Fed also includes a federal agency, which is part of the government. There are elments of both private and public control, but this claim is hyperbole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, in 2012, the Federal Reserve successfully rebuffed a Freedom of Information Lawsuit by Bloomberg News on the grounds that as a private banking corporation and not actually a part of the government, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to the operations of the Federal Reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lawsuit was several years earlier and <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/bloomberg_wins_its_lawsuit_aga.php">Bloomberg won</a>.</p>

<p>[Blather about 16th amendment skipped.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later that same year, and apparently unwilling to risk another questionable amendment, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act over Christmas holiday 1913, while members of Congress opposed to the measure were at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s Wikipedia on this claim: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After months of hearings, amendments, and debates the Federal Reserve Act passed Congress in December, 1913. The bill passed the House by an overwhelming majority of 298 to 60 on December 22, 1913[14] and passed the Senate the next day by a vote of 43 to 25.[15] An earlier version of the bill had passed the Senate 54 to 34,[16] but almost 30 senators had left for Christmas vacation by the time the final bill came to a vote. Most every Democrat was in support of and most Republicans were against it.[11]</p>

<p>But pass it Congress did, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it as he promised the bankers he would in exchange for generous campaign contributions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wilson ran on a platform of reforming the banking and monetary system. Most bankers were opposed to his plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wilson later regretted that decision.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; -- Woodrow Wilson 1919</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part,  &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.&quot; is totally made up. This quote is unknown before the 1950s, 30 years after Wilson died.</p>

<p>The rest,  &quot;A great industrial nation is now controlled ... &quot; is from his 1912 campaign speeches, <em>before</em> the Federal Reserve was created. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/">(Source)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if a video isn&#39;t actively blocked by Facebook, just about anything political (especially if it is countering government positions) is passively blocked by the News Feed algorithm.</p>

<p>Your algorithm determines what you see. Everyone else&#39;s algorithm determines what they see. It&#39;s nearly impossible to break through everyone&#39;s algorithms to reach a lot of people with a political post. Sometimes my own algorithm would remove my own political posts from my own news feed.</p>

<p>Instead, everyone gets the least controversial topics, which are the lowest common denominators: sports, Buzzfeed, selfies, pets, travel pictures, concerts, crazy nights at bars, etc.</p>

<p>Facebook wants you to believe that the world is full of smiling, happy people that are living a more fulfilled life than you. The truth is, your life is probably fine, and generally people who broadcast their entire lives to everyone else on Facebook are in dire need of emotional validation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think much about these issues.</p>

<p>In a recent Business Inside article about psychology &amp; success in life/business/whatever,  Conspiracy Believers combine Deep Pessimism w/ a Low Degree of Skepticism.</p>

<p>Ironic when you consider the use of disparaging terms like &quot;Sheeple&quot; used by these same conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The most successful people (of course) are highly optimistic w/ a high degree of skepticism.</p>
