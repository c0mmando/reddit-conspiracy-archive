       The only things people like
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       will ever see, are internet stories and youtube clips. Besides, it's not about exactly how much money they have, it's more about what level of control they have over how things are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say some small group of people was acting in a coordinated manner and they had a great deal of influence over the world's finances and international policy. Let's also say they were sincerely dedicated to making the world a better place for everybody, not just themselves. I'd be OK with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is when a small elite manipulates the world for their own benefits at the expense of the vast majority. That's the best definition of evil that you can think of. It would be Apartheid (but with money instead of race) on a planetary scale.

       You see, this is why I keep telling buddies of mine who are obsessed with following the Mars Rover that we really should shutdown the space program while we are controlled by the demonic fucks.  I would rather that human consciousness be wiped out than to allow the chance for these evil parasites to spread their influence not only to the solar system but beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately they've planned rather well for pretty much anything. I've heard they split their brood into groups that inhabit estates that are strategically places on opposite ends of the earth, for example one in China, one in the US, one in Alaska, one in Argentina. I even think they have a complex in Antarctica now, for fans of video games, if you played a Deus Ex the facility was eluded to by Hugh Darrow and his brave new world.  The game also includes the reference to the real life AI core they're working on in their polar estate in order to trigger a singularity and the spontaneous development of AI consciousness. The remote location guarantees that if the first singularity goes bad, the AI won't be able to spread its intelligence to the worldwide web and beyond, forming a Skynet.  But yeah, because they are always distributed across the globe, if a civilization ending event happens like a massive asteroid hitting the earth that instantaneously wipes out a massive section of the planet, the guys in the opposite side will have enough time to gather sex slaves necessary to keep bad genetic mutations at bay and escape into the massive underground bunkers they have built under or near each estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't count on global warming to wipe them out either, they've been planning for that for at least 100 years.  They've been spreading these ultra light metal reflective dust into the high atmosphere-what theorists call chemtrails--in order to stabilize the temperature.  If it wasn't for these efforts, the environment would've gone up by 10+ degrees already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still counting on a good old fashioned nuclear holocaust fueled by religious fanatics to just wipe us all out in one go, not giving them enough time to escape to their bunkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's better to just let intelligent life just evolve again--clearly the main reason humanity hasn't been directly communicated with by aliens is that they recognize the threat posed by revealing interplanetary space travel to such a ruling class

       Why the fuck do you think it's cooling down? They are filling up the atmosphere with tiny, extremely reflective, essentially dust particles that on the whole reflect a large amount of sunlight.

       LOL it makes me laugh whenever I read some theory about how the elite are spraying toxins in the air to control the population-no again they are filling up the atmosphere with these tiny reflective particles.

       Okay, no need to be rude. I literally didn't say anything about population control. Even you said that they are filling the atmosphere with particles, so what's to stop them from spraying poisons? How would you know? How would anyone actually know? Follow the money, dude.

       I'm no scientist and don't claim to be an expert on any of this, but I believe that the Earth has a way of sorting itself out, and no amount of human anything will change that. Say what you will, call me crazy, I don't care. We're all entitled to our own opinions and if you believe that National Geographic is telling you the truth, then by all means, stand by your belief.

       I apologize, I'm really sorry for being rude, I'm a bit testy over getting 7 downvotes for trying to get the truth out there on r/conspiracy-which should be the last place for censorship.  I admit that some of my details might be wrong or sound very extreme. However I truly believe that these guys circulate their various estates to make sure in the case of a civilization ending event they are able to continue their rule of Earth and I truly believe the Universe would be far better off without these scumfucks expanding into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I --do-- follow the money--the Rothschilds clearly want the world to be overpopulated, this benefits their rule in so many different ways.  Yes at some point, much, much further in the future they will likely claim the planet for themselves and wipe out all the slave classes, probably at that point everyone will be chipped and all it will require is a touch of a bottom.

       Maybe you're right. Who knows? That's too far into the future and quite frankly, we should be focused on what we can do now. At this moment. No matter how small, we can make a change. Think about it.. if every person on this planet made a change, then that would be 7 billion changes amounting to ultimately one big change. Maybe I'm just a wishful thinker, but I know that people will change one day. It's happening now. Look, we're here having a conversation on the subject right now. It is possible. Just need more people to think a little more.

       Totally agree about your point about aliens. There's no way humans could ever play nice with the other species. Some humans could, but as a race that tends to reward sociopathic and exploitative behavior, no.

       The earth has been cooling for ten years, al gore saod by now California would be underwater,  he just got done building a 9 million dollar mansion. He said the antarctic ice sheet would be gone by now. The ice sheet got thicker and gree bigger. The ozone has begun to repair it self. All of this is recent news within the past week. Global warming isna farce. Just to control us.

       I'm really surprised so many people here believe in Global Warming. The Earth has been taking care of itself for millions of years and even with our stupid technology and all of the pollution we cause, there's no way we have actually effected the global climate enough to melt the ice caps, come on...
      </p>
      <p>
       There's actually been multiple reports of the reverse now happening, and that the ice cap is increasing in size.

       Not at all. Global Warming is Al Gore's gift to the elite that are pulling the strings. One more way to try to completely control everything we do, and get us to pay to try to fix something that isn't broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if you look into a lot of the major benefit foundations and projects, all the money sent ends up being redistributed for other government crap.

       Yup. Obamas epa plan? Just to get more money from us. Smart meters? Track what what we do and give us less power when we use to much. Its all a lie. They say 97% of the scientific community agrees about global warming. The facts say its cooling, California and the Antarctic ice sheet are still there, al gore iust built a new mansion in a state where he said that would be gone by 2014. And the ozone is repairing itself. They can only measure it in October once a year.  The average is 8.7 million squar miles and it wad 8.1 million oast October. Cant wait to see what it is next month. Global warming is a lie to take our liberties.  In the 70s global cooling and communism and russia was the bad guy. Today its global warming, terrorists and IS and russia again. Its all fear mongering for control.

       the only thing you've mentioned that has "been in the news recently" is parts of global warming "reversing itself", like the ozone healing. none of your other babble has been, and never will be. whether you're right or not.

       Well since that family was one of the first ones to own a bank and supply governments with money. Id say the cumulative interest over the past 2/3 centuries combined with inflation can easily amount for that sort of cash.

       The Rothschilds were almost certainly the wealthiest non-royal family in the middle of the 19th century. Since then, there's been the rise of corporate banking, the income tax, the inheritance tax, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and the nationalization of the Bank of England. All their (continental) European assets were seized or destroyed during World War II, although they regained some of them afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The estimates of $500 trillion are more than all the wealth of everybody in the world combined. That kind of estimate is an obvious fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forbes magazine, which has the most experience in estimating wealth, currently ranks two Rothschilds among the world's richest people.
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/benjamin-de-rothschild/">
        Benjamin Rothschild
       </a>
       comes in at #1010 on the list. There's also a
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-rothschild/">
        Jeff Rothschild
       </a>
       at #1229, but I'm not even sure he's part of the Rothschild family. He made most of his money by having an actual job at Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       On previous lists, they had
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/nathaniel-rothschild/">
        Nathaniel Rothschild
       </a>
       , but he seems to have fallen off the list in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       The web site Celebrity Net Worth says
       <a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/how-rich-is-the-rothschild-family/">
        "As a modern day an empire, the family's total net worth and assets combined have been pegged in the $300 – $400 billion range."
       </a>
       , but they don't give a source for that.

       You have a static mound of cash, and when you get it, you're rich, but you decide to do nothing with it. Given inflation, everyone else's money becomes proportionally greater compared to your static mound. Your analogy isn't very good.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they receive interest on a proportionally large share of money, then as long as it beats the inflation rate they'll become wealthier than everyone else. Even if it doesn't beat inflation, as long as it grows faster relative to the entire supply of money then they'll remain rich.

       Inflation reduces the value money indeed. Resulting in larger piles of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation just means you need more money to have the same value.

       if you had $100 300 years ago it might be $1000 now (not sure how those rates apply specifically).

       There is a great documentary about the Rothschilds which is well worth a watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       They own the "banks" which are responsible for printing currency in 99% of the worlds countries and their "net worth" is immaterial, they own the ability to print any currency they want, trillions, quadrillions, whatever - its just trying to give it a name, its an infinite supply of money and yes its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are actually fascinating people and they were never wealthy to begin with, they worked their way in to aristocracy and created everything they have today through financing wars, manipulating stock markets and various other things. They are remarkable people.

        Here's a good read for you.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These things have been manipulated by those in power for centuries, this is nothing new, and it generally comes out in the end. The unfortunate thing is that realizing once it's too late won't matter, it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why we need to understand from history and how this has been an ongoing issue since America was founded and finally stand up against these private banks and move back to our nation controlling its own currency. (Edit: Since well before the founding of America, but that's as far back as we need to look in history to see the conspiracy and decide to act NOW instead of after it's too late.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's in the history book, our country flourished when it stopped borrowing from private banks. That's the whole reason they didn't want to resign the charter after both the First and Second banks of America, because they ruined the economy. Now the Federal Reserve is essentially the Third bank of America, privately owned, and funding the Fourth Reich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please wake up so we will all be able to stand together when the time comes, I'd really rather not be their debt slave under Martial Law and full implementation of their New World Order. It's bad enough being their debt slave as things are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Edit: Also,
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4">
        All Wars Are Bankers Wars
       </a>
       is a nice 45ish minute long video going over bits of history with relation to finances and how America's progress has really been inhibited by the manipulation of these banks.

       That's completely wrong. The stock of the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks is owned by all the member banks in their region. The member banks are required to own a specific amount of stock, which cannot be traded. There is no stock that is owned by private individuals or families.
      </p>
      <p>
       More stock entitles the member banks to a greater dividend, but not to more votes in controlling the bank. Each Federal Reserve Bank is controlled by a board of nine directors.
Regardless of how much stock they own, each member bank gets two votes, one for a class A director, and one for a class C director (who cannot be a banker). The big banks in each region pick two directors, the medium size banks pick two, and the small banks two. The remaining 3 directors are appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which is a federal agency. So, even if all the big banks in a region collude, they can only pick 2 out of 9 directors, and that's only for 1 out of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seven Governors of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President of the United States and approved the Senate.

       You should be asking for evidence from the people who claim that the Rothschilds own central banks. Any evidence at all. For even
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       central bank. There is no evidence. It is a completely fabricated story that starting circulating on the Internet a few years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the central banks in the world are owned by the national government of their country, including England, Canada, Russia, China, and many others. The stock of the Federal Reserve Banks is owned by all the member banks in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds were involved with the Bank of England in the 19th century and may have owned some portion of its stock up until it was nationalized in 1946.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some central banks, such as the Bank of Japan, have publicly traded stock, but the shareholders have no say in the how the bank is run.

       lol, I think you have misinterpreted what I meant by 'remarkable'. For any individual or group to be able to work their way in to higher society and ultimately assume control of something like the ability to print money is pretty remarkable in my books. You don't have to agree but you don't need to call me a shill for having that opinion. If I were a rothschild 'shill' (if that is even a thing) then you are saying i agree with overthrowing governments, financing both sides (or either side) of a war and creating debt enslavement. None of which are things i agree with. But whatever, you are entitled to your thoughts pal

       They can have all the money in the world but that doesn't mean a thing. What they have is the
       <em>
        illusion
       </em>
       of money infused into the lives of everyone in the world. Naturally, money has no meaning or real existence in the
       <em>
        natural world
       </em>
       but our belief in it makes it real. Why would this even be a theory? If they have trillions of dollars, why would they need to, of all things, LAUNDER their money? If anything we launder the money for them because they print it, we slave for it and spend it in a (in)finite cycle.

       Money is just a tool we have invented, it's not an "illusion". Yes, if everyone stopped willing value onto money then it would be meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's nothing special, the same could be said about maths. If my "2" was different to your "2" then maths wouldn't work either. It's really not an intrinsic problem for humanity to hold a unified belief in abstract things, infact, it's actually necessary sometimes.

       What got me thinking on money was one of the through the wormhole episodes.  I think it was "is reality real". They had a segment about money. It really got me thinking. Anything can have value if we place it on it. Alls its really is is to show you worked. Anything can be money if we put faith into something

       San Fran = L.  L = clarity of thought and the removal of the veils society puts up.  The illusion of money became extremely apparent.  I thought I might be able to pass the idea along. I don't think they understood - hence the crazy look.

       There are several groups of economic think tanks associated with various universities who claim that the American debt clock is not accurate showing $17 or $18 trillion. They claim the real US debt is closer to $100 trillion when one factors in old age security, various federal social programs and aggregate all of their debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the USA is $100 trillion in debt, how easy is it for the global debt to be at the $500 trillion mark?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how is their some cap on global debt when money is "created" out of thin air via fractional reserve banking and technology?

       Yes, it's true. But the average person will never see the evidence. These folks have the best lawyers and accountants on the planet. We're talking entire teams. And the lawyers and accountants will never reveal the truth because they cannot legally do so. And none would ever become a whistleblower. It's too lucrative, plus the threat of lawsuits.

       I have no doubt that their combined wealth is vast, but those sums are purely ridiculous.  The Gross World Product is around $75 trillion/year.  I'd be surprised if the combined family assets were 5 trillion, though that's still enough the annually buy pretty much every government on earth based on interest alone.

       I wish everybody would just pick a day -- say, Thanksgiving -- and swap all their fiat currency for doge, with the caveat that no Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans, or Soroses could own any. Leave them all with their worthless paper to trade among themselves.

       With 'Old Money' it's impossible to approximate net worth.  So much is tied up in trusts, umbrella corps., shell corps., schemes, non-profits, etc.  Even their accountants couldn't give you a firm figure.  Networks of influence are more important than money at that level.

       Is there really an amount you can place on all the worlds banking assets, in one account?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, I imagine it would be in the area of hundreds of trillions of dollars (or equatable currency).
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the own the banking processes, services, industry, and by proxy, anything and everything the banks own.
