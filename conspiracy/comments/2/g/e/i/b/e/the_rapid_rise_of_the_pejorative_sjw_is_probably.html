       I have no evidence of this whatsoever - but hey, it's r/conspiracy, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find the amazingly rapid spread of the "SJW" suspect - even if the thought police weren't behind its origin I'd be very surprised if they haven't had some hand in spreading it. It's perfect - people who use it can think "oh, I only mean the really annoying tumblristas who are parodies of themselves" but it's functionally a smear against any progressive who speaks up on the 'net - and the security state LOVES spreading pejoratives against the politically active (see the rise of the term "hippy"). Functionally, it also creates a barrier against internet kids becoming overtly political for fear of being labelled "SJW" - and the security state is always preoccupied with preventing youth radicalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I just imagine some commander of the Pentagon's or the IDF's Sock Puppet Army saying "hey, have you seen this SJW slang? It's great. Let's run with it- make it a priority-2 meme and let's see how far it can spread." I mean, why wouldn't they?

       I disagree, I think the rapid rise of the term SJW is because of the rapid rise of these "SJWs." With the rise of these people you'll get the rise of people who disagree with them. Like many other terms it was said by someone who didn't agree with the other side and the phrase caught on. Some people don't like regular weed smokers so they called them pot heads. Both sides of any argument like that has it's extremists which are usually douchebags.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really easy to come to terms with an idea that someone with higher power than you is just trying to fuck over your beliefs when in actuality people just disagree with your cause. Back to the weed metaphor, people call others SJWs when they only rant about their "causes" online. If they were out participating in rallies or whatever they wouldn't be SJWs. Potheads wanted to stop being punished for smoking weed so what did they do? They started rallies and petitions and voted. They didn't sit at home on their computers and complain about how the "shitlords" are making their lives worse until someone with power read their complaints. They got out there and made shit happen.

       Thanks for the well thought-out response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dislike ideologues and with-me-or-against-me all-or-nothing identity politics as much as anyone - I think they tend to hurt their causes more than help. That being said, I try to default to solidarity. Anyway, you'd be hard pressed to find a "rapid rise" of those types - if anything radical politics is on the downswing right now - maybe in certain corners of the internet is what you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the pitfall of the term is that being vocally political online doesn't equal being inactive offline. How can you tell? The person you're debating or who's ranting online could be running an infoshop, running for a political position, running food aid to refugees. This also seems to imply that if I state a political opinion online it's incumbent on me to provide my "credentials" - "I think rape on campus is a systematic problem and I work for a crises line so I'm not being an SJW so please don't flame me" - you see what I mean? You see the problem? Everyone who states a counter-narrational political opinion becomes SJW by default - especially if they can't write well enough or haven't organized their thoughts enough to not sound "whiny" or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking that all into account, I feel saying "SJW is just about wacko internet extremists" become pretty weasley - it's clearly not true, not in how it's used casually. SJW is straight up a pejorative, dismissive, troll term for leftists  - I think part of what bugs me is people really seem to have convinced themselves it isn't.

        SJWs are a symptom of post-modernism getting into politics. When you can deconstruct something to the point of meaninglessness, you can basically invent shit to get falsely outraged at.

       Internet 2.0, egos, and ever-shifting moral compass probably explain SJWs more than conspiracy.

       Ha good find. I just don't think that many people spend their time being "falsely outraged" - there's no lack of real shit to be outraged over out there - in that way "SJW" signifies a cartoon, an absurdist caricature, and it's used to dismiss out of hand entire arguments. Which is why I say it was probably encouraged by DARPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the opposite opinion of "political correctness" - injecting some ethics into language is not anything I have a problem with. To me "political correctness" is just a Reagan-era recruitment phrase used to build the Right's army of useful idiots.

       The weird thing is the political correctness I grew up with was so much more extreme than what we have now. I used to rail against it, then. Now, I'm pretty often shocked by the abuse you see being spewed at minorities and women. There is no such thing as "political correctness" now and it's a joke to see young men bitch about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a woman in her 30s, I feel like I grew up in a golden age. Despite obstacles and sexism, I made money for the people I worked for and was rewarded, and then left to start my own companies. Now, I see what other young women are going through and damn...what the hell happened. Our generation was not vigilant in holding the ceiling up. I blame my generation, actually. We didn't realize we had to hold the ceiling up, we just let it fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mother had it shitloads harder than I ever did and she excelled in amazing ways. When we get together and talk about it, we're both saddened as hell to see how much harder it is for young women in our industry--we always assumed it would get better and better--easier for me, easier for the next generation. But that's not how it's turning out at all.

       You see the glass ceiling descending; what you don't see (because PC propaganda is in your way) is the steel ceiling above it, that has housed the whole affair, descending. Pancaking is what they call it, no? But it's controlled demolition all the same; we're all just meat for the sacrifice, Molech doesn't care what sex.

       I look at how people I talk to every day treat me and others around me. It's degrading and degrading fast. We can blame the powers that be or we can take responsibility and at least act right ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's annoying, but I don't always mind the people "above" me that treat me worse due to my gender. They lose my money and business, and I learn who not to work with in the future. Better that I see their colors early.

       But there are people out there who aren't totally worthless bad eggs, but make bad choices due to following the crowd. I'm hoping they wake up so that we can all work together.

       I partially agree. What's important to recognize is that there are some stupid "SJW" out there. I'm sick of hearing about how all cis-gendered, white males are the devil. How many "SJW" think this? I don't know. However, you do raise a good point. The term "SJW" is starting to be used to demonize the entire left. I've noticed this the most during the #gamergate incident. People on /v/ acted like they were fighting against the left. That I find problematic.

       Probably very few. I know plenty of feminists, none who believe men are the devil. Did you hear about the young "men" creating Twitter accounts pretending to be women of color trying to sow discord among feminists?

       There are people out there who have a lot of time on their hands and have a lot of feelings of disenfranchisement and entitlement and act like car-hit dogs when it comes to biting out at anyone near them. I'm not sure if they also have budgets (I suspect they might, if even their wives' or mothers'), but they apparently have time and network access.

       This happened after WWII in the US, by the way. And after WWI in Germany. The only way to really solve it is to fix the unemployment crisis.

       The whole thing seems so perverse - why is the term such a pejorative? When I was growing up, fighting for justice was...well..heroic. Now, it's cause for slurring and abuse and rape and death threats.
