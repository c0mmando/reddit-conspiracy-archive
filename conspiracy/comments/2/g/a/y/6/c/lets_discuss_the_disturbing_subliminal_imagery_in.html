       The original is essentially gone from YouTube in both cases. Thumbnails show the video with the drapes positioned over his head, then the video inside is a different video with a higher angle where the drapes are not visible. The angle within these videos do not change over time, and I cannot fathom why the thumbnail is from a completely different video.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the 2013 Syria speech, I saw it live on television with the crown. The crown version is buried under at least 7 pages of an alternate angle and is only available in terrible quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these speeches were prerecorded. There is a feeling of heavy overproduction as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you are more open to suggestion when you are watching something perceived to be live and more interested in details when you are watching it freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does it mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the nay-sayers out there, remember how calculated absolutely everything is in our corporate-driven society. Especially visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have theories about the Cult of Subuh, Muhammad Subuh, and Obama's sun rising over the west campaign icon. That rabbit hole went down surprisingly far.

       "Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (born 1901 in Java, Indonesia; died 1987). As a young man Muhammad Subuh who received a series of intense experiences that he believed gave him contact with a spiritual energy from a higher power. By the 1930s, he believed that it was his task to transmit this energy - which he called latihan kejiwaan (Indonesian for "spiritual exercise") - to others, but that he was not to seek people out but simply to wait for those who asked for it.
In 1956, Pak Subuh, or "Bapak" as he was called by members of Subud (the word "Bapak" is Indonesian for male honorific, akin to Mr.), was invited to England by J. G. Bennett, where many Westerners joined Subud. He was then asked to go to other countries such as the United States and Australia. In this way, Subud spread rapidly around the world.
When he died in 1987 he left many talks on tape, video and in print, which Subud uses to guide the organization he founded."
      </p>
      <p>
       His divine experiences:
      </p>
      <p>
       -"The moment of his birth was auspicious. It coincided with the anniversary of the birth of the prophet Muhammad, and just after Bapak was born, forty cannon shots were fired from the palace at Surakarta, to announce the beginning of the anniversary celebrations."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Muhammad Subuh wrote in his autobiography that, about the year 1932, he had a visionary visit to the highest heaven, the "Seventh Heaven".
By his account, one night he felt drowsy and went to lay down in bed. Instead of falling asleep, he felt himself "lengthen, widen and expand into a sphere" and then entered a great space. He saw a group of stars far away and was told that it was the universe he had left behind. He then traveled at great speed through a great expanse and beyond were "mountain-like cones of light, seven of them, one stacked upon another". He described how he entered the cones of light one after another until he entered the seventh, the last. Then he returned to earth and saw what looked like stars in the sky but later realized they were the lights of Semarang, the hometown where he lived. He even tarried a little over the rooftop of his own house trying to lift up some roof tiles with his fingers but instead found himself inside his own room. It was about the time of Subuh or dawn.
In his description Muhammad Subuh implied the seventh cone of light represents the highest heaven. It is likely because of this description of his ascension that Muhammad Subuh insisted that his autobiography be published only after his death though it was completed much earlier" - Wiki
      </p>
      <p>
       -"In Ambarawa at the age of fifteen he had a strange and powerful experience. He was sleeping on the floor, when in the middle of the night, he saw a man approaching him. This tall older man dressed entirely in black leaned over Bapak and woke him up.
"I have to tell you something important," the man said. "Soon you will leave this place to go to work."
"You will work until you are 32 years old. But God will call you back when you are thirty-two. After that your name will become respected and revered by many people because of God's love for you." Then the man disappeared."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Out walking, he saw a bright ball of light like the sun which came down and entered his head, causing his whole body to shake. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and thought he was going to have a heart attack. He went home and lay on his bed and prepared to die. Instead, he began to pray, not from his own will, but as if moved by a power beyond himself. During the day, Muhammad Subuh continued his normal life. He was married, had children, and worked as a bookkeeper for the city of Semarang. Now began a period which Bapak always referred to as the "thousand nights" when spiritual experiences came to him every night for about three years.  A crucial characteristic of these experiences were that they were not sought for or desired, but came spontaneously. He was not propelled by his own will, but moved by something beyond himself. On one occasion, he found himself in front of wide ocean contained by a dyke with an irrigation canal with a lock. He felt himself pushed forward, the lock-gate opened and the whole ocean emptied his mouth. He belched and his belch smelled of sea water.
Once, in a vision, a man in Arabic costume approached him and opened up his chest with the point of a spear. It was very painful. The man withdrew a clot of blood from Bapak's chest on the point of the spear. He threw the clot away and then took a shining object about the size of a duck's egg, placed it in Bapak's chest and closed the wound with his hand. Then man then disappeared. Bapak's chest felt clear and wide - his inner feeling sensitive, clean and calm - his faith in the presence of God stronger.
On another occasion, a book - about the size of an atlas - fell into his lap. The book showed people of many races and nationalities praying, weeping and calling out to God for forgiveness. It was a foretelling of how the latihan would spread around the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Then in 1933 - when Bapak was 32 years old, the prediction that he would be "called back to Almighty God" that had been made when he was fifteen, came true. 
The experience began in this room around 9.30 in the evening. Bapak experienced himself being freed from the confines of this earth, like a jewel being released from its setting, and sped through the sky at unimaginable speed. 
Throughout this journey he maintained a clear awareness and an alive feeling and constantly uttered "Allah Hu-Akbar, Allah Hu-Akbar" "God is Almighty, God is Almighty".
He passed the moon and other planets. He reached the planet Jupiter and saw a world of immensity. The beings there were hundreds of miles high. He swept in an arc through space towards the sun, He saw that it was a tunnel through which he had to go.
He asked, "Won't my body be destroyed by going through the sun?"
At first he thought he would be destroyed, but then he saw his own body was made of radiant light. He was told, "You are made of the same substance as the sun you must go through." And he was able to pass unscathed through the sun. He found himself in a vast realm. He traveled across a huge expanse at great speed. Then he saw seven mountain-like cones of light stacked one above the other. He traveled up through the cones until in the seventh cone, he had no direction and no purpose other than to say, "Allah, Allah, Allah." Then he felt a key penetrate the palm of his hand. Then he was moved with extraordinary speed and suddenly found himself fin surroundings where he felt as though he had returned to normal.
As he entered the "sphere of the earth" he went more slowly. He saw his own form complete and ordinary as it had been before he began the journey. About 5 kilometres from the surface of the earth he stopped his journey. He saw lights below which he at first thought were stars but then understood to be the lights of Semarang. He re-entered his house and saw that a clock showed 4.25. He performed his morning prayer and then his mother came to him and told him of an experience she had the night before. She too had experienced being taken up into the air, then woken in the morning to a normal situation.
Perhaps this experience had been given to her as a witness or confirmation of what her son had received." -

       There was an eyewitness report that stated she died by 'dramatically letting go and falling into the ocean'. Being the only casualty, it seems possible.

       According to Kissner, “She was linked to Subud by her biographer (and New York Times reporter) Janny Scott (Harvard ’77) in the book A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama’s Mother,” reviewed by the New York Times here.” On page 116 of the book, Scott writes that Ann Dunham invited members of Subud to teach in the business-communications department she established in a private non-profit management-training school in Indonesia." -

       The symbolism of the sun in ancient religion ties into all of this. There are far too many atheists here for me to type all of my musings out. But if anyone is interested, let me know.

       Essentially he is, or they at least believe he is, Apollyon, the destroyer incarnated in the flesh. He would be the next Muhammad, Zoroaster, Jesus, Ra. But his role is purifying corruption with destruction, rather than offering the same message of love we have had for millennium. Humans did not have the ears to hear.

       He holds the key to the bottomless pit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "9 Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. 3 Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 4 They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. 6 In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men. 8 They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle. 10 They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power was to hurt men five months. 11 And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon." - Revelation 9
      </p>
      <p>
       Iron locusts, with the face of a man, whom strikes men. Drones?

       You have to realize, all of this prophecy is self-fulfilling. You may not be a religious fanatic, but your leaders are. And they are not christian or muslim.

       Elaborating on the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun and his twelve deciples. The twelve signs of the zodiac. Jesus is not the first demigod to have 12 deciples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prominent astrologists have pinpointed dates (2?) where all of the signs have been completely equal in all houses. One was around 2 AD, in the region of Jesus' birth. This makes Jesus a leo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun is not ra in egyptian mythology, it is a seperate god that exists with him. It is a disc, a female god. She has different forms, and she becomes a lion when she destroys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is a leo. I haven't looked deep into his natal chart, because to be honest my astrological knowledge is limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Subuh goes, let's look at the connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun enters his body
      </p>
      <p>
       He is implanted with an egg
      </p>
      <p>
       A key is shoved into his hand as he enters the sun
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun is a different realm of existence
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me reiterate, this does not all have to be true, people only need to believe it is true. These subliminals are further evidence this is what they are thinking. The balls this administration and the media has, purveying this as politics and entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all loose connections, but they are constantly evolving. I'll add citations when I get to a real computer.

       It's east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun rising represents newness and beginnings. The west represents descent and death. They want to capitalize on people's optimism and so a rising sun is more optimistic than a setting sun. "Hope and Change" is in line with a new dawn, a new beginning and a new day. The light is day. The dark is night. He and his handlers want to be associated, by the populace, with day, warmth and "hope."

       ok you had made the claim that it was the sun rising in the west, I was just trying to understand how that interpretation was made.

       I'm not sure that a person can be sure that compass west is what is being depicted in the logo.

       The differences of the second set of pictures you linked are just shot at different focal lengths, it magnifies the background differently.
       <br/>
       I can't think of a good example, but it's a technique used in movies, usually a close up shot of someone's face, and the background suddenly seems to get closer or farther away, yet the face remains unchanged, usually to go along with the character realizing something significant, or perhaps the onset of a drug trip.
       <br/>
       I couldn't find a good video that explains in, but here is a bad and boring video about it:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpJNOZpwts">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpJNOZpwts
       </a>
       <br/>
       If you go to 5:38 he shows a couple examples with shoes, and after that with a child posing, but the backgrounds are very fuzzy so it's harder to see the change in the background, though there is a change.

       What do you propose I do: not find things interesting? Should I discard my interest in the aesthetics of politics?

      <p>
       Are you aware that by dismantling unpopular interests, you would be dismantling a large and driving force within historical and contemporary academia? Tenure was established in the universities of the world to protect just this: academics tackling unpopular issues without the risk of losing their positions.

       "Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (born 1901 in Java, Indonesia; died 1987). As a young man Muhammad Subuh who received a series of intense experiences that he believed gave him contact with a spiritual energy from a higher power. By the 1930s, he believed that it was his task to transmit this energy - which he called latihan kejiwaan (Indonesian for "spiritual exercise") - to others, but that he was not to seek people out but simply to wait for those who asked for it.
In 1956, Pak Subuh, or "Bapak" as he was called by members of Subud (the word "Bapak" is Indonesian for male honorific, akin to Mr.), was invited to England by J. G. Bennett, where many Westerners joined Subud. He was then asked to go to other countries such as the United States and Australia. In this way, Subud spread rapidly around the world.
When he died in 1987 he left many talks on tape, video and in print, which Subud uses to guide the organization he founded."
      </p>
      <p>
       His divine experiences:
      </p>
      <p>
       -"The moment of his birth was auspicious. It coincided with the anniversary of the birth of the prophet Muhammad, and just after Bapak was born, forty cannon shots were fired from the palace at Surakarta, to announce the beginning of the anniversary celebrations."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Muhammad Subuh wrote in his autobiography that, about the year 1932, he had a visionary visit to the highest heaven, the "Seventh Heaven".
By his account, one night he felt drowsy and went to lay down in bed. Instead of falling asleep, he felt himself "lengthen, widen and expand into a sphere" and then entered a great space. He saw a group of stars far away and was told that it was the universe he had left behind. He then traveled at great speed through a great expanse and beyond were "mountain-like cones of light, seven of them, one stacked upon another". He described how he entered the cones of light one after another until he entered the seventh, the last. Then he returned to earth and saw what looked like stars in the sky but later realized they were the lights of Semarang, the hometown where he lived. He even tarried a little over the rooftop of his own house trying to lift up some roof tiles with his fingers but instead found himself inside his own room. It was about the time of Subuh or dawn.
In his description Muhammad Subuh implied the seventh cone of light represents the highest heaven. It is likely because of this description of his ascension that Muhammad Subuh insisted that his autobiography be published only after his death though it was completed much earlier" - Wiki
      </p>
      <p>
       -"In Ambarawa at the age of fifteen he had a strange and powerful experience. He was sleeping on the floor, when in the middle of the night, he saw a man approaching him. This tall older man dressed entirely in black leaned over Bapak and woke him up.
"I have to tell you something important," the man said. "Soon you will leave this place to go to work."
"You will work until you are 32 years old. But God will call you back when you are thirty-two. After that your name will become respected and revered by many people because of God's love for you." Then the man disappeared."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Out walking, he saw a bright ball of light like the sun which came down and entered his head, causing his whole body to shake. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and thought he was going to have a heart attack. He went home and lay on his bed and prepared to die. Instead, he began to pray, not from his own will, but as if moved by a power beyond himself. During the day, Muhammad Subuh continued his normal life. He was married, had children, and worked as a bookkeeper for the city of Semarang. Now began a period which Bapak always referred to as the "thousand nights" when spiritual experiences came to him every night for about three years.  A crucial characteristic of these experiences were that they were not sought for or desired, but came spontaneously. He was not propelled by his own will, but moved by something beyond himself. On one occasion, he found himself in front of wide ocean contained by a dyke with an irrigation canal with a lock. He felt himself pushed forward, the lock-gate opened and the whole ocean emptied his mouth. He belched and his belch smelled of sea water.
Once, in a vision, a man in Arabic costume approached him and opened up his chest with the point of a spear. It was very painful. The man withdrew a clot of blood from Bapak's chest on the point of the spear. He threw the clot away and then took a shining object about the size of a duck's egg, placed it in Bapak's chest and closed the wound with his hand. Then man then disappeared. Bapak's chest felt clear and wide - his inner feeling sensitive, clean and calm - his faith in the presence of God stronger.
On another occasion, a book - about the size of an atlas - fell into his lap. The book showed people of many races and nationalities praying, weeping and calling out to God for forgiveness. It was a foretelling of how the latihan would spread around the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Then in 1933 - when Bapak was 32 years old, the prediction that he would be "called back to Almighty God" that had been made when he was fifteen, came true. 
The experience began in this room around 9.30 in the evening. Bapak experienced himself being freed from the confines of this earth, like a jewel being released from its setting, and sped through the sky at unimaginable speed. 
Throughout this journey he maintained a clear awareness and an alive feeling and constantly uttered "Allah Hu-Akbar, Allah Hu-Akbar" "God is Almighty, God is Almighty".
He passed the moon and other planets. He reached the planet Jupiter and saw a world of immensity. The beings there were hundreds of miles high. He swept in an arc through space towards the sun, He saw that it was a tunnel through which he had to go.
He asked, "Won't my body be destroyed by going through the sun?"
At first he thought he would be destroyed, but then he saw his own body was made of radiant light. He was told, "You are made of the same substance as the sun you must go through." And he was able to pass unscathed through the sun. He found himself in a vast realm. He traveled across a huge expanse at great speed. Then he saw seven mountain-like cones of light stacked one above the other. He traveled up through the cones until in the seventh cone, he had no direction and no purpose other than to say, "Allah, Allah, Allah." Then he felt a key penetrate the palm of his hand. Then he was moved with extraordinary speed and suddenly found himself fin surroundings where he felt as though he had returned to normal.
As he entered the "sphere of the earth" he went more slowly. He saw his own form complete and ordinary as it had been before he began the journey. About 5 kilometres from the surface of the earth he stopped his journey. He saw lights below which he at first thought were stars but then understood to be the lights of Semarang. He re-entered his house and saw that a clock showed 4.25. He performed his morning prayer and then his mother came to him and told him of an experience she had the night before. She too had experienced being taken up into the air, then woken in the morning to a normal situation.
Perhaps this experience had been given to her as a witness or confirmation of what her son had received." -

       There was an eyewitness report that stated she died by 'dramatically letting go and falling into the ocean'. Being the only casualty, it seems possible.

       According to Kissner, “She was linked to Subud by her biographer (and New York Times reporter) Janny Scott (Harvard ’77) in the book A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama’s Mother,” reviewed by the New York Times here.” On page 116 of the book, Scott writes that Ann Dunham invited members of Subud to teach in the business-communications department she established in a private non-profit management-training school in Indonesia." -

       The symbolism of the sun in ancient religion ties into all of this. There are far too many atheists here for me to type all of my musings out. But if anyone is interested, let me know.

       Essentially he is, or they at least believe he is, Apollyon, the destroyer incarnated in the flesh. He would be the next Muhammad, Zoroaster, Jesus, Ra. But his role is purifying corruption with destruction, rather than offering the same message of love we have had for millennium. Humans did not have the ears to hear.

       He holds the key to the bottomless pit.

       "9 Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. 3 Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 4 They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. 6 In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.

       7 The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men. 8 They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle. 10 They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power was to hurt men five months. 11 And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon." - Revelation 9

       Iron locusts, with the face of a man, whom strikes men. Drones?

       You have to realize, all of this prophecy is self-fulfilling. You may not be a religious fanatic, but your leaders are. And they are not christian or muslim.
