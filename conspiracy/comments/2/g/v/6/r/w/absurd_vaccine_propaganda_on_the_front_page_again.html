       "Pay for comments" is not against the law. Surprisingly, even reddit TOS does not prohibit such actions. Me thinks its a fairly reasonable explanation for the level of vaccine enthusiasm on reddit.

        "WARNING: This review includes 15 out of 36 trials funded by industry (four had no funding declaration). An earlier systematic review of 274 influenza vaccine studies published up to 2007 found industry funded studies were published in more prestigious journals and cited more than other studies independently from methodological quality and size. Studies funded from public sources were significantly less likely to report conclusions favorable to the vaccines. The review showed that reliable evidence on influenza vaccines is thin but there is evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions and spurious notoriety of the studies. The content and conclusions of this review should be interpreted in light of this finding."

       You've missed the most important parts of the study, they are telling you that this is corporate science, not real science.  At best the flu vaccine is not more beneficial than a sugar pill placebo which is a lot cheaper and safer.  Vaccines are known to induce autoimmune diseases, this is the real reason the pharmaceuticals push them so hard; they want to increase their size of their drug sale market.

       If you pump tons of
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       into someone, something bad will happen.  This does not even come close to proving that regular vaccinations cause autoimmune.  This proves that if you repeatedly inject a subject with an antigen
       <em>
        far beyond
       </em>
       the subjects steady-state,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       they will develop autoimmune.

       <p>
        Dr. Weil, pg. 24: "There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem." .... "the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”

        Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: "we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes."

       <p>
        Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: "Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: "So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information."
       </p>

        Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: "This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... "I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on."
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Weil, pg. 207: "The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.

       America is the only country that goes out it's way to promote these flu vaccines. It's a total sham and totally unnecesary. Doctors and Nurses are actually forced to take them and they bend over and take it since the Bureaocrats control the medical system. If they object in many cases they are fired.

       It's scary to think that so many people in the US actually are actually naive enough to think that their government actually cares about them not catching the Flu and about 'protecting' their teeth with toxic Fluoride in the drinking water.  It must be a nice feeling having such a world view, even after the vaccines have induced lifelong autoimmune diseases these people are still thinking how lucky they are to have pharma providing them expensive treatments, completely oblivious that they were targeted, harmed and now being medically taxed by Big Pharma.

       When you can give someone a disease and their response is to thank you and to pay you a percentage of their earnings for the rest of their life to help cope with the disease...congratulations! You've got yourself a golden goose! Of course the global elite is behind dangerous vaccines and the propaganda machine that defends the vaccines. Humans are fickle and will believe what you tell them as long as you APPEAR to be on their side. CDC, WHO, CIA, FBI, CFR, ADL, etc are just arms of the elite machine wearing masks that fool the majority of humans. The game is just too easy for the elite at this point.

       "According to the National Vital Statistics System in the U.S., for example, annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year -- fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743). The story is similar in Canada, where unlikely killers likewise dwarf Statistics Canada's count of flu deaths."

       I love those comments like "Even if you never really get the flu or are affected by it, you could pass it on to a child who could DIE from it! Think of the children!!!" and "I get one every year, never get the flu :D"... Me personally, I've NEVER had one, and I've had a minor case of the flu maybe ONE time in the past decade, and it was for about 2 days. That's the purpose of staying in good health and keeping a strong immune system, I don't need to be injected with a virus to save me from a virus, the logic in thinking it's necessary is absurd.

       I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed."

        "WARNING: This review includes 15 out of 36 trials funded by industry (four had no funding declaration). An earlier systematic review of 274 influenza vaccine studies published up to 2007 found industry funded studies were published in more prestigious journals and cited more than other studies independently from methodological quality and size. Studies funded from public sources were significantly less likely to report conclusions favorable to the vaccines. The review showed that reliable evidence on influenza vaccines is thin but there is evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions and spurious notoriety of the studies. The content and conclusions of this review should be interpreted in light of this finding."

       I like it when they waste time with their Flu vaccine propaganda, as a large % of people have already worked out that the Flu Vaccine is a total scam, so this discredits the CDC even more.  The reason they focus on the Flu jab is because they can sell it to you every year.  It's mid-September now, all very convenient that their obviously fake study appears in time for the big sales push.

       Even the doctors are embarrassed at having to offer this to you, they pretty much apologise at having to mention it.

       It's that sort of "scientific orthodoxy" that makes me suspicious; when you're not allowed to ask certain questions because they're unpopular or people associate face value to an idea without critical thought. The scientific method is meant to inspire skepticism. Medical ethicicy and big business are two things that don't seem to run well together, so long as the propensity of businesses to make a profit above all else exists.

       There is nothing wrong with the scientific concept of vaccination, it's the actualization that is the problem. Insuring a "pure" vaccine that isn't accidentally contaminated is difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purposful "contamination" of vaccines with mercury-containing preservatives such as Thimerosal and "adjuncts" such as squalene are what turn vaccines from a "good in principle" medical treatment to a "risky at best" medical treatment.

       Out of those 100 kids how many of them were already sick with something else other than the flu? How many were already in a hospital or had some sort of immuno-deficiency problems? And finally and most importantly...the flu vaccine is not any guarantee of not getting the flu! It says so on the inserts! People get the jab all the time and then get sick despite the flu shot! The logic is astounding...cognitive dissonance hard at work! Thanks for this post.

       I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed."
