<li><p>The MSM effectively controls the conversation and dictates public opinion. They steer discourse to gossip, debauchery, and mob mentality.</p></li>
<li><p>Young men and woman treat each other as disposable Chattel.</p></li>
<li><p>Parents defer child rearing responsibility to the state, MSM, and a directionless society.</p></li>
<li><p>Vital services such as effective government, education, food and healthcare have been bastardized through financial manipulation and greed.</p></li>
<li><p>Religious institutions go at extreme lengths to harbor sexual predators and cater their message/platform to acquire excessive wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>Satisfying personal pleasure and impulses, through entertainment and hollow experiences, is viewed as more critical than developing discipline, expanding the mind, and deepening the soul.</p></li>
<li><p>Men, woman, and families would rather share a virtual relationship, than calling each other to say hello or sending a simple birthday card.</p></li>
<li><p>Governments steal blood and treasure to pursue endless wars and conquests to protect faceless private interests.</p></li>
<li><p>Banks have legalized the printing press and regularly kill leaders of countries who stand in their way.</p></li>
<li><p>Mental health professionals are modern day witches and wizards, in that they regularly abuse their power with the oversell of mind-alternating drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporations have taken advantage of their freedom to form unbreakable monopolies, colluded with governments to finance their corporate expansion, and devalued the worth of their customers into consuming livestock.</p></li>
<li><p>The local Police force, originally designed to serve and protect our communities, and a group most people use to hold to the highest regard..now actively recruit people of the lowest IQ denominator, enforce laws designed to control and manipulate behavior through terrorizing methods, and are servicemen for a for-profit jail system that has resulted in the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>History, a theoretical accurate record of time, that allows all men an opportunity to improve and to learn from past mistakes, has been successfully re-written by the criminals of war, financial engineers, shadow government agents, and corporations. Their goal is to diffuse the human spirit of an anxious public, to confuse and misdirect opposition, and to reshape society for the sole purpose to increase profits and control.</p></li>
<li><p>The Family Unit, by simple definition, is a group of people that work together to achieve grander goals impossible to achieve through individual means, is the absolute greatest threat to the imperialists of human capital and the last remaining power that serfs have over their slave masters. The Family Unit is being destroyed by controlled demolition from within. Selfishness and ego are now the conscious foundations to making decision; Materialism has been instilled as a basic need of modern-day children; Chains of economic slavery and debt has prevented family prosperity, increased state dependence, and eliminated voting power; The cherished Family Unit is now disposable and unworthy of sacrifice at the moment of discomfort; Grown men have been trained to behave like teenagers, grown woman have been trained to worship fickle emotion, and the procreation of children is now the successful completion of a commercial product, rather than the representation of steadfast devotion by the two leaders of the household.</p></li>
<li><p>Strength is now measured through conquest over the weak, rather than bravery to evil; Success is now defined by the opinion of others rather than the belief in oneself; and Hope is now looking upward from the bottom of a crater, rather than from the top of a mountain.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The body of humanity is full of tumours and parasites as every cell is acting for its own benefit, thirsty cells that keep mutating and growing at the expense of others. The immune system is crippled because we are distracted by education, entertainment, politics and religion, and humanity as a whole is devolving into a state of tribalism, which is exactly what happened to the barbarian tribes of the present which are the leftovers of past once-great lineages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is sick for a person to ask all the question and never respond to a thread they create. Look at what you did. First off you are no better then main stream media. You ask all these loaded questions. Then you fuck off for another month or so.</p>

<p>Of course everyone in here will agree with what you say. There is a mob mentality in here of hate and distain. People always requesting proof and mocking those that wont join them. I have no doubt I will receive -21 comment score for even speaking my mind. </p>

<p>I also fail too see hardly any conspiracy threads in here anymore. It is all bullshit political stories about Obama and isis. The mods actively join in this mentality.  What happened to the days of discussion in this thread. A little over a year ago it used to be like that. </p>

<p>Now you have nothing but dismal posts of how fucked up everything is. I am not saying it should be rainbows and unicorn farts with glitter and sprinkles on every post. The others on reddit that want to detour the conversations are just as bad thou. </p>

<p>The mentality of this whole sub has shifted to a lone wolf mentality.  Not about being a community at all. Its all about how bad can you make ths world seem in a post? Then as soon as you do log off and watch your karma score go up. </p>

<p>Come on everyone is the world bad sure it is. Are you gonna help your own mind by bitching about it on here and agreeing with someone else. Nope you wont. </p>

<p>Get active in your community and find a way to reach people. Its what I did. Wife and I also have fun doing it. As you can tell from my username we like lego. We made a group for kids at a local library so that they can free their minds of the constraints put on them by poverty and school. </p>

<p>You have a 50/50 shot of reaching parents. Plus it wont do much if you actually manage it either. With children its easier look at tv they did it very easily with games and programs. You have to show kids they can excel at creativity. Plus remember when we are all older and in assisted living they will be running things.</p>

<p>Think about it. Dont be like the rest of the hateful people out there. Try and stay positive. You will be glad you did.</p>

<p>Best we can do as parents is instil the right values and morals in our kids. It may seem like a shitty place to raise a kid, but it isnt. We came out ok right? </p>

<p>There&#39;s staying positive, and there&#39;s hiding your head in the sand. Too many people are drinking the socialist Marxist Kool-Aid. If by staying positive you mean buying into the fantasy that the liberals peddle in their controlled media, then it won&#39;t do any good. It only makes you part of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have some valid ones in there, but many of them I disagree with. </p>

<p>I mean I used to think this way, until I stopped watching T.V. years ago.  </p>

<p>That seems counter intuitive, since I still see the same stories on the web, but I honestly think that the brain processes the information differently from T.V. to print.  </p>

<p>Take #3 and #14 for instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents defer child rearing responsibility to the state, MSM, and a directionless society.</p>

<p>The Family Unit is being destroyed by controlled demolition from within</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see or believe that.  I know many parents from all walks of life.  The one thing that they all have in common, is that they would die for their children.  </p>

<p>T.V. shows (sitcoms in particular) would have you believe that parents view their children with the vague detachment that one bad actor shows towards another bad actor, but it&#39;s pretty fucking far from real life.  </p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s programming designed to foster the belief that we are all alone in our values. </p>

<p>I see this all of the time.  But I love my shrink.  I feel like I was born a hundred years too late.  She helps me cultivate the social and life skills that I need to navigate a world that I really don&#39;t understand.  Going to see her every couple of months is like taking a huge satisfying dump, from my brain.</p>

<p>The local Police force, originally designed to serve and protect our communities, and a group most people use to hold to the highest regard..now actively recruit people of the lowest IQ denominator, enforce laws designed to control and manipulate behavior through terrorizing methods, and are servicemen for a for-profit jail system that has resulted in the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world.</p>

<p>I see fucked up shit about cops all of the time.  I always root for the bad guys in movies.  But my local cops are cool as shit.  Mind you I live in Alaska, so it is really in the best interest of cops to be cool, but still...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Young men and women treat each other as disposable Chattel.</p>

<p>Again, I see this as T.V. programming to make people feel disgusted with society and therefore isolated from their community.</p>

<p>I could go on with this novel for days, but it all leads to the same conclusion IMO.  T.V. has created a culture of fear and distrust among people.  Cutting the cord has to be step 1, if the revolution is going to move forward.</p>

<p>The core values of our society that are promoted and ingrained into the consciousness of our people from a young age are polar opposite of the values we need to have for our civilization to flourish, grow and be successful. </p>

<p>It sounds like from what I have read below (and what you posted above of course) that you woke up in the middle of the night and had a real moment of inspired clarity. Props to you for getting it put into words for us. I really enjoyed reading your post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Western society has been made sick by its ruling class, its intellectual class, and its media. Most of those who have poisoned Western culture have been Jews. Wealthy Jews. Intellectual Jews. Media Jews. They are not solely responsible for the sickness in Western society, but they are mainly responsible.</p>

<p>They have ceaselessly attacked white Christian culture on every front for decades, attempting to degrade it, pervert it, ridicule it, and defile it. Over time they have largely succeeded in their attack.</p>

<p>One of they main weapons has been pornography. Another has been their intellectual assault on Christianity. Another has been the perversion of Western art. Another front in their attack has been the pseudo-science of psychology and psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Attack, attack, attack, over decades. We see the result of their ceaseless attacks today -- a sick society.</p>

<p>You actively look for these connections so of course you see them, you stereotype an entire people for no reason other than to have a scapegoat. Your worldview makes you feel comfortable because you have a well defined boogey man, you literally can not handle the complexity of the world around you so you simplify it using bullshit methods. </p>
