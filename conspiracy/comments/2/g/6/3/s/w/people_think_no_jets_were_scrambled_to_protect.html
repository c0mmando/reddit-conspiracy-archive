<p>Another quote &quot;Seriously, before 9/11 you would be laughed out of a room to suggest keeping fighters on alert to stop terror attacks. Hindsight is 20/20.&quot;</p>

<p>Is there any hope or are we doomed to live in the perpetual War on Terror nightmare because of such morons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that&#39;s incredibly depressing. I get that these are probably young people that weren&#39;t paying attention 13 years ago, but, I don&#39;t know. Ask someone? Read a book?</p>

<p>Oh wait, I just read the article: </p>

<p>|<em>As remarkable as it seems now, there were no armed aircraft standing by and no system in place to scramble them over Washington.</em></p>

<p>|“There was no perceived threat at the time, especially one coming from the homeland like that,” says Col. George Degnon, vice commander of the 113th Wing at Andrews. “It was a little bit of a helpless feeling, but we did everything humanly possible to get the aircraft armed and in the air. It was amazing to see people react.”</p>

<p>|Things are different today, ­Degnon says. At least two “hot-cocked” planes are ready at all times, their pilots never more than yards from the cockpit.&quot;</p>

<p>These are lies. This is patently untrue, I mean, are you fucking kidding me with &quot;As remarkable as it seems now, there were no armed aircraft standing by and no system in place to scramble them over Washington.&quot; Did they just make up all those times they scrambled jets over personal aircraft over DC before 2001? </p>

<p>So you are left with two things, one is a response to your post: These people in TIL appear to be idiots, I agree--but they&#39;re just repeating what they&#39;ve been told by the Washington Post. If they didn&#39;t live through that time, or know people involved, the current newspaper is a good source. Why would the Washington Post make something like that up? Why would a General?</p>

<p>Which leaves me to #2: Why would the Washington Post make something like this up? Why would a Colonel at Andrews? Jets are always available to scramble (and two F-16s were reported to be flanking Flight 93 closely at the time). Why are they trotting out a feel-good story about a pilot who could have been the one to shoot down flight 93 now, 10* years later? While a Navy SEAL talking shop publicly and publishing books isn&#39;t a white whale, you sure don&#39;t see fighter pilots (or any USAF, from my perception) in the press very often.</p>

<p>*Realized this article was from 2011. Thought it was from today because it&#39;s been in all my feeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the word &quot;sheeple&quot; but the amount of &quot;everything changed on 9/11&quot; and &quot;that was a pre-9/11 world&quot; is depressing.  Our response to attacks didn&#39;t change for dick, only our treatment of citizens.</p>

<p>The 9/11 Stand Down in 2 Minutes...</p>

<p>NORAD, responsible for intercepting errant aircraft over the U.S., has a standard operating procedure for scrambling planes for interception which takes less than 15 minutes</p>

<p>They did this successfully (on time) 129 times in 2000 and 67 times between September 2000 and June 2001.</p>

<p>Yet, on September 11th, they failed to do their job 4 times in a single day:</p>

<pre><code> * NORAD, once notified of the off-course aircraft, failed to scramble jets from the nearest bases
 * Once airborne, interceptors failed to reach their targets because they flew at small fractions of their top speeds
 * Fighters that were airborne and within interception range of the deviating aircraft were not redeployed to pursue them
</code></pre>

<p>You might think that the military couldn&#39;t find the hijacked planes because the hijackers turned off the transponders. However, a former air traffic controller, who knows the flight corridor which the two planes which hit the Twin Towers flew &quot;like the back of my hand&quot; and who handled two actual hijackings says that planes can be tracked on radar even when their transponders are turned off (also, listen to this interview).</p>

<p>As a former senior air force colonel said:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;If our government had merely done nothing, and I say that as an old interceptor pilot—I know the drill, I know what it takes, I know how long it takes, I know what the procedures are, I know what they were, and I know what they’ve changed them to—if our government had merely done nothing, and allowed normal procedures to happen on that morning of 9/11, the Twin Towers would still be standing and thousands of dead Americans would still be alive. That is treason!&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Norad&#39;s stand down on 9/11 was so blatant that Norad has been forced to give 3 entirely different versions of what happened that day[/i], as each previous version has been exposed as false. When someone repeatedly changes his testimony after being caught in lies, how believable is he? The falsity of Norad&#39;s explanations were so severe that even the 9/11 Commission considered recommending criminal charges for the making of false statements.</p>

<p>In addition, Dick Cheney monitored flight 77 for many miles as it approached the Pentagon -- one of the most heavily-defended buildings in the world -- and yet ordered that the airplane not be intercepted (confirmed here). Given that Cheney was in charge of all of the war games and coordinated the government&#39;s &quot;response&quot; to the attacks on 9/11 -- apparently including Norad (see this Department of State announcement, this CNN article, and this essay) -- Cheney&#39;s orders regarding flight 77 seem to be part and parcel of the Norad stand down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who was working on the flight line at Langley that day. He claimed several planes were dispatched that morning. He also claimed they were loaded with ordinance and came back with none. Off topic - but my belief is they shot down flight 93 which makes the hero movie that much more sickening</p>

<p>Hope that made sense</p>
