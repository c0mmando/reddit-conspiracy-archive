If the govt had no compunction about killing 3,000 Americans and millions of Iraqis in this attack, as well as shredding the constitution, then why do you think they would let little old you walk around disseminating these so called &quot;truths&quot; on a platform where dozens or hundreds of people might read it?  Wouldn&#39;t they just send a micro drone to give you a heart attack causing &quot;bee sting&quot;,hack your cars on board computer and have you fly off the side of the road, or set you up in a honeypot scandal that then destroys your life with your wife and kids.  Knowing most conspiracy types, the ideas I just suggested are only the tip of the iceberg of how they could silence your voice of &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>No, Occam&#39;s razor--the most likely explanation is that having these theories out there distract people from what they could be doing like stacking townhall meetings, closely following local efforts to redistrict things so that the Republicans always win even with only 25% support, and organizing people to vote in the next election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really annoys me now, as opposed to say roughly 5 years ago when I first felt differently about the events of 9/11, there is SO much evidence around now from people that truly are qualified to say the official story is bullshit, yet people still just believe what mainstream media tells them. No wants to know they&#39;ve been believing a lie for 13 years, I guess I can understand that. Especially when your whole country or even the world has sacrificed so much because of that lie.</p>

And for it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s your opinion of &quot;grand conspiracies.&quot; They don&#39;t have to be really all that complicated. If a group of people from multiple Middle East nations can operate in full observation of our CIA (we have lots of evidence that the CIA was monitoring guys like Atta, Moussaoui, and others in the Hamburg Cell of Al-Qaeda), send money all around the world using electronic wires that were fully visible to our spy agencies, successfully enter the United States, enroll in universities, attend flight lessons, meet with people who would later be be-headed in Iraq, actively plan, train, and execute their attack, all with the complete failure of all security (airport, flight control, USAF, etc. etc.), why couldn&#39;t those people have purposefully been manipulated into accomplishing that attack? What&#39;s really so crazy about believing that the leaders of the United States allowed it to occur in order to further political ideals, control resources, manipulate the public, and ultimately gain financially? I mean....really? </p>

<p>And for the record, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUid6oBXXP0">someone brutally murdered Terrance Yeakey</a>. Someone I was personally close to was monitored in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s under COINTELPRO. He filed multiple FOIA&#39;s about 9/11, particularly the connection to the University of Oklahoma and the Murrah Bombing. He&#39;s dead now. Not saying it was foul-play, but OP....maybe people who know stuff or ask too many question DO actually get disappeared. </p>

<p>Do you have any proof that people who have credible information against the government aren&#39;t killed/arrested/black-bagged/indefinitely detained? I mean, it would be crazy if we had a system of laws set up to give our executive government the sole power to kill, detain, and torture any single person in the world, all without a trial, all without charges of committing a crime. It would be <em>even crazier</em> if we had a system of black-site prisons set up, ran by our military, that we could house these &quot;enemy combatants&quot; while we torture, force-feed, maim, rape, and destroy their very will to live. </p>

<p>And it would be <em>crazier still</em> if people did not question the very real possibility that one day, if you realize whatever truth you seek and desire to fight those who oppose the masses, you might end up in one of these camps. But wait....that all exists, doesn&#39;t it? Sounds like a fucking conspiracy....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh here we go. Jesus is there anything bad that happens in America that conspiracy theorists --don&#39;t- blame on the spooks or the federal govt? Now you&#39;re claiming not only was the Oklahoma City bomb done by the federal govt but also it&#39;s connected to 9/11.  Please elaborate, I really wish to understand how you pull of such a stunt in terms of creative detective work.</p>

<p>Just what would the federal govt have to gain by bombing and killing 100s of people on OK? It makes no sense, if they were planning a false flag it would&#39;ve been somewhere in rural New England where it would&#39;ve caused paranoia in the real rich, wealthy class of people that control this nation (if you don&#39;t believe that New England basically controls the US, then I truly find it odd how many other conclusions you come to)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never made any connection to the US federal gov&#39;t performing the Murrah Bombing or 9/11. However, the connections between the Murrah Bombing, the WTC &#39;93 Bombings, and 9/11 are a fact. Just because there is doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t a bunch of pissed off Muslims. It even would give you more &quot;proof&quot; to think so, because Ramzi Yousef is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. If you don&#39;t think Terry Nichols meeting with the nephew of Kahlid Sheikh Mohammed is a connection from the Murrah Bombing to 9/11, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, most people who assume they know something about &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; actually have no real understanding of what they even believe. </p>

<p>Conspiracy doesn&#39;t tend to give answers, it only asks more questions. We don&#39;t know the answers because people are collectively hiding and suppressing information. We may NEVER see the videos of Tim McVeigh and John Doe #2 getting out of the Ryder Truck. We may NEVER see the videos of the actual explosions. That information exists. The public may never witness it. That alone is, by definition, a conspiracy. </p>

<p>So when the information exists to end all debate, yet it is purposefully hidden from ALL public, and any willingness to share such secrets are imprisonment or death, you kinda are just stuck to try and connect the dots yourself. That&#39;s why I believe so many &quot;conspiracies&quot; get so drawn out into various branches. </p>

<p>The point is, we don&#39;t fucking know the truth. But we damn sure know the truth we&#39;ve been told to believe is full of shit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s obviously because there ---weren&#39;t--- any videos. Obviously in such a terrible disaster the government would&#39;ve released a video of it -if- it existed in the first place. You guys go straight from non-existence to shady plots when the most obvious reason why there wasn&#39;t a video released because there --were--no videos of the disaster LOL.  What would the govt gain by covering up the videos? It would ONLY do so if the videos had vital national security data on it, for example if Osama bin Laden appeared in the videos carrying out the attack with McVeigh.  Except the chances of this being true are next to nothing, it&#39;s far,far,far,far more likely that there just wasn&#39;t any videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets answer your question in a way that relates to what you think or feel are &#39;conspiracies&#39; as a whole as this applies to pretty much any and every topic that is discussed openly here which reveals truths that we wouldn&#39;t otherwise see.</p>

<p>First off though,</p>

<p>What are you actually saying here? - because we have the ability to converse about said topics in various forums that 9/11&#39;s official narrative is somehow true? uh, what?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Media - when the vast majority of the population are unthinking, kept dumb, watch mainstream news channels and continue to surround themselves with what they consider &#39;like minded people&#39; (those who do not think for themselves) , you have a big herd of sheep who form the &#39;majority public opinions&#39; as their views on the world are entirely formed based on what is on the TV and other mainstream outlets. </p></li>
<li><p>You act like people who have tried to expose truths in the past haven&#39;t been killed. Do some research, there are plenty, if not too many. You can even look to recent times concerning the deaths of multiple bankers and high level financial executives across the world. </p></li>
<li><p>I think you underestimate your own freedoms and what your government is prepared to do not only you personally, but to its ordinary citizen. Where have you been since september 11 2001? Have you been AWOL? Are you even aware of what is going on in your own country? You think your government gives a shit about you and that you are &#39;free to spread truths&#39; - lol, right now your government has a police state agenda, it has domestic police forces with military equipment.. and your sitting here questioning this stuff like they aren&#39;t trying to keep you caged? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t want to go in to more points as I feel that the above 3 are quite self evident that this is a question that can be dealt with by looking through this sub for 5minutes. The threat is real, but i think that deep down, you know who the real threat is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but this is incredibly presumptuous.</p>

<p>What&#39;s sillier is you believing an official government story.  Most have been discredited throughout history whenever there is something this strange.</p>

<p>But all in all, the reason you are being presumptuous is because you assume all truthers think the government did it. That really isn&#39;t the point now is it?  The point is that it didn&#39;t happen as the official report shows.  There is a reason that to this day the official report has a 1 star on Amazon in the book section.  It&#39;s because its illogical, messy, and about as well written as the King James Bible; a crock of crap (no offense to any religious people here, but seriously that version is hilariously bad).</p>

<p>In either case, this is the smallest of my points.  I can literally go on for hours about the inaccuracies of the story.  At the end of the day, a 5 year old could tell you that if you throw an aluminum plane through a thick steel-framed building wouldn&#39;t collapse it.  It just wouldn&#39;t.

<p>Also, I don&#39;t believe it was the government that did 9/11 anyways. I believe it&#39;s much more likely the people that control their wallets did it and the government was reacting to it, and this is probably much more often the case than not. The government obviously did make laws and regulations stripping rights, yadda, yadda, in the aftermath... this is where they are at fault - Colluding with the enemy against us.</p>
