        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In order to accept the official version of events of 9/11, there a number of anomalies you would have to accept as mere &quot;coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p>From: <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html">http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;That George Bush&#39;s brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Centre, Dulles Airport and United Airlines means nothing more than you must admit those Bush boys have done alright for themselves.</p>

<p>That George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama’s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz is just one of those things - one of those crazy things.</p>

<p>That Osama bin Laden is known to have been an asset of US foreign policy in no way implies he still is.</p>

<p>That al Qaeda was active in the Balkan conflict, fighting on the same side as the US as recently as 1999, while the US protected its cells, is merely one of history&#39;s little aberrations.</p>

<p>The claims of Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the Jeddah visa bureau, that the CIA ran the office and issued visas to al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States, sound like the sour grapes of someone who was fired for making such wild accusations.</p>

<p>That one of George Bush&#39;s first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda&#39;s Afghanistan camps, even as the group&#39;s guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.</p>

<p>That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>That the company PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America’s Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA’s entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack, means he must not have been such a threat after all.</p>

<p>That on May 8, 2001, Dick Cheney took upon himself the job of co-ordinating a response to domestic terror attacks even as he was crafting the administration’s energy policy which bore implications for America&#39;s military, circumventing the established infrastructure and ignoring the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman report, merely shows the VP to be someone who finds it hard to delegate.</p>

<p>That the standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, is simply poor planning and unfortunate timing. Fortunately the error has been corrected, as the order was rescinded shortly after 9/11.</p>

<p>That Dave Frasca of the FBI’s Radical Fundamentalist Unit received a promotion after quashing multiple, urgent requests for investigations into al Qaeda assets training at flight schools in the summer of 2001 does appear on the surface odd, but undoubtedly there&#39;s a good reason for it, quite possibly classified.</p>

<p>That FBI informant Randy Glass, working an undercover sting, was told by Pakistani intelligence operatives that the World Trade Center towers were coming down, and that his repeated warnings which continued until weeks before the attacks, including the mention of planes used as weapons, were ignored by federal authorities, is simply one of the many &quot;What Ifs&quot; of that tragic day.</p>

<p>That over the summer of 2001 Washington received many urgent, senior-level warnings from foreign intelligence agencies and governments - including those of Germany, France, Great Britain, Russia, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Afghanistan and others - of impending terror attacks using hijacked aircraft and did nothing, demonstrates the pressing need for a new Intelligence Czar.</p>

<p>That John Ashcroft stopped flying commercial aircraft in July 2001 on account of security considerations had nothing to do with warnings regarding September 11, because he said so to the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p>That former lead counsel for the House David Schippers says he’d taken to John Ashcroft’s office specific warnings he’d learned from FBI agents in New York of an impending attack – even naming the proposed dates, names of the hijackers and the targets – and that the investigations had been stymied and the agents threatened, proves nothing but David Schipper’s pathetic need for attention.</p>

<p>That Garth Nicolson received two warnings from contacts in the intelligence community and one from a North African head of state, which included specific site, date and source of the attacks, and passed the information to the Defense Department and the National Security Council to evidently no effect, clearly amounts to nothing, since virtually nobody has ever heard of him.</p>

<p>That in the months prior to September 11, self-described US intelligence operative Delmart Vreeland sought, from a Toronto jail cell, to get US and Canadian authorities to heed his warning of his accidental discovery of impending catastrophic attacks is worthless, since Vreeland was a dubious character, notwithstanding the fact that many of his claims have since been proven true.</p>

<p>That FBI Special Investigator Robert Wright claims that agents assigned to intelligence operations actually protect terrorists from investigation and prosecution, that the FBI shut down his probe into terrorist training camps, and that he was removed from a money-laundering case that had a direct link to terrorism, sounds like yet more sour grapes from a disgruntled employee.</p>

<p>That George Bush had plans to invade Afghanistan on his desk before 9/11 demonstrates only the value of being prepared.</p>

<p>The suggestion that securing a pipeline across Afghanistan figured into the White House’s calculations is as ludicrous as the assertion that oil played a part in determining war in Iraq.</p>

<p>That Porter Goss met with Ahmed the morning of September 11 in his capacity as Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has no bearing whatsoever upon his recent selection by the White House to head the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p>That Goss&#39;s congressional seat encompasses the 9/11 hijackers&#39; Florida base of operation, including their flight schools, is precisely the kind of meaningless factoid a conspiracy theorist would bring up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that George HW Bush and Dick Cheney spent the evening of September 10 alone in the Oval Office, but what&#39;s wrong with old colleagues catching up? And it&#39;s true that George HW Bush and Shafig bin Laden, Osama&#39;s brother, spent the morning of September 11 together at a board meeting of the Carlyle Group, but the bin Ladens are a big family.</p>

<p>That FEMA arrived in New York on Sept 10 to prepare for a scheduled biowarfare drill, and had a triage centre ready to go that was larger and better equipped than the one that was lost in the collapse of WTC 7, was a lucky twist of fate.</p>

<p>Newsweek’s report that senior Pentagon officials cancelled flights on Sept 10 for the following day on account of security concerns is only newsworthy because of what happened the following morning.</p>

<p>That George Bush&#39;s telephone logs for September 11 do not exist should surprise no one, given the confusion of the day.</p>

<p>That Mohamed Atta attended the International Officer&#39;s School at Maxwell Air Force Base, that Abdulaziz Alomari attended Brooks Air Force Base Aerospace Medical School, that Saeed Alghamdi attended the Defense Language Institute in Monterey merely shows it is a small world, after all.</p>

<p>That Mohammed Atta dressed like a Mafioso, had a stripper girlfriend, smuggled drugs, was already a licensed pilot when he entered the US, enjoyed pork chops, drank to excess and did cocaine, was closer to Europeans than Arabs in Florida, and included the names of defence contractors on his email list, proves how dangerous the radical fundamentalist Muslim can be.</p>

<p>That 43 lbs of heroin was found on board the Lear Jet owned by Wally Hilliard, the owner of Atta’s flight school, just three weeks after Atta enrolled – the biggest seizure ever in Central Florida – was just bad luck. The fact that Hilliard was not charged shows how specious the claims for conspiracy truly approach. </p>

<p>Reports of insider trading on 9/11 are false, because the SEC investigated and found only respectable investors who will remain nameless involved, and no terrorists, so the windfall profit-taking was merely, as ever, coincidental.</p>

<p>That heightened security for the World Trade Centre was lifted immediately prior to the attacks illustrates that it always happens when you least expect it.</p>

<p>That Hani Hanjour, the pilot of Flight 77, was so incompetent he could not fly a Cessna in August, but in September managed to fly a 767 at excessive speed into a spiraling, 270-degree descent and a level impact of the first floor of the Pentagon, on the only side that was virtually empty and had been hardened to withstand a terrorist attack, merely demonstrates that people can do almost anything once they set their minds to it.</p>

<p>That the fact that none of the in total 4, bright orange, incredibly conspicuous flight data recorders from Flight 11 and United 175 that hit the WTC were recovered, even though everything from tiny bone fragments from victims and a hijacker&#39;s passport in perfect condition were, and the ones from Flight 77 and Flight 93 that were recovered have not been made available to the public, just demostrates that there&#39;s a first for everything. </p>

<p>That Mohammed Atta left a uniform, a will, a Koran, his driver&#39;s license and a &quot;how to fly planes&quot; video in his rental car at the airport means he had other things on his mind.</p>

<p>That multiple military wargames and simulations were underway the morning of 9/11 – one simulating the crash of a plane into a building; another, a live-fly simulation of multiple hijackings – and took many interceptors away from the eastern seaboard and confused field commanders as to which was a real hijacked aircraft and which was a hoax, was a bizarre coincidence, but no less a coincidence.</p>

<p>That the National Military Command Center ops director asked a rookie substitute to stand his watch at 8:30 am on Sept. 11 is nothing more than bad timing.</p>

<p>That a recording made Sept 11 of air traffic controllers’ describing what they had witnessed, was destroyed by an FAA official who crushed it in his hand, cut the tape into little pieces and dropped them in different trash cans around the building, is something no doubt that overzealous official wishes he could undo.</p>

<p>That the FBI knew precisely which Florida flight schools to descend upon hours after the attacks should make every American feel safer knowing their federal agents are on the ball.</p>

<p>That a former flight school executive believes the hijackers were &quot;double agents,&quot; and says about Atta and associates, &quot;Early on I gleaned that these guys had government protection. They were let into this country for a specific purpose,&quot; and was visited by the FBI just four hours after the attacks to intimidate him into silence, proves he&#39;s an unreliable witness, for the simple reason there is no conspiracy.</p>

<p>That Jeb Bush was on board an aircraft that removed flight school records to Washington in the middle of the night on Sept 12th demonstrates how seriously the governor takes the issue of national security.</p>

<p>To insinuate evil motive from the mercy flights of bin Laden family members and Saudi royals after 9/11 shows the sickness of the conspiratorial mindset.</p>

<p>Le Figaro’s report in October 2001, known to have originated with French intelligence, that the CIA met Osama bin Laden in a Dubai hospital in July 2001, proves again the perfidy of the French.</p>

<p>That the tape in which bin Laden claims responsibility for the attacks was released by the State Department after having been found providentially by US forces in Afghanistan, and depicts a fattened Osama with a broader face and a flatter nose, proves Osama, and Osama alone, masterminded 9/11.</p>

<p>That at the battle of Tora Bora, where bin Laden was surrounded on three sides, Special Forces received no order to advance and capture him and were forced to stand and watch as two Russian-made helicopters flew into the area where bin Laden was believed hiding, loaded up passengers and returned to Pakistan, demonstrates how confusing the modern battlefield can be.</p>

<p>That upon returning to Fort Bragg from Tora Bora, the same Special Operations troops who had been stood down from capturing bin Laden, suffered a unusual spree of murder/suicides, is nothing more than a series of senseless tragedies.</p>

<p>Reports that bin Laden is currently receiving periodic dialysis treatment in a Pakistani medical hospital are simply too incredible to be true.</p>

<p>That the White House went on Cipro September 11 shows the foresightedness of America’s emergency response.</p>

<p>That Republican guru Grover Norquist has been found to have aided financiers and supporters of Islamic terror to gain access to the Bush White House, and is a founder of the Islamic Institute, which the Treasury Department believes to be a source of funding for al Qaeda, suggests Norquist is at worst, naive, and at best, needs a wider circle of friends.</p>

<p>That the White House balked at any inquiry into the events of 9/11, then starved it of funds and stonewalled it, was unfortunate, but since the commission didn&#39;t find for conspiracy it&#39;s all a non issue anyway.</p>

<p>That the 9/11 commission&#39;s executive director and &quot;gatekeeper,&quot; Philip Zelikow, was so closely involved in the events under investigation that he testified before the the commission as part of the inquiry, shows only an apparent conflict of interest.</p>

<p>That co-chair Lee Hamilton has a history as a Bush family &quot;fixer,&quot; including clearing Bush Sr of the claims arising from the 1980 &quot;October Surprise&quot;, is of no concern, since only conspiracists believe there was such a thing as an October Surprise.</p>

<p>That FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds accuses the agency of intentionally fudging specific pre-9/11 warnings and harboring a foreign espionage ring in its translation department, and claims she witnessed evidence of the semi-official infrastructure of money-laundering and narcotics trade behind the attacks, is of no account, since John Ashcroft has gagged her with the rare invocation of &quot;State Secrets Privilege,&quot; and retroactively classified her public testimony. For the sake of national security, let us speak no more of her.&quot;</p>

<p>See? There are no conspiracies you nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the owner of the building, Larry Silverstein, would have surely died if he had not missed his daily breakfast atop the Trade Center that morning to go to a last-minute doctor appointment, should have no bearing on your opinion of what happened that morning. Also, if that coincidence must be tossed aside, you must likewise toss aside the fact that two of Larry&#39;s children, Lisa and Roger, were also expected to be present in the towers when the attack occurred, yet both missed certain doom by &quot;running late&quot; that morning. You could call it dumb luck or the Silverstein family having an angel looking over their shoulders, but as they are the same ones to benefit financially from the attack, you must never consider that they may have known something was going to happen in advance.  </p>

<p>J/k. If you look at all the inconsistencies and all the &quot;coincidences&quot; surrounding this morning, you would have to say this official story simply cannot be right. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget the group of men in Bush&#39;s administration that also were members of PNAC and collectively agreed on the way the U.S.A. should proceed with future plans for itself and it&#39;s &quot;enemies&quot;. </p>

<p>Barring a substantial and cataclysmic attack on American soil, such as &quot; A New Pearl Harbor&quot;, there is no way the American people would allow/stand behind any military actions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>This, of and by itself, is damning enough to commence a true international investigation. The Bush&#39;s, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Condi, Ashcroft, Kristol and any other members of PNAC and The Bush Administration should be interrogated with enhanced techniques.  </p>
