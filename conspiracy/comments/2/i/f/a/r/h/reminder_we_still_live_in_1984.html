All of our emails and text messages are monitored and being stored in giant databases. Corporations are sharing private information for economic espionage. Go down the line.</p>

<p>And yet... nothing happened. Maybe this was the goal all along, with Edward Snowden in fact leaking on behalf of the establishment to get it all out in the open, knowing any outrage would recede in the cacophony of the next 24-hour news cycle.</p>

<p>But it remains that we are still living in a 1984 that greatly surpasses what George Orwell could have ever envisioned. </p>

<p>Even in this sub the surveillance chatter has receded into the background... what will it take to change the system?</p>

<p>It will take people starting to care about their privacy.  But they don&#39;t.  They share every aspect of their lives willingly on Facebook because they are narcissistic.  Sorry, but it&#39;s the sad truth.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because the takeover was such a gradual process. Rights and freedoms were eroded slowly. Meanwhile, the public was kept happy with movies, music and TV..... and distracted by the fear of all the bad things they show us on the news each day.</p>

<p>The only protests you see are really tame, politically correct affairs that are aimed at safe targets. Nobody believes they can make a difference, so nobody gives a crap. If someone is monitoring all my emails and all my phones calls so what? I still talk about whatever and look at whatever and nobody gives me any hassles. </p>

<p>So we find ourselves living in a mildly repressive surveillance state. But the standard of living is not too bad. There&#39;s lot&#39;s of choice when it comes to material possessions. We can still party hard. That&#39;s the kind of system that has serious potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this post is part of the psyop intended to make you feel helpless and/or act.  If you go the helpless route, the noose will slowly continue constricting. If you go the action route, you will be labled as terrorists and most likely be used to hasten the noose tightening.  </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the right move?  </p>

<p>I say turn your back on it and let the whole thing come to a probably scary, grinding halt. Or continue living enslaved, and bring your children into the same slavery.</p>
