<p>There have been some phenomenal posts on this sub over the years, and the new queue certainly offers a more nuanced and interesting platform for debate than the top threads which are frequently akin to shouting in a crowded room when trying to have a discussion.</p>

<p>fwiw, I wouldn&#39;t put too much stock in sub member numbers, the figure is almost arbitrary given that many accounts are obsolete, etc.</p>

<p>and..</p>

<p>weeks ago i made post saying that 24 housr a day this sub is brigaded. its us against them but you know, letter, that ppl arent commenting n shit anymore , but... u gota motivate em
...
edit... *<em>since this will probably be the top post in some hours, i will advertise a subreddit *</em>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the sub mostly talks about snowden&#39;s documents being limited hangout, but also assange and wikileaks and manning</p>

<p>theres plenty more... propaganda and limited hangout are very similar terms</p>

<p>when nbc or foxnews or cnn tells you that a drone strike killed 12 in pakistan... its probably limited hangout because they leave certain info out. or not</p>

<p>who knows</p>

<p>subscribe and read</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ya3fr/i_am_now_convinced_that_snowden_is_part_of_a/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ya3fr/i_am_now_convinced_that_snowden_is_part_of_a/</a></p>

<p>I call it &quot;the limited hangout theory&quot; for its overarching explanation, but its more like the leading hypothesis because of the minimal information that we have been exposed to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence for a while now, honestly trying to view this situation without any bias and hoping for future &quot;revelations&quot; to convince me that Snowden was a genuine whistle-blower (because the leaks kept showing up periodically). Prominent people that made me curious about the &quot;limited hangout&quot; idea were Webster Tarpley and Naomi wolf:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/06/18/309609/how-to-identify-cia-limited-hangout-op/">Tarpley&#39;s article</a></p>

<p><a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">Wolf</a> </p>

<p>And <a href="http://publicconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/rconspiracy-links-for-snowden-limited-hangout-op/">here&#39;s</a> a collection worth mentioning of other bloggers that someone gathered. (Edit: seems to be <a href="/u/ObeyTheCowGod">/u/ObeyTheCowGod</a>. Thanks for the links).</p>

<p>Their biggest argument was that we have only seen garbage revelations heretofore, which benefited the NSA and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, so I looked into it. The best timeline of the &quot;leaks&quot; I&#39;ve found is <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">Al Jazeera&#39;s</a>. I don&#39;t think you need to doubt its validity, since it&#39;s a collection of mainstream articles anyway. </p>

<p>You can follow the timeline for yourself, and you would find that the most incriminating article is from <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/ministerio-das-minas-e-energia-esta-na-mira-de-espioes-americanos-e-canadenses.html">Globo</a> that showed how companies in Brazil were being spied on. The big catch? It&#39;s the only leak showing that it was perpetrated by the Canadian intelligence agency, not the NSA (besides monitoring Canadian citizens in airports). There is another one that tells us the NSA <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-and-gchq-spied-on-opec-a-932777.html">spied on OPEC</a>, a collection of <a href="http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm">Arab countries and Venezuela</a>, most of which have had their sovereignty compromised anyway. A worthless leak. Spying on Iraq is supposed to be big news after the entire country has been leveled to the ground?</p>

<p>Those who doubt the Snowden charade also say that the NSA&#39;s main motive is to make people aware of the fact that they&#39;re being monitored. Sort of like sending a clear message of &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;. The diplomatic leaks fall under this category as well, but they also imply a serious threat to the nations&#39; autonomy, like intercepting the calls of Germany&#39;s Merkel. Nothing came of it, but people are now a tiny bit more accustomed to the idea of a one world government.</p>

<p>Besides these leaks, it&#39;s all garbage. Many were waiting for anything on 9/11, but all they got was that the NSA was pushing its spokespeople to promote the official 9/11 narrative, in order to <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">to justify the program</a>. An idea so prevalent in society that it&#39;s used as satire in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;amp;t=0m46s">cartoons</a>. </p>

<p>Some articles are even used as a mouthpiece for the NSA, like how <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">&quot;Al Qaeda&quot; are trying to hijack the drones</a>. You should also know by now that anyone even using the words &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; is full of shit.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the fuse for me was the leak released today: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/">Wikileaks and other activist groups being monitored</a>, which by the way was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y86j0/glenn_greenwald_topsecret_documents_from_the/">top post</a> in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a while ago. The article clearly shows how the NSA was <strong>only</strong> targeting foreign activists like Anonymous. An organization that doesn&#39;t include domestic activists, as we all know. My BS-detector went haywire after that, which made me write this post. (Tarpley mentions Wikileaks as another limited hangout operation, which I&#39;m undecided about).</p>

<p>Another argument for it is that Snowden has received a lot of attention from the MSM. This only hints to him being controlled, it&#39;s not proof. But it still makes you consider why.</p>

<p>Does it mean that Greenwald is part of it as well? I have no idea. There is a possibility that he naively releases the leaks without being compromised. That&#39;s for you to decide, and I would love to hear your opinion on it. </p>

<p>If you feel like I&#39;ve made a factual error somewhere or want me to include anything of importance, please say so. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt about disinfo campaigns which is all <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> is. When they first arrived on reddit they did nothing but spam every subreddit they could and have been spamming ever since and most of their Mods are shadowbanned. If they arrived before Snowden i wouldn&#39;t think of them as a disinfo sub but the sub was made shortly after Snowden arrived on the scene even though there were dozens of leakers that came before him.</p>

<p>Apparently when the big guns come out on the leakers side and come out with actual proof with documents to back up their claims the big guns also come out on the other side to try to discredit them.</p>

<p>The other NSA leakers didn&#39;t steal as many documents that 100% confirmed their claims Snowden did. Before Snowden there was never a Government leak of this scale, i don&#39;t understand how its so hard to see why the press are all over it, something of this scale has never happened to the US Government before.</p>

<p>lets see, <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> has been a community for 7 months, created back in... march 2014? </p>

<p>snowden came on the scene in june 2013</p>

<p>try and do the math <a href="/u/afidak">/u/afidak</a> </p>

<p>im pretty much the only one posting anything about not only  limited hangouts, but about snowden as well</p>

<p>every post someone new probably googles limited hangout, if so, then my job is done. they can think for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the quality of the submissions that is poor.  I find a lot of great linked articles that are very informative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the quality of the comments that are in the toilet and are all over the place.  </p>

<p>There are users that take the conspiracy to the extreme such as all vaccines being bad to nobody actually being killed at Sandy Hook to 9/11 is absolutely a Zionist agenda.  </p>

<p>Then I discovered a user who only comes to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to argue with the users and never adds anything constructive to the subreddit because this user thinks everyone is a lunatic that comes here. And I&#39;m pretty sure that there are a lot more users like that person.</p>

<p>I myself try and start off a conversation civilly but then it all goes haywire when I encounter one of these extremists no matter what side they&#39;re on because I don&#39;t have any patience for their BS.  </p>

<p>So I feel the the OP&#39;s post is a noble effort but we&#39;re plagued here from both sides.  It&#39;s just like the Democrats and Republicans.  They&#39;re arguing all the time and both sides have an equal amount of scumbags.</p>

<p>But like I said before, the quality of the submissions is pretty good but the comments section is a wasteland where you enter at your own risk and I feel it&#39;s always going to be like that unless there is a Moderator monitoring each post at all times and we all know that&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So should I just quote our entire convo where you called me a &quot;dickhead&quot; maybe 2 replies in?   Is that the civility you are claiming?  Where you immediately jump to insulting those that do not agree with you? </p>

<p>There are many users on this sub that still have open minds and a willingness to debate/argue in order to grow in their own beliefs.  Anyone who knows me knows that I do not share many of the same beliefs as you all, and I like to debate my beliefs against others... but it is truly only to try and get the most informative, logical information out into the open. </p>

<p>I am sarcastic at times to those who either insult me or say something that just really grinds my gears (which I&#39;ll stop doing if a mod tells me I&#39;m doing it to much).</p>

<p>Most conversations/debates/arguments I hace with people on here I enjoy and I usually learn something either about how they came to believe what they believe or that is actual evidence out there that makes me ponder.</p>

<p>Arguments and debates are always good as ling as each party can remain civil and on topic.</p>

It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if he added something constructive to any of the posts.  Instead, he claims to come in with an open mind but when it&#39;s obvious he doesn&#39;t and his user history proves it.</p>

<p>Actually, it was 3 replies in that I referred to you as a Dickhead Troll.</p>

<p>You&#39;re arguments keep going in the same circle like you tried to do to to me again but I refuse to play your bullshit game, but this is the reason I referred to you as a Dickhead Troll.</p>

<p>And why are you stalking me?</p>

<p>And why do you keep skirting around the issue when I ask you if you&#39;re a United States Citizen or Resident?  Every time I keep asking you, you either ignore it or like last time, you just completely stopped responding?</p>

<p>So Yes or No, it&#39;s real simple.  Are you a United States Citizen or Resident?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to answer either because we kept going back and forth until I finally asked him to answer the Citizenship question.  He never responded back.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2i33j5/til_if_you_participate_in_peaceful_demonstrations/ckyj0bn?context=3">link</a> of our exchanges if you&#39;re curious.</p>

<p>Anyways, that guy is one of the reasons why I feel the comments section is a wasteland.  Actually more like the Wild Wild West.  Users like that guy come by just to challenge shit that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are trying to discuss in a civil manner.</p>

<p>Then you get other users like I witnessed where he kept mocking the Reptilian Conspiracy even though the topic had nothing to do with that.  And I don&#39;t know about you but I feel that the Reptilian deal is nonsense.</p>

<p>I still do not believe you are a citizen because you still do not see that her rights were not infringed upon. An FBI agent is allowed to knock on your door and ask you questions. There is nothing that prevents them from doing that. Just like there was nothing that prevented her from saying &quot;No thanks. Goodbye&quot;.</p>

<p>Spoken like a true Non-American.  Where are you really from?</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m curious if <a href="/u/TheRehabKid">/u/TheRehabKid</a> is going to respond when I asked him if he&#39;s a United States Citizen or Resident because he seems to keep avoiding the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt about disinfo campaigns which is all <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> is. When they first arrived on reddit they did nothing but spam every subreddit they could and have been spamming ever since and most of their Mods are shadowbanned. If they arrived before Snowden i wouldn&#39;t think of them as a disinfo sub but the sub was made shortly after Snowden arrived on the scene even though there were dozens of leakers that came before him.</p>

<p>Apparently when the big guns come out on the leakers side and come out with actual proof with documents to back up their claims the big guns also come out on the other side to try to discredit them.</p>

<p>This coming from a person who came to a different post to stalk me.</p>

<p>Anyways, whats wrong?  Are you uncomfortable because I figured out that you aren&#39;t a Citizen of the USA?</p>

<p>And quit telling us real Americans that we shouldn&#39;t worry about our Constitutional rights being violated when you&#39;re not even from here.</p>
