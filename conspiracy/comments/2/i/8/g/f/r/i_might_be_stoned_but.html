    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s part of it but you gotta consider the financial aspect as well.  Yes, the government and banks make lots of money off of drugs in their current illegal state, but if they were legalized there&#39;s even more opportunities for the finalization of the drug industry.  If weed was ever legal there&#39;d be weed futures and short selling of weed and all that shit that can&#39;t happen now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s no money, there&#39;s no legislation. In Washington we have a community of nonprofit organizations who were trying to get legalization on the ballot. They had the Proposition written up, the petitions signed, and when it looked like it was going to pass, this shadowy group with a similar law came along. Suddenly there were two bills competing for the same ballot, only the one from the second group made it.  What was the difference between the two bills? The second bill had a bunch of giveaways to law enforcement including some stiff and arbitrary DUI measures. You can guess where the money for that bill came from...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newer electromagnetic frequency-based methods of controlling mental states make it unnecessary to rely solely on cultural conditioning and propaganda to control the masses. While weed makes people resistant to propaganda, it may make people more susceptible to brainwave control.  </p>

<p>This, incidentally, is why binaural technology was purposely released and marketed as ineffective &quot;digital drugs&quot;: so the idea of brain frequency manipulation would lose credibility with those curious enough to learn about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that. In fact I have a theory that reveals the opposite. We had the 70s where we experimented with drugs, and was also a time of hippies promoting &quot;peace love and happiness&quot;... and STDs. 
I believe weed amongst other drugs opened our minds where we could conceive that the government wasn&#39;t doing things in our favor. Perhaps some of these helped people have visions of the reality of what shady things the government was doing. So that&#39;s why the government started banning all the drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a controlled rollout of policy that reflects public opinion from the last twenty years. the alcohol and tobacco lobbies are among the most powerful in the country. legal weed would take a great deal of business from those industries, so while the respective titans within each get their ducks in a row and make sure they&#39;ll remain profitable after prohibition is repealed, weed will remain illegal in most states and on a federal level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the surface it looks like they&#39;re legalizing it, and granted technically they are in a way. But what we&#39;re NOT getting is complete de-criminilazation of a harmless, and more importantly, very potent medicine. George Soros and his ilk are trying to keep things controlled, so not much of their profits go down the drain. Remember cannabis has the potential to topple many industries (plastic, fuel, pharmacological, cotton to name a few), but we won&#39;t see this done in this kind of a controlled manner, or its still decades to come.</p>

<p>I think you are right. It&#39;s not to just pacify them by allowing new smokers, it&#39;s also the mindset of, &quot;Hey, the government legalized it. See we are free&quot;.</p>

If they had, it would have become a bigger issue, and none of the conservatives can say shit because they&#39;ve been pumping States Rights for decades.
