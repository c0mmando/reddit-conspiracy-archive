       Mad is relative. You're on f'n reddit. I'm pretty sure revolutionaries don't waste their limited time cruising the popular culture distractions. Pretty sure you're pacified.

       Pacified? My point is &amp; was that if you are on Reddit...don't kid yourself.....you are pacified.

       I don't think they had a choice, maybe it would have been over turned if Colorado had failed to pass.

       But two states legalizing at the same time would make it harder for the feds to crack down. The push back would be worse than letting us have our fun.

       Exactly. They knew there wasn't the political will to overturn it. If they had, it would have become a bigger issue, and none of the conservatives can say shit because they've been pumping States Rights for decades. It's been fun watching the domino effect as state after state begins rethinking how they deal with cannabis.

       I think that's part of it but you gotta consider the financial aspect as well.  Yes, the government and banks make lots of money off of drugs in their current illegal state, but if they were legalized there's even more opportunities for the finalization of the drug industry.  If weed was ever legal there'd be weed futures and short selling of weed and all that shit that can't happen now.

       It's actually just a struggle between a variety of corporations, both public and private; those which make money of its illegality are trying to defend their profit center against those which make money off its legality.

       If there's no money, there's no legislation. In Washington we have a community of nonprofit organizations who were trying to get legalization on the ballot. They had the Proposition written up, the petitions signed, and when it looked like it was going to pass, this shadowy group with a similar law came along. Suddenly there were two bills competing for the same ballot, only the one from the second group made it.  What was the difference between the two bills? The second bill had a bunch of giveaways to law enforcement including some stiff and arbitrary DUI measures. You can guess where the money for that bill came from...

       Yes, this, but it's not so much a struggle between forces as a deliberate suppression of one, because of weed's ability to both build neurons, and cure cancer. Then there's hemp, the most important plant on the planet.

       Newer electromagnetic frequency-based methods of controlling mental states make it unnecessary to rely solely on cultural conditioning and propaganda to control the masses. While weed makes people resistant to propaganda, it may make people more susceptible to brainwave control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, incidentally, is why binaural technology was purposely released and marketed as ineffective "digital drugs": so the idea of brain frequency manipulation would lose credibility with those curious enough to learn about it.

       I would venture to say there are more pot smoking activists then there are not.  Marijuana does not make you docile it just allows you to view things in a more creative way which is usually done without violence.

       If I was a professional snowboarder, I don't doubt that zen would make me better day-to-day, but for what I do, it doesn't work. I'm pro-legalization, but dat brain fog, mang. And schedule 1 is some kind of bullshit, it's shitloads less dangerous than alcohol, which doesn't even rate a schedule--but for what I do, pot would not be my day-to-day. It's bad enough I have a reddit and cheap champagne habit.

       I hear ya.  I know alot of everyday tokers who are more productive than some non smokers.   But I guess it all breaks down to personality type.  In regards to the short term memory problems.  They do exist but not in the way most people assume.  The memory loss only occurs while under the influence or in heavy-duty users.  A little here and there doesn't necessarily affect memory.  But all that said I respect your opinion and your right to live however you see fit.

       My three best friends who live in the same city as me are 100% sober. They don't drink or smoke anything. They're all lazy fucks with crap jobs and they complain all the time about how rough the job market is. It isn't the market so much as their effort level and discipline to keep pushing forward in spite of the setbacks. Weed has nothing to do with it.

       I don't believe that. In fact I have a theory that reveals the opposite. We had the 70s where we experimented with drugs, and was also a time of hippies promoting "peace love and happiness"... and STDs. 
I believe weed amongst other drugs opened our minds where we could conceive that the government wasn't doing things in our favor. Perhaps some of these helped people have visions of the reality of what shady things the government was doing. So that's why the government started banning all the drugs.

       it's a controlled rollout of policy that reflects public opinion from the last twenty years. the alcohol and tobacco lobbies are among the most powerful in the country. legal weed would take a great deal of business from those industries, so while the respective titans within each get their ducks in a row and make sure they'll remain profitable after prohibition is repealed, weed will remain illegal in most states and on a federal level.

       On the surface it looks like they're legalizing it, and granted technically they are in a way. But what we're NOT getting is complete de-criminilazation of a harmless, and more importantly, very potent medicine. George Soros and his ilk are trying to keep things controlled, so not much of their profits go down the drain. Remember cannabis has the potential to topple many industries (plastic, fuel, pharmacological, cotton to name a few), but we won't see this done in this kind of a controlled manner, or its still decades to come.

       Are you implying that all state elections are rigged?  Because it was citizens who decided it was time to legalize.  I'm not saying government and media doesn't do everything it can to manipulate, but they don't actually have 100% control over what happens in state referendums.

       I would not have been awoken to what is happening if it were not for weed. Yet there is no free lunch. I have no desire to take action just educate and prepare for the inevitable which is nothing.and all keeps going, nothing ever changes.

       Exactly. They knew there wasn't the political will to overturn it. If they had, it would have become a bigger issue, and none of the conservatives can say shit because they've been pumping States Rights for decades. It's been fun watching the domino effect as state after state begins rethinking how they deal with cannabis.
