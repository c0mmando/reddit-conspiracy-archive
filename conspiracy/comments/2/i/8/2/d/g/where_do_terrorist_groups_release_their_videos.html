       Katz said that ISIS cut off her access to the staging location after she "beat them to the punch" with the release of the Sotloff video.
      </p>

       So where are the videos being released, and how can they be used for recruiting, if no one can actually see them?

       What makes me skeptical, is ISIS supposedly has made 2 billion off of oil production, but who are they selling to and how are they able to operate while still waging war and holding down so many areas? ,

       That's the other question, there's an article that claims they use the majority of the fuel for their own operations, so if that's true, their not turning it over to cash.  The article also said they are selling to locals, but I doubt they are making that much money selling to locals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one article:
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-makes-million-day-selling-oil-analysts/story?id=24814359">
        http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-makes-million-day-selling-oil-analysts/story?id=24814359
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Officials from the Iraqi oil industry have said that ISIS reaps $1 million per day in Iraq in oil profits and that if they get the Syrian fields in [areas where they're advancing], the total would be $100 million per month for both Iraq and Syria combined. They sell it for $30 a barrel because it's a black market. It's not pegged to international standards for oil prices, which are over $100 a barrel. The oil is bought through Turkey from Syria, and it's sold to black market traders who function throughout the Levant.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Think about that, 30 bucks a barrel and make a million a day.  That means their able to produce 33,333 barrels a day.  Sounds like they would need some help or some serious infrastructure in order to pull that off, while waging a war.

       Just speculating here, but I believe that Islamic terrorist groups are notorious for running their own websites, some of them anyway. Law enforcement have been pretty successful in pulling terrorist related websites from the internet and my understanding is that a lot of terrorist organisations have moved to the dark web, using anonymising tools such as TOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, basically, I believe that they upload their propaganda videos to their websites and I guess the media picks them up from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched a documentary about the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan and it showed how they release DVD's for free to local communities. It was a VICE documentary about the Taliban in Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not so sure that the press get's hold of these videos any quicker than an internet user might if they are looking in the right places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Headlines for today's alleged ISIS execution video, and the ones before, usually run with titles such as, "Beheading video appears on the internet". As opposed to something like, "the BBC has obtained exclusive footage".

       So you think the MSM media that recognizes 4chan as a single entity hacker accesses the darknet to grab these videos before anyone else and then the website gets shut down before anyone that is a regular user of the darknet can make a copy or a screenshot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: you seem to be full of all this insightful information but when asked for proof or your sources or these website terrorist keep posting videos to, you don't seem to have shit. Not sure what you are trying to accomplish....

       Um... No? I'm really not following what you are saying in relation to my comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I was saying that terrorist organisations distribute their propaganda videos themselves. And the media picks up on that in the same way anyone else does.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example, a video may get uploaded to Liveleak and a journalist who monitors the web will find said video and report it.

       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay lets just clarify for a second (I don't know what is going on lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       OP's questions were these: "Where do terrorist groups release their videos?" and "why is it that the press get hold of this information before anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer to those questions you can see above. But in brief they were:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         On their websites. And I have seen in a documentary film that the Taliban would distribute their propaganda film's on DVD for free to local communities on the Afghan Pakistan border. I'd imagine there are other ways.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't think it is true that the press get's hold of these videos before anyone else, not always anyway. Mainly due to my answer to question one.

       No, because I don't frequent that part of the internet, the dark web. And I don't have TOR.

       Figures. So no proof but you know exactly how people got these videos. You are a idiot. Come back with some proof next time.

       I understand how it works. People upload stuff to a server then other people plug in a web address to see it. I know that not everything online is true. I know what the TOR Project is and how that works. I know what a proxy is and how that works.
      </p>

       I don't get what you are trying to say? You're the one hiding behind the mask of the internet along with everyone else on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are the All Knowing Oz, where does this propaganda come from? If its not the "terrorists" themselves, then who is it? The Pentagon?

       That's reddit, if you don't like it, go back to Facebook.

      <p>
       The whole point is how is it that the MSM is the only ones receiving these videos when no one else seems to be able to get a hold of them before they do. Just rings as bullshit.
