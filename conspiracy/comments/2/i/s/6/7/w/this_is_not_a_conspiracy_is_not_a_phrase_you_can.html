    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>Some people seem to expect that every single post here be a self contained conspiracy theory from start to finish.  It is rare that anyone has the attention to detail required to make such a post.  For an example see <a href="/u/three_letter_agency">/u/three_letter_agency</a> and his/her posting history.  3letters has an inhuman ability to organize an overwhelmingly huge data pool into a coherent timeline that is much easier for your average reader to digest.</p>

<p>Many underwhelming posts here are tangentially connected to a well known and larger conspiracy.  Like the &#39;news&#39; posts about a judge being sentenced to 25 years for his role in selling juveniles to private prisons for a kick back.  That is a small conspiracy but at the same time it is connected to a much larger CT gripe about private prison corruption.</p>

<p>Duh? Who thinks that it is?</p>

<p>&quot;This is not a conspiracy&quot; is a legitimate reason, however, to report posts which provably have nothing to do with any form of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>We need to keep this place clear from clutter and posts that don&#39;t belong here, which are posts that have nothing to do with being any form of conspiracy.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t freaking <a href="/r/SRD">/r/SRD</a>, and we need to keep that shit out of here.</p>

<p>The timing of your post seems very suspect, just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that the ex employee did his AMA because reddit is cleaning house for unknown reasons.  The first link in my post (if you read it) is a current employee&#39;s writings about the ridiculous required relocation (move to SF or you&#39;re fired) with a ridiculously short period of time to do it.</p>

<p>This was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back with the ex employee to do an AMA.  Then the CEO of reddit publicly denounces the ex employee and shames him.  This exposes reddit to potential lawsuits and it very unusual behavior for a CEO.</p>

<p>meanwhile the media ignores this forced relocation story and pretends like the controversy is only about the CEOs public statement.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is about &quot;why is reddit making huge changes for no apparent reason&quot;.  Since we are actually on reddit right now, it is perfectly relevant to this sub.</p>
