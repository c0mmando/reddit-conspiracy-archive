       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people seem to expect that every single post here be a self contained conspiracy theory from start to finish.  It is rare that anyone has the attention to detail required to make such a post.  For an example see
       <a href="/u/three_letter_agency">
        /u/three_letter_agency
       </a>
       and his/her posting history.  3letters has an inhuman ability to organize an overwhelmingly huge data pool into a coherent timeline that is much easier for your average reader to digest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many underwhelming posts here are tangentially connected to a well known and larger conspiracy.  Like the 'news' posts about a judge being sentenced to 25 years for his role in selling juveniles to private prisons for a kick back.  That is a small conspiracy but at the same time it is connected to a much larger CT gripe about private prison corruption.

       Something can be a symptom of a conspiracy and not an actual conspiracy too. For example the militarization of the police and training them to see us like enemies is not an outright conspiracy but it's part of the bigger problem, a systemic one.

       I think it's silly to ignore the symptoms.

       The conspiracy is that the ex employee did his AMA because reddit is cleaning house for unknown reasons.  The first link in my post (if you read it) is a current employee's writings about the ridiculous required relocation (move to SF or you're fired) with a ridiculously short period of time to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the straw that broke the camel's back with the ex employee to do an AMA.  Then the CEO of reddit publicly denounces the ex employee and shames him.  This exposes reddit to potential lawsuits and it very unusual behavior for a CEO.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile the media ignores this forced relocation story and pretends like the controversy is only about the CEOs public statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is about "why is reddit making huge changes for no apparent reason".  Since we are actually on reddit right now, it is perfectly relevant to this sub.

       Very good point and I already do that.

       Again, the timing is too suspect for me based on the post this relates to from
       <a href="/u/flytape">

       about two days ago where I asked "how is this a conspiracy and where is your evidence to support it being one" to which he never answered.

       The conspiracy is that the ex employee did his AMA because reddit is cleaning house for unknown reasons.  The first link in my post (if you read it) is a current employee's writings about the ridiculous required relocation (move to SF or you're fired) with a ridiculously short period of time to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the straw that broke the camel's back with the ex employee to do an AMA.  Then the CEO of reddit publicly denounces the ex employee and shames him.  This exposes reddit to potential lawsuits and it very unusual behavior for a CEO.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile the media ignores this forced relocation story and pretends like the controversy is only about the CEOs public statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is about "why is reddit making huge changes for no apparent reason".  Since we are actually on reddit right now, it is perfectly relevant to this sub.
