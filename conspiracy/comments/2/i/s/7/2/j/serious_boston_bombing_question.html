<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7YNmbGd.jpg?1">This is an image of a lady</a> on the ground after the Boston bombing, along with an image of her later being wheeled out. You can clearly see there is no blood on her face, hands, or legs. And yet later she is photographed with blood all over her. Also worth noting, the guy next to her stands up and rips his pants more and then lies back down (you can see this in videos). The bottom left comes before the top pic and are a few seconds (maybe a min) after the blast. So, I&#39;m just curious -- why isn&#39;t anyone talking about this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize this happened almost two years ago, right?  A lot of people <strong>did</strong> spend a lot of time and effort talking about this, about how the Boston Bombing and Sandy Hook and the Aurora shooting and others were obvious bullshit.  About how all the evidence is right there in your face, out in the open.  They were met with censorship and attacks in every form of media, and with organized limited hangout disinformation ops like DallasGoldBug and countless others.  Some were even physically threatened by the dipshit, criminal thugs posing as law enforcement in this country.  Average people don&#39;t have the time and resources to risk their safety by continuing to harp on every little piece of evidence, years after the fact, in order to attempt to educate the dumb masses of what should be obvious: that nearly every terror attack in the past fifteen years has been a false flag hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that. But I didn&#39;t really focus on it at the time. But about a week ago I came across an article talking about the stupid &quot;tin foil hat wearing&quot; conspiracy theorists who thought the bombing was fake. So I looked into it (the same way I did 9/11 -- with an ultra skeptical and logical eye) and my skepticism turned to shock... again... But this one thing with the lady caught my eye and I didn&#39;t see much of anyone talking about it by doing a Google search. How can you deny before and after images and video? how can you think there would be no blood, cuts, damage to skin at all when you&#39;re right next to the guy who supposedly had his leg blown off?</p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder the people of this country are OK with a military-police-state with a corrupt media who combine to both physically and mentally terrorize them when you realize that Stockholm Syndrome can actually happen en masse.</p>

<p>why isn&#39;t anyone talking about this?</p>

<p>There is a small group of people who literally control the reality in which 90% of people in this country believe they live in. Every major news org is controlled and if all the news orgs say &quot;The sky is green&quot; then that&#39;s what the masses believe. The news says that if you ask the question you just did, you should be shamed and mocked and ridiculed. So that&#39;s what will happen if you bring it up in a &quot;normal&quot; setting.</p>

<p>The same kind of questions exist for JFK, the 1993 wtc bombing, the okc bombing, Twa 800, Dumb bases, FEMA, 911, Boston, Sandy Hook, ebola, MH370 and MH17. Are all of these conspiracies? Maybe, maybe not. Are all of these events shrouded in a massive web of lies and weakly glued together by a manufactured narrative? Better believe it.</p>

<p>It has been. A search should in this sub should give you lots of results. Boston doesn&#39;t generally get a lot of love around here though. And if you think the anomolies with Boston are crazy check out Sandy Hook. I can&#39;t make heads or tails of that one.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t clearly see that, shot is very blurry, can&#39;t see the side of her face that has appears to be bloody in wheel chair picture. The blood on her hand can be the blood from the wound on her head. You can&#39;t tell the sequence of events based on how the images are given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or the blood on her face is from her hand and she touched her face which is more likely. Agreed though, in the initial photos you cannot really see the side of the face that does later have blood on it.

There&#39;s an image of the close up of the hand in another comment I made that is sharper. I don&#39;t buy at all that all the blood on her hand and leg is from a head wound.

<p>I&#39;m from Boston.  Was at finish line that day.
It happend.
Could someone in the crowds have gamed the system by pretending to be hurt? Sure.
But I have seen other threads about the bombing where people theorize that all the victims were actors.
I can unequivocally say they were not.

    <div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t focus on the little details.  As someone who was skeptical of the officially reported event as they occurred, there were countless times where the official story contradicted first hand reports.</p>

<p>The authorities were really sloppy when create the official story of the Boston Bombings.  A couple days after the event, CNN broadcasts that they the bomber had been taken into custody.  Within a few hours, they abandoned that story without any explanation or retraction.</p>

<p>A few days later, the FBI has a press conference where they show video of two guys walking one after the other, and ask the public for help identifying them.  Shortly after, it emerged that the FBI had been in recent communication with the accused bombers.  They were lying when made the official announcement that they wanted the public&#39;s help identifying the people seen on video.</p>

<p>After the manhunt, it they found no weapon near the surviving bomber, so the story about a 2 way firefight was a lie.  Other details from the original story were cut from the official story and forgotten within about a week.  Such forgotten details from the original reports were that they robed of a 7-11 and were throwing bombs out the window of their getaway taxi.</p>

<p>I could go on, but it&#39;s pointless.</p>

<p>There are a countless little discrepancies in the official stories of the Boston Bombing, 9/11, and other important happenings where there is an official truth repeated by people in the media and politics.  It&#39;s much more sane and reasonable to just accept that the official story is not the honest truth.</p>

<p>The official story falls apart if you examine it critically.  If you are skeptical of such reports from the start, you can actually see the official story being fabricated in the immediate aftermath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when the boston marathon happened on this subreddit there were tons of pictures that we saw doctored. literally hundreds. </p>

<p>there were also explanations on the smoke bombs used, the fake blood, the fake explosions, the fake police badges, etc. etc. dig through the search history of the subreddit from the time it happened to about a week-two weeks later and there WAS unlimited INSANE information about what really occurred. very detailed, such a hoax what they say happened there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not so bad that you can&#39;t see her ring on her left hand, or the white rip of her jacket or other details like that. So why not even one speck of blood? <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.eurweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston-bombing-bloodied-woman-in-wheelchair.jpg">This image</a> shows how much blood was on her leg. Also, it was enough time for blood to show. </p>

<p>Edit, just realized the image i posted doesn&#39;t show the ring. But there is a frame where it is showing and the hand is turned more. I will try to find it.</p>

<p>Edit 2: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/37lJQaD.jpg">Found it.</a> The right is from the same pics after the blast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve found the solid evidence necessary for you to KNOW the Boston Bombing (firecracker) was a sham.  Congratulations on your perceptiveness.  When you open your eyes on Sanky Hook and 9/11, very likely similar conclusions will be made.  The masses can see this evidence, yet their fear controlls them.  Truth is everything.</p>
