        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This article starts off by saying that the person who released this information has &quot;reportedly been killed&quot;, which obviously sounds like a troll, so take with a grain of salt, but the information provided was definitely interesting. I&#39;ve been wanting to find out the esoteric meaning behind the cube&#39;s cryptic message, and this is the most interesting thing I&#39;ve read so far about it. Keep an open mind, tell me what you think.</p>

<p>Taken from here:
<a href="http://vanshardware.com/2014/10/anonymous-message-claims-to-reveal-r-c-christian-identity-georgia-guidestones-doom-date/">http://vanshardware.com/2014/10/anonymous-message-claims-to-reveal-r-c-christian-identity-georgia-guidestones-doom-date/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>So the cube says: 8 16 20 14 MM JAM</p>

<p>People first assume this is a date of 8/16/2014. That’s because they read the cube in the wrong direction. They are reading the cube spun clockwise. This is wrong. Remember the guidestones make a big deal out of Polaris. And viewed from Polaris the Earth turns counter-clockwise. The cube date read in this direction becomes: 8/14/2016</p>

<p>This is important for two reasons. The obvious being that unlike 8/16/2014, 8/14/2016 hasn’t happened yet. But more importantly, August 14th is a day that means a lot to Freemasons.</p>

<p>(search for the date here:<a href="http://www.mastermason.com/wallerlodge/events.htm">http://www.mastermason.com/wallerlodge/events.htm</a>)</p>

<p>They HATE that day and for good reason. The first true public enemy the Freemasons had was William Morgan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_%28anti-Mason%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_%28anti-Mason%29</a>).</p>

<p>Long story short, this man had access to secret Freemason rituals and materials and planned to make them public. He planned to expose the Freemasons via a book called “Illustrations of Masonry, By One of the Fraternity Who Has Devoted Thirty Years to the Subject”. He obtained a copyright for this particular book on August 14th, 1826. Shortly afterwards he was murdered by Freemasons. This led to the Morgan affair which led to the Antimasonic Party. To this very day, Freemasons loathe the date August 14th. They see it as the point at which society at large turned against them. What better day then, for the Freemasons to enact their revenge? To turn against society? And thus we have the date of the 2nd cube being: 8/14/2016.</p>

<p>But what of the letters MM and JAM?</p>

<p>MM stands for Master Mason. No surprise. Lots of people figured that one out.</p>

<p>Nobody figured out JAM. I guess no one studies Latin anymore?</p>

<p>JAM stands for Judicie Anno Mundi. “In the judgment of the world.”
Judgement day.
(<a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=judicie+anno+mundi">http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=judicie+anno+mundi</a>)</p>

<p>The 2nd cube tells those who can read it that the Master Mason will bring Judgement Day on 8/14/2016.</p>

<p>This is the extent of information that I can tell you. Research the things I’ve said, you will find all of it true. I leave this upon you and one other soul to decide what to do with all this information. Good luck and bless you as an agent of truth.</p>

<p>From here on out, I do not exist. We will never speak again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason I don&#39;t feel like MM means Master Mason. That&#39;d be too obvious. And JAM meaning judgement day is a stretch but hey, can&#39;t argue with cool sounding latin phrases.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more too it, but speculation is all we&#39;ve got. This is definitely the most interesting thing I&#39;ve seen on this sub for awhile though, even if it is just a cryptic piece of stone.</p>

<p>Is there any othet latin phrases  of two words with both beginning with M? </p>

Sense the local law enforcement seem unable to identify who did this I think this confirms that the camera&#39;s at the location are fake and the only true surveillance of the site is probably done by the closest rural neighbors of the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>viewed from Polaris the Earth turns counter-clockwise. </p>

<p>Any conspiracy theory that can work in that phrase is cool in my book! :-) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>... But more importantly, August 14th is a day that means a lot to Freemasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They HATE that day and for good reason. The first true public enemy the Freemasons had was William Morgan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freemasonry in its current form was founded 100 years before the Morgan Affair, on another continent. We had plenty of enemies, and Morgan really wasn&#39;t even one of them. Sure, he wanted to profit by revealing what he&#39;d sworn not to, but that makes him a liar and greedy, not an enemy of Freemasonry. During the 18th century, the Catholic Church in Spain had over 1000 Freemasons and their families killed. Morgan was a mere nuisance, and had a group of idiotic and very un-Masonic Brothers not kidnapped him from jail (and possibly subsequently murdered him) he would barely be a footnote in our history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They see it as the point at which society at large turned against them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it was the start of the anti-Masonic period, but the acceptance of Freemasonry has waxed and waned since. In the 1920s and 1950s, I&#39;d argue that the Fraternity was more accepted by the public than it was in the 19th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really need to go check the Guidestones out because I only live about 35 miles away. I&#39;ve been meaning to do that since I first heard about them several years ago. </p>

<p>What strikes me as unusual is their location.  They are just off Hwy 77 (Hartwell Highway) on Red Hill Road, 12 miles outside of the town of Elberton GA. You can look here on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgia+Guidestones/@34.232024,-82.894426,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x46db3257cdff59b1">Google Maps</a> and see for yourselves there is nothing in or around that area except  woods/country and an occasional house. </p>

<p>Did the people who commissioned and paid for the stones want them somewhat hidden away, and if so why? If they didn&#39;t want them to be seen why build them at all? If they did want them seen, why not build them in a more populated area?  </p>

<p>The only reason I can think of for putting them there is logistics and cost. Elberton&#39;s only claim to fame is that it&#39;s billed as the <a href="http://www.gpb.org/georgiastories/stories/granite_capital_of_the_world"><em>Granite Capital of the World</em></a> because it is located on top of one of the largest granite veins in America. So cutting, carving, transporting and erected the stones there would be cheaper than most anywhere else. But money didn&#39;t seem to be an issue to the man that went to Elberton and had them commissioned. He deposited a healthy sum of money with a local banker and, if I remember the story correctly, told him if more money was needed to contact him. </p>
