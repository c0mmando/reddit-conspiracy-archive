        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been on here a couple of years. I&#39;ve watched my fair share of documentaries, books read, drugs taken. I know that this society is corrupt at its core. I know the money game is rigged. I know that the healthcare system doesn&#39;t promote health. The court system is fucked when real criminals get off scott free. The food system is a mess and doesn&#39;t help people support themselves.</p>

<p>I know all of this!</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t know, is what it could otherwise be. Whats the goal that we strive for here? Do we need a consciousness shift (my personal belief)? Where will that take us?</p>

<p>I feel at loss in all of this monotony of wars, meaningless jobs, poor food intake. I know I can better MY situation as I have the means to but does that really get us anywhere else? Sorry for the rant but I would like to hear your ideas on what the human race has the potential of doing (constructive/destructive)</p>

<p>What would a free society look like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utopia is a Resource based economy. Everyone&#39;s needs are met (clothing, food, shelter) at no requirement to do &quot;work&quot;. Work is optional and used to further the sustainability of mankind and the planet. This requires a huge consciousness shift however, which is why the use of entheogens and meditation practices will need to be widespread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to post something similar then scrapped my post. Technology is getting us to a point where we can automate highly technical jobs. Soon enough, if we wanted, we could give most people in the world a guaranteed income that would allow them to live comfortably without having to work. (the robots are working for us, remember)</p>

<p>This would free up the genius/passionate people who would be willing to devote their lives to their study without having to worry about having a job to make a living. </p>

<p>Think of all of the geniuses who came up with breakthrough inventions or discoveries. They didn&#39;t do it at their 9-5. They were the type of people who would work as a clerk at a patent office so they could spend every other minute of their day working on what they were passionate about.</p>

<p>If we do this people would not only be happier but I think it would lead to a revolution in technological and artistic development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree. It&#39;s hard to convince people of this though and the rate at which AI and robotics are progressing is astonishing.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we are really that close to this point at all (yet), but could get there rapidly with the right advances in tech and society.  The fact that we throw away 50% of our food is a testament to our wastefulness and inefficiency, not the fact that the food had no use because we can automatically make so much.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe we will ever achieve this goal.  One line is reality and &quot;perfection&quot; is another.  The two lines can get exponentially closer to the capabilities and goals of this utopia, but mathematically they will never meet.</p>

<p>At the end of the line, when every other variable is met, every possibility made real to enable this Star Trek society...  The decision to abolish money and move to meeting EVERYONE&#39;s needs- would have to be made by the &#39;men&#39; who already have the largest piles and all their needs met.  The decision to disarm or reduce our militarization will have to come from those with all the power and control over the military complex.  </p>

<p>Regardless how over-simple I make the argument, in the end there would require a dramatic shift from people being unequal to people being equal, BUT the only forces that can really facilitate that change are those most positively unequal.  Once we solve economic scarcity (of ALL THINGS).. there is still a complete roadblock.  So long as human beings are selfish or even truly hold a value of &#39;self-identity&#39; we will never see any such possibility come into fruition and the tools / technology that could most enable it will cease to exist or be used in a very different function (to further the inequality).</p>

<p>I know, that was my point.  It&#39;s the wastefulness and inefficiency and income inequality that are the main problems, not the technology.</p>

<p>I agree with the rest of your points that it would/will be a difficult road to get there - it will/would most likely require a massive consciousness shift on a global scale - but I think it&#39;s wrong to say it&#39;s impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;tech&quot; I throw out was more of an internalization of the only way I view this kind of society &#39;evolving&#39;.  The &quot;have&#39;s&quot; will never choose to share their excess with the &quot;have not&#39;s&quot;.  Not until there comes a point where scarcity no longer exists.  Once a point is reached where literally ANYONE can &quot;have&quot; most any desired thing they value, when everyone has excess, is the only time people &#39;could&#39; begin to be able to push towards this kind of society... Or they will just point to new things that are scarce and shift value to those things they can &#39;own&#39; or accumulate.  (To me, at this point comes the issue I was talking of in the previous post- self identity- people still want to &quot;be better&quot; than others)  So I guess by my reference to not having the necessary &quot;technology&quot; yet, it is a sci-fi cop-out.  The only way that everyone can be the &quot;have&#39;s&quot; is after a more free form of energy, after some sort of technologies like 3D printers FOR ANYTHING (or replicators on Star Trek).  Even then, what is their &#39;ink&#39;, that resource would have to be renewable and accessible.  The only way I see societies powerful Lords getting in the muck with their serfs is if all the serfs are all given their own castle with the same power, capability, and potential.  Now being a &quot;Lord&quot; loses its meaning for all, as there are no lordships or serfs, but what holds the kingdoms or society together when we all have our own castle?  People will always have differences and degree&#39;s of selfishness, so I can only see technology offering such a possibility- and not for a long time (if at all).</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know how a society would thrive though, once that point is reached no one has any inherent value to society any longer.  I only earn money because I perform services or create goods, I raise children to do the same, I follow their laws and pay taxes- so they see me as a useful or valuable member of society..  Now we live in a &#39;faith without works is dead&#39; society. So in this utopia, where no work is required, nor faith, what is the glue that holds it together (what punishes for not being beneficial to said society.. currently I starve)?  It is interesting stuff to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this theory before from the Venus Project by Jacque Fresco. I tend to buy into the theory that these fucks who rule over the resources are an impediment to our evolution and need to be overcome. However, I feel like if all needs were met (base needs) then a lot of motivation would be taken away in striving for higher consciousness. Though you could say since we have those things we would quickly realize our need to go much deeper into the realms of our consciousness. It depends on the person I guess. Thanks for the input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I always think. I get the feeling that I am being led to believe that humanity can&#39;t be noble, that the hell we currently live in is natural and it&#39;s our failing as humans to be any better. Without being controlled, our animalism would take over and savagery would be the norm.</p>

<p>But then, I think about the state of mind that one experiences when they take LSD, psilocybin, DMT, etc. Surely that enormous spiritual understanding and compassion points toward the potential of humans to be enlightened. Same with meditation.</p>

<p>Taking such drugs is ecstatic. If it were legal, it would be common. I can&#39;t imagine a society that embraces the psychedelic state one day a week spends the other six warring with each other.</p>

<p>Our current society is <em>so fucked up</em>. It&#39;s upside down in almost every way. <em>This</em> is the bizarro version of what our society could be like. Practically every institution is corrupt and its logic is backwards.</p>

<p>My opinion is that all this is intentional. It&#39;s designed to be absolutely unnatural and miserable. TPTB are promoting this descent so they can, one day when we&#39;re at breaking point under the weight of the total insanity, reveal themselves and show us a &quot;better&quot; way. They think they&#39;ll be able to admit the whole thing was a ruse, that we&#39;ll be shocked but see how the ends have justified the means and forgive them.</p>

<p>But it won&#39;t be a real better way. It&#39;ll still be shit, it will still maintain their unassailable invulnerability, but it&#39;ll be better than what we had -- this.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They are not &quot;connected&quot;.  There is no achievement in an act that requires anything other than one&#39;s own personal, individual, focused, sober, fully conscious exertion and will power.  Anything achieved in any manner otherwise is nothing but a chimera - a ruse, a guise.  It does not signal accomplishment.  It indicates a further chain of worldly enslavement that has been shackled on the ankle of one&#39;s development, for it is - again - only when one accomplishes through the use of one&#39;s own personal volition that the true effects of the act can be felt and truly experienced.  What one experiences otherwise is the effect of the artifice - not the actual end goal itself.  The artifice causes one to not have to use their own exertion to accomplish the task - creating a greater rift and distance between the final goal and the individual in question.</p>

<p>In other words, it is only when the identity alone reaches the goal that there is accomplishment, and the identity is prevented and undermined to the extent that it is encumbered by any exterior or artificial influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These have always been used by tribal societies that live in harmony with nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not saying here that one cannot achieve a certain level of harmony with nature and each other via the use of any external artifice.  I am saying that 1) they are unnecessary for any such harmony, and 2) they are actually specifically undermining to the achievement of true conscious liberation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to err on the side of nature when it is put against technology. I feel like we lose ourselves in technology too easily (therefore making us susceptible to slave master mentality) for it to be used as a good thing. I feel like the tech needs to interwine with nature for us to really strive. We can&#39;t have robots working for all of us if all the natural resources taken from the earth are used up by the time we&#39;ve built them. Any arguments against? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Random is hard to corrupt when done right, random is statistically representative. Random has allowed the poors to rule over Athene for a century. There are grassroots movements flowering in Europe (ex: &quot;gentils virus&quot;) dedicated to re-establishing such a system into law. They offer constitution writing workshops to the population all over the place, to be ready when we need to be instead of letting the same write more of the same new rules. They also generate micro-parties to take over municipalities in some places. A fake revolution is top-bottom, boom, sudden change. A true revolution is bottom-up, and it takes a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would look like a bunch of people that educate themselves on what matters and not what the &quot;education system&quot; demands by law you take. We would rid ourselves of the legal system and have compassion for one another. Heinous crimes would be met with a public that will not tolerate it and personally decide what to do at the individual and local level. We would have more than enough wealth to disperse once we kill off the parasites, I hate to say violence is the answer but for them it is, every single one of them needs to be eradicated as a surgeon would do to a cancer. No more parasitic jobs or middle men, you would need to have a value.</p>

<p>Once the fear porn ends and healing begins we could share with each other in a way unimaginable. We could have an internet based government that gives jobs to the ones with the highest ratings (amazon like). No more leaders but councils and tons of them with every discipline counted for and an open source open logging nothing hidden based decision making. Children would be at home with their mothers or fathers and maybe 1-2 workdays per week with 5 days of or really personal preference.</p>

<p>These are just some initial musings if anyone wants to chime in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree in getting rid of these fucking monsters (I honestly don&#39;t see them as humans). On the other hand, I have a theory that the violent act that is used can bear a seed in our awareness and that which we detest in our enemies  cannot be fully removed from our collective consciousness without doing it with the very antithesis of violence. 
(complex thought I can&#39;t seem to articulate it better)</p>

<p>I see that we could reconnect with lost knowledge, the understandings of the universe and how we can better fit into our ecosystems so that we can tend to the divine rather than mundaneness in life that is pound into our psyches from the moment of entering into this schizophrenic culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that the ones who are doing the negative things should be removed from society. I do not believe all reptilians are bad and having seen how they operate they have an amazing grasp of how to manipulate space time and matter. However we need to awaken to the fact that the self serving ones which are few are so poisonous it could literally lead to the annihilation of this planet. Maybe you have a better plan to deal with them but I cannot think of anything else but removal from this planet.</p>

<p>I would also take a full confessional and a commitment to help right the wrongs committed, but I feel they are too proud to do so. I would totally back something like this. Watch that recent <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> post McCain interview he lies one second and then flips and lies again. </p>

<p>That sounds a lot like mob justice and lynchings to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I´d recommend reading some anarchist literature(Kropotkin / Bakunin are good starting points imo) for a different idea of what the world could be. I am not saying that these are the ultimate theories on social organizing, but they are definitely worth reading if only to be able to criticize other ideologies. It´s also a good way of stepping out of the right left dichotomy, even though people consider anarchism to be leftist(socialist, communist) it is inherently anti-fascist, anti-state and anti-capitalism(wage slavery) and I would consider it to not fit into the right-left paradigm at all.</p>

<p>There are interesting documentaries about the spanish revolution as well where a largely anarchistic / libertarian socialist revolution was taking place until Stalin/the west/Franco destroyed any chance they had. (rudolf rocker - tragedy of spain is a good read for that specific history)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some notion of anarchism and not in the sense of chaos would follow if we were to do it. Rather, small local regions of ruling would take place and societies would be much more manageable. Do you feel that the populations we are at are too big for such a sweeping transformation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I´m not really qualified enough to answer that(if there is space for it), but I also don´t see our population maintaining this growth long term, and rather we´ll see a correction through mass famine, drought, etc.</p>

<p>I do believe that anarchism in the notion you mentioned there would be best suited to go forward from there, and thus we need to start building these social structures now. Something that is happening with a varying degree worldwide. (Permaculture movement and the likes), one example I can think of is the CIC in Catalunya(funny how history comes back again?) <a href="https://cooperativa.cat/en">https://cooperativa.cat/en</a></p>

<p>The anarchism = chaos has no holding, its just a repeated &quot;truth&quot;. The etymology itself simply means without leaders/rulers. (an - arkhos or something)</p>

<p>But yes, smaller decentralized federated communities would be a good way. It could probably work in cities as well, as it have for short timeframes in the past.</p>

<p>The key without bringing ideologies into it for me is simply devolve, decentralize and horizontalise(not a word?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard Terence Mckenna say that if we want to reduce population, each mother on Earth has one natural child. If all 3.5 billion followed suit, we would have the population cut in half by each generation. I&#39;m not for depopulation in a violent sense but rather in an educated manner. People need to stop having kids because that&#39;s what everyone does. I teach children for a living and though I have love for my students, I know most of them (including myself) are a detriment to the harmony of this world when we live under such dead, cacophony mentality that is passed down from generation to generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, I just think don´t think we have generations before we fuck up to much and a correction comes. And before we start thinking of a child policy we definitely need to solve the patriarchy that exists where men are valued higher than women. China found out that the hard way.</p>
