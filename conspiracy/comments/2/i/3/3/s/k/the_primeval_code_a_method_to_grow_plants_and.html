<p>Seeds of cereal plants and trout roe where exposed to an electrostatic field and then grown naturally. It resulted in them becoming what is considered to be their primeval form. They where much more fertile, fruitfully and robust.</p>

<p>The video was part of a show in the Swiss television in 1988. It has been removed from all the archives and this private copy is the only one left.</p>

<p>The plants needed no fertilizers and pestizides at all. Since Novartis was and is one of the biggest manufacturers of these products worldwide it comes to no surprise that this happened.</p>

<p>I managed to find a copy with English subtitles:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seal your seeds in a non-conductive container and put a plate of metal on each side. Connect the two plates to a high voltage dc generator. You want to have a constant voltage somewhere between 500 and 1000 volts per centimeter of separation between your plates.  For a generator they use a step up transformer with a high voltage diode to rectify the ac to dc. I suspect you could use a van de graaff, or wimshurst generator or potentially a lord kelvin&#39;s waterfall to do the same thing. You want that electrostatic potential around your seeds for weeks, from when they&#39;re fertilized till they sprout/hatch.</p>

<p>Corn is basically just a very large type of grass/grain that gets its size from  artificial selection.  There is nothing in that claim that could not be checked with a simple Google search. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nativetech.org/cornhusk/cornhusk.html">Here is a link to help you out</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over a period of thousands of years, Native Americans purposefully transformed maize through special cultivation techniques. Maize was developed from a wild grass (Teosinte) originally growing in Central America (southern Mexico) 7,000 years ago. The ancestral kernels of Teosinte looked very different from today&#39;s corn. These kernels were small and were not fused together like the kernels on the husked ear of early maize and modern corn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope I didn&#39;t. Just sharing what I find interesting and it seems legit. I have no desire to proove it though. The fact that the patent has been accepted suffices my needs.</p>

<p>There are several books available though and there has been some further research been done by one of the inventors son&#39;s including longtime studies.</p>

<p>I believe the patent is outdated today (AFAIK it&#39;s protected for 20 years, but I could be wrong) and everybody&#39;s free to do his/her own research though. So give it a go and keep us informed... ;)</p>

<p>But that means nothing?  If there was a plot to keep this from everyone then the patent office would of bought the patent themselves for millions of dollars and sealed the patent as classified and had the original inventor sign a gag order.  If the inventor refused to sell then they would refuse to grant a patent.  That right there is no secret and happens from time to time under the claim of &quot; national security&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not fully true. The THC content of cannabis, in the wild, has to do with the location it is growing.  Meaning you could take the strongest strain of pot and planted it out in a field in lets say Wisconsin and let it do its thing with out ever harvesting it.  After 8 to ten generations  the plant would revert back to a non-drug type ( hemp). You could also take hemp and plant it in a field in lets say Brazil and in about the same 8 to 10 generations the plants would convert to drug type cannabis. </p>

<p>Anyways my point is all strains around today originally can from just a handful of wild varieties  from Afghanistan, Vietnam, central Africa, Hawaii and south America.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &quot;primeval&quot; thing is a bit of a misnomer. From what I gather, they started calling it that because the changes that occurred in the fern made the leaves appear similar to some fossilized ferns that no longer exist.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean the treatment is somehow reverting the plant to its &quot;primeval&quot; state, it just means that the treated fern looked, coincidentally, like the ancient fern. The corn, obviously, was not like an ancient corn. Perhaps they should have called it the hulk code.......</p>

<p>..... hang on a minute... could this be the plot for a new hulk movie? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess we disagree. Posting one &quot;lol&quot; does not dismiss all of that, unless he maybe only ever replys Lols on every post, and it definitely did not end your discussion. And saying people that post lol are trying to disrupt civil discourse is just wrong(source:the internet)</p>

<p>But the main thing here is are you really going to let a lol bother you that much? I hope that is the only time you have jumped on a guy for a lol. Imagine what a real troll could do to you. Lol</p>

<p>I never made such a claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I said specifically here, on this subreddit. Not the internet as a whole.  This is a subreddit modeled around the idea that we are all here to discuss things at length.  People that post absolute shit replies like that are usually either dedicated trolls or teenagers that normally stay in the default subs where their short attention spans can be catered to.  By posting a &quot;lol&quot; he is indeed dismissing everything being said in and about that post.  He&#39;s welcome to disagree/agree with whatever he wants, but if you don&#39;t have anything to add to the discussion, why post anything at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the main thing here is are you really going to let a lol bother you that much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just because I took a whole 45 seconds of my day to express a thought or argument something is genuinely bothering me?  I already said I was curious as to why he felt compelled to post that, especially after he already had said something of substance in a different post.  But fuck me for wondering what makes others tick right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope that is the only time you have jumped on a guy for a lol.</p>

<p>Man you sure seem bothered by others opinions and actions on the internet, you should (insert condescending advice here).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine what a real troll could do to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uhhhh make me waste 15 seconds of time before I laugh out loud in real life and move on to more fruitful ventures?  Thats usually the way it goes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a totally appropriate use lol actually.  Can&#39;t beef with ya on that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you might not have said that it ended your discussion, you said it dismissed convo and discussion, which it cannot do, unless you stop your discussion to let it. Seriously the only way for it to affect anything is if you stop and respond to it.</p>

<p>People post single Lols all over the internet, and they don&#39;t just do it to &quot;prevent civil discourse.&quot; Just because you are paranoid and in conspiracy reddit DOES NOT mean that&#39;s what he is doing. Seriously you state it as fact.</p>

<p>And guess what else I&#39;ve learned on the internet, when people try to use the words &quot; i was just curious&quot; and then go on to say I was bothered, are trying to act like the &quot;bigger man&quot; and the normal internet troll thing of &quot;this doesn&#39;t matter to me but it does to you&quot;</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t wondering what makes other tick. You were acting like a little bitch.</p>

<p>You were bothered by the lol. I was bothered by you jumping all over him instead of just moving along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope I didn&#39;t. Just sharing what I find interesting and it seems legit. I have no desire to proove it though. The fact that the patent has been accepted suffices my needs.</p>

<p>There are several books available though and there has been some further research been done by one of the inventors son&#39;s including longtime studies.</p>

<p>I believe the patent is outdated today (AFAIK it&#39;s protected for 20 years, but I could be wrong) and everybody&#39;s free to do his/her own research though. So give it a go and keep us informed... ;)</p>
