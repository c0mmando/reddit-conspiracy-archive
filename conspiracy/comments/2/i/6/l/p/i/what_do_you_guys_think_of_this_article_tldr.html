       Essentially, the article is arguing that using a fever-reducing medicine like Ibuprofen could help infected passengers through screenings without detection --- while they are still contagious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The implications of this, if true, would be staggering. It would cause a great deal of concern, imo.

       Makes sense. Lower fever = less sweat. Less sweat = lower amount of releasing virus into the air through perspiration or leaving sweat on a touched surface.

       Yet ibuprofen is effective for only a few hrs. The concern is that many flights take about eight hrs (from europe to america). Plenty of time for the fever to kick back in once in flight, not to mention once one arrives at their destination airport...

       I feel like you missed the concern that the article was trying to address.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone was infected in africa, and then begin to show symptoms, albeit on the milder side as it is in the beginning stage, they could possibly pass through the "fever checkpoints" at the airports in africa, and board a plane while still being contagious. Once in flight, that infected person could then potentially spread the disease to other passengers..

      <p>
       That was what the article was implying..

       He's confused because you worded that like a retard, or you are one. You don't need to have a fever to infect others, so that wouldn't make sense as your message. So it sounds like you are saying they'd show symptoms again and get caught. Which is why he said what he did.

       Uh no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Per the article (not me), the argument is to use ibuprofen to lower the bodys temperature so as not to be screened at the fever checkpoints they have set up, in order to obtain passage on the flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then said fever--&gt;sweating, and conversely no fever--&gt;no sweating--&gt;lower risk, to whichbi replied ibuprofen only works for a few hrs, and the flights are long enough to allow the fever to get back up, cause sweating, and increase that risk that he said would be lowered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said anything about him getting caught either....

       So then your answer is "nothing". You are not trying to offer any constructive contribution. Have you even read anything in the title, details section, or even the article i linked to in the details section?

       I was hoping that by giving him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he would get back on topic. I dont like to feed trolls, but i hate to assume even more. I get burned alot, like i did now, but its worth the patience imo, as ive had some good discussions with some guys who, at first, seemed like a troll/asshole but turned out to be alright once things were addressed...

       Lmao what? That's a whole lot of assumptions right there buddy. I guess you substitute the lack of information you grasp from text with a wild imagination.

       So the implication is that these people would theoretically be aware that they have ebola but are attempting to board flights anyway?  Why would they be doing that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so skeptical of the entire "outbreak" story - maybe I'm way off here but it all just reads like blatant MSM fear mongering.

       That's pretty much the nature of things when the MSM that's supposed to keep the people informed is actually nothing more than propaganda.  It becomes somewhat difficult to separate the truth from the lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can anyone possibly say it's being downplayed though?  "Ebola, ebola, ebola, ebola!" has been all over every MSM website for the past week, particularly the last few days.  The problem is all of the conflicting information that's been coming out.

       Yeah I read that but do you actually buy it?  Would people really have no qualms whatsoever about infecting the other people on the plane?  Maybe
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       people wouldn't give a fuck but I think that the majority of people would.

       I would hope most would care enough not to do it. But ive seen people do some really selfish things. This behavior/decision isnt beneath some humans, imo.

       Maybe.  I'll agree with you that it's possible but here's my issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there an MSM article being written about this minute possibility?  I'm sure you or I could come up with five other "worst case scenario" possibilities with regards to the ebola outbreak but that doesn't mean that they're credible or something that Americans need to be worried about.  This is what's making me skeptical of all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it being pushed
       <em>
        so hard
       </em>
       by the MSM which we all already know is literal propaganda.  I can see multiple (possible) agendas being pushed and fed by the fear created by articles like this and I just haven't seen enough to convince me that this outbreak is really
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying I'm definitely right, I'm not saying that the outbreak is a hoax, I'm not saying that we all shouldn't remain vigilant - I'm just saying that we should take anything we see in the MSM with a grain of salt, especially when we're being bombarded so heavily with information (some/much of it being contradictory).

       I agree to this, actually. Actually, your entire comment here. I was just interested in what others thought as well.

       I dont really think this outbreak will be of much concern in america. There are many variables against it taking hold. But i acknowledge the possibility, however remote it may be.

       It's probably just fear mongering, but I have read articles of Africans that believe Ebola was created/caused by other nations.  I could see someone wanting to send it back where it came from.
