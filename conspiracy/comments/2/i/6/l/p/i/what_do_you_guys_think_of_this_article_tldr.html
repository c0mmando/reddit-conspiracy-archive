<p>Essentially, the article is arguing that using a fever-reducing medicine like Ibuprofen could help infected passengers through screenings without detection --- while they are still contagious. </p>

<p>The implications of this, if true, would be staggering. It would cause a great deal of concern, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you missed the concern that the article was trying to address.</p>

<p>If someone was infected in africa, and then begin to show symptoms, albeit on the milder side as it is in the beginning stage, they could possibly pass through the &quot;fever checkpoints&quot; at the airports in africa, and board a plane while still being contagious. Once in flight, that infected person could then potentially spread the disease to other passengers..</p>

<p>That was what the article was implying..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh no.</p>

<p>Per the article (not me), the argument is to use ibuprofen to lower the bodys temperature so as not to be screened at the fever checkpoints they have set up, in order to obtain passage on the flight.</p>

<p>He then said fever--&gt;sweating, and conversely no fever--&gt;no sweating--&gt;lower risk, to whichbi replied ibuprofen only works for a few hrs, and the flights are long enough to allow the fever to get back up, cause sweating, and increase that risk that he said would be lowered.</p>

<p>I never said anything about him getting caught either....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.  I&#39;ll agree with you that it&#39;s possible but here&#39;s my issue.</p>

<p>Why is there an MSM article being written about this minute possibility?  I&#39;m sure you or I could come up with five other &quot;worst case scenario&quot; possibilities with regards to the ebola outbreak but that doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re credible or something that Americans need to be worried about.  This is what&#39;s making me skeptical of all of this.</p>

<p>I see it being pushed <em>so hard</em> by the MSM which we all already know is literal propaganda.  I can see multiple (possible) agendas being pushed and fed by the fear created by articles like this and I just haven&#39;t seen enough to convince me that this outbreak is really <em>that</em> bad.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m definitely right, I&#39;m not saying that the outbreak is a hoax, I&#39;m not saying that we all shouldn&#39;t remain vigilant - I&#39;m just saying that we should take anything we see in the MSM with a grain of salt, especially when we&#39;re being bombarded so heavily with information (some/much of it being contradictory).</p>

<p>I agree to this, actually. Actually, your entire comment here. I was just interested in what others thought as well.</p>
