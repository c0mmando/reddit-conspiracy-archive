<p>Flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk - CDC</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A recent NYT report: Ebola: Up to 100 in Texas at Risk of Exposure <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/number-being-screened-for-ebola-in-texas-grows-to-80-1412258558">http://online.wsj.com/articles/number-being-screened-for-ebola-in-texas-grows-to-80-1412258558</a></p>

<p>This raises the question, if ebola is only transferred by direct contact with the person and only when they are symptomatic then are people seriously telling me that this person had physical contact with 100 people in a few days? I doubt I&#39;ve physically touched 100 people in the last year much less a few days. This is obviously about touching surfaces that he has touched which is exactly how the flu is mostly spread. The idea about being airborne matters little.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting sick of these people parroting the same statement over and over about how you can only get ebola from direct contact when the person is symptomatic. It&#39;s an obvious lie. People are ridiculed for concern and told that as long as you aren&#39;t gargling their blood you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> has been shown to have a political agenda: <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2i34tk/texas_officials_say_eighty_people_may_have/ckyqvlh?context=3">https://pay.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2i34tk/texas_officials_say_eighty_people_may_have/ckyqvlh?context=3</a> pushing the &quot;everything is fine&quot; narrative. </p>

<p>Every time there is a new story there is a widely upvoted IAMA or other such story from a large group related to ebola. Yesterday one of the members during one such discussion referred to any opinion outside the norm as emanating from the &quot;sewers of the internet&quot;: <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2i3cyg/we_work_for_local_and_international_aid_groups/ckyoly6?context=3">https://pay.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2i3cyg/we_work_for_local_and_international_aid_groups/ckyoly6?context=3</a></p>

<p>I understand that panic is not good but <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> has shown itself to be a convenient front for whatever the government position is regardless of the objective science. Pathetic.</p>

<p>You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.  It&#39;s contagious in amounts as low as one virus particle, it&#39;s contagious in vomit and diarrhea aerosols as well as from coughed aerosols, the CDC has admitted the same thing.  The CIDRAP advisory I just linked makes it very clear.</p>

<p>Banning flights from known epidemic nations is a great way to start, or at the least checking passengers for any signs of illness. Which has not been done. They can say all they want, but until they take action it is meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%.</p>

<p>Are you aware of the circumstances under which the previous CDC director quit?</p>

<p>You also have to realize that there is mounting evidence and concern of weak-airborne or long-aerosol transmission.  Initially the WHO and CDC were vehemently against the possibility but it&#39;s been coming out of the bag, a very recent example being Frieden&#39;s statement the other day that &quot;we are all connected by the air we breathe.&quot;</p>

<p>Also please understand that I&#39;m not a conspiracy buff, the main reason I read this crap is to counter claims that it&#39;s part of a depopulation agenda, that vaccines are the mark of the beast, etc.</p>

<p>Some of the most experienced Ebola doctors, nurses, and medical staff have contracted the disease and died.  To believe that all of them are treating patients without wearing gloves or following high level contamination prevention protocols is absurd.</p>

<p>Some doctors, nurses, and other medical staff have contracted Ebola.  Some doctors, nurses, and other medical staff have been attacked.  Is your contention that ALL doctors and nurses who have ever contracted Ebola have contracted ebola via attacks by ebola infected individuals who, during the assaults, rubbed bodily fluid and excrement into the wounds?  I think we both know how absurd that line of reasoning is.</p>

<p>To put it simply, for one to believe that Ebola is only passed via direct contact with bodily fluids or excrement requires a suspension of logical reasoning.</p>

<p>So this happened with 100 people?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People can also contract the disease by touching infected fluids and then touching their eyes or mouth. The virus does not spread through the air, unlike measles or chickenpox. And Ebola does not invade healthy skin, so merely touching secretions does not mean an infection will follow. But washing hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is essential after any potential contact, to avoid spreading the virus to other people or to one’s own eyes or mouth. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/understanding-the-risks-of-ebola-and-what-direct-contact-means.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/understanding-the-risks-of-ebola-and-what-direct-contact-means.html</a></p>

<p>Yeah, this sounds nothing like how the flu is mostly spread. Nothing at all. Dude with ebola sneezes into hand, touches doorknob, you touch doorknob and then rub your eye. Are you saying 0% risk?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not worried about myself but I am concerned about the government&#39;s response to this. It&#39;s not insane to block flights from ebola hotspots as many countries already have: <a href="https://www.internationalsos.com/ebola/index.cfm?content_id=435&amp;amp;language_id=ENG">https://www.internationalsos.com/ebola/index.cfm?content_id=435&amp;amp;language_id=ENG</a></p>

<p>Recently an American cameraman was diagnosed with it: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/health/ebola-nbc-ashoka-mukpo/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/health/ebola-nbc-ashoka-mukpo/index.html</a></p>

<p>Maybe he was directly touching ebola patients that were also symptomatic, maybe not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also concerning that just one person can cause 100 people to have to be monitored. They are not quarantined but still there are resources being diverted toward them. If ebola even spread very mildly you can see the exponential amount of resources that will be required. Troubling. Each patient requires tens of people (maybe hundreds) and extreme precautions (hazmat suits) and planes cannot be properly sterilized.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 100 possible contacts, meaning people who might have touched something he touched, etc.  They are just trying to be on the safe side.  As well they should be.</p>

<p>I agree with you about &quot;everything is fine&quot; and the narrative.  They have to look like they are in total control for political reasons, and a lot of people don&#39;t want their safety to be questioned.  Also this is the first time I have seen significant numbers of people I suspected to be shills.</p>

<p>At the same time I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the disease in the US or other first world countries.  If it does ramp up it will take a long time to do so and there will be ample time to prepare.</p>

<p>One thing you have to realize about the flu is that flu cases don&#39;t generate a heavy response from public health authorities.  After seeing what&#39;s going on in Liberia you can expect them to treat it deadly seriously.  </p>

<p>In fact I bet the response is going to be so overwhelming that people on this sub are going to be completely losing their shit.</p>

<p>This is exactly my point. The official narrative repeated like some sort of robot is that you have to have direct contact with the person, not contact with something they had contact with. Of course, that&#39;s absurd b/c 100 people didn&#39;t touch him but here we are. Contradictory official narrative being parroted by officials and media types.</p>

<p>Last night when they were interviewing Nancy Snyderman about her cameraman and the fact that they were all going to be quarantined she said exactly the same line, almost as if reading from a script:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really, you cannot catch Ebola from someone if that person isn’t experiencing symptoms. And symptoms really include looking sick, feeling achy, and being exposed to bodily fluids, vomit, diarrhea, blood, urine, or sweat. We have mitigated those chances by being very careful. <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dr-nancy-snyderman-colleagues-ebola-diagnosis">http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dr-nancy-snyderman-colleagues-ebola-diagnosis</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what she said is technically true but it&#39;s a lie by omission. You can also catch it from surfaces that infected people have touched. That is what&#39;s being omitted and purposely so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are indeed lying by omission, by &quot;simplifying&quot; the story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact that the primary transmission mechanism is thus and so.  But their party line is that the primary transmission route is the only one and that&#39;s just not the case.  Though it is the primary route.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, that&#39;s absurd b/c 100 people didn&#39;t touch him but here we are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we don&#39;t know that.  We don&#39;t know who he touched and who he didn&#39;t.  My guess is these people also include airline passengers who sat near him or in his seat.  Which again is pretty disturbing and exposes half truths in the official narrative.</p>

<p>At the same time though the large number of people under observation is the CDC erring on the safe side.</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;m not personally very worried about it.  I don&#39;t like it very much that we&#39;re getting half truths and trickle truth.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think the idea is that he himself had contact with 100 people.  They come up with that number from something that is probably more along these lines:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They see he has had contact with 4 people in the past few days</p></li>
<li><p>They examine those 4 people, and see that in total, those 4 people have come into contact with 22 other people</p></li>
<li><p>They examine those 22 other people and look at who they have come into contact with</p></li>
<li><p>They conclude that up to 100 people are now at risk, based on the activities of the aforementioned 27 people</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I agree the &quot;symptomatic&quot; part throws a wrench into all of this, but I also agree that that statement is either bullshit or a mistake.  The idea that you could only catch Ebola virus from a person showing obvious symptoms does not sound correct to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Recently&quot;? They have shown a strong political agenda on some issues for a long time - e.g., global warming. (Although lately the fervor for that example in particular is slowly [puts eyeglasses] cooling down.)</p>

<p>That is not exactly surprising. Since traditional religions are loosing influence in the West, Science became the new god and scientists (or rather scientific-sounding mouthpieces) the clergy. They are politically used to justify a lot of stuff based on the theological argument of &quot;sin against reason&quot;, so to speak. And in doing so they wallow in all the fallacies that the true scientific method should avoid at all costs, like the argument to authority and <em>argumentum ad populum</em> (&quot;this is true because everyone believes it is&quot;).</p>
