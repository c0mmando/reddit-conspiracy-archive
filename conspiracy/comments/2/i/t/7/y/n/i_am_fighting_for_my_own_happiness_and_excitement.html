       As the Federal Reserve Bank / Central Bank exists you are being been stolen from in at least 3 ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The theft of interest on counterfeit money (money that was not gotten by working and creating businesses and jobs) and charged to you as taxpayer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Theft by inflation, where the counterfeit money causes the money you have saved and work for to lose power because products cost more now.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Theft by complete control of the money supply, by being able to print money, and raise and lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve Bank can swing the economy back and forth and make money by selling and buying stocks and other instruments at opportune times they themselves create.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Efforts by Congress to Abolish the Federal Reserve Banking are already underway, however you must give it MASSIVE public support, so get the word out now:

        http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/02/federal-reserve-board-abolition-act-hits-congress/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       S. 209, the Senate version to more deeply audit the Fed, is also alive as the 113th Congress draws to a close late this year. Time is of the essence, apply strong pressure on both houses of Congress to revive this movement to make the Fed Reserve history. Call Capitol Hill at 202-224-3121 or 225-3121.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another method to be used in parallel to abolish the Federal Reserve is the Constitutional Convention option, the threshold for a Constitutional Convention has been reached, since over 34 states have called for one:

       You cannot abolish something like this. You need to find legal work-arounds to the dollar if you do not like it and them convince others to do the same.

       Yes, you absolutely CAN abolish it, if enough Americans called their Representatives and said they simply will not vote for anyone unless the candidate is for abolishment of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve would be abolished very, very quickly.

       I agree that this is technically possible, although I would argue it is unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would pretty much need to coordinate a virtual vote out and defeat of
       <strong>
        all incumbents
       </strong>
       in their respective primaries for the next 2 cycles, and replace the majority if our bicameral legislature with younger, more in touch critical thinkers who are not beholden to corporations and are trustworthy enough to somehow get elected, then to actually vote for this drastic change (need 2/3 majority in both for an amendment, remember).
      </p>
      <p>
       This would require a massive amount of coordination (that doesn't exist), a well-informed electorate (that doesn't exist), 500+ strategically and geographically located candidates, and run successful micro campaigns (currently don't exist, or are busy working on this in super secret).
      </p>
      <p>
       Up to the task? My argument is my is this is far more difficult to pull this off than to find local solutions to local problems, find alternatives to Federal Reserve Notes whenever possible, and build up a local, trustworthy group of people who want to work constructively together for A Better Tomorrow™.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...or maybe my solution could potentially nurture a situation where your solution is possible.

       No, this is NOT the only way. The Federal Reserve could be abolished with a Constitution Convention, the necessary threshold of 34 States calling for a Constitutional Convention has already been reached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you just need to call your State Representatives, and tell them you want the Federal Reserve Bank abolished in the Constitutional Convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, also tell your Congressional Representatives to abolish it as well.

       The last time the US held a Constitutional Convention, the richest bankers and lawyers got together in May of 1787 and emerged months later from secret meetings in Philadelphia with private security details to keep it secret. The delegates were sent to deal with issues plaguing the fledgling nation, most notably security (with Daniel Shays up in Weatern Massachusetts) and interstate commerce and obligations. They emerged with a strong federal government modeled after the British model (surprise!).
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked what they came up with, Ben Franklin is quoted as saying, "A republic, if you can keep it."
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Through ~120 years of legislation, judicial review and executive orders, this government has evolved into the monstrosity it is today, completely beholden to corporations. You think that was an accident?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I was alluding to is - if a Convention gets declared... What makes you think the delegates would be beholden to this Abolish The Fed idea? The original founders crafted a Constitution with no mention of a Central Bank (part of the revolution was fought for financial independence after the Crown continually squeezed the young colonies with the Currency Acts). But then Hamilton established the First Bank Of The United States shortly after ratification in 1791.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment was merely alluding to the fact that a Convention could go swimmingly well, or in the complete opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you knew all that, right?

       Be careful. I hear that's a naughty word around here. Haven't been called a Shill in awhile though, that was refreshing.

       The Constitutional Convention of 1787 produced the Constitutional Government we have today,  the best from of government in existence, which gives people FREEDOM, and the Federal Reserve is presently taking FREEDOM away from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Constitutional Government, is now being corrupted by the Federal Reserve Bank Act of 1913, which established the Federal Reserve, and which was snuck through Congress on Christmas Eve 1913 when hardly any Representatives were present, and signed into law by Woodrow Wilson who later regretted what he had done:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence.
       <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Woodrow_Wilson">
        https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Woodrow_Wilson
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the Federal Reserve Bank is the very thing that is making Our Government completely beholden to big banks and corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it is Our time to remove the Federal Reserve Bank which is privately owned and has been UNCONSTITUTIONAL since its inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can now abolish the Federal Reserve Bank at the upcoming Constitutional Convention of 2016, and return to a true Constitutional Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve Bank exists UNCONSTITUTIONALLY, and puts government by the people, for the people, into the hands a very few who privately own it, and are using it to completely commandeer Our Constitutional Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitutional Convention of 2016 will allow the true the wishes of the people to be heard, the Federal Reserve Bank abolished, and our FREEDOM retained for Our Happiness and Prosperity, not given away to the foreigners who own the Federal Reserve.

       First off, we agree that the Fed is corrupt and based on Modern Money Mechanics and the basis of fractional reserve banking, it is literally (I hate using that word but it works here) impossible to pay off a national debt (as all new dollars exist as debt with interest added on).
      </p>
      <p>
       We agree that changes need to be made, however I am skeptical and hesitant to entrust this big of a change to delegates at a convention that would be tasked with amending our Constitution, unless it is direct in focus and has a specific strategic plan (ie, declaring the private creation of currency to be unlawful or something to that effect). If you can somehow guarantee this, I'm all for it as a solution. I would happily represent my fellow Americans in participating. However, we see that 'both sides' (false dichotomy, gotta love it) are bought and paid for by corporations today. What makes you think the convention delegates would be any different? This is my argument and hesitation. Now to your post!

       What makes you say that the FED is unconstitutional? The courts? They haven't ruled that way. And in your system of government, you have a select group of judicial elites who are appointed for life and are not beholden to citizens. And this is the
       <strong>
        best form of government
       </strong>
       ? You elect state legislatures who appoint electoral college delegates, who vote for your President.  Your President appoints the Justices, who are approved by (bought and paid for) Congress. You think these courts are beholden to you? They are beholden to

       It might! It might not, too. There's our third FREEDOM, by the way, so if you had the last sentence for it That's A Bingo for you! I fear that the FED is far from all that ails the plebes of this country, but it would be a monumental first step. I am just not as all-in to the convention idea.

       The Federal Reserve Bank is UNCONSTITUTIONAL:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed was never in the plan of the Founding Fathers who drafted the Constitution. In 1913 the Congress shirked their constitutional responsibilities concerning the nation’s money and handed it over to a private corporation in the form of a central banking system.  The Federal Reserve System is not a part of our federal government, and there is no reserve of real money (gold and silver), and it is not constitutional. -Ron Paul
      </p>
      <p>
       "Congress created the Federal Reserve, yet it had no constitutional authority to do so. We forget that those powers not explicitly granted to Congress by the Constitution are inherently denied to Congress and thus the authority to establish a central bank never was given." -Ron Paul

       Except
       <strong>
        your constitution
       </strong>
       contains something known as the Necessary and Proper Clause in Article 1 of the Constitution:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This clause was successfully argued by Alexander Hamilton when defending the notion that the newly established federal government could charter a central bank, arguing that currency regulation and creation fell to the federal government, of which they could contract out the services.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also used to defend the Second Bank of the United States in McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819, when the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has 'implied powers' other than those strictly enumerated by constitutional authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't worry, the Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause,
       <strong>
        built into your Constitution
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So here are two
       <strong>
        concrete examples
       </strong>
       of one of your founding fathers using language in a document
       <strong>
        he helped create
       </strong>
       to justify
       <strong>
        a central bank
       </strong>
       . Isn't this something I have been warning about all night with you and your convention talk? It's at least plausible, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you going to come back and hit me with more Ron Paul stuff? You seem slightly out of your league, which is OK. We all need to start somewhere.

       Ok, now your starting to stumble, have you had a few drinks in the last few hours, or lots of Fluoride Coffee?, if so, THAT'S OK!
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of your overall argument, while looking at your previous posts, is that you believe the Federal Reserve is Constitutionally justified under the Necessary and Proper Clause:
      </p>
      <p>
       "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers..."
      </p>
      <p>
       To be truthful, the history of the Federal Reserve Bank, along with the proven fruitfulness of countries that use a Value Based Currency rather then a Fiat Currency which the Federal Reserve Bank imposes on the US, proves in crystal that the Federal Reserve Bank is NOT necessary within the context of the above concept you posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the Federal Reserve should be immediately abolished, because it is UNCONSTITUTIONAL and NOT NECESSARY or NEEDED.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just try a little harder to wrap your head around it, you can do it. Also, you should clarify your stance, or your arguments will be no more coherent than mashed dogshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there is a Necessary and Proper clause in the Constitution, however creation of the Federal Reserve Bank cannot be justified as Constitutional under it, due to the reasons I just mentioned.

       Not once have I argued that it is necessary. I have merely stated that a convention may not be the ultimate solution towards abolishing the FED, because last time we head one [a convention] the 13 confederate States were reorganized into 13 states, subservient to Washington, DC. And in this unifying document, loopholes were inserted to allow the chartering of a private central bank by the then-Secretary of the Treasury (Hamilton), who
       <strong>
        helped write the constitution to begin with

       Again the point you made that the Constitutional Convention of 1787 was a failure was destroyed earlier, because it is known the Constitutional Convention of 1787 created the best governmental document in history, which is "Government for the People by the People", and protects OUR FREEDOM (which the Federal Reserve is strongly trying to remove).

       Ok, you then agree that the Federal Reserve is UNCONSTITUTIONAL because it is NOT NECESSARY when examined under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, and therefore it should be immediately abolished by any means necessary, including the Constitutional Convention in 2016, which will likely protect FREEDOM again like the Constitutional Convention of 1787 did.

       You really aren't understanding the Necessary and Proper Clause. It allows Congress to act to make laws that they deem to be necessary and proper to run a nation. It is essentially a blank check for powers not enumerated in the Constitution itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the words of the Constitution, if Congress says they can do it, they can do it (because they deem setting up a charter for a private central bank to run a nation's currency necessary and proper). If the executive signs off on it, it becomes law (obviously). Therefore, it is up to the judiciary to state that it is unconstitutional, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in MucCulloch v. Maryland, the Supreme Court argued that Congress
       <strong>
        did
       </strong>
       have power to create the bank. Remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in sum, all three branches of government (the legislature who were fooled by the central bankers in Jekyll Island, the executive who was duped into signing it and later regretting it, and the Supreme Court that has previously shown that it's OK to do).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, nobody's working for you. Not generally, at least. Which brings me back to my point earlier about having to vote EVERYONE out. Because it's the only way. Get it?

      <p>
       This is a FALSE statement. The Necessary and Proper Clause is not a "Blank Check", what ever is being considered under it must be proven to be NECESSARY.  Again, the Federal Reserve Bank was NEVER proven to be NECESSARY, and the Federal Reserve's history only reaffirms this fact.
At least it seems you agree that the Federal Reserve MUST BE IMMEDIATELY ABOLISHED BECAUSE IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
      </p>

       And no, we don't need to vote 100% of the politicians out because many of them are trying to abolish the Federal Reserve right now.

       We need to reduce the power of staunch opposers to abolishment of the Federal Reserve, those who are clearly on the side of the New World Order must be removed from Our Government immediately, this means all the Zionists that have infiltrated into positions in Our Government.
      </p>

       The Constitutional Convention of 2016 will overpower any Zionist opposition to the abolishment of the Federal Reserve Bank.

       A Constitutional Convention by nature AUTOMATICALLY PRECLUDES any Supreme Court ruling on any issue the Constitutional Convention considers. So yes, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WILL BE ABOLISHED AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 2016.

       Until the convention runs away from you when the delegates are all representatives of the 0.1% (because all of our representatives are, anyway...) and they install a government even more authoritarian and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that happened
       <em>

       No, the Articles of Confederation were abolished because the States would not pay taxes to support an Army, and this caused the US to be weak at attempts of takeover from abroad. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 fixed this issue by establishing the Federal Government, the sole purpose of which is to protect Our FREEDOM.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now the US is weak at attempts at takeover by infiltration of government by foreigners, this is the case with the Congressional Representatives that support the Federal Reserve Bank, which is a result of all the Isreali-American dual citizenship holders in Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the Constitutional Convention of 2016, will again, like the Constitutional Convention of 1787, protect Our FREEDOM from Zionist infiltration of government that puts all the power into the hands of the few owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, Corporations, and Big Banks.
