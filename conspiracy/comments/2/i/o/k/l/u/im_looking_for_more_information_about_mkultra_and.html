       I'm looking for test subjects or side programs that may have continued after the initial MKUltra was supposedly stopped.  For all I know it never did.  The subject is just fascinating.  Any help/links would be much appreciated.

       Disney employs "script transmission."
      </p>
      <p>
       Timothy Leary prior to 1961 co-invented Transactional Analysis.  When he published evidence that Army officers have pathological personalities,  his wife committed suicide and his CIA handlers tasked him with taking Ayahuasca, then LSD.  That removed him from the academic world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eric Berne took over for Leary at the Presidio.  He brought his theory of life scripts.   Eventually he published the book,  "What Do You Say After You Say Hello?" which covers script transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney read this stuff,  which is the foundation of today's mind control,  and put it in his children's films.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TA books are sinister.   Most intelligent people who read them fall into a mind control trap.  They put the book down, finished.  About a week later they apply for a government job.

       You are welcome.  But I cannot overstate the dangers of reading these books.  Get a "buddy" to monitor your personality as you read the books -- someone who knows you well.  Their job is to keep you from signing up for the Army or something similar when you are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a month ago, I recommended those two books
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       to a dude, then told him we needed to get coffee.  We still haven't gotten coffee, but he is posting on facebook asking for people with connections to DARPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       Games People Play and What Do You Say After You Say Hello? are the "two books" by Berne.

       As far as the media goes, we laugh when the subject if North Korean citizens being in the dark about most things and blindly clinging to nationalism and remarking of how Kim Ill Sung hits hole-in-ones all day (and other awesome NK lore). But when you look inward, and see the big, foam America #1 fingers at the Independence Day celebrations, and then find that most of what the public consumes as news is bullshit, how are we really that much different?

       Sure, we don't have 'work camps,' but we do have mandatory minimum sentencing laws, and ridiculous penalties for smoking a plant that grows anywhere. We should be ashamed.

       Good on you. They get hooked, then start watching shows for the particular age group of 11-17, which is an EXTREMELY impressionable time in their life. The shows that they have for teens and pre-teens are garbage.

       First we have
       <a href="http://www.markdice.com/documents/MindWar_co_authored_by_Michael%20Aquino.pdf">
        From PSYOP to Mindwar: The Psychology of Victory
       </a>
       which was co-written by intelligence officer and noted Satanist Michael Aquino and came out of the psy-op headquarters at Presidio.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second is a book by Dr. Robert Duncan AKA "The Saint" called
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_matrix57.htm">
        The Matrix Deciphered.
       </a>
       He explains in detail much of the current mind control technology that exists and how it works.

       This. It's all mushroomed off of MKUltra Subproject 119- "the remote electronic activation of the human organism." Dr. Duncan explains it well, and everyone in this sub should read that book, it's free online. His second is available on Amazon. He was also featured in the Jesse Ventura Conspiracy Theory show "Brain Invaders"- he's speaking the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- Also of interest is "Monarch-The New Phoenix Program." It's available free online in documentary or pdf format and discusses Aquino, Psychotronics, and current non-consensual mind control tests being done on the public right now.

       Yep - he was LaVey's "second in command" before going on to found a "spin-off" Satanic cult/religion/organization called the Temple of Set in the 1970's.  He was also implicated in ritual child abuse by multiple victims and witnesses.  Pretty interesting rap sheet for a PSYOPS officer if I may say so.

       I want to say I saw a documentary about him and some military ritual killings.  I may be way off because it's been at least a decade since I saw that documentary.  Thanks for reminding me of who and what he was.

       Was it
       <strong>
        Conspiracy of Silence
       </strong>
       ?  I'm pretty sure his name is mentioned in that - I could be wrong though, been a while since I've seen it.

      <p>
       But anyway, if you
       <em>

       seen it you should definitely check it out if and when you have some time.

       Well, look at the primary methods of "brain washing" in MKUltra - repetition of phrases (putting tape recorders under people's pillows, etc), and inducement of an altered state to make the brain more receptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays there is a free flow of Benzo type drugs that induce a suggestive state, lack of anxiety, reduction of emotion - and a constant repetition of themes through the combination of traditional and "social" media, as well as entertainment media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, not even touching on specific targeting, there has been a broader approach to keep people induced into staying part of the national storyline and accepting it without much reaction.

       Removing moral judgment; Mkultra was an experiment. They found a way to monetize the results of the experiment in television &amp; to a lesser extent in college textbooks.
