       From
       <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/07/ebola-how-to-stage-a-fake-epidemic/">
        this article
       </a>
       by Jon Rappoport:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The two primary diagnostic tests for Ebola—the antibody and the PCR—are completely useless for verifying the presence of millions of Ebola virus in a patient—which is what you need to begin to say that patient is an “Ebola case.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In fact, Dr. Kary Mullis,
       <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/the-ebola-test-let-the-tests-inventor-speak/">
        the inventor of the PCR test
       </a>
       (which earned him a Nobel prize), admits that the PCR test is insufficient to determine
       <em>
        how much
       </em>
       virus is in a person's body.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a
       <a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm">
        1996 article by John Lauritsen
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kary Mullis is thoroughly convinced that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. With regard to the viral-load tests, which attempt to use PCR for counting viruses, Mullis has stated: ‘Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron.’
       </p>
       <p>
        PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers. Although there is a common misimpression that the viral-load tests actually count the number of viruses in the blood, these tests cannot detect free, infectious viruses at all; they can only detect proteins that are believed, in some cases wrongly, to be unique to HIV. The tests can detect genetic sequences of viruses, but not viruses themselves.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rappoport continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Therefore, the CDC’s gold standard for testing Ebola patients says nothing about whether they are sick or will become sick. It says nothing about why some patients do become sick.
       </p>
       <p>
        And upon this foundation of sand, the whole “Ebola epidemic” is being foisted on the public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rappoport continues to draw parallels with AIDS, citing
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941523039/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0941523039&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20&amp;linkId=37JKSFT4YJPW6HLQ">
        his own research from 1988
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is absolutely no reason to say that HIV causes what is called AIDS. Once you subtract HIV from the official story, what are you left with...a number of people who present an array of illnesses and symptoms. But without HIV, the ‘glue’ that held them all together vanishes. So now you have sick people.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have them in Africa, in New York, San Francisco, Haiti, and other places. Yes, they are sick and they are dying. But that doesn’t make an epidemic, because the tiny virus that was supposed to be at the bottom of all this is missing from the equation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tells you how to invent a fake epidemic. You take many sick and dying people, and you claim there is one germ that is causing all the trouble. You promote a few diagnostic tests that ‘will confirm the presence of the germ’ and you tell people they must be tested.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the tests don’t really confirm the presence of the germ. They’re deceptive and useless. Of course, the test will register positive in many cases. These positive people are said to be victims of the one germ that is at the root of the epidemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        You tie together and link together people who are sick and dying for various reasons, and you claim they’re all dying because of the One Germ. That gives you a powerful psychological ploy, because people are always looking for the one unified thing that explains a whole host of disturbing facts. You give them what they want.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The same thing happened with the "SARS" fiasco:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the case of “the SARS epidemic” in 2003, it was “the coronavirus.” A Canadian microbiologist working for the World Health Organization, Frank Plummer, inadvertently blew the whistle on the scam when he told reporters, stunningly, that the percentage of SARS patients who actually “had the virus” was shrinking from month to month. In fact, finally, the percentage was approaching zero.
       </p>
       <p>
        This rank absurdity was duly reported in the press by brain-dead journalists, and everyone moved on, unaware that a bomb had just exploded. How could these people be called “SARS cases,” when the one and only cause of SARS, “the coronavirus,” wasn’t present in their bodies?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And don't forget AZT:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the case of HIV, it was even worse, because the people who were diagnosed as “HIV-positive,” as a result of useless and misleading antibody tests, were given a drug called AZT.
       </p>
       <p>
        AZT was a failed chemotherapy drug sitting on the shelves of the US National Institutes of Health. It had been there for nearly 25 years. It was doled out to patients with orders that they take it every day for the rest of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        To say AZT is highly toxic is a vast understatement. It attacks all cells of the body, including cells of the immune system. So when patients began dying as a result, doctors blithely assured one and all that “the AIDS disease had accelerated” and the deaths had nothing to do with AZT. This gives you a clue about how medical criminals can target specific populations.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, gay men in America were heavily promoted to “take the AIDS test.” The propaganda was relentless. Naturally, a percentage of the tested men showed up positive on, again, the useless and misleading antibody test. They were dosed with what amounts to a chemical warfare agent. AZT. Many died.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rappoport continues by mentioning his interview with a researcher connected with the San Francisco Men's Study, the largest HIV study involving gay men:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This piece of research tracked men who had been diagnosed as HIV to see what happened to them over the course of many years. Of course, all of them were taking AZT. A huge percentage of them fell ill and died.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there was a subset of men who remained healthy for 8-10 years and were still healthy. The common denominator? They never took AZT, or they stopped taking it. I asked the researcher why the organizers of the Study didn’t trumpet this fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         She said they didn’t think it was very important.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Not important? According to the conventional “science,” these men should be dead. They weren’t. They were healthy. They didn’t take the drug.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the kind of “science” that is used to bolster fake epidemics. Real death, false reason.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My two cents:
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these sick and dying individuals may not even have "ebola" as is being so ruthlessly pushed right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they do, and even if an "epidemic" spreads, it's the
       <em>
        treatment
       </em>
       we need to be concerned about. Whether it be experimental vaccines or some sort of antiviral drug, it's going to make some folks filthy rich and it's going to maim and kill the majority who take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like AZT, they can then just blame these casualties on the disease and not the toxic treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay educated and safe, and don't let them get to you with the fear-mongering bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all in this together, even the psychopaths running the asylum.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're running out of time and they're beginning to lose the information war, hence the pulling out of all the stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that the ability to completely fool the population is becoming a thing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why, as they turn up the heat, we need to be awake and ready.

       Holy moley is this ever absurd.  This makes AIDS denialism look plausible by comparison.  AIDS at least was a very strange symptom cluster that was difficult to identify at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       This?  Wow.  Ebola is very clearly a hemorrhagic fever.  We are very familiar with hemorrhagic fevers and how they behave in primates and in humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can isolate the virus.  When injected into monkeys or rodents it very quickly produces fulminating cases of hemorrhagic fever.  It's communicable.  When we isolate the virus from animals that contracted it from the first it's the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ebola is not something that is hard to spot.  It's pretty obvious.  It has such high presence in the blood and serum and cells, and it causes so much cell damage, that it can't hide, and was in fact spotted and identified very early on because what it leaves behind is scorched earth.

      <p>
       Like AIDS drugs?  Remember when AIDS was fatal, a death sentence?  People think science and medicine are infallible and then when they take years to develop entirely new drugs or when the drugs are rough at first they're very quick to point fingers.

      <p>
       That's ludicrous.  First, vaccines are cheap.  So cheap that it's difficult to get drug companies to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, and I'll quote it again because it's astounding me so much:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it's going to maim and kill the majority who take it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What?  What's it going to do?  It would have to be pretty damn bad to be worse than ebola.  It would have to have worse than an EIGHTY PERCENT KILL RATE to be worse than ebola.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put that another way:
       <strong>
        It would have to be almost three times as bad as smallpox.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a person with no education and no critical thinking skills, and I suspect some sort of cognitive problem, quoting people with the same sort of deficits and the result is a pile of stinking, mindblowing bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're doing is analogous to denying the bacterial theory of disease.  It's not the sickness, it's the medicine that actually kills.  Brilliant.

       Vaccination is an established and very difficult to patent process.  Once ramped up, they run around $3 per dose and require government subsidies in order to get drug companies to produce them.  This is why we run out of vaccine stocks.

       Now just a point about patenting of disease genomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to have these diseases sequenced so that we can make drugs that work against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sequencing genomes costs money and while it's drastically decreased thanks to Venter and others it's still a fairly complicated process and in the case of ebola it's even extremely dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who do the sequencing need to get paid somehow.  There has to be something to induce them to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the government patents something it's usually to prevent others from doing the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intellectual property law is a huge headache and has so many weird crannies and loopholes that it borders on nonsensical.

       You might be able to agree on it but based on the information I've accumulated in 15 years of biotech investment it's impossible for drug companies to profit from such a small per-dose cost and thus they either need to be strong-armed or subsidized in order to get them to produce vaccine.  The Polio vaccine costs about $2 per dose.  The E-D68 virus, since that is a simple enterovirus, will fall to the same vaccine production process as Polio and thus they will not be able to sell the vaccine for a sufficient amount to interest drug companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, an ebola vaccine might be odd in some way and that might be a patentable process and they might be able to charge something for it.  How exactly they will make an ebola vaccine is a different question-- it might very well be something like killed or attenuated Reston but the danger of ebola makes that seem unlikely at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realize that these guys have limited bioreactor space and they would rather use that space on something patentable and wildly profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       A possible vaccine methodology might be taking surface proteins from harmless regions of the ebola envelope and grafting them into some virus that is easily attenuated with long-standing safe use in vaccines.  That way the immune system would be tricked into producing antibodies for ebola.  That's how the current prospective vaccine works and that requires boosters at 10 month intervals... we can do better.

      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember back when AIDS was a slatewiper among gays?
       <a href="http://wearewarriorsblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/aids-victims-canada1.jpg">
        This
       </a>
       is the way terminal AIDS manifested.
      </p>
      <p>
       In western countries this does not happen anymore and it's because of inhibitor cocktails.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people take them, they live.  They have an amazing remission rate.  If they stop taking them, they very rapidly spiral down and this is supported by their T-cell numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another way his claim is ridiculous.  Gays STILL engage in self destructive drug parties but they just don't die the way they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as Callen says at 12:30, children die who catch it from their parents.  Monkeys catch AIDS if they are injected with the AIDS virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he's saying just doesn't make any sense.

       If you claim that I'm "straw manning" him, expound on your ideas of what his argument is.  I've been familiar with Duesberg and his arguments, more so than the vast majority of other people since my girlfriend on and off in the early to mid 1990s WORKED WITH DUESBERG, and that is my distillation of what his argument is.

       Understand, while Duesberg turned out to be a lunatic and totally wrong, early on his claims weren't that outlandish, considering that HIV wasn't the kill mechanism: you'd see anything from fungus pneumonia to staph to thrush to bizarre cancers we'd never seen before in any numbers.  (One wonders if previously they might have been HIV-related.)  Basically he claimed that the presence of HIV virus was just another of these weird opportunistic infections and the root cause was something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       30 years later it's pretty easy to throw darts.

       That's my summation of Duesberg's argument as someone who was one degree removed from Duesberg and the debate.  He was claiming that it was a massively unhealthy lifestyle that caused AIDS to occur and that HIV was just one of numerous opportunistic infections.  I don't know what you're saying but that was certainly my understanding of his claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I don't have two more hours of my life to spend on Duesberg, would you mind encapsulating?  How do you perceive his argument?

       My wife has hepatitis C and has to get expensive tests all the time to determine her "viral load" or how many viruses she has running around in her body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the funny thing, every single doc we go to asks for the viral load, and every single one says the number doesn't indicate anything at all. I have worked in an analytical lab most of my life, the answers to my questions about the quantitation on this were kind of ridiculous from that context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was like seriously? You guys require this test of everybody all the time that have Hep-C and you have determined no correlation between load and infection? That is a TON of data. There are like 10 million people with Hep-C in the US right now. Why even do the test?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: The only thing it indicates is an active infection. When viral load is = 0, that indicates the infection is likely no longer communicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where am I going with all this? I am saying quantitation may not matter. If I took my wife's blood and injected it into me, I will most likely get Hep-C right now. And that will remain the case whether her viral load is 1,200,000 like it is right now, or 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: BTW I think a lot the ebola fearmongering is just that. I just thought I would share some info on the lack of understanding that exists regarding what active virus counts actually mean in the medical community in general.

       Without doubt. But that doesn't mean it is worthless. My problem is they put a number on data that is really only an indication of Presence/Absence. Presence/Absence is a typical and valid microbiological result evaluation that is given when that is all that can or needs to be known.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm unsure with Ebola, but it looks like if the virus is present, you got Ebola, same with Hep-C. The number doesn't matter. Your immune system might fight it off and you could survive, but that does not mean you are not contagious, or that you do not have an actual virus, as OP seems to be saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on that, I will not be making sweet love to the excretions of anyone that has tested positive for Ebola. I'm not stocking up on environmental suits and packing my camping gear just yet, but to say just because they don't know to what degree people are infected is a reason to deny an infection exists at all is a bit foolhardy.

       I have also read things like this in which I question the validity of testing methods and results. It seems that testing methods can and do result in a false negative. Dr. Brantley's first test came back negative. All sides of the issue should be looked at and considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q: How is Ebola virus infection diagnosed?
      </p>
      <p>
       A: Early diagnosis is tricky, because at the beginning of infection symptoms are non-specific and could represent more common diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person has early symptoms AND has had contact with someone sick with Ebola, or has been in an impacted region, the protocol is to isolate them and notify public health officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laboratory tests used in diagnosis are the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the CDC:
      </p>
      <p>
       Within a few days after symptoms begin:
      </p>
      <p>
       Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing
IgM ELISA
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Virus isolation
Later in disease course or after recovery:
      </p>
      <p>
       IgM and IgG antibodies
These testing methods take anywhere from 12 hours to four days to show results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those tests are not entirely foolproof, though:
      </p>
      <p>
       One test for Ebola, the indirect fluorescence assay, is known to have a rather low specificity, and therefore a rather high false negative rate.  PCR testing has also been known to miss cases of affliction. (source)
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, it is possible for an Ebola test to be negative when the person actually does have Ebola.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Brantly’s first Ebola test was negative:
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Dr. Brantly’s employer, Samaritan’s Purse, a U.S.-based international relief organization that has operated in Liberia for 13 years, Dr. Brantly first felt ill July 23 but tested negative. Despite that negative result, he was placed into isolation—a provident decision. His symptoms soon worsened, and a repeat test on Friday night showed evidence of the virus. (source)
      </p>
      <p>
       Rapid tests that show results IMMEDIATELY have been developed, but have yet to be approved for use.
      </p>

       While im not sure if i can agree to parts that say the viruses arent responsible, i do agree that it is the treatment thereof that should he considered with skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of ebola, almost everyone outside of africa so far has received some sort of experimental treatment. Some still died. This is ignored while they prop up those that survived. They instantly say it was because of the treatment, when people in africa have survived their infection without any treatment at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is this lack of a control population within their studies that make this ploy dangerous. If they give it to a hundred people, and sixty still die bit forty survive, they will undoubtedly say the treatment saved them, when in reality, the odds are that forty of them will survive without treatment at all (assuming a mortality rate of 60%).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldnt personally go so far as to say this isnt a real outbreak, or even to dismiss the possiboe severity of it. There is no need to fake an outbreak, in this case. The end result is the same --- their treatments make them a lot of money and is accepted as a viable treatment for the infection when in reality it may do absolutely nothing or worse --- cause harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, i contend that this fearmongering isnt so much an embellishment of a crisis, but rather a marketing ploy to indirectly drive future profits at the expense of the health of a dissenting population, with the added bonus of ushering even more oppressive legislation (e.g. martial law).

       I've been saying for the past few weeks that this MSM barrage of ebola talk reeks of fear-mongering propaganda and that the outbreak, if not a complete hoax, is
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       being blown grossly out of proportion.
