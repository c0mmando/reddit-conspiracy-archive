       Snowden gave his info to many more people than the corporate media. Scott Bennett says he was in contact with Snowden and received the full go. His crazy story here:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo8Xm46s62I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost a certainty that he gave the files to Russia as well. More info here:

       Yes, he could be a limited hangout but in my opinion he is the most important whistleblower out there and has much much much deeper info than just the NSA shit. We'll see if it starts coming out or not in the next couple years. If we hit the 2016 elections and there is no new bombshell leaks, he's probably a lh.

       I don't even think the mind control stuff as important as what Scott Bennett has to say. You should watch that Project Camelot interview. Seems like the dam is breaking but well see.

       If you're interested in mind control, check out the book Project Soul Catcher by Robert Duncan. It blew my mind.

       Thanks man and wow that makes total sense. Last year in september I had to do a book report on "1984" and had to link it to moderne events. And while doing so I found on article on "Lapresse" that snowden had leaked less than 1% of all the files he had stolen. That would explain alot

       John Kiriakou concluded that water boarding was effective. However, Abu didn't cooperate after being waterboarded over 50 times. It was his visit in his cell that night from "Allah" telling him his cooperation would make it easier on the other brothers that did the trick. Good thing we don't have any "Voice of God" weapons that could have accomplished that feat.

       I'm starting to think Snowden is a limited hangout, deliberately releasing facts in a slow dribbling manner so we get used to the idea without revolting against it and it's founders.
