    <div class="md"><p>Snowden gave his info to many more people than the corporate media. Scott Bennett says he was in contact with Snowden and received the full go. His crazy story here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo8Xm46s62I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo8Xm46s62I</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s almost a certainty that he gave the files to Russia as well. More info here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeSX-PBnAE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeSX-PBnAE</a></p>

<p>Yes, he could be a limited hangout but in my opinion he is the most important whistleblower out there and has much much much deeper info than just the NSA shit. We&#39;ll see if it starts coming out or not in the next couple years. If we hit the 2016 elections and there is no new bombshell leaks, he&#39;s probably a lh.</p>

<p>lol thats the thing, everyones content with waiting 18 months or whatever... some people have told me they knew it right when he came out. personally it took me 5 months or so to think he was lh.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in mind control, check out the book Project Soul Catcher by Robert Duncan. It blew my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man and wow that makes total sense. Last year in september I had to do a book report on &quot;1984&quot; and had to link it to moderne events. And while doing so I found on article on &quot;Lapresse&quot; that snowden had leaked less than 1% of all the files he had stolen. That would explain alot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Kiriakou concluded that water boarding was effective. However, Abu didn&#39;t cooperate after being waterboarded over 50 times. It was his visit in his cell that night from &quot;Allah&quot; telling him his cooperation would make it easier on the other brothers that did the trick. Good thing we don&#39;t have any &quot;Voice of God&quot; weapons that could have accomplished that feat. </p>
