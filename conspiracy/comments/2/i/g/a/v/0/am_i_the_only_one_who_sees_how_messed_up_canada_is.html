BULL! They are hiding out fellow country men and training them with the advanced technology the government is hiding from all the tax money. CANADIANS stop with the taxes we are going to be our own down fall! Just wait till WW3 then we&#39;ll see the crap hit the fan.</p>

<p>Edit: So glad to see people are seeing this I am trying to raise the word, because Canada is being over looked and people seem to think its the quite good kid in the front of the class, that&#39;s the perfect cover up.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t your health care free?  Do you have old age pensions? (like US social security benefits).</p>

<p>Because right now, looking from America where I know I will be bankrupted if I get seriously ill and I&#39;m praying my 401k does well enough to sustain me from 65-70, Canada looks pretty sweet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like where your heart is at, but you can&#39;t blame it on the educational system in this day and age. I&#39;m Canadian and I have a great education. Also, the Internet is free, so you don&#39;t have that excuse. Keep searching on the net. Reddit is a great place to find info. Keep educating yourself cuz nobody is gonna do it for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canada? Well this is a new topic for me. As i understand, yall get free healthcare, right? I mean, youbhave to wait for weeks for an appointment to open up, as far as ive heard...</p>

<p>But in regards to where the money is going, maybe yall dont <em>have</em> a large military with &quot;Made in Canada&quot; stamped onto every boot, but maybe, instead, &quot;all that tax money&quot; is going into some other countries military, for protection, for influence, whatever.</p>

<p>Just a thought... I admittingly dont know too much about canada...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Western Canada got Harper in office, now we all suffer the consequences of their bad choice. </p>

<p>Not the end of the world really, except when you realize that the Conservatives and Liberals have been working hand in hand for the past 200 years, it makes you wander what the grand plan is. </p>

<p>Orwellian surveillance? Doubtful, unlike the USA. Just being allied with the strongest states just so we dont get pwnt? Again unlikely. Pretty sure everyone is missing something so simple and obvious that once it happens we&#39;ll all be wondering how the hell we missed it.</p>
