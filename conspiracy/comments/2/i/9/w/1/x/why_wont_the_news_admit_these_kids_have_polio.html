       This is actually a serious issue. Can't get pharmaceutical companies to spend much on rare diseases (a lot of demyelinating diseases in this raft right now) because there's no cash in it. It sucks, because this is exactly why we have things like NIH in the US and universities - but they're ruled by big business grants, too.

       Never thought, of all the things to turn me into a gottdanged commie, it would be the sad state of our medical establishment in the US, but there you go.

       "Polio has not been eradicated by vaccination, it is lurking behind a redefinition and new diagnostic names like viral or aseptic meningitis.  Knowing the reality of polio disease,  this nifty but dishonest administrative move excluded more than 90% of polio cases from the definition of polio. Ever since then, when a polio-vaccinated person gets polio, it will not be diagnosed as polio, it will be diagnosed as viral or aseptic meningitis.  According to one of the 1997 issues of the MMWR, there are some 30,000 to 50,000 cases of viral meningitis per year in the United States alone.  That's where all those 30,000 - 50,000 cases of polio disappeared after the introduction of mass vaccination. One must also be aware that polio is a man-made disease since those well-publicized outbreaks are misrepresented that those huge outbreaks were causally linked to intensified diphtheria and other vaccinations at the relevant time.  They even have a name for it: provocation poliomyelitis."  Viera Scheibner, Ph.D.

        In the United States in 2012 there were over 41,000 reported cases. This is the highest number for about 60 years. There were 18 reported deaths. In 1999 there were 7,288 cases. In 2000 there were 7,867. The CDC has an excellent website with up to date information and recommendations on the treatment and prevention of whooping cough (pertussis).

       have you had whooping cough? I have. So have my kids. It's not aids boss despite what you've been told. It's as deadly as the flu. Those that are at risk are at risk. Most get over it without any major issues as the statistics point out.

       I guess it would maintain the public's faith in vaccines. It appears they eradicated polio, when in fact (according to the above comment) they haven't. If there were an evil entity operating high in power, vaccines would be the perfect mechanism for anything they wish to deliver into the masses. For that to work people need to be volunteering for them, "Look they're really good they eradicated polio" would convince people of their effectiveness.
      </p>

       As for who would profit, who's making them? Not saying that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the reason, just a somewhat possible answer.

       Has the polio vaccine itself changed in the last decade or so? I know that (all vaccinated and up-to-date) kids in Maryland are catching whooping cough - some of the vaccines are just not as effective as companies are advertising (here's Merck being sued by multiple parties for lying about the effectiveness of their mumps vaccine:
       <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/27/47851.htm">
        http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/27/47851.htm
       </a>
       ). Wonder if something similar could be going on with Polio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Here's the source on the vaccinated kids &amp; whooping cough:
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/whooping-cough-cases-climb-in-montgomery/2014/10/01/f2b01054-4752-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html">

       </a>
       I had assumed that the whooping cough outbreaks were parapertussis, which is more common in vaccinated kids (but not as virulent as pertussis itself), but it sounds like kids vaccinated for pertussis are getting pertussis anyway...

       First of all, "polio" never has been a "disease."

       It's been a catch-all term for many primary disorders that include the same symptoms as "classic polio"(Guillian-Barre Syndrome for example) but polio as a single entity never EXISTED, let alone was eradicated. It's one of the biggest hoaxes in history.

       Before the polio vaccine, it was so common almost everyone personally knew someone (or several people) that had polio. (Talk to your grandparents if you don't believe me). Now, almost nobody does (I certainly don't, and I don't know anyone who does). So how do you explain that? Is everyone we know really an actor planted by the government and big pharma? LOL

       So, I've watched this once now and am having a second watch because I'm in a rather distracted mood and need to drill this stuff in to be able to parse it and it's certainly piqued my interest.

       I' somewhat concerned by the assertion on rationalwiki that Suzanne Humphries is apparently a homeopathy advocate these days, but that may just be defamation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I think this is something that absolutely warrants further research on my part, so thank you for the link.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not something that I have a direct concern with as I have no sprogs nor any plan to acquire any, but it is clearly something I want to be informed about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other material you have to hand which I could have a look at would be gladly received.

       It could quite possibly be an outbreak of mutated polio virus from vaccination. It's not the first time people have contracted a polio mutation from the polio vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A major concern about the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is its known ability to revert to a form that can achieve neurological infection and cause paralysis.[32] Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses.[33] This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain."
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be impossible for some mutated strain of enterovirus to infect some kids through vaccination and cause an outbreak that would be resistant to the vaccine itself. Not saying this happened.. but who knows.

       There's a lot of covering up the fact that Obama's children from Central America, for whom he opened the southern border and assisted as they crossed illegally into the US from Mexico, are infected with a huge number of nasty things, polio among them. So far nobody had pointed out in the press that this mystery virus comes from the illegals who crossed in from Central America, with the direct assistance of Obama. The only one I've heard state this explicitly is the talk radio host, Michael Savage, who has a PhD in biology and an extensive knowledge of how diseases are carried and transmitted.

       Mexico and Central American countries has vaccination rates high as or higher than the United States. So, if not getting vaccinated it the cause (not saying it is) blame  over privileged white parents who and conspiracy theorists who don't vaccinate.

       for cities and large towns maybe, but can the same be said for remote villages in war torn or rebel controlled areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       fake vaccines for rebel areas would be classic counterinsurgency tactics, make the children sick to weaken the parents, diverts resources into looking after sick children, demoralizes rebels and anybody who might join them in the cause 'rebels cannot look after their own children'
