    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Polio has not been eradicated by vaccination, it is lurking behind a redefinition and new diagnostic names like viral or aseptic meningitis.  Knowing the reality of polio disease,  this nifty but dishonest administrative move excluded more than 90% of polio cases from the definition of polio. Ever since then, when a polio-vaccinated person gets polio, it will not be diagnosed as polio, it will be diagnosed as viral or aseptic meningitis.  According to one of the 1997 issues of the MMWR, there are some 30,000 to 50,000 cases of viral meningitis per year in the United States alone.  That&#39;s where all those 30,000 - 50,000 cases of polio disappeared after the introduction of mass vaccination. One must also be aware that polio is a man-made disease since those well-publicized outbreaks are misrepresented that those huge outbreaks were causally linked to intensified diphtheria and other vaccinations at the relevant time.  They even have a name for it: provocation poliomyelitis.&quot;  Viera Scheibner, Ph.D. <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/scheibner8.html">Hearings on Hepatitis B vaccine</a></p>

<p>Whooping cough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Babies and young children are usually most severely affected by whooping cough. They are most likely to develop severe complications, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>    pneumonia, an infection that causes inflammation of the lungs</li>
<li>    dehydration</li>
<li>    temporary pauses in breathing as a result of severe difficulty with breathing</li>
<li>    weight loss due to excessive vomiting</li>
<li>    seizures (fits)</li>
<li>    low blood pressure, requiring medication</li>
<li>    kidney failure, requiring temporary dialysis</li>
<li>    brain damage, if breathing difficulties prevent enough oxygen from getting to the brain</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Has the polio vaccine itself changed in the last decade or so? I know that (all vaccinated and up-to-date) kids in Maryland are catching whooping cough - some of the vaccines are just not as effective as companies are advertising (here&#39;s Merck being sued by multiple parties for lying about the effectiveness of their mumps vaccine: <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/27/47851.htm">http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/27/47851.htm</a>).

<p>It&#39;s been a catch-all term for many primary disorders that include the same symptoms as &quot;classic polio&quot;(Guillian-Barre Syndrome for example) but polio as a single entity never EXISTED, let alone was eradicated. It&#39;s one of the biggest hoaxes in history.</p>

Now, almost nobody does (I certainly don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t know anyone who does). So how do you explain that? Is everyone we know really an actor planted by the government and big pharma?

    <div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ve watched this once now and am having a second watch because I&#39;m in a rather distracted mood and need to drill this stuff in to be able to parse it and it&#39;s certainly piqued my interest.</p>

<p>I&#39; somewhat concerned by the assertion on rationalwiki that Suzanne Humphries is apparently a homeopathy advocate these days, but that may just be defamation.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think this is something that absolutely warrants further research on my part, so thank you for the link. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not something that I have a direct concern with as I have no sprogs nor any plan to acquire any, but it is clearly something I want to be informed about.</p>

<p>Any other material you have to hand which I could have a look at would be gladly received.</p>

<p>Cheers again for the YT link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could quite possibly be an outbreak of mutated polio virus from vaccination. It&#39;s not the first time people have contracted a polio mutation from the polio vaccine. </p>

<p>&quot;A major concern about the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is its known ability to revert to a form that can achieve neurological infection and cause paralysis.[32] Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses.[33] This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.&quot;</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be impossible for some mutated strain of enterovirus to infect some kids through vaccination and cause an outbreak that would be resistant to the vaccine itself. Not saying this happened.. but who knows. </p>
