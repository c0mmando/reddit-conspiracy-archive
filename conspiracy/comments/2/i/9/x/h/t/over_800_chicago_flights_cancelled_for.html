       If you Google "flights cancelled" you will see that this past week there were several headlines like this:
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-nearly-500-flights-canceled-at-ohare-midway-as-storms-approach-20141002-story.html">
        Weather forecast prompts airlines to cancel nearly 800 flights at O'Hare, Midway
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take much searching through weather.com and other sources to see that there is not a damn cloud in the sky, and in particular nothing to warrant canceling so many flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the real story: An airport employee at O'Hare, distressed that he was about to be demoted/relocated to a different airport (I heard Hawaii) chose to attempt to commit suicide in an ATC (air traffic control) tower by lighting himself on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       His attempt failed, but the resulting fire badly damaged a lot of computer systems at O'Hare and has absolutely wrecked havoc on their ability to coordinate flights in and out of there. Air travel in the US has been screwed all week as people rebook flights through other connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole reason they're lying about it is that they can cancel flights for weather, but if there is something like a self-immolation they may have to issue comp tickets to everyone who is affected, which would totally screw the airlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an open secret in the airline industry right now but there is nothing in the news. Spread the word!

       Well I guess the farther away you are from the incident, the more its down played.  Where I'm at, its was just a small electrical problem caused by a disgruntled employee.

       Hello.  Chicagoan here.  We had some storms move in on Thursday evening that lingered throughout the morning commute Friday morning.  None of that ended until midday yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       From
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-nearly-500-flights-canceled-at-ohare-midway-as-storms-approach-20141002-story.html">
        the Tribune article
       </a>
       sourced by OP...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The threat of storms was enough for airlines to cancel nearly 800 flights at Chicago's airports Thursday,
        <strong>
         as last week's fire at the Aurora radar center continues to disrupt air traffic across the country
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        United nixed 124 departures out of O’Hare today because of "significant weather in Chicago
        <strong>
         and continued FAA airspace restrictions
        </strong>
        ," airline spokeswoman Mary Ryan said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't see what the conspiracy would be; the article blatantly attributes said event for additional cancellations.  O'Hare will cancel flights at the slightest sneeze, since it's a major hub with connecting flights.

        This

       Last week's events at the Aurora air traffic control center didn't help.  Heck, our local media

       The was 2 fridays ago, on the 26th.  I'm a pilot and was told there was an ATC fire.  Weather was nonexistent at the time, it was a beautiful day to fly over Chicago aside from the commercial traffic that was far redirected being much lower than expected.  This is the first I'd heard of the redirected traffic being "due to weather" as I was informed it was an ATC fire when I asked about the unusual traffic.

       You're correct; the weather has been rather calm from 26-SEP through the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article OP referenced is dated 02-OCT, which was this past Thursday.  Airlines canceled flights in anticipation of continued aviation disruptions combined with approaching weather.  If OP linked to multiple articles at the end of September talking about inclement weather -- when none actually existed -- then it'd be worth harping.

       The article mentions "This is the first bad weather to roll across the Midwest since the fire last Friday grounded thousands of flights in Chicago and across the country" so maybe they're discussing two separate sets of cancellations?  I'm nowhere near Chicago this week so I have no insider radio chatter to relay for anything newer, but I doubt there would be fires two weeks in a row.  More likely, they don't have last week's tower fire cleaned up and are operating at diminished capacity, which might lead to cancellations in
       <em>
        anticipation
       </em>
       of weather rather than waiting for it to actually happen.

       Yeah, I just realized I placed "This week's" event when it was actually last week.  The article reinforces  the "last Friday" (26-SEP) date since it was written on Thursday 02-OCT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aurora incident is all mostly all we've been hearing locally, so it still seems like the recent week's events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weather on 02-OCT through 03-OCT wasn't a mere thunderstorm moving through but a good, steady rain.  Some areas had over 3" of rain.  This morning we're in the upper 30s (well below normal) and completely overcast.

       The day this happened this was at the top of Google News, I really don't see a
 conspiracy.  It might be downplayed a little bit but stories about this cam be found with about five seconds of Google.

       There has most definitely been some clouds in the sky here in Illinois the past week or so. It's been raining a lot, just got hit pretty bad with some rain yesterday actually. Other than that, and any lightning though, idk if any of it was enough to put a bunch of flights down.

       EDIT: The Aurora ATCC will not be fully operational until Oct. 13th. This hub has handed off all flights to other ATCC. The man is being held on an involuntary mental hold. His own attorney wouldn't defend his release. He wheeled in a rolling suitcase with gas and a knife. He set the place on fire and was found, under a table, trying to decapitate himself. He appeared in court with bandages around his neck.

         Autosacrifice
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Human sacrifice was a religious activity throughout Mesoamerica. In Aztec and Maya culture, autosacrifice involving self-decapitation by priests and kings is depicted in artworks.[89][90] The sacrifice is usually depicted holding an obsidian knife or axe to the side of the neck.[90][91]
       </p>
       <p>
        Some forms of Durga worship in Indian Hinduism involve a male devotee offering himself as a sacrifice through ritual self-decapitation with a curved sword. This is designed to obtain a favor from the deity for a third party.[92][93]

        Howard, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged in U.S. District Court in Chicago with destruction of aircraft facilities in connection with the fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        He arrived at the building, about 40 miles west of Chicago, at 5:06 a.m., dragging a suitcase, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit filed in court. About an hour later, police and firefighters responded to a call about smoke.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paramedics followed a trail of blood to the basement, where they saw a floor panel that had been opened to expose telecommunication cables, according to the affidavit.
       </p>
       <p>
        They found Howard, shirtless with cut wounds to his arms, using a knife to slice his throat, according to the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 30 minutes after he had entered the building, a message was posted on a Facebook account held in Howard’s name saying he was about to take out the center “and my life,” according to the affidavit.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Do your best to move on quickly from me please,” the message said.

       This was on the 26th (two fridays ago), correct?  I was flying somewhat near Chicago area at the time and asked over the radio about the much more frequent (and much lower altitude) than usual commercial flights I was seeing; I was told directly that there was an ATC fire and traffic was being diverted.  Nobody mentioned self-immolation, but nobody lied about weather, either, so yes this is definitely a case of an open secret; it appears the only people that were fed the weather line were ticket holding passengers, as there was nothing but clear sky, high ceiling, and unlimited visibility.

         EDIT

       </strong>
       From what I understand,
       <em>
        this week
       </em>
       they cancelled flights due to weather.   Last week there was definitely a fire, so I believe this is two separate incidents.  I can't give you any insider info regarding whether there was a fire again this week because I'm not flying anywhere near Chicago, but I doubt it'd happen two weeks in a row so I suspect this is two separate incidents a week apart, both leading to cancellations.

       In the news report you linked there is a graph that shows FIRE on September 26 and it being the reason for cancellations that day. What you linked to is talking about October 2nd. There is no conspiracy.

       Chicagoan here, also a pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in the air when this happened. NEVER did the lamestream media, either in Chicago or nationally, mention a self-immolation. NEVER. Only a "fire at Aurora Center" which is (was) in a secret location anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd bring that up. And yes, about a day afterward it became an "open secret"--at least around pilots at ORD and our supervisors. There was VERY little weather on the day in question...nearly CAVU all day with some very light showers around 1900.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that with the passage of NDAA the Zionist media can say literally ANYTHING on the air. Propaganda is now fully legal and encouraged...just like in Israel and Nazi Germany.

       Really? Because here on the ground, EVERY major news outlet told us the story of this guy's "apparent suicide attempt" as soon as it happened. Here's a USA today article about it posted the same day it occurred. It doesn't get much more "lamestream" than USA today:

       Well thanks for the post. I'm either in a hotel or flying usually and the Channel 2 news here did NOT mention an attempted self-immolation that night, only the fire. You appear correct though.

       You're correct; the weather has been rather calm from 26-SEP through the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article OP referenced is dated 02-OCT, which was this past Thursday.  Airlines canceled flights in anticipation of continued aviation disruptions combined with approaching weather.  If OP linked to multiple articles at the end of September talking about inclement weather -- when none actually existed -- then it'd be worth harping.

       I wasn't talking about "Here we go," I meant the article saying the guy tried to decapitate himself.

      <p>
       "Here we go" as in "here we go with so-called journalists saying he tried decapitate himself when he was really just aiming for his jugular."
