       In the movie I Am Legend there is a scene in the background with a movie poster for Batman vs. Superman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it ironic how in the movie society collapsed right before Batman vs. Superman came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have the REAL Batman vs. Superman movie coming out and society is at a tipping point.  Ebola virus scares, mass protest, fear of WW3, gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know hollywood likes to leave clues in movies, but they are seen too late.  I think we found one of their clues.  They want Ebola to spread rampantly so they can use those plastic coffins and FEMA camps they've been building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take it so literal, but it is a little fishy.  Real eyes realize real lies.  There is a lot of shit wrong with the world, society is at a tipping point.  Could it all be preplanned, fear mongering?

       The screenwriter for I am Legend had worked on some rewrites for a Batman Vs Superman and the poster is a nod too that.  I agree that there is some interesting symbolism in movies but I think you are really reaching here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they did want to release a virus to destabilize things there are better candidates than Ebola.

       I read about that too, and you might be right.  I don't know much about Ebola but the symptoms resemble zombielike qualities, blood from orifices?  With zombies being a trending theme in Hollywood and TV, I guess Ebola is just luck of the draw and opportunistic.  You can't deny that the US Government loves a good titty milking job, recent examples Trayvon Martin and the Ferguson shootings.  Just a theory.

       What makes you think an Alien race would save us? If there's aliens monitoring our planet, or happen to pass through and observe, what reasons would they have to save us? Just to do it for the sake of doing it? Or can you think of a logical reason that also benefits them somehow in doing so.

       They save us, we turn to them as our savior, they run the world. Simple logic. Imagine if they exposed the government for everyone to see after saving us, the sheeple would be  heartbroken and would turn to the alien race.

       Tin foil hat wearers say that gold is just as rare as it is on Earth as it is in the universe.  Not a fact, but they say we are slaves mining gold for them.  Gold has a lot more properties than just being pretty.  If I was an alien, fuck it, I'd let a lesser species do my dirty work.  As to them saving us, ehh doubt it unless they really want their gold.

       Pre-planned by whom? Someone with an axe to grind again the African nations who have been suffering from it for years? Posts like this are so US-centric when it comes to this topic. You forget there's a whole other world out there that has been hit hard by this for a long time just because there are a handful of people in the US turning up with it now. You Americans aren't that special. Get over yourselves!!

       I never said anyone was special and this is a global problem. It just makes more sense, to me at least, that a deadly virus would originate from Africa, it looks better in a future textbook. Don't get me wrong but Africa is the forgotten love child of the world.  Like in the movie Blood Diamond with the phrase, TIA, this is Africa. It's just a theory but the coincidences are still there. Take the movie the Matrix for example.  Neo's passport expired on 9-11-2001. Neo represents an average joe before he becomes the "one". You could argue that on 9-11-2001 the average joe's civil liberties started to expire.  Take it with a grain of salt.

       It's not supposed to be funny, people do it. I used to "hide" things in my artwork at school, mostly to troll the teacher, but just to see if anyone would notice it.  They didn't so I got ballsy. I can't help but feel that if there is a secret order hell bent on world domination that they would leave subtle clues, why? because fuck you that's why.  It's the same reason serial killers keep a "trophy". Being part of the "club" is cool, so people made their own clubs by hiding their own meanings and would laugh at people when it goes right over their head.

       So the super secret leaders make elaborate, highly secret plans for mass social change or war - Keeping everything secret except for the few that need to know...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... Only to then leave the plans/clues in a couple of movies for the public to see.

       The problem with this whole topic is it's a broken watch. People like yourself make a hundred claims for future events, then if a guess becomes true you claim you were right all along and everyone forgets how many guesses were wrong.
