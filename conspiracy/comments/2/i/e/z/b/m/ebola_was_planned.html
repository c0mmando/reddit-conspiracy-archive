        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the movie I Am Legend there is a scene in the background with a movie poster for Batman vs. Superman.  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it ironic how in the movie society collapsed right before Batman vs. Superman came out.  </p>

<p>Now we have the REAL Batman vs. Superman movie coming out and society is at a tipping point.  Ebola virus scares, mass protest, fear of WW3, gun control.</p>

<p>I know hollywood likes to leave clues in movies, but they are seen too late.  I think we found one of their clues.  They want Ebola to spread rampantly so they can use those plastic coffins and FEMA camps they&#39;ve been building.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it so literal, but it is a little fishy.  Real eyes realize real lies.  There is a lot of shit wrong with the world, society is at a tipping point.  Could it all be preplanned, fear mongering?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read about that too, and you might be right.  I don&#39;t know much about Ebola but the symptoms resemble zombielike qualities, blood from orifices?  With zombies being a trending theme in Hollywood and TV, I guess Ebola is just luck of the draw and opportunistic.  You can&#39;t deny that the US Government loves a good titty milking job, recent examples Trayvon Martin and the Ferguson shootings.  Just a theory.  </p>

Posts like this are so US-centric when it comes to this topic.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anyone was special and this is a global problem. It just makes more sense, to me at least, that a deadly virus would originate from Africa, it looks better in a future textbook. Don&#39;t get me wrong but Africa is the forgotten love child of the world.  Like in the movie Blood Diamond with the phrase, TIA, this is Africa. It&#39;s just a theory but the coincidences are still there. Take the movie the Matrix for example.  Neo&#39;s passport expired on 9-11-2001. Neo represents an average joe before he becomes the &quot;one&quot;. You could argue that on 9-11-2001 the average joe&#39;s civil liberties started to expire.  Take it with a grain of salt.</p>
