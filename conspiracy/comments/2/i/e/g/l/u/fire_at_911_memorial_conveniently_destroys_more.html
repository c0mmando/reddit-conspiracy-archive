      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The headquarters building and some personal items belonging to the passengers and crew were destroyed in the fire on Friday
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would be very curious to know what sort of “personal items” belonging to the passengers and crew were destroyed. Didn’t Constantine’s wife make a small fortune selling “True Pieces of the Cross” and other such relics?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember growing up in Washington DC. We went to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum every summer. My favorite exhibit was, of course, the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander. When we were kids they told us it was the real thing, the one that had been on the Moon. A few years later, they told us it was just a replica. Then, one year, it disappeared and I never saw it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you are creating a mythology, it’s best if the physical evidence doesn’t stick around long enough to be subjected to forensic analysis. They started shipping the steel beams from the World Trade Center to China within days of 9/11. You see, everyone thought there were bomb in the building, until “official word” came down from NYPD Chief Bernard Kerick saying, no, it was just the jet fuel (kerosene, essentially.) That’s why there is no such thing as a kerosene lamp made of metal, the whole thing would just collapse on itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years later Kerick went to prison for being connected to organized crime.

       Not that i doubt  some evidence was destroyed, but this claim lacks in facts.

       Those clever SOB's that pulled this whole thing off were also smart enough to wait 13 years before destroying a few personal items that were also on display for over a decade.  The final pieces of the puzzle that may have one day broken this case are no more.  The government was too smart to keep this "evidence" in a secure undisclosed location or destroy it right away... No, they kept it at a low security memorial knowing that nobody would even bother to notice that they were looking at the "Government's Plan to Pull Off 9-11."
      </p>
      <p>
       But really though... what the hell are people thinking when they try to use this story as "further evidence of a cover up!!111!!!"?

       even as a ten year old i knew that it wasn't the same lunar lander, as it was never designed to return. what idiot adult informed you of that? i am sure the words on whatever museum ID would have informed you it was an EXACT REPLICA from the get go.
      </p>
      <p>
       source: i was ten when the air and space museum opened and the Apollo program was a real big deal to a ten year old who wanted to be an astronaut

       When you light a kerosene stove, do not pour the fuel all over the mechanism and smash it with an airplanee before lighting.

       OK, I have a kerosene stove here, poured fuel all over it and hit it with a giant hammer and lit it, it's still the same as it was, so what do I do with it now, wait for it to collapse in it own footprint ?
