<p>I can assure you that I was not trying to belittle you in anyway. If you would&#39;ve given me time to explain myself before calling me a nazi, you might have known that.</p>

<p>But if you truly are asking this question (as after reading your back and forth with <a href="/u/nighthawk1961">/u/nighthawk1961</a> , I&#39;m not convinced), Then nighthawk gave you the answer you were looking for, as unfortunate as that may be. </p>

So, that rules out the direct method. The &quot;Elite&quot; must, therefore, use the sneaky method. Since most of the people today are pretty stupid, then the sneaky method isn&#39;t very hard to do.</p>

<p>Now, all that said, the people are stupidly allowing the government to make our lives worse and worse. There are a lot reasons for this and some of them are our fault and some of them are the government&#39;s fault. But all in all, our lives are quite comfortable.

<p>There are many ways that were are being manipulated, to be sure, but if we didn&#39;t have the 2nd Amendment, I guarantee you that the citizenry would be a <em>lot</em> easier to manipulate and force than is currently the case.  As it stands right now, TPTB&#39;s m.o. involves using the MSM and public education to slowly dumb the population down enough to have them/us actually willingly give up our ability to defend ourselves.  That and false flag after false flag demonizing the second and saying &quot;Gunz are baaaad!&quot; continues putting more pressure against the 2nd and in favor of the growing police state that exists.</p>

<p>The moment the people don&#39;t even have personal firearms, then the state can come in and do whatever it wants.</p>

<p>Granted, if we the people were to simply come together as the one, united force that we really are (but have been convinced and indoctrinated to believe we AREN&#39;T), then we would be able to do away with TPTB manipulation soon enough - guns or no guns.  Unfortunately, we are generally weak and have become eviscerated idiots for the most part that <em>need</em> Big Brother over us telling us what to do.</p>

<p>Again, there you go with not only generalizing, but marginalizing as well.  You really shouldn&#39;t even use the word &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; at all anyway.  It&#39;s a psyop word that has been adopted and manipulated by the MSM in order to (again) marginalize and demonize those individuals who are unwilling to just unquestioningly take in the narrative that TPTB have the people follow.  It is a cointelpro tool, and the more that you or anyone continue using it, the more you play into the hands of those that are doing nothing but manipulating you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You said that already a while back.  Why do you keep parroting it since it&#39;s actually <em>not</em> the actual truth?  Certainly there are some that <em>do</em> unquestioningly believe in &quot;everything&quot; that AJ says (some of which is true, a lot of which purposefully isn&#39;t), but your thinking that it applies to all members of a certain group does <em>not</em> involve much critical thinking at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct.  It is a brain washing technique of sorts.  Unfortunately, you are not doing yourself any favors by not realizing that it applies only to <em>some</em> people, and not &quot;all&quot; of the individuals in whatever group you continue to attempt to marginalize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...etc etc. is the mentally of conspiracy theorists whether you follow Alex Jones or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you continue to generalize in literally every sentence you post.  You passed the &quot;not a critical thinker&quot; mark quite a few posts ago.  I keep trying to help to STOP doing that...but it seems you&#39;re kind of stuck in your mentality.  That&#39;s not good.  At all.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is, the core beliefs of conspiracy theorists is basically Alex Jones&#39;, David Ike&#39;s or whoever&#39;s psychological marketing bullcrap. People want to feel special for knowing the &quot;truth&quot; and they exploit that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re a broken record.  Try a different tune.</p>

<p>For example, do I strike you as one of the type that falls into your narrow categorization?  I certainly don&#39;t think so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If these people are so smart to figure everything out, why are they simple radio show hosts or authors and not something more prestigious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow.  Your perspectives on prestige and what is &quot;simple&quot; are very narrow.</p>

<p>Matt, does &quot;8_7&quot; refer to the year you were born?  If so, then...actually no.  That can&#39;t be it, because that would mean you&#39;re 27, and you do <em>not</em> sound like a 27 year old.  I don&#39;t mean this in too disparaging a manner, but the mind set that you have continued demonstrating thus far is one that wades in a very small puddle thinking that what happens there applies to the entire ocean.  You are only looking at a small subset of a group and are for some reason applying it to everything around you.  Such could not be further from the actual truth.</p>

<p>Secondly, your thinking that someone trying to make a dollar shows that they aren&#39;t searching for the truth is a very, very fallacious and shallow thought.  If that&#39;s the case, then YOU are certainly not looking for the truth either.  That makes you no better than anyone you criticize.

<p>I could come up with many examples, but all I have to do is mention Jame Corbett of The Corbett Report and your entire argument falls entirely on the ground in a puff of airy, baseless nothingness.</p>

<p>The job of the critical thinker is to be able to sift the wheat from the chaff.  The <em>uncritical</em> thinker throws out the baby with the bath water entirely.

<p>I haven&#39;t watched or even <em>owned</em> a television in over fifteen years.  Your assumptions and fallacious thinking continue to show themselves to be entirely self-defeating.</p>

<p>You really have to further educate yourself.  Things are not very much like how you seem to think they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So anyway...just for the sake of curiosity, what do you believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I work diligently at believing absolutely NOTHING.  I would say I believe almost nothing at all, as a matter of fact.  I work with <em>knowledge</em> - not mere belief.  If I don&#39;t have a decent amount of evidence or information pointing in a particular direction, then I simply withhold any &quot;belief&quot; instead of trying to make some willy nilly judgement based on what I &quot;believe&quot; alone.</p>

<p>Belief is what people tend to have when they don&#39;t have any actual evidence on behalf of a thing.  If I don&#39;t have evidence, I tend to say nothing, or I try to simply state what a situation <em>seems</em> to be like to me - understanding that I may be entirely wrong one way or the other.</p>

<p>All that being said, your question is extremely broad.  Narrow it a bit first.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s fair enough.  However, and again, that different point of view was one which took the actions of a certain subset of a group and uncritically applied those actions to the whole of the group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you were at least somewhat open minded you would see that what I&#39;m saying probably isn&#39;t too far off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, man.  That (again) is not going to fly.  This is not actually a question or issue one way or the other about &quot;open mindedness&quot; at this point.  You are using terms that simply do not apply even a little bit.  The point here is that you are saying that &quot;EVERY&quot; member of a group is &quot;such and such&quot;.  You continue to fail to understand that that is simply untrue.  Even if <em>most</em> members of the group were like that (and they&#39;re not) you would <em>still</em> be entirely wrong in your conclusion that &quot;every&quot; member of the group is like that.  Again, you made a universal, unqualified statement.  What you said applies to only <em>some</em> of the members of said group - which ultimately (and yet again, I say) completely invalidates your point.  It&#39;s unfortunate that your mind is unable to grasp the logical truth behind what is being shown here.  This is why I assume you are quite young.  Saying that you are young and don&#39;t know isn&#39;t a put down either.  It&#39;s just a truth.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  We&#39;re all ignorant at certain levels.  Ignorance isn&#39;t a bad thing in and of itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>hubris</em> that&#39;s bad, and that&#39;s what you continue showing without, it seems, even knowing or understanding that that&#39;s what you&#39;re even doing.  Hubris is when one is under the delusion that the false paradigm they are under is the ONLY truth that there is; is the ONLY way things are or can possibly be.</p>

<p>You make statements that leave no room for the possibility of your being wrong, and that is an egregious error in thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But listen, if you want proof of my &quot;generalizations&quot;, keep them in mind when you&#39;re reading the comments on this subreddit or watching conspiracy theory videos on youtube or where ever you get information from</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it is on these very outlets that the points you make get continuously proven incorrect.  All I need to see is ONE example of a valid thought - of a valid statement, an intelligent person with a good or decent point of view - and your entire argument comes absolutely crumbling down because it shows that not &quot;everyone&quot; in the group which you try to vilify is deserving of the broad, unthinking generalizations that you make.</p>

<p>Although I myself am greatly ignorant of many things under the sun, all I have to do to know that what you say is summarily false is look at myself and my own thought processes - to say nothing of those others on here that know even more than I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop reading about conspiracy theories(or whatever you want to call them) for a few months. Totally cast it out of your life completely for those months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too late.  I don&#39;t have to do it &quot;for a few months or whatever&quot; because I did it for years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After you do that come back and read about them again. You may see how your perception of the &quot;truth&quot; has changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to understand that, to a great extent, perception can be greatly guided by proper logic and assessment - by proper <em>thinking</em>.  That IS what perception is, after all.  Perception is the proper formulation of thought based upon sensation.  If you DON&#39;T have proper logic and assessment, then it doesn&#39;t matter if you are neck deep in a subject, or if you go away for a long period of time and then come back or not.  If you don&#39;t know how to properly think about things and the world around you, then you will be fooled regardless of what kind of method you use to &quot;get away from it all&quot; or whatever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let&#39;s go with what the overall plan the government has for us. What is their end game?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot say I know what their &quot;end game&quot; is.  I cannot even say I know with any great degree of certainty who &quot;they&quot; are.  I <em>can</em> say that the government is not who and what is in charge of this country or any country really.  The government is not the most powerful entity in the land.  There is a multinational corporate enterprise running the planet that has shown itself to be powerful enough to covertly tell the governments what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and convince the majority of the population that it is the government that&#39;s in charge of everything instead of the puppet master behind the government.</p>

<p>So what is the overall plan of the government?</p>

<p>Who cares?  They&#39;re not the ones in charge anyway.  The banks, the corporations, and the money changers are above the government.</p>

<p>So what is <em>their</em> overall plan then?</p>

<p>Well, although I will <em>still</em> say that I don&#39;t presume or pretend to know for sure, I WILL say that a lot of the puzzle pieces at least seem to heavily point toward a level of power manipulation over the people in such a manner as to keep the citizenry of the entire planet in a perpetual state of subservience while a small subset of elite individuals remain in a perpetual state of dominance over that citizenry.</p>

<p>And what is the point of <em>that?</em>  Well, there are various theories - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">some of which are rather intriguing if not compelling</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Of course I understand what you are saying. But I don&#39;t think you understand what I&#39;m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve only been going by the words you&#39;ve been typing.  That&#39;s all I have to go on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t recall ever saying that <em>every single</em> person thinks this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm.  Okay.  Well.  Let&#39;s look at some of the things you&#39;ve said thus far.</p>

<p>Initially, you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theorists would rather believe a guy trying to sell a book/dvd/radio show, than think about the subject critically. They let some business man shape their reality and he&#39;s laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  Well, there is absolutely NO QUALIFIER in that statement.  Your saying &quot;Conspiracy theorists would rather believe a guy trying to sell a book/dvd/radio show, than think about the subject critically.&quot; is similar to someone saying &quot;Dogs are yellow.&quot;  There is no qualifier on the subject, and if there is no qualifier, then it logically means that &quot;all instances of the [subject] are [whatever you describe them as].&quot;</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s just plain and simple logic there.</p>

<p>Then in your next response, you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every conspiracy theorists that I&#39;ve met(and I&#39;ve met quite a few living in a big city) all repeat the same thing Alex Jones says about a topic like a mindless robot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, you do qualify the &quot;every&quot; by saying &quot;that <em>I&#39;ve</em> met&quot; - which does, again, qualify the &quot;every&quot; and temper its universality.  However, your also saying &quot;and I&#39;ve met quite a few living in a big city&quot; very heavily implies that you feel that &quot;every&quot; conspiracy theorist you&#39;ve ever met is sufficiently indicative of &quot;every one that exists&quot; - enough for you to go ahead and paint them all with the same disparaging brush.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what I&#39;m saying is, the core beliefs of conspiracy theorists is basically Alex Jones&#39;, David Ike&#39;s or whoever&#39;s psychological marketing bullcrap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm.  There&#39;s another unqualified blanket statement in yet another post of yours.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s...let&#39;s see...not one, not two, but three different occasions when you made an unqualified universal statement about an entire group.  Your saying you &quot;don&#39;t recall ever saying that <em>every single</em> person thinks this way&quot; is pretty significantly contradicted by what you <em>actually did</em> in fact say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure there are a few exceptions but that really wasn&#39;t my point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if you make universals like you&#39;ve made over and over again, then that, in fact, IS the point because it shows that your assessments are simply not correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you don&#39;t relate to my opinion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t relate to your opinion.  It&#39;s that your opinion - consisting mostly of universal unqualified statements - is <em>wrong</em>.  You might want to change your opinion, therefore, considering it&#39;s been shown to be unfounded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I think my posts paint a pretty accurate picture of the majority and that is what I&#39;ve been talking about this whole time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now you&#39;ve changed from using the universal to saying that the &quot;majority&quot; of the group is like that.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Okay.  Well, to that, I 1) shrug my shoulders and say &quot;<a href="http://www.bolgernow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Shoulder-shrug-old-lady.jpg">meh</a>&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure one is going to find &quot;perfect people&quot; or whatever in any group on the planet.  If there is information that is worthwhile, then one should pay attention to that information regardless of who else - good or bad - is also attracted to it.  With that in mind, 2) I&#39;ve personally never allowed myself to pay too much attention to all the idiots that exist in almost really any group.  Sure.  There are a lot.  However, if there is something that I am interested in investigating, I simply pay attention to that which is sound and makes sense and is logical and throw away that which is stupid and doesn&#39;t make sense and isn&#39;t very logical.  You&#39;re going to find a bit of both in <em>everything</em> it seems.  Again, your job isn&#39;t to only go toward that which is &quot;100% perfect&quot;.  You&#39;re going to be <em>very</em> disappointed if that is your modus operandi.  Instead, and as I&#39;ve said already, learn to be critical and how to sift the wheat from the chaff.  Learn how to be properly discerning and how to assess information critically.  Also, 3) if you&#39;re so focused on disparaging a certain group and saying they&#39;re &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;...then why is it that you continue frequenting the very same circles that the group itself frequents?  I mean after all, you <em>are</em> here in this sub, aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh but I&#39;m not part of <em>these people!!</em>&quot; is what you want to say?  Okay.  Perhaps not from <em>your</em> perspective, but I can guarantee you that you&#39;re likely lumped in with all the people you disparage in the eyes of others.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you have that big of a problem with a group you&#39;re talking about, then why spend so much time thinking about them?  Why not just go on about your way?  Seems kind of silly to me actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you recall in my first post I had said that my rant wasn&#39;t directed at you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get that, and I appreciate that.  I also don&#39;t want you to think that any of my criticisms here are personal.  They&#39;re not.  You don&#39;t know me aside from some words on a screen, and I don&#39;t know you aside from some words on a screen.  I&#39;m just pointing out that the words you&#39;ve used are not indicative of a person that has thought about the topic or subject in a very deep or critical manner, and that person is subsequently making a lot of mistakes in thinking and errors in judgement that don&#39;t need to be made is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just seemed like you weren&#39;t a conspiracy zombie so I responded to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, sir, I certainly don&#39;t <em>feel</em> like a &quot;conspiracy zombie&quot;.  Do I seem like or appear to be one to you?</p>

<p>If one doesn&#39;t think broadly enough, then I imagine it could come across that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The teachings of the Occult, Freemasons, Crowley, and Baphomet aren&#39;t used for &quot;evil black masses&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have <em>no</em> idea whatsoever where the &quot;used for &#39;evil black masses&#39;&quot; statement came from, but ANY teaching can be used for positive or less than positive purposes.  Therefore, based on that alone, you are mistaken in your above comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are tools for enlightenment, not darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally EVERY tool is only just that - a tool - and it can be used for enlightenment <em>or</em> darkness.</p>

<p>Give me a hammer.  I could build you a large house that you and your family can live and care for each other in, or I can hit you over the head with it and kill you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t get too stuck on the quantified data.  Almost no type of information on this planet and in this age will have &quot;the full truth&quot;.  One must learn to be discerning and properly grasp what about any type of information is valuable, and what should be discarded.  Entirely accepting or entirely rejecting any type of data is usually not the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p>Besides, they don&#39;t have everything wrapped up nice and neat yet. They need a lock on water and oil still, and the rogue governments. The tensions from both sides in every aspect - religion, race, class, etc - need to get so high that we&#39;re killing each other, miserable, and falling apart at the seams. They&#39;re in the stages of building up what can only be called WW3, setting the stage, and after which their targets are going to be devastated and can be conquered with consent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big game of chess now, and they&#39;re suggesting every move we make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illuminati rulership of the planet extends into the supernatural, or superphysical to be accurate.  There are laws in everything, natural laws.  They have rulership over all worldly institutions but not total control over every human soul nor all the varying levels of consciousness among humans.  There are individuals on Earth who are much more advanced in consciousness than the highest illuminati and even higher then supernatural rulers over illuminati.  Yet the purpose and meaning of life on Earth is self-initiated growth in consciousness for every human being.  Thus freedom is not only natural law but obviously a necessity for the entire process to work.  So it&#39;s a constant battle of stopping illuminati while letting humans gain free will.  Illuminati are basically the disruptive schoolchildren at planetary and spiritual scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but I never said <em>every single</em> conspiracy theorist, that&#39;s just how you interpreted my post. I&#39;ve said I was speaking about the ones that I have met. It was even in my second post that you quoted, I also used the words &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;general&quot; in a couple of others. What I don&#39;t understand is why ignore the main idea and focus solely on something insignificant like if I actually meant <em>every single</em> conspiracy theorist or not. Why does that even matter? It really has nothing to do with why conspiracy theories are bullshit and the well known conspiracy theorists use propaganda to shape the world view of innocent people for a pay check.</p>

<p>So whatever, buddy. If you&#39;d rather have a discussion about this petty bullshit than the serious issues at hand, I&#39;m done. </p>

Why spend the time and resources doing all these &quot;false flag&quot; attacks and spending decades &quot;stripping us of our freedom&quot;  when, if what conspiracy theorists say is true, the government already has us by the balls.
