       According to conspiracy theorists the government/illuminati control everything, brain wash all the citizens, love taking our rights away to enslave us etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question speaks for itself. If they have this much power over everything and everyone, what is stopping them from global enslavement? Why pussyfoot around with their NWO plans if they don't have to?

       The form of slavery that is in style today is so perverse and effective that it convinces the enslaved that the current system is the apotheosis of governance, and are grateful for the increasingly smaller chunk of the pie that is allocated to us each year. It's both brilliant and horrifying.

       Well it's ironic that you being up freedom and society when here you are assuming the worst in people. While calling an American, a nazi.

       I can assure you that I was not trying to belittle you in anyway. If you would've given me time to explain myself before calling me a nazi, you might have known that.

       But if you truly are asking this question (as after reading your back and forth with

       You expect me to believe that your cat distracted you from explaining? Somehow you found the submit button without an issue. Is your backspace key not working either? Why even type a personal thought on a public forum? You obviously were trying to create a hive mind.

       The "Elite" (powers that be, Illuminati etc) can not just stand up one day and say "At 8 am tomorrow you are all going to be our slaves." That stunt wold start the riot of the Century and get the "Elite" killed. So, that rules out the direct method. The "Elite" must, therefore, use the sneaky method. Since most of the people today are pretty stupid, then the sneaky method isn't very hard to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, all that said, the people are stupidly allowing the government to make our lives worse and worse. There are a lot reasons for this and some of them are our fault and some of them are the government's fault. But all in all, our lives are quite comfortable. As long as the food and the gasoline are plentiful then life is good. When they run out then the shit will hit the fan.

       Yes, provided that the people remain in small groups. If the people were to come together into a very large group (think French Revolution) then the military fire power would be meaningless.

       True. But that is missing the point by a wide margin. You are correct technically, of course, but that action would not achieve the effect you seek. That would get a lot of people killed but that is all.

       You're right, it would create a big mess. But think of how protests and riots are. The only people on that street are rioters. Even heavy ground troops(Army National Guard) for example could fire at will and kill 90% of them. It'll be like shooting fish in a barrel.

       Small arms and semiautomatic assault rifles aren't going to do much compared to what the Military has. That fact alone makes the whole "they're taking our guns away to make us defenseless" argument moot. The Military has weapons and equipment that would destroy anything civilians have access to.

       The Military oath says "to protect the country from threats both foreign and domestic" The rioters could be classified as domestic terrorists. Isn't that the reason people had a shit fit over the Patriot Act? That was established ~13 years ago. So what's stopping them from using it?

       Because the people can still rise up. They do things like...create a boogeyman that everyone is afraid of..so people willingly give up rights. They do it slowly so most people will never catch on to the fact it's all lie. It's all about an illusion. Make people think they are in control. They do it like that because they are a lot smarter then most of the human population

       Logically it doesn't make any sense to. Why spend the time and resources doing all these "false flag" attacks and spending decades "stripping us of our freedom"  when, if what conspiracy theorists say is true, the government already has us by the balls. They can go in for the kill at anytime according to how conspiracy theorists interpreted the Patriot Act.

       Not really.   There are enough people out there with resources they would be willing to give to the cause.  You bank accounts frozen?  So what you have a bunch of guns and ammo so now you can take what you need to continue the revolution.  You don't have guns you say?  Well maybe you own a farm and you provide food for those fighting.  we're taught from a young age that money is everything when in reality money is nothing.  freezing accounts will only piss people off.  They would be smart not to do that and allow the public to continue wasting their money on what really matters to them, chachkies and cheetos.

       There are many ways that were are being manipulated, to be sure, but if we didn't have the 2nd Amendment, I guarantee you that the citizenry would be a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       easier to manipulate and force than is currently the case.  As it stands right now, TPTB's m.o. involves using the MSM and public education to slowly dumb the population down enough to have them/us actually willingly give up our ability to defend ourselves.  That and false flag after false flag demonizing the second and saying "Gunz are baaaad!" continues putting more pressure against the 2nd and in favor of the growing police state that exists.

      <p>
       The moment the people don't even have personal firearms, then the state can come in and do whatever it wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, if we the people were to simply come together as the one, united force that we really are (but have been convinced and indoctrinated to believe we AREN'T), then we would be able to do away with TPTB manipulation soon enough - guns or no guns.  Unfortunately, we are generally weak and have become eviscerated idiots for the most part that
       <em>
        need

       Big Brother over us telling us what to do.

       This world view is silly if you look at it from another view point. Conspiracy theorists would rather believe a guy trying to sell a book/dvd/radio show, than think about the subject critically. They let some business man shape their reality and he's laughing all the way to the bank.

       Every conspiracy theorists that I've met(and I've met quite a few living in a big city) all repeat the same thing Alex Jones says about a topic like a mindless robot. It's like they're literally programmed by Alex Jones on how to respond to questions. But I'm the sheep for not believing in the "truth"? It's sad really, it reminds me of a cult to be honest.

       Most of the "truths" on this subreddit stemmed from Alex Jones. He pretty much turned conspiracy theories into pop culture after his 9/11 dvds. People are still parroting around his bullcrap about 9/11. I'm sure he's still making a boat load of money from that.

       I mean the general mentality of conspiracy theorist. Most of what they believe as the "truth" is repeating what Alex Jones or whoever rambles on about. If someone repeats the same bullcrap 1,000's of times, the listener is more likely to believe it to be true. Especially if other people repeat the same thing. It's basically brain wash.
      </p>
      <p>
       NWO this, one world government that, neo cons, gun rights, illuminati is after us, Obama is satan/illuminati(or whoever the current president is at the time), OMG! Fema prison camps!, WE'RE ALL DOOMED! World war 3 is right around the corner! etc etc. is the mentally of conspiracy theorists whether you follow Alex Jones or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm saying is, the core beliefs of conspiracy theorists is basically Alex Jones', David Ike's or whoever's psychological marketing bullcrap. People want to feel special for knowing the "truth" and they exploit that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these people are so smart to figure everything out, why are they simple radio show hosts or authors and not something more prestigious? Also if what they are saying is indeed the truth the government would have killed them off long ago to shut them up.

       Again, there you go with not only generalizing, but marginalizing as well.  You really shouldn't even use the word "conspiracy theorist" at all anyway.  It's a psyop word that has been adopted and manipulated by the MSM in order to (again) marginalize and demonize those individuals who are unwilling to just unquestioningly take in the narrative that TPTB have the people follow.  It is a cointelpro tool, and the more that you or anyone continue using it, the more you play into the hands of those that are doing nothing but manipulating you.

       Again, you continue to generalize in literally every sentence you post.  You passed the "not a critical thinker" mark quite a few posts ago.  I keep trying to help to STOP doing that...but it seems you're kind of stuck in your mentality.  That's not good.  At all.

       sound like a 27 year old.  I don't mean this in too disparaging a manner, but the mind set that you have continued demonstrating thus far is one that wades in a very small puddle thinking that what happens there applies to the entire ocean.  You are only looking at a small subset of a group and are for some reason applying it to everything around you.  Such could not be further from the actual truth.

       I could come up with many examples, but all I have to do is mention Jame Corbett of The Corbett Report and your entire argument falls entirely on the ground in a puff of airy, baseless nothingness.

       Sure, it's fine to make money. But using brain wash, thought control, reality manipulation etc on innocent people to make a buck is wrong. It's ironic in a sense, all the bullshit they rant about what the government is doing, they are doing it themselves.

       That's not the point and that doesn't matter, however, because your statements haven't been partial.  They've been universal - i.e. you have continued stating in unqualified terms that "every" person of a certain group is "this or that".  All that's needed is
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       counter example to show that what you're saying is simply not true and entirely undermine and do away with that entire type of argument.

       What you're not understanding is that no system of manipulation works without having at least some truth to it.  Regardless of whether the people in question ARE ultimately charlatans or not, the fact of the matter is that there is a lot that they say that is indeed valid.

       I work diligently at believing absolutely NOTHING.  I would say I believe almost nothing at all, as a matter of fact.  I work with

        knowledge
       </em>
       - not mere belief.  If I don't have a decent amount of evidence or information pointing in a particular direction, then I simply withhold any "belief" instead of trying to make some willy nilly judgement based on what I "believe" alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Belief is what people tend to have when they don't have any actual evidence on behalf of a thing.  If I don't have evidence, I tend to say nothing, or I try to simply state what a situation
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       to be like to me - understanding that I may be entirely wrong one way or the other.

       Another interesting thing to try is this. Stop reading about conspiracy theories(or whatever you want to call them) for a few months. Totally cast it out of your life completely for those months. After you do that come back and read about them again. You may see how your perception of the "truth" has changed.

       And that's fair enough.  However, and again, that different point of view was one which took the actions of a certain subset of a group and uncritically applied those actions to the whole of the group.

      <p>
       Sorry, man.  That (again) is not going to fly.  This is not actually a question or issue one way or the other about "open mindedness" at this point.  You are using terms that simply do not apply even a little bit.  The point here is that you are saying that "EVERY" member of a group is "such and such".  You continue to fail to understand that that is simply untrue.  Even if
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       members of the group were like that (and they're not) you would
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be entirely wrong in your conclusion that "every" member of the group is like that.  Again, you made a universal, unqualified statement.  What you said applies to only
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the members of said group - which ultimately (and yet again, I say) completely invalidates your point.  It's unfortunate that your mind is unable to grasp the logical truth behind what is being shown here.  This is why I assume you are quite young.  Saying that you are young and don't know isn't a put down either.  It's just a truth.  There's nothing wrong with that.  We're all ignorant at certain levels.  Ignorance isn't a bad thing in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <em>
        hubris
       </em>
       that's bad, and that's what you continue showing without, it seems, even knowing or understanding that that's what you're even doing.  Hubris is when one is under the delusion that the false paradigm they are under is the ONLY truth that there is; is the ONLY way things are or can possibly be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make statements that leave no room for the possibility of your being wrong, and that is an egregious error in thinking.

       And it is on these very outlets that the points you make get continuously proven incorrect.  All I need to see is ONE example of a valid thought - of a valid statement, an intelligent person with a good or decent point of view - and your entire argument comes absolutely crumbling down because it shows that not "everyone" in the group which you try to vilify is deserving of the broad, unthinking generalizations that you make.

      <p>
       Although I myself am greatly ignorant of many things under the sun, all I have to do to know that what you say is summarily false is look at myself and my own thought processes - to say nothing of those others on here that know even more than I do.

       You have to understand that, to a great extent, perception can be greatly guided by proper logic and assessment - by proper
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       .  That IS what perception is, after all.  Perception is the proper formulation of thought based upon sensation.  If you DON'T have proper logic and assessment, then it doesn't matter if you are neck deep in a subject, or if you go away for a long period of time and then come back or not.  If you don't know how to properly think about things and the world around you, then you will be fooled regardless of what kind of method you use to "get away from it all" or whatever.

       I cannot say I know what their "end game" is.  I cannot even say I know with any great degree of certainty who "they" are.  I
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       say that the government is not who and what is in charge of this country or any country really.  The government is not the most powerful entity in the land.  There is a multinational corporate enterprise running the planet that has shown itself to be powerful enough to covertly tell the governments what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and convince the majority of the population that it is the government that's in charge of everything instead of the puppet master behind the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the overall plan of the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares?  They're not the ones in charge anyway.  The banks, the corporations, and the money changers are above the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is
       <em>
        their

       overall plan then?

      <p>
       Well, although I will
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       say that I don't presume or pretend to know for sure, I WILL say that a lot of the puzzle pieces at least seem to heavily point toward a level of power manipulation over the people in such a manner as to keep the citizenry of the entire planet in a perpetual state of subservience while a small subset of elite individuals remain in a perpetual state of dominance over that citizenry.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hmm.  Okay.  Well.  Let's look at some of the things you've said thus far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially, you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Conspiracy theorists would rather believe a guy trying to sell a book/dvd/radio show, than think about the subject critically. They let some business man shape their reality and he's laughing all the way to the bank.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay.  Well, there is absolutely NO QUALIFIER in that statement.  Your saying "Conspiracy theorists would rather believe a guy trying to sell a book/dvd/radio show, than think about the subject critically." is similar to someone saying "Dogs are yellow."  There is no qualifier on the subject, and if there is no qualifier, then it logically means that "all instances of the [subject] are [whatever you describe them as]."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, that's just plain and simple logic there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then in your next response, you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Every conspiracy theorists that I've met(and I've met quite a few living in a big city) all repeat the same thing Alex Jones says about a topic like a mindless robot.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here, you do qualify the "every" by saying "that
       <em>
        I've
       </em>
       met" - which does, again, qualify the "every" and temper its universality.  However, your also saying "and I've met quite a few living in a big city" very heavily implies that you feel that "every" conspiracy theorist you've ever met is sufficiently indicative of "every one that exists" - enough for you to go ahead and paint them all with the same disparaging brush.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        what I'm saying is, the core beliefs of conspiracy theorists is basically Alex Jones', David Ike's or whoever's psychological marketing bullcrap.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hmmm.  There's another unqualified blanket statement in yet another post of yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that's...let's see...not one, not two, but three different occasions when you made an unqualified universal statement about an entire group.  Your saying you "don't recall ever saying that
       <em>
        every single
       </em>
       person thinks this way" is pretty significantly contradicted by what you
       <em>
        actually did
       </em>
       in fact say.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sure there are a few exceptions but that really wasn't my point.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, if you make universals like you've made over and over again, then that, in fact, IS the point because it shows that your assessments are simply not correct.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe you don't relate to my opinion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not that I don't relate to your opinion.  It's that your opinion - consisting mostly of universal unqualified statements - is
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       .  You might want to change your opinion, therefore, considering it's been shown to be unfounded.

       So now you've changed from using the universal to saying that the "majority" of the group is like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm.  Okay.  Well, to that, I 1) shrug my shoulders and say "
       <a href="http://www.bolgernow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Shoulder-shrug-old-lady.jpg">
        meh
       </a>
       ".  I'm not sure one is going to find "perfect people" or whatever in any group on the planet.  If there is information that is worthwhile, then one should pay attention to that information regardless of who else - good or bad - is also attracted to it.  With that in mind, 2) I've personally never allowed myself to pay too much attention to all the idiots that exist in almost really any group.  Sure.  There are a lot.  However, if there is something that I am interested in investigating, I simply pay attention to that which is sound and makes sense and is logical and throw away that which is stupid and doesn't make sense and isn't very logical.  You're going to find a bit of both in
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       it seems.  Again, your job isn't to only go toward that which is "100% perfect".  You're going to be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       disappointed if that is your modus operandi.  Instead, and as I've said already, learn to be critical and how to sift the wheat from the chaff.  Learn how to be properly discerning and how to assess information critically.  Also, 3) if you're so focused on disparaging a certain group and saying they're "this" or "that"...then why is it that you continue frequenting the very same circles that the group itself frequents?  I mean after all, you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       here in this sub, aren't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh but I'm not part of
       <em>
        these people!!
       </em>
       " is what you want to say?  Okay.  Perhaps not from
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       perspective, but I can guarantee you that you're likely lumped in with all the people you disparage in the eyes of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, if you have that big of a problem with a group you're talking about, then why spend so much time thinking about them?  Why not just go on about your way?  Seems kind of silly to me actually.

       I get that, and I appreciate that.  I also don't want you to think that any of my criticisms here are personal.  They're not.  You don't know me aside from some words on a screen, and I don't know you aside from some words on a screen.  I'm just pointing out that the words you've used are not indicative of a person that has thought about the topic or subject in a very deep or critical manner, and that person is subsequently making a lot of mistakes in thinking and errors in judgement that don't need to be made is all.

       I've read the thread you posted and honestly it's a bit far fetched. The teachings of the Occult, Freemasons, Crowley, and Baphomet aren't used for "evil black masses". They are tools for enlightenment, not darkness. Even the numbers he used could be interpreted in a few different ways. He just chose a way that fits his theory. I'm sure if you go and buy today's newspaper and play with the numbers in there you'll find something to relate to 9/11 or the Occult, does that mean the newspaper company practices Thelema or was a part of 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do admit that his theory would make a damn good book. He should sell the plot to Dan Brown.

       Don't get too stuck on the quantified data.  Almost no type of information on this planet and in this age will have "the full truth".  One must learn to be discerning and properly grasp what about any type of information is valuable, and what should be discarded.  Entirely accepting or entirely rejecting any type of data is usually not the wisest thing to do.

       It's sad that people have the tendency to marginalize what they don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of learning and improving themselves, they more often than not have a pretty typical knee jerk reaction designed to protect and preserve their tiny egos.  "Not looking stupid" trumps actually learning, unfortunately.  This prevents forward movement and keeps people dumb - stuck in the mud of their normal, unthinking existence.

       Besides, they don't have everything wrapped up nice and neat yet. They need a lock on water and oil still, and the rogue governments. The tensions from both sides in every aspect - religion, race, class, etc - need to get so high that we're killing each other, miserable, and falling apart at the seams. They're in the stages of building up what can only be called WW3, setting the stage, and after which their targets are going to be devastated and can be conquered with consent.

       It's not some big secret. It's right in front of our faces. Hell it's plastered all over the UN all the time. There are just a few pesky pieces of the puzzle left. They present it so seemingly harmlessly: Nations working together for global organization and democracy. A global society. On the surface it sounds like a good idea, but in the details it's disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the Illuminati is a small part of a much larger concept that's been around so much longer: The idea that man's reason is supreme. To craft an age of intellectualism. It's solving the puzzle of all man's problems using man's logic.

       The illuminati rulership of the planet extends into the supernatural, or superphysical to be accurate.  There are laws in everything, natural laws.  They have rulership over all worldly institutions but not total control over every human soul nor all the varying levels of consciousness among humans.  There are individuals on Earth who are much more advanced in consciousness than the highest illuminati and even higher then supernatural rulers over illuminati.  Yet the purpose and meaning of life on Earth is self-initiated growth in consciousness for every human being.  Thus freedom is not only natural law but obviously a necessity for the entire process to work.  So it's a constant battle of stopping illuminati while letting humans gain free will.  Illuminati are basically the disruptive schoolchildren at planetary and spiritual scale.

       Right, but I never said
       <em>
        every single
       </em>
       conspiracy theorist, that's just how you interpreted my post. I've said I was speaking about the ones that I have met. It was even in my second post that you quoted, I also used the words "majority" and "general" in a couple of others. What I don't understand is why ignore the main idea and focus solely on something insignificant like if I actually meant
       <em>
        every single
       </em>
       conspiracy theorist or not. Why does that even matter? It really has nothing to do with why conspiracy theories are bullshit and the well known conspiracy theorists use propaganda to shape the world view of innocent people for a pay check.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever, buddy. If you'd rather have a discussion about this petty bullshit than the serious issues at hand, I'm done.

       Logically it doesn't make any sense to. Why spend the time and resources doing all these "false flag" attacks and spending decades "stripping us of our freedom"  when, if what conspiracy theorists say is true, the government already has us by the balls. They can go in for the kill at anytime according to how conspiracy theorists interpreted the Patriot Act.

       It's not some big secret. It's right in front of our faces. Hell it's plastered all over the UN all the time. There are just a few pesky pieces of the puzzle left. They present it so seemingly harmlessly: Nations working together for global organization and democracy. A global society. On the surface it sounds like a good idea, but in the details it's disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the Illuminati is a small part of a much larger concept that's been around so much longer: The idea that man's reason is supreme. To craft an age of intellectualism. It's solving the puzzle of all man's problems using man's logic.

       You see where it's gotten us, and I bet you have at least a vague idea where we're headed.
