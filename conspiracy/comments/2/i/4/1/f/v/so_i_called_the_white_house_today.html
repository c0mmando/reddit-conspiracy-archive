       I got an operator. She said do you have a comment for the president? I said yes I would like to know why president Obama is not stopping all inbound flights and not closing birders when European and African countries are. She said she would pass it along and I said thanks and hung up
      </p>
      <p>
       Then 20 minutes later, I got a restricted phone call. I missed the call and the restricted number called back again. I answered and said hello. There was a quick static sound then one beep and it hung up. I thought that was weird

       I'm already on it for tor, im an ancap and I say whatever I want when I want without caring who the fuck is listening. Im not going to not speak my mind because some nerds in Utah are collecting my data. If you think twice about what you say then then they already won right? It doesn't bother me, I don't do anything wrong and I don't hurt people. I wont be silenced, I don't care if some guys in suits in Washington gave the nsa this unconstitutional power. Im a free sovereign human and I take orders from Noone but myself

       Same here. I don't know about you but I want true freedom. Their needs to be people like us because if there wasn't, we'd be where they want us to be already, as serfs. Honestly in my head I am truly free. Everything I do is my choice. Freedom is a state of mind, in my opinion,  based on your likes and dislikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it goes deeper then that but I really think about the costumes the cops wear and how they think they are above the law because they have a shiny badge and a gun. I laugh when I see cops because it is just a costume they have on and they don't even realize they are the politicians will manifested in human for to do their bidding on whatever laws they sign

       True freedom.  That thought has plagued me for years.  I once thought I was free, growing up in a solid middle class family in America.

       I once thought I was free, becoming a man and starting a family.

       I once thought I was free, when I realized I was being lied to and that I had the power to free myself.

       How long did it take again?  Less than a week for the 'guard' to resort to brutality?  That's a disturbing study, and speaks volumes of the threat of authority over others.

       Yes sir. I think it was exactly at the 1 week mark. The doctor said he felt like a prison warden. I think the number of the guy they were messing with was 226. Months later 226 and the guard said they still felt weird around each other

       Not exactly as you are trying to imply, but you may potentially show signs of what could lead to becoming a terrorist, which may then lead to increased surveillance.

      <p>
       Read the whole of the first document from the link you posted, because the author of the activist post you linked is actually misconstruing what is said in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       The activist post says people who may be considered terrorist are "Those that talk about individual liberties", but that's not actually true according to the document.

       Introduction Section E. Recruiting moves, Subsection 1. Introduction bullet point 2 states: Nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the document doesn't actually state "if you talk about personal liberties, you are a terrorist", it states that this is one of the recruitment efforts that extremist groups engage in.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - The activist post is misleading and wrong, and it's that type of shit that makes people view this sub as not credible, because people post articles that state things that are wrong.

       Questioning the government is a terrorist act now. Look at all the peaceful protests and how they were victimized by the police for simply standing around with signs. Actually making contact with the government is the same thing as threatening them with assassination.

       Nothing I do is considered "suspicious", it is considered a citizen actively engaging in the democratic process as proscribed by the system which we are a part of.

       In response to that awful incorrect activist post article you linked:
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the whole of the first document from the link you posted, because the author of the activist post you linked is actually misconstruing what is said in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       The activist post says people who may be considered terrorist are "Those that talk about individual liberties", but that's not actually true according to the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       DEOMI EOAC STUDENT GUIDE - 3150 - EXTREMISM - FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - DO NOT USE ON THE JOB
      </p>
      <p>
       Introduction Section E. Recruiting moves, Subsection 1. Introduction bullet point 2 states: Nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the document doesn't actually state "if you talk about personal liberties, you are a terrorist", it states that this is one of the recruitment efforts that extremist groups engage in.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - The activist post is misleading and wrong, and it's that type of shit that makes people view this sub as not credible, because people post articles that state things that are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My God this shit is getting old.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW, as to the second article you linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "privacy-conscious" people being labelled as suspect by the NSA are those who are explicitly looking for software which allows one to avoid direct surveillance online.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is targeting people who actually do show signs of "potential terrorist activity" only by the fact that terrorist groups are actively trying to avoid surveillance by using tools of the same nature for anonymous communication.

      <p>
       Duh? They wouldn't be spying on you if they weren't trying to control you in any way, even if the controlling is indirect, such as by posting a whole bunch of shit online to scare you into just staying in your home and going nowhere, not being any form of threat to their system.

      <p>
       None of us are spared, we are all spied on, all of us are more than likely spied on more just for posting here, so what the fuck does making a call to the white house requesting the president takes actions which will secure our national safety and security matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, that should make them view you in a better light as you are showing that you do not want any harm to befall your fellow citizens.

       The analogy is useful (at some levels of analysis) but does break down. The brain does perform
       <em>
        computations
       </em>
       (at least: some our computational models fit with observations).
      </p>
      <p>
       Computers' power comes from the capacity to rapidly process information using binary to perform Boolean operations. This is done in serial. Brains are much slower than a computer, and heavily use parallel processing (although both parallel and serial are used such as in the dorsal and ventral visual pathways). Brains have an absurd
       <em>
        number
       </em>
       of subunits with ridiculous
       <em>
        connectivity
       </em>
       which allows statistical computation - also the degrees of freedom in the way signals can be modulated is huge. Both feed-back and feed-forward means that signals can be altered at many levels in a pathway, [my textbook claims] in the thalamo-cortical loops to the motor cortex around ~70% of the neurons are from the cortex back to the thalamus feeding back on the signals at an earlier stage which allows fine adjustments (like an optimisation).
      </p>
      <p>
       One final difference, if we're looking at temporal processes, brains as we think of them have enormous causal power in the world; our brains control a sophisticated motor system, not to mention many autonomous systems to control our viscera. We live. We change our environment, we disperse force through space over time, we react. Computers are much more inert, relying on user input. The way our brain develops and changes (thus what certain computations, at a macro level, end up producing) is shaped by memory and feedback from exercising that causal power.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the analogy is limited.

       I was going to go to the climate March to the UN 2 weeks ago but decided not to. All it was was commies socialists and Marxists. Personally I don't believe in man made global warming and was going to film.

       It wasn't for climate change. Just like occupy, there were alot of commies and far left socialist Marxist. It was an anti capitalist March on Wall Street. Personally I don't give a shit if someone has money. I care about people rigging the game so only them and their buddies win

       I fucking hate crony capitalism. It gives actual free market capitalism a bad name. That's why so many millennial are socialists commies or Marxist, because they believe it's all capitalism fault and not corporations in bed with the government with massive tax breaks and all of this bullshit getting small businesses closed down. I'm an advocate for true free market capitalism with anarchy.

       Don't be too quick to marginalize those ideologies any more than capitalism or "democracy".  They're all forms of control that have been put in place by an elite and designed to limit the masses.

       Are you serious? Open your eyes man! Go take a look at youtube and you can find literally THOUSANDS of videos like the one on the front page today where the FBI visited a woman who protests in order to ask her if she was going to do any crime in the future.

       Privacy has always been a sort of illusion. If you work somewhere, the information of when you leave your house every day, what route you take, where your work place is, when you leave work, and how you get home is all public information, should somebody track said info.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is easily done with use of no electronic equipment, you could gain it all by following the person around on horseback and writing it all down if you really wanted to use no electricity, I'm not being hyperbolic either I'm being dead serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think we were un-trackable before the internet and cell phones, LOL.

       Privacy does not quite work how you think it does.

       Horses and pens actually DO have technical meta-data, were you to properly collect an analyze it.

       You could set up two electronic troughs which track the data of how much food the horse consumes, and which food it prefers.

       Gotcha.  I agree that it's kinda pointless to think that you'd be under "enhanced surveillance" as if all possible data isn't already being collected.  "Enhanced surveillance" would probably just mean that they're actively monitoring the data they have about a person as opposed to just collecting it.

       Probably an automated system calling you back and it didn't work correctly. Maybe one of those "Thank you for calling blah blah blah we value your opinion blah blah blah we'll take your thoughts into consideration blah blah blah" type of things. That would be my guess. Knowing how terrible the government is with technology it probably didn't work right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were tapping your phone or some stupid shit you'd never know. They would just arrange it with your service provider and you would be "tapped". It wouldn't exactly require then to call you and static your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       You called a publicly available phone number that allows you to speak with the "President". Plus you'll probably never be forwarded to him,  and they probably don't even tell him what is said.

       I get that dude. How many times can you say that? It doesn't matter. Most lines coming from the White House probably show up as restricted. Shit I can make my phone number show up as restricted. So unless you can come up with a reason for it to be something more nefarious I think you're just reaching for something that's not there.

       Or has DARPA not developed laser systems and drones which can stay airborne for over 3 weeks with a visual radius of coverage of 25 kilometers with the ability to view up to 3 inches from the ground and have over 12 displays pulled up which all track every object in motion on screen?

       Right, the government is NOT terrible with technology, you are confusing that for the government being in bed with corrupt businesses, holding back technological progress so as to maximize profits.

       Sounds like they they aren't terrible with technology if they are capable of doing that, the average citizen is completely incapable of that, so really the average citizen is more inept with technology than the federal government.

       Trifling? What are you, a 90 year old man? Who says that shit. I'm talking about a publicly available call system for citizens to speak to the government. The people behind that are the part of the government we are referring to. They have zero things to do with DARPA (which is mostly contractors and not government officials by the way).

       I have a vocabulary. I'm just not old and don't feel the need to use antiquated words for no reason. I tend to stick to more current terms to capture the broadest audience. That's not my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've basically said a whole lot of nothing. I'm sorry I made you butt hurt from making the statement about the government and is general lack of technical knowledge. You seem to be caught up on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of my statement is there are many parts of the government that cannot use computers and technology well. I've seen it first hand. It's not too hard to believe someone didn't setup a callback correctly and that's why it did what it played static and a click. That happens when you call into a computer or fax sometimes. So assuming it's a call from the white house that wad my guess. It could also just be from something unrelated.

      <p>
       From individuals, that doesn't equate to the whole, thus you can't use that as basis for claiming that "the government knows nothing of technology".

      <p>
       Of course, that's a possibility for sure, though a small possibility as the automated callback system has been in place for years and doesn't require any human to allow the call to be placed once a person has placed a call themselves, that's why it's called automated call back.

       It could also possibly be a technical error.

       The answer to your question is simple... because of the GDP (aka the economy).  Let's skip all the feasibility issues with shutting down every single international airport, closing the borders, and also shutting down the ports of entry (yes, people still come into the country via boats, trains, and other methods of travel).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that they actually did close everything.  This would prevent
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       entry or exit from the country, not just for people, but goods also.  This includes food, clothing, and even the materials to build structures that are harvested from other countries and shipped to the US.  The shelves would be cleared in a matter of days as shoppers purchased every single item that was previously shipped in from China, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and other various cheap-labor countries.  Gas stations would run dry because we can't import crude oil from other countries anymore to process in our refineries.  Besides the severe lack of food (which would cause a mass panic and hundreds of thousands of deaths), consumption (i.e. buying useless crap from stores) would come to a screeching halt, and, if you knew the first thing about economics, you would realize that the GDP of the US is based on the cash flow from one hand to another.  This includes the cash flow from consumer to business but also includes the cash flow between corporations and foreign countries at the ports of entry when they pay for the goods that come in on huge container ships.  And the GDP is the virtual paycheck of the US which means that the entire system would go belly-up in a matter of days.

       It probably was already, I downloaded tor, and I'm an ancap and I'm reverent of personal liberty, Ron Paul supporter etc. Not worried about it,  I live my life and I'm not a robot. Im not going to let people tell me how to live my life. I wont give into tyranny. More people have to ask questions. Don't let anything scare you into submission because if that's that case, the authoritarian already won. I love this quote from Jefferson.

       I broke my phone last year and picked up a cheap flip phone until my new one showed up. No one had the number yet but within 2 hours it rang with a restricted number. Same thing; hiss, beep, disconnected. Pretty sure you're tapped.

       Who knows? I'm pretty vocal about the bullshit that the government does. I've had some involvement with the FBI in the past and am very forward with my rights anytime I interact with police so they might just be keeping an electronic leash on me. I really don't know or care about that since it won't stop me from voicing what I think is right.

       What is the White House phone number? I will call myself as soon as I have it, ask the same thing, and report back.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Google says this is it: (202) 456-1111
      </p>
      <p>
       Same response, "Okay, I will pass that on, thanks for calling."
      </p>
      <p>
       And now I play the waiting game.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2: about an hour later and no calls yet. I also may have been flagged by the government previously due to what I post online, that I don't hide my identity, and things I have done IRL. Not anything that matters, but you know, "a known dissenter. "
