    <div class="md"><p>Just wana say thanks for putting this out there. Everyone should give this a watch. It&#39;s only 43 minutes long. </p>

<p>It cleared up a lot of problems I had understanding why things are happening as they are and as they have been. Essentially bankers want private banks installed in every single country, and will oppose any nation that opposes usury.</p>

<p>Makes sense too. My dad used to work as an architect back in the 70s and 80s and he would tell me that a lot of his friends would go to work in the Middle East because they wouldn&#39;t get taxed whilst working over there.. because there was more than enough to go around. All matches up. If the bankers get their way it won&#39;t be that way for long.</p>

<p>After I saw this I wanted to know more. I also wanted to fact check and see if there was any bias in the film. After doing a lot of reading online from various sources. Everything I learned only served to reinforce the claims represented and put forth in this film. Basically the FBI lies their balls off left and right. I even started making a list of their lies and it was 30 lines long before I got tired and gave up. Too many to count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just the lies and the cover-up, that&#39;s to be expected.

    <div class="md"><p>A must watch documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/85948693">The Century Of The Self</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This series is about how those in power have used Freud&#39;s theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed the perception of the human mind and its workings profoundly.</p>

<p>His influence on the 20th century is widely regarded as massive. The documentary describes the impact of Freud&#39;s theories on the perception of the human mind, and the ways public relations agencies and politicians have used this during the last 100 years for their engineering of consent. Among the main characters are Freud himself and his nephew Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in advertising. He is often seen as the father of the public relations industry.</p>

<p>Freud&#39;s daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in the second part, as well as Wilhelm Reich, one of the main opponents of Freud&#39;s theories. Along these general themes, The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy and its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the attitude to fashion and superficiality.</p>

<p>Happiness Machines. Part one documents the story of the relationship between Sigmund Freud and his American nephew, Edward Bernays who invented Public Relations in the 1920s, being the first person to take Freud&#39;s ideas to manipulate the masses.</p>

<p>Vaccines are a polarising issue for sure; people tend to gravitate toward the extreme terminals of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Sure, many vaccines do a lot of good. To make a generalisation about a certain ample of vaxx: they&#39;re a cost-effective way of raising the standards of population health and preventing some nasty shit. Buuuuuuuuuut... that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re de facto above scrutiny. There&#39;s enough evidence to warrant scepticism. And when there&#39;s an unscrupulous corporate industry behind &#39;em you gotta follow the money.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that people who are blindly pro-vax will harp on about &quot;science&quot; and &quot;facts&quot; yet deny, despite evidence of cases, that at least there have been instances where vaccines have been tainted by adulterants causing deleterious effects to the recipients. If one really did care about vaccination use, one would be inquiring into how these things happen to prevent them from ever happening again. And that&#39;s not even the tip of the iceberg, and that&#39;s a completely different iceberg to ones which are more nebulous... Well, I guess people compare themselves to Jim Carrey&#39;s wife and believe themselves to be experts on immunology by comparison.</p>

<p>tl;dr anybody who puts blind faith in modern mechanistic medicine &amp; purports all manifestations of modern medicine are unquestionably benevolent forces clearly knows jack all about modern medicine.</p>

<p>The Zapruder Film Mystery</p>

<p>Was the Zapruder Film altered by the CIA in the days after the JFK assassination to hide evidence of a conspiracy? Legendary <strong>CIA photo interpreter Dino Brugioni</strong> thinks it was.</p>

<p>In this film, Brugioni speaks for the first time about his examination of the film at the <strong>CIA&#39;s National Photographic Interpretation Center</strong> on the Saturday evening after the assassination. As researcher Doug Horne discovers, Brugioni was not aware of a second examination of the film at NPIC the following evening by a completely different team and believes the Zapruder Film in the archives today is not the film he saw the day after the assassination.</p>

<p>Drawing on Volume 4 of his book Inside the ARRB, Doug Horne, former chief analyst of military records at the Assassination Records Review Board, sets the scene for his interview with Brugioni and presents his disturbing conclusions.</p>

<p>Definitely look forward to it coming out--the sooner the better.</p>

<p>Maybe there will be more info in the <em>KILLING OSWALD</em> documentary--this was just an extra feature to the dvd. I originally found this doc posted on jfkfacts.org...<a href="http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/rewinding-the-zapruder-film/#more-15891">http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/rewinding-the-zapruder-film/#more-15891</a></p>

<p>All of these are amazing, and im a serious documentary head.  I have been following these threads.. And i love this idea.. I run a hip hop group in NYC and i make my group watch one doc a week to spark inspiration..  But this reddit thing is just plain awesome. Honestly, the 5 docs i just named are some of the best, and at some point NEED to be watched by you guys. I like docs to have a certain quality, and the ones i named are top notch.</p>
