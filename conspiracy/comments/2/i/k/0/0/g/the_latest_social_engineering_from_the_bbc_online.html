        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all know that BBC News is the heart of Western Propaganda, but what about the online magazine section of their website, is it innocent or does it perform another important role?  Let&#39;s have a look through one of their recent stories, we will look closely at the &#39;lessons&#39; they are trying to teach.  The article in question is <strong>Why short men make better husbands</strong>, it&#39;s been incredibly popular over the last few days.</p>

<p><strong>A Point of View: Why short men make better husbands</strong></p>

<p>(it&#39;s a long story you don&#39;t have to read it all)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29464446">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29464446</a></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s home in directly on the morals of the story...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;There is, I think, a broader moral here. In every area of life, we underrate the merits of desperation, and persistently overrate the advantages of free choice&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>They are saying that desperation is good, such as in the coming later stages of the Ebola outbreak or WW3.  That is because when we are desperate for food, water, money or medicine we are easier to control.</p></li>
<li><p>Free choice for us is seen as bad , like us deciding to avoid untested sterilizing vaccines, yes free choice makes us difficult to control.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;Frequent failure is the true price of free choice.&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They want to convince us that we are not smart enough to make our own decisions, our freedom should be taken away.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;It is not an accident, I think, that the great periods of civilisation tend to follow on and then appear not in moments of abundance alone, but of renewed relief. They come shortly after some disaster that has given an entire community the same sense of having made it by the skin of their teeth that a short man feels, looking gratefully at his wife in the early morning.&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They could be talking about the later stages of the planned Ebola outbreak or WW3, trying to convince us that what happens is beneficial for us, when really it only benefits those who want complete control of society, currently there are too many for them to keep control over.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;Renaissance Florence appeared in the wake of the black plague that halved its population. The Paris we love most, that of the impressionists and the Belle Epoque, rose with the smouldering ruins of the Franco-Prussian war still visible in its centre. They were reduced - shortened, one might even say - but they clung to pleasure. Entitlement and its disappointments make wars. Desperation and gratitude build cities.&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Now they are clearly talking about a huge depopulation, so by telling us that short men are more successful in marriage they really telling us that a smaller population will be easier for them to keep control over.</li>
</ul>

<p>What would be the purpose of pushing these morals?  They want to reboot human society, they want a huge engineered crisis from which they will bring order out of chaos, this could be the Ebola outbreak or WW3 after which they want to take away our freedoms and keep the population down to a level which is easier for them to control.  They are pumping out morals to the masses, like religions do, this is to soften us up so as there is less resistance when the time comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, fuck this. This breakdown makes me a bit apprehensive about the future. It reads like an annotated version of your favorite holy book, which says a lot about their audience. Thanks for this! I&#39;ll make it my goal not to be fearful of this predicted future because if there&#39;s any time to have patience and clear thought, it&#39;d be when I&#39;m afraid. From this perspective I think it&#39;s easy to see how I should take this if this interpretation turned out to be true. So keeping as many people alive and with freedom is the name of the game. From now on, I have no enemies. I&#39;ll start from individual freedoms and move up, because the freedoms of many people is pretty messy and probably the reason some (who knows how many) would agree with BBC&#39;s propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ain&#39;t that the truth. I recognized it after experiencing years trapped in the fear-apathy cycle which left me either overwhelmed and paralyzed or complacent and bothered. Only God knows why or how I stepped out of that infinite loop but for now I&#39;ll chalk it up to newly acquired knowledge/interpretation of the world and my lack of faith in it. Patience would eventually reaffirm or disprove any knowledge(or lack of it) that I assumed to be true. For what it&#39;s worth though, I found that patience in acknowledging an omnipotent and omnipresent God although I have doubts of anything beyond that including my belief system (Islam).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s it baby!  This is the kind of thinking we need to see from everyone.</p>

<p>Understanding that staying in that cycle does nothing except support it, staying apathetic and inactive should be thought of as even MORE damaging than growing a pair of balls and being able to simply stand up and say what you believe in.  There is no reason to fear. Only taking action and challenging the problem head on will resolve issues for ourselves and future generations.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all in the same boat, manipulated or otherwise.</p>

<p>Glad to have you next to me, fellow human being.  Take care out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. <strong>Read the entire article.</strong> Don&#39;t be mislead by someone saying &quot;Don&#39;t read it all. Read these cherry-picked quotes instead!&quot;</p>

<p>The article is very clearly talking about the fact that short guys (usually) have a very tough time in the world of finding a special person to share their life. Women discriminate against them. It&#39;s tough, but that&#39;s life for you. You can&#39;t pass laws against it or anything, or make people date shorter guys. But you can raise awareness of the issue, and let people perhaps question their own feelings on the matter. Which is the aim of that article.</p>

<p>However, <strong>none</strong> of this is covered in OPs ridiculously <strong>unrelated</strong> diatribe.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s crap! It literally has nothing to do with it!</p>

<p>Every time it mentions desperation in the article, it&#39;s talking about the desperation of shorter men, and how they will try harder and work more at a relationship - because it&#39;s been harder for them to get into one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would be the purpose of pushing these morals? They want to reboot human society, they want a huge engineered crisis from which they will bring order out of chaos, this could be the Ebola outbreak or WW3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What on Earth are you talking about, OP? Have you reached the point now where <strong>literally anything</strong> is a sign of impending doom and evil forces plotting the overthrow of mankind?</p>

<p>tldr: Read the article. OP&#39;s rant is completely unrelated.</p>
