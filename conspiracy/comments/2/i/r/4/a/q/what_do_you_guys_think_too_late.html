       While the thought of someone who is showing symptoms of Ebola just hopping on an international flight is scary, the odds of that were already somewhat low. What many people are worried about (myself included) is the possibility of asymptomatic carriers travelling to other countries and then developing the symptoms (and becoming contagious) after arrival. This is precisely what happened in the Duncan case, and yet these are precisely the sorts of cases that the screening procedures are likely to miss. We must also consider the case of the nurse infected in Spain-- she originally had to insist on being tested for Ebola because even though she was feverish, her fever measured slightly below the official WHO guidelines.

       Agreed. I believe if they really wanted to stop this outbreak in its tracks, they would ban all outgoing flights from those countries, only allow aid flights to and from, ajd quarentine the aid workers once they come back home. Do the same for any american citizens who have a right to return home, either ship them by boat to provide isolation and quarentine time, and then keep them isolated upon arrival to finish quarentine, or just throw them straight into qiarentine upon arrival of a designated flight... Imo, at least...

       The NBC cameraman and the NBC crew with Snyderman went through a fever checkpoint just days before the fellow fell ill. Fever checkpoints are ridiculous. A retention period for monitoring would be better.

       They'll say they will be, but I doubt it. It seems like this is something they want to happen, because it's a great crisis and you "never let a good crisis go to waste."

      <p>
       We'll see fancy vids on the primetime news of people in airports with Predator Vision© and it will look fancy as fuck. Once it's shown that the fever checks don't work, people will not really want to fly or travel for awhile, which is a great way to get the cattle to herd themselves together without you having to do much besides play some programs on TV and say it's the truth.

       Remember all of the put options on the airlines? I could actually see that as a possible strategy again for TPTB to make some quick cash on the hysteria when airline stocks inevitably drop. Maybe?

       Oh, young padawan, here it comes!
      </p>
      <p>
       A ridiculous amount of 'put' options were placed on the airlines most affected by the 9/11 Official Story, which are stock bets that the price would fall. Here is a quote from Allen Poteshman, in the Journal of Business in July of 2006. There are plenty of mainstream sources that reported this 10 years ago as well. Good summary in his Intro:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, there was widespread speculation that the terrorists or their associates had used advance knowledge of the attacks to profit in the financial markets.1 Much of the attention focused on the trading in the days leading up to September 11 in options written on American Airlines (AMR) and United Airlines (UAL), the two companies whose planes were hijacked and crashed by the terrorists. Since the value of a put (call) option is decreasing (increasing) in the price of the underlying stock, the put‐call volume ratio is a common measure of the extent to which positions established by option market trading will profit when the underlying stock price falls rather than rises. It is commonly believed that a typical put‐call ratio is in the neighborhood of one,2 and according to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) Web site (
        <a href="http://www.theocc.com">
         http://www.theocc.com
        </a>
        ), the September 10 put‐call ratio for AMR options was 6.09 and the September 6 put‐call ratio for UAL options was 25.4.
       </p>

       <p>
        Investors have yet to collect more than $2.5 million in profits they made trading options in the stock of United Airlines before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to a source familiar with the trades and market data.
       </p>
       <p>
        The uncollected money raises suspicions that the investors -- whose identities and nationalities have not been made public -- had advance knowledge of the strikes.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Usually, if someone has a windfall like that, you take the money and run," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

       Here's what the 9/11 Commission reported regarding the put options:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual
pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options—investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price—surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10—highly suspicious trading on its face.
        <strong>
         Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11.

        k) TRADING SUSPENSIONS EMERGENCY AUTHORITY
(1) TRADING SUSPENSIONS
.—If in its opinion the public interest and the protection of investors so require, the Commission is authorized by order—
(A) summarily to suspend trading in any security (other than an exempted security) for a period not exceed
ing 10 business days, and
(B) summarily to suspend all trading on any national
securities exchange or otherwise, in securities other than
exempted securities, for a period not exceeding 90 calendar
days.

may by order summarily take such action to alter, supplement, suspend, or impose requirements or restrictions with respect to any matter or action subject to regulation by the Commission or a self-regulatory organization under the securities laws, as the Commission determines is necessary
in the public interest and for the protection of investors—

       Remember the 'footage' of planes hitting the towers? Do you think it's a coincidence that the impact zones at both towers included the offices of Garban Intercapital, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Eurobrokers, three of the largest securities firms in the nation who allegedly have ties to the alphabet organizations. Flight 175 hit just below Eurobrokers (missed by 5 floors), and Flight 11 struck close to Cantor Fitzgerald's offices. Due to the eased regulatory restrictions and chaos of the day, an estimated $240 billion in securities was cleared, upon maturity, on September 12th.

       It's unfortunate that is isn't more well-known, but after 13 years the memory-holes are very well concealed.

       You're very welcome. This type of evidence based discussion is what r/conspiracy should be about, because the facts should be on our side. Bonus points if the MSM gets to be used but I prefer to go to sources (SEA of 1934) whenever possible.

       Do you know when they officially said the outbreak started? Tekmiras stocks were at 30.94 points back on march 11th, then steadily dropped down to 12.75 by april 15th,
      </p>
      <p>
       Then stayed around that area until august 11th in whcih it shot up to 23.80 where it has beej oscillating around thst value ever since...
