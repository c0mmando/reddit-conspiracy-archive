       I've seen two seperate documentaries now that refer to some experiments that showed that speaking certain ancient languages in the correct way can cause specific manifestations in the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example would be with cymatics where speaking a word or sound would produce a shape in the medium (most often sand) that matches the letter used in that language to represent that sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, along with cymatics in general, is extremely fascinating to me but I can't seem to find any solid information about any of it. If anyone has any resources I'd love to see them.

       I don't have anything to add, just wanted to say I'm also interested. I learned about cymatics (funny how spellcheck underlines it in red like it's not a word...) recently after seeing some youtube videos on it. I think the fact that in 24 years of life I had never heard of it, and it was never taught in school, is extremely strange. Makes me wonder why this is being hidden.

       The fact that sound can create visible patterns that reflect patterns found in nature reinforces the concept that everything is vibration.

       Exact same thought I had. How is this not a HUGE scientific field? What are the practical applications? It seems insane to me that this is something that appears to be entirely ignored.

       And this seems to be a culmination of religious, mythological and scientific knowledge in modern times. Quantum/string theory shows us that everything gets fuzzy the smaller we go. We live in a sea of quantum fluctuations. The idea that everything is a vibration seems to make sense.

       I wish I could find it but there was a video about how every word for god in every language involves the sound "ahhh" as that is the sound we most easily make when we look up to the heavens.
It also had really cool Ahhhh music in the background. Wish I could find it.

       Who's hiding it? And what other "huge scientific fields" are being kept hidden? Bleeding-edge research isn't performed in secret gov't labs, it's proof-of-concepted in academia until it gets to a more applicable state, at which point in may or may not be taken up by DARPA depending on the type of technology and industry.

       The landmark paper that introduced this has never been replicated (and has been tested by major labs), and the reason it's ignored is b/c scientists have pretty firmly concluded it's an empty rabbit hole. If you actually perform the same procedure in a proper vacuum, there's no effect.

       I actually worked in a university lab on this technology and all of our funding came from DARPA b/c the government doesn't have the budget for funding their own dedicated departments for this bleeding edge research. There are several major journals dedicated to publishing this material.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as mind control, my degree was in biochemistry with a minor in neuroscience, and the portrayal of mind-control is far from the actual realities of implementation. Truth-serums? Barely more effective than alcohol.

      <p>
       No, I'm not saying that secret research facilities don't exist at all. What I'm saying is that the
       <em>
        vast majority
       </em>
       of bleeding-edge research is done in academia, where there are
       <em>
        lots of specialized academics.
       </em>
       So sure, at Fort Detrick they have specialized, biowarfare research that's off the books. But things like energy and propulsion? There's big money and recognition to be made by researchers who make advances in this, so you can bet they're going after it.

       Are you referring to TT Brown?  His is by no means the only work done on this subject.  I'd recommend Paul LaViolette's book - he's compiled a ton of good information about it.  Joseph P. Farrell also has a few books that touch on this research.  It's pretty well documented.

       What do you think about MK-Ultra and Monarch programming?  How about V2K technology?  Have you ever read the "Mindwar" paper co-written by Michael Aquino?  It's pretty short.  I don't know if you're deliberately downplaying some of the technology that's been in existence for decades but if not you should try looking into some of it because I believe you're way off here in saying that alcohol is as effective.

       Dr. LaViolette is an interesting and smart man. He's been quite productive throughout his life, but yet the Biefeld-Brown effect
       <em>
        has never been reproduceable.
       </em>
       Ever. So while some of his other theories are interesting and worth pursuing, I don't think one can objectively buy into that particular theory given the history of laboratory failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Joseph P Farrell, he's never had any scientific training and does not practice the craft of inquiry with any rigor at all. He's a snake-oil salesman.

       Such as statement is infuriatingly ignorant and a disservice to people who need help. The amount of energy required, the real-time targeting that would be required to track a single-individual (or other people would be affected), and with no loss of fidelity. I don't even.

       This is extremely interesting. It reminds me of some tests done awhile back where they introduced sound waves to a pan of sand at certain frequencies, and the frequencies caused the sand to create patterns. These patterns were very intricate and replicable oer each frequency, and those patterns also tended to fit some ancient megalithic stuctures and stuff.

       I feel like a certain harmony or set of tones will produce the flower of life pattern and that there is something special to that frequency. I wish I had the time and money to make my own setup so I can fool around and see what I can get. I've never seen anyone apply 2 tones at once to a cymatic setup, I want to know what shapes it produces.
