       If Obama stops plane flights to the Ebola countries, people will start asking him why he is deliberately leaving the southern border wide open to hoards of illiterate, diseased illegals from Central America. What is he going to say to that? So the planes keep flying, and people who may have Ebola are permitted to wander around the US.

       I won't paint the entire subreddit with a broad brush but if the government did what OP suggests the same people who complain about lack of action would be complaining about jackbooted thugs, how ebola is just a means for martial law, etc.

       There are numerous reasons why I would oppose stopping incoming passengers for searches and checks but for flights originating in western Africa inbound to the USA, I would not think it unreasonable to hold visitors in a 21 day quarantine for the safety of the rest of the entire country. A visitor could delay their flight, agree to the 21 day stay or not travel.

       Ebola might be a biological war attack similar to the anthrax attacks that were perpetrated on the US population shortly after the 9/11 attacks.  Fear is popular.  Population reduction is sought by some (Georgia Guidestones).  And historical precedence is there with Operation Gladio and the Strategy of Tension.

       Population control. Baby boomers must die for social security to survive.  Pyramid schemes come to a grinding halt unless the massive bottom layer of eaters is replaced with payers, thereby delaying the inevitable global economic meltdown and continuing the upward transfer and centralization of wealth into the hands of the few.

       Secondly from a conspiracy theorist standpoint, would you want that law to be in effect? If you're coming from a country labeled as an Ebola threat you can be  detained for up to a week? It sounds like it would be a huge violation of rights, its along the same lines as the patriot act and NSA spying. I wouldn't be for it at all even if it means lowering the chance of Ebola transmission.

       Having Ebola and merely going a place where it isn't makes you a walking biological weapon of mass destruction. Given the nature of this as an exponentially self-replicating contagion caused by something invisible to the naked eye, coming from a country where it exists is reasonable suspicion.

       There's limited downside to delaying some people's travel plans for a day or two. Limited upside and unlimited downside to allowing that risk to enter a place where it was simply not previously. But given what we're seeing in Texas it's too late for that. No intervention at the societal level in the U.S. is going to work. It's a short bus nation. This thing will just have to run its course.

       Viruses are not self replicating, they require a host. I'm sure you know this. Yes it is invisible to the naked eye but there are many diseases that are just as invisible and much more contagious. HIV, Mumps and Measels being a few. They aren't as deadly, but I mention them to show just how slowly this disease moves. Every person who has Ebola (historically) on average infects 2. For HIV the number is 4. For measles its 18.
      </p>

       America may not be fully equipped for a mass Ebola outbreak but I doubt that will be the case here. In W. Africa a major component of the spread is reusing needles and ignorance about the disease. In the US we're not as clean or intelligent as we could be but our citizens improve the capability of suppressing the spread massively.

       It's funny because if the govt was doing this you would see all kinds of posts on this sub about how the police and military are holding people against their will with no just cause and they're using Ebola as an excuse to take all our rights away. You can't win in this sub. I do enjoy reading some of the topics, but some, like this one don't make any sense. If some of these people had their way, the whole world would come to a standstill because of this Ebola outbreak.

       I would hope the CDC would have a handle on what to do.. other than allow it to spread so the economy wouldn't be affected.
