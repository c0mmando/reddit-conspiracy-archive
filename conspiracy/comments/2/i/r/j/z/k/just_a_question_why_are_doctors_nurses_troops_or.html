What is he going to say to that? So the planes keep flying, and people who may have Ebola are permitted to wander around the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is going to pay for that week of missed work? </p>

<p>Secondly from a conspiracy theorist standpoint, would you want that law to be in effect? If you&#39;re coming from a country labeled as an Ebola threat you can be  detained for up to a week? It sounds like it would be a huge violation of rights, its along the same lines as the patriot act and NSA spying. I wouldn&#39;t be for it at all even if it means lowering the chance of Ebola transmission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having Ebola and merely going a place where it isn&#39;t makes you a walking biological weapon of mass destruction. Given the nature of this as an exponentially self-replicating contagion caused by something invisible to the naked eye, coming from a country where it exists is reasonable suspicion.</p>

<p>There&#39;s limited downside to delaying some people&#39;s travel plans for a day or two. Limited upside and unlimited downside to allowing that risk to enter a place where it was simply not previously. But given what we&#39;re seeing in Texas it&#39;s too late for that. No intervention at the societal level in the U.S. is going to work. It&#39;s a short bus nation. This thing will just have to run its course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A walking biological weapon of mass destruction&quot; ok. wow. lol</p>

<p>Viruses are not self replicating, they require a host. I&#39;m sure you know this. Yes it is invisible to the naked eye but there are many diseases that are just as invisible and much more contagious. HIV, Mumps and Measels being a few. They aren&#39;t as deadly, but I mention them to show just how slowly this disease moves. Every person who has Ebola (historically) on average infects 2. For HIV the number is 4. For measles its 18.</p>

<p>America may not be fully equipped for a mass Ebola outbreak but I doubt that will be the case here. In W. Africa a major component of the spread is reusing needles and ignorance about the disease. In the US we&#39;re not as clean or intelligent as we could be but our citizens improve the capability of suppressing the spread massively.</p>
