<p>They responded with what is called the GLOMAR response, or where they state, &quot;we can neither confirm nor deny&quot; that documents exists.</p>

<p>In short, the FOIA requires agencies to respond to requesters, and in some cases will release information about what is being requested. Unfortunately, when you get a GLOMAR response like I did on this one, although they aren&#39;t &quot;confirming&quot; anything - it sure seems like I hit a nerve and whatever might exist - is highly classified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter who originally started the project. It&#39;s open source, there&#39;s more than enough eyes looking at it. Especially in the case of TOR, being what it is.  </p>

<p>Heck, the kernel code for Security Enhanced Linux was written by the NSA. In recent light, it&#39;s obvious that the NSA is a malicious entity. But still, i use a kernel with the SELinux patches on a machine hosting a fileserver.  </p>

<p>If it were closed source binary blobs, i&#39;d not touch them in a million years knowing they were published by the NSA or Naval Intelligence.  </p>

<p>Sure, i personally don&#39;t have the full knowledge nor time to dig through every source file, but projects such as TOR or SELinux, are security centric pieces of software, the paranoid (and rightly so) will be looking out for backdoors.  </p>

<p>Having said that, security virtually doesn&#39;t exist. You can&#39;t trust any piece of software 100%. Not even code written by yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly know your onions about TOR (and I make no such claims) but I have noticed that the Russians see TOR as a threat to their security, and are far more concerned about &quot;cracking&quot; TOR than the American intelligence community.

    <div class="md"><p>yup. disregarding if the tor software is secure or not, if USN intelligence runs some or most of the servers (and we all know how full of holes operating systems and hardware are) then the security of the tor software is a moot point. do you really think an intelligence agency would let an &quot;unbreakable&quot; anonymity tool it developed itself go wild? it let it go wild because you need a crowd to hide in if you want to be anonymous, as they did, for comms with agents etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to create a tool that provides anonymity, you kind of need to have a wide variety of people using it.   If you restrict TOR use to only people the government approves of then it becomes know that all traffic leaving TOR exit nodes are only from that group.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you can tell who sent the traffic, its bad because only that group uses that method.  To provide a reasonable amount of anonymity, it can&#39;t be known if the user is approved by a government organization or not.    It needs a large diverse population.   It needs to work equally well for both sides or its useless.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to bet a certain 3 letter agency knew about ShellShock and Heartbleed long before they were publicly disclosed.  Such undisclosed vulnerabilities would be immensely valuable in the intelligence sector.  </p>

<p>TOR is, and always has been, a honey pot.  If you can observe traffic entering and leaving the TOR network how exactly is TOR secure?        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heartbleed could have been found by almost anyone auditing underlying C code.  I&#39;m not dissing Mehta either, dude is brilliant.  </p>

<p>My point is in regards to open source, everyone assumes everyone is looking at the assembly code.  The reality, like we saw in Heartbleed, is that few people actually are doing so.  It took 2 years for someone to catch essentially a grammatical error in OpenSSL.  </p>

<p>Shellshock has existed in Bash since 1992.  Was only discovered last month.     </p>

<p>I really get a chuckle when people give open source software a pass because &quot;It&#39;s open source, there&#39;s more than enough eyes looking at it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can observe traffic entering and exiting, that&#39;s a necessity. It isn&#39;t designed to obfuscate what information is being sent/recieved. It&#39;s about hiding the origin of the person sending/receiving that information.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say TOR is secure. The fact is, no software is or will ever be secure, because as long as human is using it, the flaw is the person themselves. It&#39;s abit of a stretch to call TOR a honeypot... No doubt, some of the users and sites within the TOR network are indeed honeypots.  </p>

<p>IF there was a current flaw being exploited within the TOR network by the NSA or whoever, there is no evidence of it. You can&#39;t exploit a piece of networked connected software without leaving a trace. Whether that be packet headers or firewall logs.  </p>

<p>IF someone wanted to demask TOR users, it would be more logical to place backdoors in the software required to connect to it. That way it wouldn&#39;t be stumbled upon by people examining code. As is the case with the OpenSSL vulnerability. If you were running TOR and firefox to access it, you&#39;d more than likely have the OpenSSL library installed somewhere as an example. There are so many different attack vectors involved.  </p>

<p>If TOR really was a source of a purposely created backdoor, i feel it would have been spotted long ago.</p>
