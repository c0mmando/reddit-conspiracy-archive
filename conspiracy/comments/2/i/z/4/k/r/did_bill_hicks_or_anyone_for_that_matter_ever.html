       Check out that hightimes.com bob marley cia article.  I watched all those bill hicks documentaries and they dont mention him ever thinking about that. But its possible.. Probably. Cancer in your 30s for people who speak out seems pretty  suspicious..

       He didn't smoke and drink anymore than ALOT of people I know. He had quit drinking before his 30s and quit smoking, only to start again when he heard he was going to die. I know barflys who are 80 years old. I understand, people get cancer, but he was very young and because of the bush hating he was doing, I wanted to ask questions.

       I do remember there being some talk on Usenet about this. Don't forget is very close in time to Frank Zappa dying of cancer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zappa was talking about running for president at the time. There was some talk about a CIA "cancer gun"  that was being used to take out anti-establishment figureheads.

       It's now been proven that Arafat was poisoned.

      <p>
       "Swiss forensic experts said last month that their tests of samples taken from Arafat's body were consistent with polonium poisoning, while not absolute proof of the cause of death."

       WTF is "absolute proof"?

      <p>
       Is it "undeniable evidence", perhaps?

       All it takes is one asshat to say

       No I'm not, outside of Late Night TV, The comedy club circuit and maybe a couple of radio shows  he was mostly unknown.  I saw him live several times I even saw him booed off stage and empty out the Punch Line comedy club in Walnut Creek (just east of San Francisco) around 1991. He wasn't as popular as you remember or think.

       I think we can agree on a happy medium. I'm just saying that he was on network TV multiple times, relative success for comedians.

       Walnut Creek is a super rich mostly White suburb of San Francisco a table of snobby girls tried to heckle him a few minutes in and Hicks proceed to destroy them politically, socially, sexually and every un-PC way he could. The uptight crowd started booing and leaving. They let the few of us left stay for the late show which ended up being the Oakland/Berkley crowd that got his humor.

       From John Hopkins-
"There are some factors which can increase the risk of acquiring the genetic mutations that may potentially result in pancreatic cancer. These risk factors are outlined in the table below. You will notice that coffee and alcohol are not listed. Currently there is not strong evidence to suggest that consumption of either substance will increase your risk for developing cancer of the pancreas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoke contains a large number of carcinogens (cancer causing chemicals). Therefore, it is not surprising that cigarette smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer. For example, smoking during college has been associated with a 2-3 fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer."

       I can never prove it but I think Hicks was taken out because of his routine about Barbara Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice, other comedians get away with massive criticisms of the PTB (like Carlin) without naming names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hicks didn't just name names, he made fun of the Queen Bee herself, the woman who spawned the horrible Bush boys, George, Jeb (who will be president soon enough), Marvin and Neal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And his routine criticizing her was obscene and profane and just plain nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also brought up the notion of "The Bill Hicks Moment"  for all incoming presidents, and probably struck a nerve there as well.

       The cancer he got was unrelated to cigarette smoking, friends.  It's fun to consider how he made jokes about the possibility that he'd get lung cancer, and then he did indeed get cancer, but cigarettes don't give you pancreatic cancer.  You just gotta look at the details on that one.

       No, smoking increases your risk for pancreatic cancer.  And probably all the other cancers as well, because it affects DNA.

       If I were a big man, I'd say ""if we give this Hicks guy cancer, it'll destroy all of his cred, and it will be hilarious as hell because of the irony."

       In that documentary it talks about how Hicks was saying "... the jokes on me..."

       Nip it in the bud, right? "He wasn't that big..." Maybe they saw it coming.

       Shulgin and Terrence McKenna died of cancer. It's interesting to consider, as outlandish as it is. I don't suppose there's any way we'd ever know if targeted cancer/mutation is a weapon...

       He didn't smoke and drink anymore than ALOT of people I know. He had quit drinking before his 30s and quit smoking, only to start again when he heard he was going to die. I know barflys who are 80 years old. I understand, people get cancer, but he was very young and because of the bush hating he was doing, I wanted to ask questions.
