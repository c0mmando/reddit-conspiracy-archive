    <div class="md"><p>From John Hopkins-
&quot;There are some factors which can increase the risk of acquiring the genetic mutations that may potentially result in pancreatic cancer. These risk factors are outlined in the table below. You will notice that coffee and alcohol are not listed. Currently there is not strong evidence to suggest that consumption of either substance will increase your risk for developing cancer of the pancreas.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoke contains a large number of carcinogens (cancer causing chemicals). Therefore, it is not surprising that cigarette smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer. For example, smoking during college has been associated with a 2-3 fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can never prove it but I think Hicks was taken out because of his routine about Barbara Bush.  </p>

<p>If you notice, other comedians get away with massive criticisms of the PTB (like Carlin) without naming names.  </p>

<p>Hicks didn&#39;t just name names, he made fun of the Queen Bee herself, the woman who spawned the horrible Bush boys, George, Jeb (who will be president soon enough), Marvin and Neal.  </p>

<p>And his routine criticizing her was obscene and profane and just plain nasty.  </p>

<p>He also brought up the notion of &quot;The Bill Hicks Moment&quot;  for all incoming presidents, and probably struck a nerve there as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t smoke and drink anymore than ALOT of people I know. He had quit drinking before his 30s and quit smoking, only to start again when he heard he was going to die. I know barflys who are 80 years old. I understand, people get cancer, but he was very young and because of the bush hating he was doing, I wanted to ask questions.</p>
