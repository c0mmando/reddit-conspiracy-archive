    <div class="md"><p>How are zombies and Ebola at all closely related? One is totally fictional and the other is a very real virus that in no way behaves like a zombie outbreak. This is so dumb. Read the article:</p>

<p>&quot;The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,&quot; Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN. &quot;This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scenario for training. If every scenario posed to me on every test or project or piece of homework I ever worked on was grounded in reality, the world would be an much more bizarre place than it already is. If you had a situation where infected people became hyper-aggressive brain eating zombies that spread the virus in a rapid and violent manner, then yes, you&#39;d have to toast some cities. Luckily there is virtually nothing that resembles a zombie virus. Not to say it&#39;s impossible with the weird shit that&#39;s out there; we know there are cases where viruses or diseases can make people behave more aggressively. But so far, that hasn&#39;t resulted in anything resembling zombies and it has nothing to do with Ebola. Conspiracies are real, but the more people muck them up with <em>fictional stories</em>, the more power we give to those who actually do seek to conspire against the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>&quot;How are zombies and Ebola at all closely related?&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually the way that desperate Ebola infected people in quarantine would behave and be treated that makes them similar to zombies at least from the perspective of how you would deal with them, these people are desperate but because they have been dehumanized they have to be kept away and killed if necessary to prevent the spread of Ebola.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;It&#39;s a scenario for training&quot;</strong></p>

<p>If they admitted it was for the imminent Ebola outbreak then that would show foreknowledge and give away that this is a bio-weapon, that is why they have to claim it is for training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Desperate infected people with Ebola are barely even mobile. They&#39;re hemorrhaging internally and gravely dehydrated. Someone in the throes of Ebola would not be capable of any kind of extended physical exertion. At all. Nor is Ebola a bio-weapon. It is one of many hemorrhagic fevers that occur naturally in the world. It has existed in Africa for decades. Modern sprawl, overpopulation, and increased contact between people and wildlife in that region due to shrinking animal habitats has made it much more likely for Ebola to spread quickly in that part of the world. Ebola outbreaks have occurred numerous times before now, and with a lot of luck and hard work by real, heroic medical professionals, they have been contained. </p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about the end stage of the disease, before that they have flu-like symptoms, and think about the people in the Ebola outbreak zone knowing that they are also likely to go down with Ebola unless they can escape.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Nor is Ebola a bio-weapon&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until flu-like symptoms occur, it&#39;s nearly impossible to determine you are carrying the virus. You have to understand that this scenario occurring in a modern US city is goddamn near impossible. In your version, there would need to be <em>scores</em> of people diagnosed with Ebola who are not yet exhibiting symptoms, and not able to receive care, and furthermore somehow agitated to the point of behaving like crazed zombies. It&#39;s not very possible to survive Ebola if you act like a lunatic. However, the chances rises substantially if you are given basic, supportive care. Why would you act like an aggressive zombie if you were diagnosed with Ebola when basic medical care is the best and only shot you have at living? And I mean, that&#39;s just some stuff off the top of my head. You seriously think this is a bio-weapon? Why would it not spread through the air, then? Why are recovery rates when care is provided at an all-time high? It doesn&#39;t make any sense, and it certainly doesn&#39;t make enough sense for you to state it as if it&#39;s an indisputable fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>&quot;Until flu-like symptoms occur, it&#39;s nearly impossible to determine you are carrying the virus.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got flu-like symptoms and all your family have got Ebola, then you&#39;re going to think that you&#39;ve got Ebola.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;there would need to be scores of people diagnosed with Ebola who are not yet exhibiting symptoms, and not able to receive care&quot;</strong></p>

<p>They don&#39;t need to be diagnosed, they simply need to be quarantined in an Ebola Outbreak Zone, these guys will go nuts to escape</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>It&#39;s not very possible to survive Ebola if you act like a lunatic&quot;</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s better to be out of the Ebola Quarantine Zone than in it</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Why would you act like an aggressive zombie if you were diagnosed with Ebola when basic medical care&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Because you&#39;re trapped in the Ebola Quarantine Zone and nobody dares to go near you, you are desperate for care and medical assistance </p>

<p><strong>&quot;You seriously think this is a bio-weapon?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Correct!</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Why would it not spread through the air, then?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>It would quickly get out of control and even kill those who are behind the grand plan</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Why are recovery rates when care is provided at an all-time high?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The &#39;all-time high&#39; still isn&#39;t particularly good, but it&#39;s inevitable that as hospitals get more experience with this bio-weapon strain of Ebola they will improve in the way they treat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply can&#39;t continue to try and reason with you as you are using lynchpins for your argument that don&#39;t even exist, like Ebola Quarantine Zones. There may be like, what, one of these in an African slum? And you&#39;re presuming it&#39;s better off to be outside the quarantine zone than inside of it? Why? If you think nobody is going to care for you when you&#39;re quarantined, why would you think anyone would care for you when you escape quarantine with a contagious and deadly ailment that everyone is terrified of? What sucks is that instead of examining your own knowledge on the science behind a contagious virus like Ebola, you&#39;ll likely chalk this up as a victory. And that sucks more, because there real conspiracies in this world, and by giving credence to every single theory that arises, especially silly ones like this, you negate the importance and focus that must be placed on the real ones.</p>
