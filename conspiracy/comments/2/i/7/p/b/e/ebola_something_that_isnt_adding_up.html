        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s sad that I have to post this in r/conspiracy because of the venomous nature of liberal Reddit, but there is something that just isn&#39;t passing the logic test for me with the most current Ebola breakout...</p>

<p>First, how can the US allow a passenger from Liberia into Dallas-Fort Worth without as much as a quarantine?  There are now at least 100 exposures...  Now, possibly D.C. as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/Investigation-Continues-into-First-US-Ebola-Diagnosis-277872651.html">http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/Investigation-Continues-into-First-US-Ebola-Diagnosis-277872651.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/03/d-c-hospital-evaluating-patient-who-has-ebola-like-symptoms/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/03/d-c-hospital-evaluating-patient-who-has-ebola-like-symptoms/</a></p>

<p>Secondly, if Ebola is so difficult to contract, as has been stated numerous times by the media, the medical community (as least those affiliated with the media), and right here in Reddit AMAs, then how are so many medical personnel contracting it?  They are wearing protective suits, using sterilization, and are trained medically, but if Ebola isn&#39;t the least bit airborne, then how have so many thousands contracted it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-american-cameraman-covering-epidemic-in-liberia-contracts-the-disease-9771646.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-american-cameraman-covering-epidemic-in-liberia-contracts-the-disease-9771646.html</a></p>

<p>Carrying on, why are there STILL cheap flights available for Liberia in the middle of an outbreak of a virus that has a fatality rate of 50%?  You can book a flight to Liberia today, right now, for $1400.  Why is the US Government not preventing this?  I simply do not get it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/01/why-hasnt-the-u-s-closed-its-airports-to-travelers-from-ebola-ravaged-countries/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/01/why-hasnt-the-u-s-closed-its-airports-to-travelers-from-ebola-ravaged-countries/</a></p>

<p>Still going, in Venezuela recently, there was an unknown disease outbreak that killed eight people, but the doctor who first diagnosed and treated the illness has fled the country because the government has accused him of terrorism for questioning, and openly defying their claim that it was not an &quot;unknown disease&quot; but was caused by Chikungunya, from mosquitoes.  Why is he being charged with a crime for warning people about a disease outbreak that appears to have characteristics new to the population?</p>

<p><a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/09/venezuela-doctor-flees-after-being-accused-terrorism-amid-fever-outbreak">http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/09/venezuela-doctor-flees-after-being-accused-terrorism-amid-fever-outbreak</a></p>

<p>Still thinking, we know that the US Government has sprayed toxins on civilian populations before, St. Louis being the one that most commonly comes to mind here...  Is there any doubt that they would be willing to test vaccines or even willfully expose civilian populations to viral infections?  Hell, we know the Germans were doing in back in the 1940&#39;s, so I think it&#39;s most likely a strong probability it has already been done since.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/army-sprayed-st-louis-with-toxic-dust-2012-10">http://www.businessinsider.com/army-sprayed-st-louis-with-toxic-dust-2012-10</a></p>

<p>Where am I going with this rant?  I don&#39;t know, but something does NOT add up about this Ebola situation.  This is a disease that is killing 50% of the people who contract it, and we are being told that contracting the disease is very difficult. yet those trained medically and in protective gear are catching it at a somewhat alarming rate.  </p>

<p>Then the UN expert on Ebola warns the world yesterday that there is a chance that Ebola mutates into something airborne and becomes far more dangerous...  </p>

<p><a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/568558/20141003/ebola-virus-airborne-mutation-nightmare-happen-transmission.htm#.VC7y4PldUxI">http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/568558/20141003/ebola-virus-airborne-mutation-nightmare-happen-transmission.htm#.VC7y4PldUxI</a></p>

<p>Then there is this:  Ebola is spreading at a &quot;terrifying rate&quot;, 5 new people per hour in Sierra Leone...</p>

<p><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/10/2/ebola-multiplyingrapidly.html">http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/10/2/ebola-multiplyingrapidly.html</a></p>

<p>So I ask, if this virus is limited to bodily fluid transmission, then why the hell are so many people catching it?  Why are West Africans being allowed into the US right now?  We shut down flights to Israel in a heartbeat when we choose, but we can&#39;t order a halt in all flights to a continent being ravaged by an Ebola outbreak?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Virologist and I don&#39;t think this is the end of humanity by any means, but I&#39;m just not buying the official version of what I&#39;m being told, it isn&#39;t logical, it isn&#39;t common sense, it doesn&#39;t feel authentic.  </p>

<p>I am not even arguing that there is a broad conspiracy at play here, I think it may just be incompetence from governments and medical communities.  We are being told that there is nothing to fear in the USA, but would YOU want to contract Ebola?  Your children?  If fatality rates fall to even 10% for Ebola in the USA, that is 30 MILLION Americans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this will get down-voted like a motha&#39;, but there just seems to be a willful effort from the mainstream media, the US Government, and even the vocal medical community to minimize what appears to be a problem they ALL have failed to contain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the ebola deal as one of two possible scenario&#39;s.  </p>

<ul>
<li>1. Ebola outbreak isn&#39;t nearly as dangerous as we are being led to believe.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
<li>2. Ebola outbreak is way worse than we are being led to believe and its being hidden from us. </li>
</ul>

<p>So I approach it like I do any cold, flu, or anything else.  And if I get sick, I get sick.  Being scared or paranoid about it won&#39;t do me any benefit.  So keep your eyes and ears open, but don&#39;t spend the night fretting about it. </p>

<p>But, a thought: what if bad guys were developing bio warfare ebola in Liberia, and they screwed up and let it escape there instead of bringing it to the West first? Maybe Ebola will show up in the West at some point just because the guys developing it get around to bringing it here. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re being directed by the govt., of course, but much of what they do is on autopilot. They&#39;re hedging their bets. This is spooky to me because it looks like the govt. might be at a loss on this one. In the grand scheme that may be a good thing, but I still think that the govt can serve a purpose, and this may be one of them and &quot;Oh shit&quot; they may not be capable because they&#39;re too committed to propagating some cultish fucking narrative.</p>

Of the list of possibilities based on what we know and what we believe we know and what we suspect, I have narrowed down the possible options I believe fit the scenario in play, to these two.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that the whole ebola thing seems off.  So much contradictory information and we&#39;re being bombarded with it from all sides.  One minute we have the MSM downplaying the situation and saying that we have nothing to worry about and the next we have them screaming from the rooftops that we should all prepare for the zombie apocalypse.</p>

<p>In general, I&#39;m <em>always</em> skeptical of anything I see being pushed so heavily by the MSM and that&#39;s especially true in this case since I can see many (possible) agendas and ways this outbreak can be used by those in power.</p>

<p>As of right now, I&#39;m not convinced that the outbreak is as bad as we&#39;re being told by Yahoo, CNN, NBC, et al.</p>

<p>Edit:  Literally the <strong>second</strong> I posted this comment, I automatically had a downvote.  I didn&#39;t even reload the page and I was already at 0 points as I posted it.

I don&#39;t actually believe that this was released with the agenda of population control in mind, but if it was, you would want to be able to control it.</p>

<p>This!  They could shut this down globally so much faster if they restricted air-travel from there.  It&#39;s almost like the they want it to happen or care too much about the prosperity of the airlines vs. human lives.  </p>

<p>&quot;Well, we cannot really shut down air-travel because the shareholders portfolios would take a hit.  And no one wants their portfolios to go south.  That would be crazy talk.&quot;</p>

<p>Somethings definately not right when the &quot;top&quot; guy uses poor logic to defend a poor decision. They keep saying itll hurt the aid they would receive.... But by closing commercial flights, you can still allow aid flights. But, to them, its either all flights are good or all are grounded. This type of locigal fallacy, and its use by those at the top to defend their decision, is what particularily worries me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a couple things going on here. First, the tickets are cheap due to economics. Demand goes down (because sane people don&#39;t want to catch Ebola) hence price of the plane tickets also goes down. Second, there has got to be some significant pressure coming from multi-national corporations to not close the border. In addition to airlines (really a drop in the bucket) sub Saharan Africa is loaded with natural resources (diamonds, minerals, oil to name a few).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is mostly a thing about perception management. The government doesn&#39;t want to send a message that people should be deathly afraid of this thing, because the knock on impact to the airlines, travel industry, trade and the economy generally are considered to be greater than the risk posed by the virus.</p>

<p>I happen to think the opposite. It is still far too easy for an infected to make their way through multiple cities in the West and spread the infection along the way, making contact tracing incredibly difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>If the government was truly &quot;acting with an abundance of caution&quot;, then we&#39;d see one way travel only.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i find it SO odd that ebola patients (as long as they&#39;re American) are being not just shipped back here, but are being brought to the middle of the country - Nebraska, as well as Atlanta, etc. Do we not have massive ships that can be used as floating hospitals specifically for containment, versus bringing people right into the country, right into hospitals where isolation / containment are the flimsy defenses, run by fallible humans? honestly, WTF? i don&#39;t begrudge anyone medical care, but putting MILLIONS at risk? wtf?</p>

<p>we&#39;ve gone from &quot;oh, it can&#39;t be transmitted that easily, no worries, Murica!&quot; to &quot;let&#39;s bring a few sick people here and be super careful!&quot; to &quot;yeah, so, a guy flew in on a commercial flight, with HUNDREDS of unwitting passengers, and WHOOPS! he&#39;s got the ebola!! but it&#39;s ok, he&#39;s in isolation now&quot; to &quot;clean the plane? yeah, we give it a good scrub-down...ONCE A YEAR&quot;. WTF??</p>

<p>this is kind of ridiculous. i&#39;m not sitting here freaking out - im in a rural area. but MAN i am definitely VERY glad i don&#39;t commute 3 hours a day on a crowded train. someone is going to fuck up where ebola is concerned, and shit is going to escalate. bank on it.</p>

<p>Watch from 43:31.</p>

<p>Ebola had no funding for research, people just didn&#39;t care enough to develop a cure because AFRICANS are TOO POOR to make a profit out of it.</p>

<p>But then, HOW THE HELL was ZMapp(Experimental Ebola Drug) funded?</p>

<p>It was only AFTER 9/11 that EBOLA was categorized as a POSSIBLE BIO WEAPON and started to get funds for the research.</p>

<p>Yep, 9/11, it was all planned just like the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WP1hGz9.jpg">Illuminati cards</a> predicted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I too question the lack of restriction on air travel from/ to the hot zone.  I am so sick of hearing the &#39;if it&#39;s not that contagious, why are they in hazmat suits&#39; argument.  </p>

<p>In that particular instance, I honestly don&#39;t believe their hiding anything.  Sick people cough and vomit and spit up.  If you were on a bus with a person vomiting, you would move far away from them.  Health care workers, on the other hand, move in closer to help.  These workers would be stupid if they didn&#39;t take every precaution available to protect themselves (and by protecting themselves they protect every other patient the come in contact with.)  </p>

<p>And as far as the question of &#39;why are so many people catching it&#39;, have you ever been to a third world country?  There is a reason they recommend vaccines for a number of diseases before you go.  Hygiene and sanitation is a hell of a lot different.  </p>

<p>I am not trying to question a majority of your points.  Ebola is scary, and how the international &#39;community&#39; is handling it is suspect.  However, every time I hear people include these kind of arguments it makes the medical community dismiss the real point and feasters fear in the wrong direction.  </p>

<p>the third title picture, two yellow suited guys carrying a boy, how is the first suited man holding the boy, what is he gripping to take the load. his left hand is on top, his right hand is !?</p>

<p>the second guy could not support half that weight at arms reach with one hand.</p>

<p>and if you zoom in on high res versions of MSM photos, the boundaries of objects tell a story, the normal used lower res photos hide their composition by the reduced resolutions.</p>

<p>the MSM editors have started to get wiser now, they scrub the EXIF from most photos used, hides the photoshop EXIF addendum data. on common low res photos anyway, some of the higher res ones as sometimes found on foreign websites have intact EXIF data still in the photos. it often tells a story.</p>

<p>the Sandy Hoax photos are a treasure trove of incriminating EXIF data, one day in the future when legal proceedings are in progress, lots of MSM perps are going to go down due to their complicity in the hoax. and their EXIF data will hang them.</p>

<p>another thing the saps in the MSM don&#39;t realize is , commercial apps like photoshop stenographically embed license numbers in the images (same as colour printers do the yellow dot thing), so they double incriminate themselves by using commercial apps for perpetrating hoax photos. scrubbing the EXIF data just makes it hard for amateur sleuths to follow the money, professionals like the FBI have an open door with images made with legal commercial software.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>First, how can the US allow a passenger from Liberia into Dallas-Fort Worth without as much as a quarantine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duncan filled out a form in Liberia stating that he had not been in contact with anyone with Ebola. He was not exhibiting any symptoms (he was screened for fever.) Is the US supposed to quarantine <em>everyone</em> who has been in Liberia or Sierra Leone for three weeks?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, if Ebola is so difficult to contract, as has been stated numerous times by the media, the medical community (as least those affiliated with the media), and right here in Reddit AMAs, then how are so many medical personnel contracting it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that many of the cases are in remote areas of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Although many helpers have good medical training, training only gets so far when you&#39;re buried knee-deep in ebola patients and not enough cleaning supplies. Plus, much of the population is poorly educated and don&#39;t take precautions when they are sick, exposing others to the disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carrying on, why are there STILL cheap flights available for Liberia in the middle of an outbreak of a virus that has a fatality rate of 50%? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the numbers are true, there are 10,000 or so cases in two countries with a combined population of 10,000,000. A very small percentage of the population has come in contact with the disease, and restricting flight to and from the country would be devastating to its economy.</p>

<p>That being said, many African countries have ceased flying to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone. Kenya, for example, has shut its doors.</p>

<p>The US did not put travel restrictions in place when MERS was a problem, either. It&#39;s just something the US does not do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>catching it at a somewhat alarming rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of three outsiders (two doctors and a camera man) who probably were educated and took precautions. I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s an alarming rate. Local medical personnel are often poorly trained for this type of contagion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I ask, if this virus is limited to bodily fluid transmission, then why the hell are so many people catching it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignorance and improper training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that the reason so many people, including a large proportion of healthcare workers, are getting it is in part because we don&#39;t actually have a complete understanding about transmission. I suspect that transmission via fomites (i.e. contaminated surfaces and objects) is really at play. Several of the aid workers who became infected swear that they abided by the PPE regulations to the T and cannot pinpoint when they were exposed. The interview with Nancy Writebol speaks to this. It&#39;s also pretty good in terms of giving a picture situation in Liberia. <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/10/ebola-survivor-ii-nancy-writebol-we-just-dont-even-have-clue-what-happened">http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/10/ebola-survivor-ii-nancy-writebol-we-just-dont-even-have-clue-what-happened</a></p>

<p>They give us all the reason in the world to panic &quot;There is a deadly virus in Africa that kills over half of its victims and is highly contagious&quot; (paraphrased from the CDC&#39;s own website), but then tell us not to panic. &quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; says the CDC director. &quot;What if I&#39;m sneezing in yer grill doh?&quot; asks Sanjay. &quot;OK, maybe worry.&quot; Then they let people come here with the virus.</p>

<p>People call a lot of thing mind boggling on the interwebz, but this truly is just nuts.</p>

<p>Oh, and, once again, Sanjay and the CDC director:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its complete bullshit that the liberals are calling out people for using scare tactics with ebola.  What&#39;s so bad about being worried about ebola?  Whats the fucking angle? Do Republicans have stock in Purell or something. There&#39;s nothing wrong with people washing their hands more.  Nothing.  This virus, if it gets out of hand, could be the next blubonic plague.  And Democrats literally have liberal sponges believing its almost impossible to get the disease and using it to try and say that republicans are just fear mongering. &lt;- This is really unethical.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with being worried about Ebola, and I feel its educated people incorrectly. Today someone posted something about how Ebola isn&#39;t Small Pox.  WTF, sure they have a point, buts not a good message right now. People should be worried about Ebola. </p>

<p>That was before we now have a case in America.  I posted something in r/Houston today (because Houston and Dallas really don&#39;t like eachother) and I was surprisingly downvoted to 0 and lost karma, although comments were all positive, and all I was pointing out is how bad it looks like Dallas and the CDC are handling this poorly.  They fucking are.  Just read anything about the families being isolated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about all the healthcare workers getting it rather confusing, but there are several things that aren&#39;t being said about the circumstances they are in.</p>

<p>1) Many treatment centers don&#39;t have enough equipment to follow all barrier procedures. Supplies--even things like gloves--are in short supply. The cheap gloves break easily. What happens when all you have available to you is a mask and gloves? Well, it&#39;s better than nothing, but the rest of you is still exposed (eyes, skin). </p>

<p>2) Reliance on others&#39; practices. Even if a healthcare worker does everything right--all the protection, sanitation, decontamination--s/he is still not guaranteed to have no contact. What is someone else screws up and accidentally touches a safe-zone door handle before he sanitizes? The next person without gloves who touches the door has been exposed. Medical teams are only as good as their weakest link.</p>

<p>3) Shortage of staff. There are many places where personnel are doing 12+ hour shifts. When you get tired, overworked, extremely hot (in the case of those with full protective gear), making mistakes is easier. You have trouble breathing and take your mask off for a second to let the hot air out. Your glove rips and when trying to fix it you accidentally touch the exposed flesh. Etc.</p>

<p>4) Some of the healthcare workers aren&#39;t getting it in the hospital, or in the Ebola wards. When not at work, the nurses/doctors are part of the community just like everyone else. They have just as much of a chance as being exposed as all the other Ebola patients did. Also, if you listened to Dr. Brantly&#39;s interviews, you&#39;ll find that he is CONVINCED, 100%, that he was not infected in the isolation ward. He thinks it happened when he went to the ER, without full protective gear, to help there. </p>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to point this out.  A virus doesn&#39;t have to be classified as airborne, and can still be caught through the air.  This is happening with ebola.  The reason why people are contracting it through the air, and it isn&#39;t labeled &quot;airborne&quot;, is because it is transmitted through the air via water droplets.  It doesn&#39;t fit the scientific definition for an airborne virus, neither does influenza or the common cold, yet they can also be caught through the air.  They are misleading the public by not clarifying this, likely because they don&#39;t want people to panic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your post.  If you need to have contact with bodily fluids in order to contract Ebola, how are so many people getting it? Are we really going to just assume everyone is wallowing in each other&#39;s bodily fluids? Are we going to assume that that&#39;s what the doctors and journalists who have contracted it so far are doing? I highly doubt it. Something is off.</p>

Wouldn&#39;t have been better to take them to a level 4 facility (like we read in books or see in movies) and keep them isolated from the rest of the world and separated from each others and to check on them constantly with the help of professionals (docs and nurses)? That way a hazmat cleaning team could have decontaminated the apartment. I&#39;m not at all a doctor or a health professional so maybe I&#39;m all wrong on this but it looks odd to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I gather, the media is fear mongering to the extreme on this.</p>

<p>In Liberia, about 6,000 people have been infected out of about 5 million. 12 people of out of 10,000.  </p>

<p>a few days before he came to the US, this particular person helped a 7 months pregnant woman to the hospital when she was having stomach pains. Everyone believed it was related to the pregnancy. Only after he arrived here, did the woman and subsequently others in the area die of Ebola.  This patient immediately went to the hospital in Dallas when he had a fever but was turned away. Not really his fault as I see it.</p>

<p>Back to the numbers, If it is indeed 12 out of 10,000 people infected, I wouldn&#39;t really expect them to shut down the airports here either.</p>

<p>I personally think this is just the first of many unrelated cases we will see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I feel that the obvious truth is staring everyone in the face, but then I glance at Reddit and just about any mainstream news site and I just shake my head.</p>

<p>Our government has, in the past, done some pretty messed up things - such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskeegee experiment</a>. I could go on for hours and post link after link to similar experiments and how our government has absolutely no ethical or moral concerns what-so-ever, but I think the majority reading this are aware of things like the TE or even MK Ultra.</p>

<p>This whole Ebola situation is a complete and utter mess and we&#39;re in deep shit unless we get our act together and demand accountability from our officials - which, as we all know, won&#39;t happen due to the apathetic American public.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/08/robert-wenzel/is-the-us-military-responsible-for-the-ebola-breakout/">The US Military and the Ebola Outbreak</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s really not a big jump to suspect that the military has also been doing research on Ebola as a bioweapon. As the Army Times notes about Ebola, “its stable nature in aerosol make it attractive as a potential biological weapon.” What better place, via the eyes of the U.S. military, to be messing around with such research than Africa? The thinking might go: If there is a misstep with the virus, research blowbacks don’t happen around US civilian populations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The research program, occurring in Sierra Leone, the Republic of Guinea, and Liberia—said to be the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak—has the announced purpose, among others, of detecting the future use of fever-viruses as bioweapons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this purely defensive research? Or as we have seen in the past, is this research being covertly used to develop offensive bioweapons?</p>

<p>Here is where things get a bit scary...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A public tweet from a large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in “high risk events” says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Goldenstate Fire/EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that I know is, every agency possible is dropping the ball drastically. This is eerily reminiscent of 9/11, NORAD failing, etc. Hospitals are messing up, airports failing to screen people, the CDC has basically failed at every level and the media is telling everyone not to panic. Sounds to me like this is WAY more serious then we&#39;re being led to believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to make preparations to ensure I am stocked on food, water, medicine and the second my locality is hit with ANYTHING similar to Ebola (that is, reports that people are being quarantined), I&#39;m going into lock down mode. Keep in mind, those FEMA camps and coffin liners had to be used at some point.</p>

<p>This MAY very well be the establishment&#39;s End Game and where Martial Law is declared across the country if things get really bad. The people will beg for it once the riots start.</p>

<p>9/10/2001, Department of Defense admits to Congress it cannot account for $2.3 TRILLION in taxpayer funds...  Yes, TRILLIONS.  9/11/2001, planes fly into the Twin Towers, which collapse at free fall, all debris and evidence is melted down within a week, no outside investigation is allowed, and the 9-11 Commission itself claims that the Bush Administration impeded their investigation at the time, and the $2.3 TRILLION is never mentioned again even as an afterthought...</p>

<p>Fast forward, suddenly you have the TSA, the Patriot Act, the NDAA, and a perpetual war on terror, which happens to be in the region of the world where most of the oil comes from, OPEC dominates, and governments are easily destabilized by organized efforts...  Oh, and Iraq is invaded on false pretenses only a few years after Saddam Hussein began selling his oil in the Euro, initially laughed at in doing so, then said Euro overtook the US Dollar on global markets, and suddenly US and British tanks are driving through Baghdad, and Saddam is hanging from a rope on global television...</p>

<p>But again, the few that question the fictional novel that is the geopolitical behavior post WW2 are marginalized by the media, the governments, and the mainstream movements in each.  Any attempt to discredit what is clearly ridiculously absurd propaganda - harsh media backlash...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad reality when most of the population act and think like the insects those who play games with the world around them believe them to be...  It&#39;s tragic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Viruses can be contracted by direct contact, indirect contact, airborne, or by vectors. EBOLA is contracted by direct, indirect and some forms of vector, by animals in the wild. Airborne viruses must have a life-cycle which involves a phase whereby the particles stay viable for long peroids in aerosol form. Most viruses will die outside the host, that is they cannot stay viable indefinately outside living or decomposing tissue. To do that there has to be longer genome, coding for different proteins, than the replication proteins. That been said contaiment is obvoulsy the best strategy, bearing in mind it&#39;s leathality, quaranten procedures should be in place immediaetly there&#39;s an out-break. It should be isolated from the population as soon as humanly possible. Even if it means that indiviuals die, better than trying to treat masses of case. They know this, it&#39;s fucking obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 12 months between Jan 2013 to Jan 2014, over 51 million passengers traveled through DFW international <a href="https://www.dfwairport.com/cs/groups/public/documents/webasset/p2_131411.pdf">Link</a>.</p>

<p>As of 2014, the TSA employs 47000 security officers for the United States in total <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration#TSA_employees">Link</a> . That ratio means that you have officers to passengers vastly outnumbered, coupled with the gross and obvious incomptence of the average TSA employee, you have a recipe of disaster. </p>

<p>The idea that our airports and travel network have anywhere near the capability required to screen, assess, and discharge a decision on each individual passenger, fails to realize the harsh reality of international travel.</p>

<p>Further to this, Ebola&#39;s characteristics, including it&#39;s incubation period, have been checked and tested by dozens of labs. For them all to be incorrect about the generally accepted 12-21 day incubation period, would either be the worse display of incompetent science, or a validation that a vast and elaborate network of scientists have stymied the study of one of the deadliest known viruses. The former is far more likely. </p>

<p>The fact that doctors and health care workers are also contracting the virus is not surprising. Yes, they are clad in multiple layers of haz-mat style suits, but they are being constantly and repeatedly exposed to the virus. Far more regularly than the average citizen.</p>

<p>They handle patients, work with samples, all in makeshift hospitals with insufficient materials and poorly maintained health facilities. Failure to understand the true level of poverty that these doctors are working in would validate this idea, but when the reality is embraced, it&#39;s clear to see why doctors would be contracting the virus at a far higher rate than the general population. Also, nothing&#39;s perfect. Especially clean suits. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy. This is the fucked up, shitty reality of living with 7 billion other people. Couple this with unlimited international travel, and you have the recipe for the disaster that&#39;s cooking right in front of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an article on droplet and airborne transmission:</p>

<p>Droplet vs Airborne Transmission</p>

<p>&#39;The 2007 updated CDC Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) infection control guidance defines droplet transmission as a form of contact transmission in which respiratory droplets carrying infectious pathogens transmit infection when they travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to susceptible mucosal surfaces (nasal mucosa, conjunctivae, and less frequently, the mouth) of a recipient, &quot;generally over short distances, necessitating facial protection.&quot;[34]</p>

<p>&#39;For diseases classified as being transmitted by the droplet route, surgical masks are recommended to protect the mouth and nose. The guidance also states that although 5 µm has traditionally been defined as the particle size break point distinguishing between larger particles (droplet transmission) and smaller particles (airborne transmission), observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those with diameters of 30 μm or greater, can remain suspended in the air. Influenza virus is an example of a pathogen transmitted by the droplet route.</p>

<p>&#39;The HICPAC guidance defines airborne transmission as dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles in the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain infective over time and distance. It states that microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual.</p>

<p>. . . </p>

<p>&quot;In spite of the distinction made between droplet and airborne transmission, current knowledge of aerosols indicates that there is no clear line differentiating droplet and airborne transmission, as currently defined, on the basis of particle size. Coughing, sneezing, talking, exhalation, and certain medical procedures generate respiratory particles in a wide range of sizes -- not just very large droplets that launch directly to the mucosal surfaces or drop to the floor. In addition, particles begin to evaporate and become smaller immediately upon emission, and particles ranging from very small up to 100 μm can be inhaled by persons in the near vicinity of the source (Figure).[28]&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s really a matter of degree, but some people are using this &quot;It&#39;s not airborne&quot; argument to make it sound like Ebola is on a par with HIV in terms of infectivity. </p>

<p>If you believe that both government and mainstream media lied about Sandy Hook, 9/11 or Boston Marathon Bombings, why is it so difficult to believe that this all maybe a giant &quot;false flag&quot; staged event?

    <div class="md"><p>What puts that on a conspiracy level to me is that the ways of transmission are being reported in the media inconsistently.  When I first heard about this disease, they were saying on tv that people were catching this disease mostly because people were picking up dead bats and eating them.  I was fine with that until I heard thousands of people had the disease and couldn&#39;t imagine that all these people were eating dead animals off the ground like that.  Then there were the doctors being flown back and at about the same time they were reporting that the disease was being spread the same way that HIV was.  I thought that was B.S. because I doubt the doctors (American) were having rampant unprotected sex with ebola patients.  Now it&#39;s being said that it is being spread by touching what ebola patients have touched and that the surface touched can carry the virus for up to 6 days.  And then there&#39;s always the talk of it going airborne at any time.  </p>

<p>Edit: Listening to Michael Rivero and he&#39;s saying that pets can carry the virus without getting sick.  So now Lassie and Fido can give you Ebola.</p>

<p>For example with aids there is and has always been a gross blatant conspiracy to specifically NOT report clear high risk factors such as anal sex and instead they write the constant falsehood about having  &quot;protected sex&quot; inferring that traditional sex has the same risk when it is well known it does not.</p>

<p>Now we see the same type of reporting on Ebola , always trying to show us how you CAN&#39;T get it instead ofelling people to take the reasonable precautions. More worry about &quot;spreading panic&quot; or &quot;spreading discrimination&quot; rather than actually assuming people are intelligent and just telling them proper precautions.</p>

<p>Now I am sure I will be downvoted as part of the conspiracy of readers who hate to hear how things are actually spread (once again proving that the conspiracy does exist)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, if Ebola is so difficult to contract, as has been stated numerous times by the media, the medical community (as least those affiliated with the media), and right here in Reddit AMAs, then how are so many medical personnel contracting it? They are wearing protective suits, using sterilization, and are trained medically, but if Ebola isn&#39;t the least bit airborne, then how have so many thousands contracted it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The virus in this outbreak is now strongly suspected to be transmitted through surfaces (&quot;fomites&quot;) tainted with body fluids; people are burning all equipment used on sick people. Also it is suspected to be transmitted by aerosols (sneezing and the like releasing droplets of fluid in the air that will end in the noses and eyes of other people) and they are recommending for medical people to use complete air purification gear, not just face masks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still going, in Venezuela recently, there was an unknown disease outbreak that killed eight people, but the doctor who first diagnosed and treated the illness has fled the country because the government has accused him of terrorism for questioning, and openly defying their claim that it was not an &quot;unknown disease&quot; but was caused by Chikungunya, from mosquitoes. Why is he being charged with a crime for warning people about a disease outbreak that appears to have characteristics new to the population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Venezuelan government <em>does</em> make a lot of censorship and political persecution, routinely and for the most absurd reasons. In a country with people on rationed food and on the brink of civil war I think it is only natural that the dysfunctional central government tries to supress information about yet another problem...</p>

<p>Anyway this mosquito virus is already spreading though other South American countries (Brazil included), which makes the Venezuelan reaction even more out of place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Fatu stayed healthy, which is noteworthy considering that more than 300 health care workers have become infected with Ebola, and she didn&#39;t even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units.</p>

<p>&#39;Instead Fatu, who&#39;s in her final year of nursing school, invented her own equipment. International aid workers heard about Fatu&#39;s &quot;trash bag method&quot; and are now teaching it to other West Africans who can&#39;t get into hospitals and don&#39;t have protective gear of their own.&#39;</p>

<p>That she seems to be doing a better job than the authorities is not reassuring. </p>

<p>because of the venomous nature of liberal Reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing in your post has anything to do with liberals, not sure how it pertains.  Also, it isn&#39;t just liberals at Reddit that have a venomous nature by a long shot.  I&#39;ve been personally attacked unprovoked many times by conservatives and/or libertarians, etc. instead of them attacking my ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how can the US allow a passenger from Liberia into Dallas-Fort Worth without as much as a quarantine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your link it says he lied on his airport screening questionnaire before flying to the US.  So, I&#39;m not sure the US is really to blame, are we?  I don&#39;t know for sure, but offhand, it doesn&#39;t appear so to me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good breakdown and comparisons with other contagious diseases here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/news/20140806/ebola-virus-how-contagious">http://www.webmd.com/news/20140806/ebola-virus-how-contagious</a></p>

<p>Many thousands are catching it in areas with low education.  And, in the grand scheme of things, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say &quot;many&quot; western medical personnel have contracted it.  But, I think we&#39;ll see a decrease in the already small number as awareness spreads and more western medics take better precautions now that they know what they&#39;re up against.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carrying on, why are there STILL cheap flights available for Liberia in the middle of an outbreak of a virus that has a fatality rate of 50%? You can book a flight to Liberia today, right now, for $1400. Why is the US Government not preventing this? I simply do not get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bottom of the article you linked to explains it.  See the part under &quot;Travel restrictions make fighting Ebola much harder&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there any doubt that they would be willing to test vaccines or even willfully expose civilian populations to viral infections?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, our corporatist government, quasi-governmental entities and military-industrial complex have already proven themselves time and time again to think that human life is cheap and kill for a buck.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put hardly anything past them within reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a disease that is killing 50% of the people who contract it, and we are being told that contracting the disease is very difficult. yet those trained medically and in protective gear are catching it at a somewhat alarming rate. ... We are being told that there is nothing to fear in the USA, but would YOU want to contract Ebola? Your children?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an alarming rate as far as it goes in the United States.  I&#39;m vastly more likely to get hit by a car than catch ebola.</p>

<p>If anything, I think the media is eating up ebola fear mongering as yet another endless distraction from telling real stories that matter and empower average Americans.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m concerned about Ebola&#39;s spread in the third world and hope we don&#39;t allow fear and ignorance to keep us from helping them to contain it there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure this will get down-voted like a motha&#39;,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I didn&#39;t downvote you.  I think you asked some very intelligent questions and also helpfully provided sources of evidence along with your text.  I may not agree with you on everything, but I think you offered a interesting post and I&#39;m glad it provoked me to read those links you posted and further educate myself on the issue.</p>

<p>If not why  it? (With a cold or flu its a virus and apparently survives in bodily fluids that are then brung from touched places to new persons hand then mouth or nose)</p>

<p>If it IS spread like cold or flu why shouldn&#39;t we expect to see hella spread  like flu season?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am compelled to this subject like a rainbow on an oil spill.  In honesty it is because I suffer from agoraphobia and emetophobia so for me to be non-bias is extremely difficult. </p>

<p>Having said that, I do feel like this is worse than what we&#39;re being told and that the constant contradictory information we&#39;re receiving is a ploy to keep us confused while our government tries to figure out what to do/how to deal with this.  </p>

<p>This whole topic is extremely stressful for me, I can&#39;t go a day without seeing something about Ebola on the internet or on tv, people who are sternly insistent that we have nothing to worry about and others with the complete opposite view.  It is very hard to keep level headed even with the &quot;known&quot; facts because it seems that even the &quot;facts&quot; can have negative or positive slants depending on the source.</p>

<p>I would gladly take any conspiracy to be fact over ebola (i.e. being worse than we&#39;re being told).  This is hell for me, the stuff of my nightmares, panic attack inducing, pure vile consistent stress.  I want nothing more than to be reassured, but this is literally a waking nightmare for me everyday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People In the Western World Need to Know What&#39;s Happening Here in West Africa. THEY ARE LYING!!! &quot;Ebola&quot; as a Virus Does NOT Exist and Is NOT &quot;Spread&quot;. The Red Cross Has Brought a Disease to 4 Specific Countries for 4 Specific Reasons and It Is Only Contracted By Those Who Receive Treatments and Injections From the Red Cross. That is Why Liberians and Nigerians Have Begun Kicking the Red Cross Out of Their Countries and Reporting In the News the Truth. Now Bear With Me:
REASONS:</p>

<p>Most People Jump to &quot;Depopulation&quot; Which is No Doubt Always on the Mind of the West When It Comes to Africa. But I Assure You Africa Can NEVER Be Depopulated By Killing 160 People a Day When Thousands are Born Per Day. So the real Reasons Are Much More Tangible.</p>

<p>Reason 1: This Vaccine Implemented Sickness Being &quot;Called&quot; Ebola Was Introduced Into West Africa for the End Goal of Getting Troops on the Ground In Nigeria, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. If You Remember We Were Just Trying to Get Into Nigeria for &quot;Boko Haram&quot; #BULLSHIT But That Fell Apart When Nigerians Started Telling the Truth. There ARE NO GIRLS MISSING. Global Support Fell Through the Floor, and a New Reason Was Needed to Get Troops Into Nigeria and Steal the New Oil Reserves They Have Discovered.</p>

<p>Reason 2: Sierra Leone is the World&#39;s Largest Supplier of Diamonds. For the Past 4 Months They Have Been on Strike, Refusing to Provide Diamonds Due to Horrible Working Conditions and Slave Pay. The West Will Not Pay a Fair Wage for the Resources Because the Idea is to Keep These People Surviving on Rice Bags and Foreign AID So That They Remain a Source of Cheap Slave Labor Forever. A Reason Was Also Needed to Get Troops On the Ground In Sierra Leone to Force an End to the Diamond Miners Strikes. This is Not the First Time This Has Been Done. When Miners Refuse to Work Troops Are Sent In and Even If They Have to Kill and Replace Them All, the Only Desire is to Get Diamonds Back Flowing Out of the Country. Of Course to Launch Multiple Campaigns to Invade These Countries Separately Would Be WAY Too Fishy. But Something Like &quot;Ebola&quot; Allows Access to an Entire Area Simultaneously...</p>

<p>Reason 3: In Addition to Stealing Nigerian Oil, and Forcing Sierra Leone Back to Mining, Troops Have Also Been Sent In to FORCE Vaccinations (Deadly &quot;Ebola&quot; Poison) Onto Those Africans Who Are Not Foolish Enough to Take The Willingly. 3000 Troops Are Being Sent In to Make Sure That This &quot;Poison&quot; Continues to Spread, Because Again It Is Only Spread Through Vaccination. As More and More News Articles Are Released Like the One Above From Liberia, Informing the Populous of the US Lies and Manipulation, More and More Africans Are Refusing to Visit the Red Cross. Troops Will Force These Vaccinations Upon the People to Ensure the Visible Appearance of an Ebola Pandemic. In Addition to This They Will Protect the Red Cross From the Liberians and Nigerians Who Have Been Rightfully Ejecting Them From Their Countries.</p>

<p>Reason 4: 3000 Troops..... Is Ebola Susceptible to Bullets?? Ridiculous. Last But Not Least the APPEARANCE of This Ebola &quot;Pandemic&quot; (Should Americans Not Catch On) Will Be Used to Scare Countless Millions Into Taking the &quot;Ebola Vaccine&quot; Which in Reality IS THE PANDEMIC. Already They Have Started With Stories of How It Has Been Brought Back to the US and Has Appeared in Dallas, How White Doctors Were Cured But Black Infected Are Not Being Allowed to Be Treated Etc.</p>

<p>ALL That Will Do Is Make Blacks STRIVE to Get the Vaccine, Because It Appears That the &quot;Cure&quot; is Being Held Back From Blacks. They Will Run Out In Droves to Get It and Then There Will Be Serious Problems. With All We Have Seen Revealed About Vaccines This Year You Would Think We Learned Our Lesson. All I Can Do Is Hope So, Because They Depend Highly On Our Ignorance to Complete Their Agendas. Ask Yourself If Ebola Was Really Spread From Person to Person, Instead of Controlled Spread Through Vaccination - Then WHY Would the CDC and the US Government Continue to Allow Flights In and Out of These Countries With Absolutely No Regulation, Or At All? We Have Got to Start Thinking and Sharing Information Globally Because They Do Not Give the True Perspective of the People Who Live Here in West Africa. They Are Lying for Their Own Benefit and There Aren&#39;t Enough Voices Out There With a Platform to Help Share Our Reality. Hundreds of Thousands Have Been Killed, Paralyzed and Disabled By These and Other &quot;New&quot; Vaccines All Over the World and We Are Finally Becoming Aware of It. Now What Will We DO With All This Information?</p>

<p>Higher than 50%: </p>

<p>WHO and CDC recently came out with correction on that too, if you want to google. The 50% statistic was largely a misquote by the media who didn&#39;t understand statistics. </p>

<p>I love a good conspiracy theory myself but, I have been following this ebola thing from the start, and I must suggest that what your feelings are picking up on is the anxiety of those in charge. They just don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve never faced anything like this. The global community acted too late. The authorities, I do believe, are really doing the best they can to keep everyone calm but yes this is uncharted territory here.  They are doing the best they can!!!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any hidden agenda other than being human and thrust into an unknown and scary situation.</p>

<p>There are a myriad reasons for this, but trust me, if it was airborne, we wouldn&#39;t be on Reddit right now -- we&#39;d all be dead. It&#39;d have whipped through the entire globe that fast. It didn&#39;t. Ebola is slower moving than that, but highly fatal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  posted a thread about it but Ill leave this here as well. In 2009 a researcher working on ebola was arrested trying to cross the border with materials into the US on his way to start work at the BIODEFENSE RESEARCH LAB.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/winnipeg-researcher-charged-with-smuggling-ebola-material-into-u-s-1.774725">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/winnipeg-researcher-charged-with-smuggling-ebola-material-into-u-s-1.774725</a></p>

<p>then in oct 2009 the patent is filed and in 2010 the CDC gets patent on Ebola.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/CA2741523A1?cl=en">http://www.google.com/patents/CA2741523A1?cl=en</a></p>

<p>Now the same lab from which the ebola materials were smuggled out of has developed a vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of spent the last hour fumbling around this rabbit hole. It is kind of scary. A lot of the dots that were connected in this blogpost regarding the 09 swine flu outbreak are all here for the ebola outbreak as well.</p>

<p>Im not sure if they are the same people but googling the name Konan Michel Yao Africa says that he is now a WHO representative for south Africa. I don&#39;t know if they are the same two people but pretty strange coincidence none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all does add up. This infection has been going on since March. If it was to be feared then you would see a lot more deaths then three thousand. I&#39;d be worried if 100 thousand were dead, and though it is reported that it MIGHT reach 1.4mil casualties, I really don&#39;t see it happening. In the countries where Ebola has claimed lives and caused disorder are socially unable to stop the virus. They don&#39;t have the medical supplies, the capacity to house the sick or the finances for better infrastructure. Which allowed for a deadly disease to become as wide spread as it has. We have transferred 3 doctors to the state&#39;s for treatment, treated them and released them. This is not the end of the world here.</p>

<p>What I see is the same thing I always see; fear mongering from the news stations to increase ratings. If you are truly afraid of this becoming catastrophic then change your eating habits to include more vitamin d, as well as your normal good vitamins, and stay active to boost your immune system. Just stay informed, and keep your wits about you. </p>

<p>Give it a month, now that it was diagnosed in the United states our political leaders will give more help that wasn&#39;t there before it got serious. Which will stop it in its tracks just like is happening in Nigeria right now.</p>

<p>Tl ;Dr Ebola is being taken care of, its being blown out proportion and this outbreak will probably die out by the beginning of next year.</p>
