        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Osama bin Laden really died in December 2001. Over the course of 2001, bin Laden had checked into a hospital multiple times. One of those times being September 10, 2001, one day before the infamous 9/11 attacks. We are supposed to believe that Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks from his hospital bed where anyone could find him if they simply tried to look. During the months following that hospital visit bin Laden was hooked to a dialysis machine and we’re supposed to believe he had all this equipment plugged into a cave wall? He really died in December 2001 from kidney failure and is buried in the mountains with an unmarked grave. The Osama bin Laden people saw in videos that were released on TV in Afghanistan were fakes created by the United States government to continue to arouse the citizens in the fight against terrorists. No one was killed on May 1, 2011 because Osama bin Laden died a long time before that.</p>

<p>Benazir Bhuto said Bin Laden died in 2001. The BBC edited it to take out her mention of Bin Laden and 2 months later she was assasinated. Coincidence? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>It would be pretty amazing if it could be proven though. Not only was the official 9/11 story a lie but the guy they told you they were looking for for the last 10 years didn&#39;t even exist!</p>

I see the point that if she did mean what she said, then it makes no sense why she would say it so casually like it was common knowledge and not elaborate.

<p>The BBC later &quot;apologised&quot; for this censorship.</p>

<p>However, editing out her comment was clearly a mistake, for which we apologise, and it should not have happened. There was no intention on our part to distort the meaning of the interview (Of course not).

<p>Neighbors don&#39;t believe Osama even lived in their neighborhood. Very few Americans have seen these interviews. Al Jazeera has blocked their video of Imtiaz Tyab (the first one), but some copies were made:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpPQdaGu0lo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpPQdaGu0lo</a><br/>

(Translation for last clip available on youtube page)  </p>

<p>Once again, we are supposed to believe a story told by known proven liars: That Osama was killed in a night raid, loaded on to a boat, and thrown into the ocean. Not a single picture or any other physical evidence has EVER been offered to back this little story up.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, no one on that boat saw anything like a burial at sea. Have a listen to one of the most explosive and shocking theories ever told about the Osama &quot;killing&quot;.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to comment negatively on this, but had a thought.</p>

<p>How do I personally have proof of any action of people in the medias real existence?  On some level media has manufactured Celebrities before, things like Contract studio actors in the early days of holly wood to pop stars now.</p>

<p>How real are those persona&#39;s and people, the actions they take, etc. How far does any of that really go? </p>

<p>If Hollywood is profitable enough to make manufacturing of stars and peoples lives, how much more so is war spending and a war economy?  </p>

<p>Yes, they do, though I&#39;m not sure whether it is out of some twisted sense of &quot;good sportsmanship&quot; (like giving the fox a head-start on the hounds) or out of sheer hubris.</p>

<p>If it this <em>were</em> true, why wouldn&#39;t Bush capitalize on it during his presidency? Why wouldn&#39;t he pull off the whole &quot;Seal Team 6&quot; raid while he was still the president?</p>

<p>And the OP asks if we are to believe that Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks from his hospital bed. I would think that all this would be buttoned up long before Sept 11th (or 10th). The snowball would have been in motion for a long time and by Sept 10th, the mastermind wouldn&#39;t even be needed. This is were the Jame Bond villains always failed.  </p>

<p>Seems legit to me. </p>

<p>On a serious note, it was Marfan Syndrome he seems to have had which requires a great deal of treatment as well as shortening life expectancy dramatically.</p>

<p>There are a few stories about when/where he died including a funeral in Pakistan some time in 2001. We can safely assume that it may be part of a smokescreen to discredit the validity of these stories but of course it seems very likely that he died shortly after or even before the 2001 attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Abbottabad raid was a fraud because the real Osama bin Laden was long since dead, but some of the events did happen. According to Pakistani eye-witnesses, it involved 3 US military helicopters, only one of which deposited special forces inside the compound. It seems likely that the person living in this squalid compound was the <strong>Bin Laden lookalike</strong> who had been used for some of the Al Quaida videos that were leaked to Al Jazeera. It is not clear whether the military personnel were aware of this or not.</p>

<p>It gets stranger, because these same eye-witnesses on the ground reported that the special forces who landed in the compound were Pashtun speakers, not American military, and their helicopter was blown up with all on board as it was leaving the compound after the operation. There were no survivors. The story about the burial at sea was an obvious fiction to explain away the fact that the fake OBL had already been blown to smithereens in the explosion.</p>

<p>The video of the eye-witness is here <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/pakistan-tv-report-contradicts-us-claim-of-bin-laden-s-death/25915">http://www.globalresearch.ca/pakistan-tv-report-contradicts-us-claim-of-bin-laden-s-death/25915</a></p>

<p>I think the local eye-witnesses reports are the most credible and coherent explanation of what happened. And of course, since we know the US administration knew the real Osama was already dead, and NOT in the compound, the mission had to be designed to fail leaving no witnesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is &quot;complete B-S.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What actually happened the night of the raid, according to the SEAL Team 6 operator who I interviewed, is that the &quot;point man&quot; ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot bin Laden in the head when he saw what looked like bin Laden poking his head out of his bedroom door. The shot gravely wounded al Qaeda&#39;s leader.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/26/world/bergen-who-killed-bin-laden/">http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/26/world/bergen-who-killed-bin-laden/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know, to be honest. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me why the point man wouldn&#39;t be the first one to shoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is oil in Iraq, the 5th largest reserve in the world according to Wikipedia. That alone would probably not be a good enough reason to have invaded, err liberated them, but it doesn&#39;t hurt. If you look on a map you will see that Iraq is also a key strategic location in the region as its surrounded by Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey. The US didn&#39;t build the worlds largest embassy in Baghdad, or as I like to call it, Washington ME (Middle East) for nothing. Also, look what sits between Iraq and Afghanistan, that would be Iran. Of course, I have no real knowledge of the actual reasons and just armchair quarterbacking but if I were playing Risk on this board I&#39;d want to control Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m proud of you for posting this. Alot of people seem to forget the definition of conspiracy theory and come here expecting world news. I know you may not have sources or proof but it is still food for thought and in the realm of possibility yet others still seem as if normal people like you and me can just pull sources and proof out of our ass like we&#39;re some journalistic gods. I think it&#39;s entirely possible that bin laden was killed off sooner than we think but just cause there&#39;s no proof doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen. I&#39;m not one to go believing everything, but believing it&#39;s true and believing it&#39;s possible are two different things. So good job OP for keeping an open mind unlike others in this thread...</p>

<p>Go find out what Jack Murphy of SOFREP had to say about that in one of his articles.  If you read his novel &#39;Direct Action&#39; you can easily figure out which incidents he believes led to the conduct which meant photos could not be released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>&quot;Over the course of 2001, bin Laden had checked into a hospital multiple times. One of those times being September 10, 2001, one day before the infamous 9/11 attacks. We are supposed to believe that Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks from his hospital bed&quot;</em></p>

<p>What really needed to be orchestrated on 9/10/2001?  At that point everything was already done... Plane tickets purchased, flight school attended, box cutters packed - the hijackers were ready to go and green-lighted long before the day prior to the attack.</p>

<p><em>&quot;During the months following that hospital visit bin Laden was hooked to a dialysis machine and we’re supposed to believe he had all this equipment plugged into a cave wall?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICDgjCs_ufE#t=139">portable dialysis machines</a> are a thing, so that&#39;s not too far-fetched - especially for a multi-millionaire. </p>
