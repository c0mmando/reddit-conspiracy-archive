    <div class="md"><p>Ebola is transmitted through fluid contact, so unless this hospital says &quot;quarantine&quot; when it means &quot;not quarantine at all,&quot; your mom will be OK in terms of ebola, just FWIW. Someone would have to sneeze or cough into her face/food/water/etc, which is not likely since the hospital staff is trained in hygiene.</p>

<p>I can see ebola being used more for panic and control than for actual infection. One case of ebola under constant quarantine lands in the US and every news outlet starts 24-hour fearmongering. The result is that now your mom has to spend 3 weeks in a hospital somewhere because the powers that be say so. That&#39;s the real problem imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear that. It&#39;s important to remember that the only reason it spreads so far in Africa is that people there don&#39;t know enough about disease to prevent it. Here on the other hand, we cover our mouths when we cough, wash our hands often, etc. So as long as everyone maintains good hygiene, we&#39;ll be okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You require an isolation period of anyone entering the US from infected regions until said person can be cleared.</p>

<p>This may seem rude and inconvenient. Sorry.</p>

<p>The alternative is what we are facing now: The likelihood of Ebola breaking out in multiple locations across the US - with, as you said, multiple weeks of infected persons wandering around and traveling before the become symptomatic - unaware that they may have Ebola, and likely infecting more people before they are properly diagnosed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a recipe for disaster - but thanks to the asinine policies of the State Dept, the CDC and the Executive Branch, it&#39;s likely too late.</p>

<p>But it is NOT too late to prevent yet MORE potentially infected carriers from entering the US - headed to Chicago, or New York or Miami or YOUR hometown.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be an interesting winter.</p>

Everything is easy in theory.  Once you have to work out the logistics it becomes difficult and unnecessary.  But it&#39;s easy to sit on a computer and say &quot;they should just do &#39;X&#39;&quot; like all it&#39;ll take is the snap of a finger.  Read the WHO and CDC reports as to why this stuff isn&#39;t being done.  If you can figure out a work-around I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll pay you for your idea.</p>

<p>How was Ebola invited into the US?</p>

<p>Via lax screening protocols. As well as the fact that they flew several ebola victims into different parts of the country. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can take up to a month before somebody ever even shows a symptom</p>

<p>Actually, ebola has a maximum incubation period of 21 days.</p>

<p>How do you keep a seemingly healthy person from getting on a plane and flying into the US? Ban all flights in and out regardless of what your reason for travel may be?</p>

<p>Something like that, yes. Ban all incoming flights of noncitizens originsting from west africa (at least the afflicted countries). Period. This can be done while still allowing aid flights to those country. No need to stop offering aid. Air drops are a good possible method as well.</p>

<p>For the american citizens thst wish to return to the U.S., put them straight into quarentine, and use designated flights for transportation (or, probably more effective, ship them by boats, which would take a decent amount of time to reduce their quarentine at home.)</p>

<p>Thats why i said travellors who originate from the afflicted countries. It would take an international effort for each country to be forthright with transparency in regards to the flight information of passengers (basically all that would be needed is country of origin and country of destination).</p>

<p>For the rest of your comment, sure our aid workers can come back. But again, either by ship or designated flights, and with proper quarentine for the individuals regardless of their risk factors. If this creates too much of an issue, ethically, financially, or otherwise, then i would propose aid care packages to be airdropped. This would essentially cut off all contact of our aid delivery to the afflicted areas but still insure the aid arrives. This has been done in the past during wars, and often it is successful.</p>

<p>Its not hard. Create a database on a protected network to which each country has access. Whenever an outbound flight from one of the afflicted countries takes off, it is logged (the origin of the flight as well as its destination). Those travellors aborad that plane would be entered into the database and have to be &quot;checked in&quot; upon arrival. Its really not that hard. Obamacare is a much harder and more complex idea than this would be, and they shoved that down our throats. This should be the easy part.</p>

<p>As for your concerns about tue screenings and the financials thereof, liberia currently has a screening process. Liberia. You are telling me that states that are MUCH wealthier than liberia cant do the same? Granted, liberian screening is not very effective. And it is in these main countries affected by the current outbreak that the screening process should be the most efficient. If the wealthier countries pitched in to increase the efficacy of screening at the point of concern, which is currently just a hand full of nations, then this shouldnt be unsurmountable. </p>

<p>This, plus thermometer check points arent thst expensive, and can totally be afforded by the wealthier nations, no doubt. This wouldnt even be in discussion if those flights out of the country were banned altogether in the first place, no matter its destination.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that even with the best screening available, some infected folks would still inevitably pass through. But, the important variable here is the protocol that should he already set in place and followed to the &quot;T&quot;. This concern is one of the problems that happened with the dallas guy. Protocols that are already established werent followed, and this is a big deal.</p>

<p>This idea is not only affordable, but i believe it would offer the experts the time that they currently do not have to track down infected folks before they spread it to others. </p>

<p>But, whether or not that opportunity has passed is a different discussion. It may already be too late.</p>

<p>Its only impossible because of politics and profiteering. Its not hard to relay information to other countries. Especially when you consider that only a handful of countries need to be watched. We wouldnt have to worry about other countries flights if there were no commercial flights leaving the afflicted countries in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, nice strawman there. But ill bite ;-) i like the devils advocate thing..</p>

<p>But anyways, the tsa abuses their responsibility. Just as do cops. But not all cops are bad. Neither are some tsa agents. Im not the kind of person to try and label folks in such a monochromatic manner, no matter their occupation.</p>

<p>However, as a unit, the tsa abuses the powers granted to them, similar to how law enforcement officers abuse their powers in this country. </p>

<p>And it begs explanation, that this the extra screening would be limited, very limited, in terms of personally identifiable information. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whether or not your current flight, or any previous flights, were originated from west africa,</p></li>
<li><p>Whether or not your temperature is above 100℉</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If yes to both, no flight. Quarentine. Thats all the info they need.</p>

<p>However, as ive said plenty of times before, if outbound flights were banned altogether, which is not a hard thing to do, then the screening of arriving flights wouldnt be as big of a deal in other countries. However, due to the ability for folks to drive out of those countries to a neighboring country, and then fly, these checkpoints would still work well enough to stem the outbreak enough for healthcare workers to catch up.</p>

<p>Passports name countries of issue and are stamped by authorities when the traveler enters/leaves a given country. We notify airlines that travelers that have visited countries x, y, z, etc will be subject to quarantine on arrival in the US.

<p>&quot;For whatever reason.&quot; Thats the important part, i think. They, at the very least, must explain their actions to reduce the distrust that the people have learned to harbor.

    <div class="md"><p>If your scenario happens, that means you&#39;d have people inside the US getting sick with Ebola, therefore outbreak has become a reality. Right now (we hope) the only people needing treatment for Ebola are those who have been infected with it <em>outside</em> the country..... and brought to the US for care.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;m just thinking that the original question still stands. Why not take them to a master location. One place with the greatest concentration of resources/expertise. Wouldn&#39;t doing it this way also give the patient the best chance at survival?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well there are those who&#39;ve been identified as infected overseas and specifically transported here for treatment - while they&#39;re not all taken to one location, their destinations are chosen as places where expert help and high quality facilities are readily available.</p>

<p>There as been others (only one?) who&#39;ve come to the US with the infection, but not yet showing symptoms. They would be the highest risk, it&#39;s pretty easy to control infection when you&#39;re aware that a person is infected - as the case with those brought to the US for treatment - but those who begin to show symptoms within the community are a bigger danger. Until they&#39;re identified they risk infecting others, so once they are identified they need to be isolated and other potentially exposed people identified and monitored.</p>

<p>Thanks but i didnt ask for shit.</p>

<p>I looked it up on my own, using my own sources that i have grown accustomed to, just like i assume you do too.</p>

<p>I wasnt dissing your sources either, just pointing out that others might have not appreciated your source due to credibility issues. I find myself on beforeitsnews alot, and blacklistednews sometimes. There are some shit articles in both, but far more shit in BIN.

<p>That, plus his condescending tones... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First it&#39;s a single event in the US, then a single event in a state, then what? Don&#39;t worry because your county, town, or household only has a single event? It spread <em>to</em> California and the question is where did it come from and how many other people were exposed? I <em>really</em> hope a person who goes to work sick unless they literally can&#39;t function doesn&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve seen how sick some people go to work because they are so dependent on every last penny. The thought is chilling. </p>
