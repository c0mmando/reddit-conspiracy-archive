       In the FX series The Strain, a zombie-like vampire strain is transported to New York via airplane. People get paid off, bribed, and threatened until it's spreading like wildfire and communications are shut off for the entire city. Still, even after all that, people don't believe what's happening. One of the things said over and over is about how your loved ones come back to infect you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same could be said about a lot of movies that pertain to epidemics (namely the movie Contagion).
      </p>
      <p>
       Predictive programming, yeah?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: It's also rather funny they include the traditional "Nazi's are the bad guy" trope. Classic.

       It's based on a book that came out 5 years ago. It was a vampire story designed to catch on with the zombie craze at the time. So if you wanna make a predictive programming claim, do it about the zombie craze. The Strain has little that makes it stand out itself as predictive programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I did find something interesting. Back when I was active on the Anonymous IRC, when Occupy was happening, we were all discussing what the next big hack should be. I had come up with the idea of hijacking the Emergency Broadcast System.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was funny to see that idea pop up in the show, when it wasn't present in the book. In the book, it was the eclipse that was fucking with everyone's communications. There was no hacker plot-line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Contagion was a much likelier candidate for predictive programming. Watch that movie again, and look at how many corporate logos pop up, and which ones.

       I'd wager the same could be said about EVERY big sickness film or show.

       Widespread threat is practically only way you can make these types of film entertaining.

       If a film's plot had people reacting immediately and appropriately, the film would be over before half an hour.

       The funny thing about it is they all portray people acting realistically and we take no heed. This is exactly what's happening and they demand the benefit of the doubt. They tell us everything's under control... :P

       If people weren't reacting realistically in the show, it would be a terrible show and no one would watch it. It doesn't take a psychic to know how people would react during/what would cause a widespread outbreak, it just takes a very basic understanding of human nature and disease. Ever played the game Plague? The game makers didn't randomly predict what would happen during a widespread outbreak and then turn out to be right, they used science and research to make a hyper realistic game, same concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr: All movies about contagions and wide spread disease are similar because the people making the movies did some research. That's it.

       Happens, and it's weird having come into faith later in my life rather than growing up with it. I see the flipside of a coin I've always been on the other side of.

       I myself was once guilty of being inclined to an immediate repulsion when presented with religion. Society conditions us and is biased in that way nowadays.

       Utopia (UK) best fits the Ebola plot imo.  (random side-note: they both have an old jew-ish man from an internment camp as a main character, coincidentally enough)  I heard with the Hola addon you can stream it by using UK, Ireland, or Canada Netflix

       it is really. Ebola is about as hard to get as AIDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But smallpox....fuck smallpox. We have zero immunity globally as a species, and if that got out, especially some genetically modified version of it, it's hard to overestimate the damage. It could reach an extinction-level-event, like Stephen King's The Stand plot. Billions could die.

       Just wait until you look into the books, OP. The Master nukes the planet to start a sunless nuclear winter to take over the planet. Seems likely after ebola kills 30 trillion Americans, and since there's only 300 million of us, 30 trillion dead will be a big deal!

       The vampires contaminate other people by bodily fluids - either by directly biting them with those tongue-stings or by splattering people with that nasty white blood full of worms (when people engage in "direct contact" with them during fights).
      </p>
      <p>
       The vampires are often covered in blood or have blood dripping from their mouths. Sure that is from their victims, but anyway it kind of resembles some Ebola pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often the vampires appear letargic or dead and then "come back to life". We have seen the same mechanics hapenning in some isolated ebola cases since last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I would say that there is at least a passing resemblance.

       Some nice people made a "nice" little PC game recently that deals with making and spreading of your very own deadly disease.  Getting as much exposure to the world as possible and helping said disease to evolve and kill better.  This is about as fucked up as you can get, in my opinion.  make it a "game".

       Nazis were the bad guys, but not in the way everyone thinks. Hitler, Roosevelt, and Churchill were all jews who were working together to kill as many "goyim" as possible.
