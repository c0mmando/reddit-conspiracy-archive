       The number 77. It has a fair bit of significance in numerological traditions. It shows up a lot -- London 7/7 bombings etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking at
       <a href="http://www.ridingthebeast.com/numbers/nu77.php">
        this old page
       </a>
       since it was the first in my google search.
      </p>
      <p>
       This caught my eye:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        With the gematria in "n", 77 is the sum of two numbers in facing: 34 value of the Hebrew word spirit, 20+6+8=34; and 43, number of the Hebrew word flesh, 2+21+20=43. That reminds us that the Son of God become man (flesh) in order that the man rises up towards God (spirit). The flesh and the spirit are then complementary: the flesh bearing the spirit and the fruit of the work of the Spirit will be the salvation of the flesh which will receive the incorruptibility.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So I did some random calculating...
      </p>
      <pre><code>34 x 43 = 1462
1462 x 43 = 62866
62866 x 43 x 43 x 43 x 43 = 214,926,343,666
</code></pre>
      <p>
       So I interpret this number as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        214 = 2014 (drop the zero)
       </li>
       <li>
        926 = September 26
       </li>
       <li>
        343 = CDC (alphabetic order)
       </li>
       <li>
        666 = Evil!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Sept 26 is the date our good old ebola victim first reported to hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence? Well, I hope so :)

       Here's another one:  322(skull and bones number) is 333(aka 9) minus 11.  Hence 322 is 9-11

       Gamers in eSports will often end their match by saying "GG" - Good Game.

       How do you know when to use numbers or letters?

      <p>
       For all you know 214 could actually spell "BAD", and not a date.

       Seems like you're dropping numbers and putting letters wherever convenient.

       In the wonderful world of numerology adding a zero changes quite a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1st becomes the 10th, time can vary from on 24-hour clocks depending on the placement of the zero, numbers of things involved can go from 1 to 100...

       add all the numbers together until you get a single digit.
a double number like 11 or 33 might mean something, but normally its one digit.

       Zero is a non number.  We can clearly see numerology means something to the Zionists attempting to rule us.  The fucks can't even run the euro zone, and they expect they can rule the world.  Pathetic.

       I've been called a shill a lot here, and I'm taking it out on you which is unfair. I don't really get it to be honest, I try to be critical on both sides, and I still get shit on.

       I have a suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop gravitating to articles that you strongly disagree with and stick to stuff you're interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy forum and there is going to be stuff here you find silly, even Alex Jones himself is bound to find certain topics here to be wrong or dumb or unethical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody wants to be baggered by someone defending vaccines or spilling their guts about the dangers of global warming. People come here to talk about the other half of these subjects, not to regurgitate the mainstream views found literally everywhere else on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if there is a conspiracy you're interested in, talk about that one.  The conspiracies that you don't believe in, ignore those.

       Yea dude, i would go so far as to say that the majority of folks here dont
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       "believe" in numerology. Most logical minds here understand that if you play with numbers long enough, youll be able to get to any preconceived result.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, numerology does have its place here, due to some theories that dictate TPTB are weirdly superstitious and that TPTB plan their "dates" according to numerological paradigms. The adage here for that is, "it doesnt matter if we believe it or not, if TPTB believe it, thats all that matters."
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your concern about people calling you a troll, (which i dont believe you are, ftr), its probably because we get a lot of folks here who will just disagree with anythijg and they will be assholes and douchebags, and will say anything just to derail the conversation. Some of them have an agenda, no doubt, but i believe most do it just for the hell of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when a person comes onto a thread that they arent even interested in, that comes up as a red flag, as thats
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what trolls will do. The best bet is to either say you disagree with the post for whatever reasons you have, or better yet, downvote and move on to what actually interests you.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a quarter million subscribers, im sure there is something for everyone. If numerology aint your thing, or if "half-baked" ideas arent your thing, or if "just for fun" isnt your thing, (all of these were included in the title, and shouldve been easy enough to recognize and skip over), then find something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ftr, i dont subscribe to
       <strong>
        <em>
         most
        </em>
       </strong>
       theories here. Honestly, i dont. But i can divide my beliefs from my speculations and entertain ideas without subscribing to them. Its part of being openminded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try not to get so pissed when folks call you a shill. Theres a lot of asshats here that toss that label around like herpes. It doesnt really mean anything, really...

       Because the asshole banker cabal religion thinks numerology is important. And when extremely powerful people think something is important, it
       <em>
        becomes
       </em>
       important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree numerology is utterly ridiculous. But a lot of billionaires and powerful politicians think it's legit, and they plan big events around it. So we can get clues to the future by understanding their dumb superstition.

       Powerful and rich people can be just as dumb as anyone else. If they are obsessed with numerology, then yes, you could use it to predict their movements.
