<p>Illuminatedwax was here at Reddit very early on and actually created most of those subs where he is top mod, including this one. For the most part he&#39;s not active unless there&#39;s a major problem with the rest of the mods. And by &quot;major&quot; I <em>don&#39;t</em> mean the very few people coming here from anti-<a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> subs with alt accounts bitching about mods. That&#39;s been going on ever since this sub was created. </p>

<p>Nice try. Every single complaint about you and flytrap has been from regular users here. Until they get banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry bud.</p>

<p>Illuminatedwax is the top mod here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which means that user has power to remove any mod below him/her, which means that user can do whatever he/she wants to do with this sub.</p>

<p>Whenever we see self posts regarding mod gripes or calls for more leasership, illuminatedwax&#39;s name gets tossed around because they aren&#39;t very active here, but I argue that it works effectively enough with what this community thrives on - which is usually the least amount of mod presence possible.</p>

<p>He also came up a lot during our AMA debacles including the fake Richard Gage AMA as well as Rob Balsemo&#39;s (Rob would not shut up about it).</p>

<p>Ever see Primer? I liken illuminatedwax&#39;s inactivity as the final plot point in Primer (no, I won&#39;t spoil it). Go watch it on Netflix. Good flick.</p>

<p>He also had a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2126540265/the-open-source-fandom-chat-client-version-413">kickstarter</a> detailed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1pxq4k/there_isnt_a_good_place_to_live_chat_about/">here</a>.</p>

<p>...is that better ;)</p>

<p>You did. You asked how you can mod 54 sub&#39;s. Make a sub, get in on the ground floor, and boom you&#39;re in. First come first serve. Asked and answered.</p>

<p>Explained above.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t. It just is.</p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>

<p>And reading the above thread again - it comes off like you think <em>I owe you something</em>. I don&#39;t owe you shit. Sure, you can expect more, but this is voluntary for me. I can answer your questions any way I want. Sorry for getting uppity - that struck a nerve for some reason and I don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>I choose to respond with larger replies more often than not here to get people to connect some dots and think about things in a slightly different way or vantage point. But I do this because I like it, and feel it&#39;s the best use of my bored time. But I&#39;ll make sure I don&#39;t give you shirt answers any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re nothing game-breaking (I don&#39;t think...) But I&#39;ll give you a nibble to see if you can see where I&#39;m going.</p>

<p>You know how there are some users here who have long, thoughtful comments with links to sources, and while I&#39;m sure they have their own biases and agenda - they can admit they are wrong, are generally polite (I failed that above, and again apologize), and try and present facts and sources in an easy to digest way? Sometimes it reinforces OP, sometimes it counters OP?</p>

<p>I have noticed and tried to model my discourse in that way here lately with solid results. Other users of note include <a href="/u/internetpropagandist">/u/internetpropagandist</a>, <a href="/u/shelloilnigeria">/u/shelloilnigeria</a>, <a href="/u/strokethekitty">/u/strokethekitty</a>, and many others which I apologize for forgetting off the top of my head (been dealing with snow in New England for weeks now and am exhausted.</p>

<p>Well, what I&#39;m getting at is - if I were to leave this place - it would be to a place that encourages that kind of communication, and rewards it (with upvotes, tips (the change tip bot was the genesis for this), and other incentives.</p>

<p>Could you imagine a link aggregator site and community that rewards thought provoking content and debunking of stories? Maybe not something you could quit your day job over, but the incentives would encourage this behavior more-so than now. And that mentality (checking sources, <em>big picture thinking</em>, et cetera) is something we have been missing in the US (at least) for a long time now. What are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the top mod spot of <a href="/r/con">/r/con</a> is occupied by a poweruser, who mods subs like <a href="/r/Funny">/r/Funny</a>, <a href="/r/Tumblr">/r/Tumblr</a>, <a href="/r/Scientology">/r/Scientology</a>, <a href="/r/4chan">/r/4chan</a> along with about 100 others.</p>

<p>He is one of the SJW that ruined 4chan, as discussed in the stickied thread in this sub.</p>

<p>He also has links to the SJWs of Reddit.</p>

<p>He never participates. He does not do any moderating here. All he is here for, is to maintain control of the sub for the SJWs and give them access to the private modmail in this sub.</p>

<p>I am guessing that Flytape is here because he does IW&#39;s dirty work with censoring. I think SM also works for IW.</p>

<p>Due to IW&#39;s links to the admins, Flytape is allowed to get unshadowbanned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for breaking it down, I tried following the other threads and was having a hard time with it. Seems like I&#39;m seeing some of the regulars here, who&#39;ve always seemed like the leaders of the sub, even if they&#39;re not mods, going head to head on mod stuff. I have to wonder how much of it could be to derail the sub and how much we are getting suckered in to it. I obviously don&#39;t understand the intricacies of the current mod problem, but from an outsiders perspective this one seems different, seems like more of the recognized names are on different sides of the issue.</p>

<p>It is weird that someone was banned for basically just posting annoying stuff about limited hangouts. I get that it was annoying. And basically everything that he posted about, but maybe that was the kind of thing he cared to post about, there are a lot of users who only post about one thing. And I get how it is annoying to regulars and mods and people like me checking the new tab more frequently than the hot tab, but there are people who only browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> occasionally and maybe that guy was just pimping out his limited hangout theory hoping to pick up another couple of people that&#39;d maybe end up interested in his stuff. </p>

<p>There&#39;s annoying shit to sift through everywhere. I hope he was banned because he was annoying and not because the content, people shouldnt really get banned for content unless it is truly spam stuff (like bots) or hate speech. But then we&#39;re left trying to answer the question of, <em>did someone get banned for annoying a mod?</em> </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying I have this figured out, but this is how the argument is coming across to a regular lurker but someone unfamiliar with the deeper crevices of subreddit drama.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not why he was banned. He was banned for retaliatory personal attacks against people who disagreed with him plus posting what amounted to witch hunts against some of those very same people.</p>

<p>One example: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uh57i/any_post_about_snowden_being_limited_hangout_or/co8dewo">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uh57i/any_post_about_snowden_being_limited_hangout_or/co8dewo</a> followed up by George_Tenet with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2umcp8/sovereignman_is_mod_not_only_this_sub_but_911/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2umcp8/sovereignman_is_mod_not_only_this_sub_but_911/</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example of many and not the final one that got him banned (note that I wasn&#39;t the mod that finally banned him). Another issue was his constant spamming of links, probably in the hundreds over the past few months, to his own subreddit.</p>

<p>As long as people are civil and follow the rules, we have no problem with discussions about limited hangouts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first example is a stretch at anything out of line, there&#39;s been a lot worse stuff in here  The retaliatory post, yeah, that&#39;s definitely a witch hunt type post, but wasn&#39;t there a bunch of drama about 911 and the ama that was botched (<em>please disregard if this is unrelated, it is the only reasonable conspiracy to post about between a link between mods with shared responsibilities and whether or not that ama was really a set up</em>)?
The link thing I am totally in support of, ban away when people are shit posting, especially for their own advertisement.</p>

<p>I can understand the ban after all is added up, but there is no rule in the side bar about a bunch of minor offenses eventually leading to a ban so for people who don&#39;t see all of GTs stuff all the time, it may seem like the ban came after a petty offense.</p>

<p>IlluminatedWax is a straight, balls to the wall, SJW. He doesn&#39;t like offensive jokes or any sort of freedom of speech. Which makes it pretty funny that he is a mod of <a href="/r/4chan">/r/4chan</a>. </p>

<p>Luckily, Illuminated maintains his high position and lack of scrutiny by not overtly censoring anyone. But I believe that is why he keeps people like Flytape and SovereignMan on the team. They do the censoring, and he makes sure they never get shadowbanned or removed from the mod team.</p>

<p>This sub of all subs should be able to post whatever they want and not have someone demand proof of them to keep posting and I think I saw in the other thread someone mentioned that he would only post about Snowden being a LHO but wouldn&#39;t provide proof of his claims.

So George calls them out on their censorship, because who the fuck are they to censor his posts? If the community thinks its annoying all they have to do is downvote it or hide it. It&#39;s no big deal. But the mods here think they are special, and that they know something, and that they get to decide what this community will and won&#39;t discuss.</p>

<p>So when George called them out, he got banned.</p>

<p>You should probably do a little investigating first. Just because you saw a funny comment he made on a thread one time doesn&#39;t mean he is worthy of anyone&#39;s respect.</p>

I&#39;m not saying I think you&#39;re wrong or George was wrong, from my vantage point and my collected information, the ban, in my opinion, wasn&#39;t warrented, but I&#39;d have a preference to have less banning in general. No bans unless it&#39;s a bot or someone bringing message of hate. If people really gets pissed off about a downturn in the quality of content maybe they will login and vote. It blows my mind that there can be so many users on at one time and stories and comments sit at 4 and 5 votes all day. Maybe we really should stop modding so hard, maybe it&#39;d encourage community involvement.

<p>I guess I disagree with you here. There has to be a line. But that line can be way off in the distance, around death threats, and stocking/doxing, and maybe a few other places. I think most everything else should be fair game, I mean if it can be said on Call of Duty by a 7year old with crap bags for parents, it should be allowed to be said here.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know Flytape&#39;s deal for sure, but I have noticed that he allows certain posters to continue here that clearly break the rules every single day and do nothing but defend government narratives while continually insulting the entire sub.  When he is called out for this behavior, he rule #10s the person and bans them instead.</p>

<p>His inconsistent behavior and crass attitude lead me to not trust him.</p>

<p>(I&#39;ll probably get rule #10&#39;d for this, so I&#39;ll see you guys on the next throwaway account.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the mod team is full of cancer because of this. Don&#39;t see any way to wrestle it away from him either. He&#39;s obviously well connected with the admins.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s cute how sovereignman defends him though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also has a lot of pretend fights with the <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> where he is shadowbanned for an hour and then unshadowbanned.</p>

<p>Then we can all say &quot;Gee, Flytape is really willing to go to war for us&quot;, but it&#39;s all just a sham. That is how he is able to censor things and not get scrutinized.</p>

<p>I also believe he is just a puppet for IW. IW can&#39;t risk anything, being the top mod, but he can make sure his buddies do his work for him, and he can keep them unbanned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a crock of shit. The sub has been dead for a long time. Time to move on to voat.co</p>

<p>To be honest, I think the top three should be heavily investigated, and probably removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came off a little pushy, my bad. I too have had a long day. I&#39;m just trying to figure this shit out. This doesn&#39;t smell right to me. To be on top of 50+ subs all/many major seems of a plant. I&#39;m sorry for the inquisition. Shit got the best of me. It&#39;s time for something new, and the door is still open for you. The future is near, and yes, fuck this place. Cheers mate, I just took a shot of whiskey for ya. :)</p>
