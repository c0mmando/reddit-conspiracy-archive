       Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently remarked while answering questions at the Georgetown University Law Center that she would overturn the Citizens United decision explaining, “I think our system is being polluted by money”.
      </p>
      <p>
       She pointed out that she is optimistic that “sensible restrictions” on campaign financing would be in place one day, referencing a quote by her late husband “The true symbol of the United States is not the eagle, it’s the pendulum- when it swings too far in one direction, it will swing back.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ginsburg (or the Notorious RBG) has an impactful track record as a justice for championing progressive causes, along with an equally impressive resume. She did side with the dissent on the case, but the above quote only highlights the chasm that separates some of our highest adjudicators and lawmakers and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not that the self stylized rhetoric of the eagle and the pendulum is necessarily wrong, just that the form of idealistic school of though it represents only obfuscates the real situation. Money and politics are always intertwined, but we’ve taken a bad situation with the Citizens United ruling and made it much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Koch brothers recently announced a 2016 election fundraising goal of around 900 million, roughly as much as the Republican Party’s three committees spent in the last election cycle. The money being raised isn’t all going to the upcoming election, but it’s pretty clear that corporate influence has reached a juncture where sensibility has flown out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Citizens United ruling created the ability for corporations and big businesses to rubber stamp elections with money, hiding behind laws where they do not necessarily have to disclose where they money is coming from. Individuals charged with a felony usually go to jail for many years. Corporations charged with felonies usually negotiate deferred prosecution agreements, pay a fine and get right back to business, with a growing trend of gaming the system to get the rules in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the above is anything new, but we have reached the point now where a new party has essentially been created with the literal ability to outspend anyone to influence elections (or anything). They don’t have to tell anyone where the money is coming from, and pretty much have the impudence to do whatever they want because they are immune from the law in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this kind of power, no “sensible reforms” are going to be put in place, especially by lawmakers themselves. When the pendulum is bought out; it’s not going to swing back. A constitutional amendment or a Supreme Court reversal is the only solution, not symbolism and idealism.

       An average American does not have the power to compete with a lobbyist who has millions even billions of dollars to give to a politician. Not only do we have to compete with corporations and lobbyists to have sway in legislation, but foreign countries as well are funneling money into our electoral process. China and Israel are the biggest contributors. All of this money and power is used to take away the ability to have a say in our government. From gerrymandering to the concentration of ownership, and the stripping of our rights; it is a quiet war going on under the noses of the American people.

       The only solution is a Constitutional Amendment barring all types of contributions and consideration to federal employees. Make the penalties for violation akin to those for treason, because that essentially is what has happened.
