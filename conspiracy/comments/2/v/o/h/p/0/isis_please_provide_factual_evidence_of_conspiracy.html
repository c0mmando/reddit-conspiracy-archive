        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been reading a few of the posts alleging that the US created ISIS and that the beheading videos are nothing more than a propaganda machine to entice the US populace to vote for boots and get the US back into the middle east. Let me state that I am part of the millions who, through constant, misguided and contradictory news reporting, do not know what to think of all of this. I see the &quot;confirmed&quot; reports, the cited sources, etc for all of the &quot;terror group&quot; claims, but every time I read a post accusing the US of creating, funding or otherwise aiding ISIS, all I see are opinions or links to YouTube videos set up by individuals who happen to be as paranoid as those who share the links. </p>

<p>I am in no way attacking anyone for their stance on the issue. I am personally curious to have facts and details. What are some facts that are verifiable that support the claim that ISIS is US owned?</p>

<p>EDIT: I have been made aware that this type of post is associated with skepticism in this sub. I have defended this post numerous times already. Please know I am genuinely looking for information. This is not an attempt to begin an argument or anything other than pure, human curiosity. I apologize for not knowing this in advance and if I have caused you to believe otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really tough subject to dive into - and I think that is by design.</p>

<p>I will spoil all the videos of the victims listed in the President&#39;s draft AUMF for escalating military engagements with ISIL:</p>

<p>James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Kassig, Gourdel, and the Japanese hostages, <strong>all cut out right before you actually see anything</strong>. </p>

<p>They really are like crappy B-movie pseudo-horror clips where the worst imagery (IMO) is in what your mind&#39;s eye inserts into it when you don&#39;t see the action.</p>

<p>As far as my biggest <em>gotcha</em> moment? In the Herve Goudel video, around ~4:22, the screen fades to black (it&#39;s when you actually would have seen the &#39;action&#39;l, and for two frames, a manipulated still of a previous beheading video (James Foley&#39;s) is <strong>literally spliced into the video, Tyler Durden style</strong>. </p>

<p>I mean - what in the actual fuck?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I just watched the Herve Gourdel video and sure enough, at 4:22 minutes the scene fades to black and you can see a split second still of a more popularized beheading scene (ISIS guy in all black with hostage in bright orange jumpsuit).

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for watching it and powering through it.</p>

<p>If you freeze it and put them side-by-side, it&#39;s a still of the Foley vid.</p>

<p>I used to think it was a creepy psychological thing to link the two subliminally, but have settled on the Occam&#39;s Razor-esque view of &quot;shitty post-production&quot; work.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse - that I&#39;m still bitching about these videos 6 months later, or I remembered the timestamp of the still without looking it up.</p>

<p>Let me reiterate his again everybody:</p>

<h1>The US Government just asked for a minimum 3-year pass to pursue The Islamic State with no geographical battlefield limitations, because of a few shitty propagandistic videos pushed into mainstream media thanks to the SITE Intelligence Group, a private, US company cofounded by Rita Katz, whose father was convincted and executed by Saddam for being an Israeli spy.</h1>

<p>Everything in the article referencing Americans have mixed words like &quot;believed to be authentic,&quot; in there. Then there&#39;s this:</p>

<p>The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, <strong>according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites</strong>.</p>

<p>We both watched the video and agreed that what was reported did not take place in hr video. I argue that institutions that <em>validated</em> the video need to be looked at with scrutiny, as they are obviously not doing their job. Do you agree?</p>

<p>Also - who is the SITE Intelligence group that the link references? Ever heard of them?</p>

<p>While not denying the inconsistencies in the execution videos, there&#39;s a huge leap from that to the claim this is evidence America/Israel is behind ISIS. If you can get as much publicity for your cause by faking an execution, it makes perfect sense to do so. Allows you to get maximum bang for your hostage, so to speak. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m with the OP: this topic sparks a lot of claims, but very little evidence. Seems to me there are those parties who would benefit very nicely from promoting a false belief that the US is backing ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read the links? Who he met simply wasn&#39;t the person claimed. This is right up there with the nonsense about dead kids from Sandy Hook showing up at the Super Bowl. Independent fact-checking has found the claim wildly fallacious:</p>

<p>There are days when we regret we are limited to just Four Pinocchios. This is one of those days.

It&#39;s a mainstream source so it&#39;s established and credible. </p>

<p>It is biased on presentation of information but it also is from non american sources. </p>

<p>Iran is obviously much closer to the &quot;threat&quot; than americans.</p>

<p>Iran isn&#39;t a backwater middle eastern state stuck on sharia or Wahhabi islam. </p>

<p>Also nobody here on this sub or alive and willing to talk has proof you&#39;re looking for. All we have is proof in our own minds based on a preponderance of evidence each of us has come across over time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My short answer is this: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/</a></p>

<p>These theories have a way of protruding into real life and zapping the joy from it. They can take over and alienate a person from friends and family ultimately dividing general populations against each other.</p>

<p>To prevent this I seek a concise conclusion after weighing the evidence at my disposal and move on with my life.</p>

<p>Unless new evidence or actions force me to either change my point of view or solidify it, I pay attention to other things I find interesting.</p>

<p>With that being said I believe the reason is multifaceted. It has moved past the point of just money and power to currently being about maintaining control of money and power.</p>

<p>The military industrial complex needs justification to continue weapon manufacturing and new weapon research.</p>

<p>The government is filled with less than honorable self serving morons who don&#39;t want to lose their status or public office. They aren&#39;t able to outsmart the military industrial complex and are scared of having their skeletons exposed to the public.</p>

<p>Banks need to justify and maintain control of currency so they partner with the military industrial complex to create problems that cost ridiculous amounts of money to solve. </p>

<p>The upper classes of the world know this symbiotic relationship between them serves all of them so they maintain the charade. </p>

<p>Intelligence agencies of the world work to provide advisable Intel and covert counter measures to keep the upper classes steps ahead of the rest of us. </p>

<p>This system has no strategic exit for them in their mind. They don&#39;t entertain the idea of stopping because they believe it to be a suicidal fools errand to try.</p>

<p>The reason we on the outside looking in can&#39;t contemplate their motivations, reasons or purposes is because we don&#39;t think like them. </p>

<p>On a fundamental level there&#39;s nobody to blame. They were brought up in an existing system that was good to them and cannot understand why we don&#39;t like that system. </p>

<p>We were brought up manipulated by said system and cannot figure out why they won&#39;t leave us be. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a stupid cycle and the people in the middle are like you and I. We see inconsistent patterns, illogical behavior, irrational emotions and feel that it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. </p>

<p>So we search for something that concretely proves or disproves our beliefs. We don&#39;t find it so we discuss it. </p>

<p>All the while spinning our wheels while they do the same. </p>

<p>This is modern life. Enjoy it or hate it, we won&#39;t get out alive either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the idea that this group is self funded through robbing banks and taking an oil field hostage, which is the mainstream media narrative as to how they got the resources to take over huge chunks of Syria and iraq, just seems far fetched to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up the video... You know the one all over the papers. That &quot;shows&quot; a beheading? Look at the knife, how much damage it does(n&#39;t do)? No blood and omitting the execution scene entirely? Why would such a heinous group not show the details... </p>

<p>Look at the picture in the desert recently. The two men&#39;s head shadows are going in different directions... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shadow thing has explanation, and it&#39;s been debunked on other websites. I think it&#39;s a mistake to focus on the backdrop. some faking this could just as easily do it outside. The fact that they don&#39;t show the actual beheading is what is most suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My short answer is this: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/</a></p>

<p>These theories have a way of protruding into real life and zapping the joy from it. They can take over and alienate a person from friends and family ultimately dividing general populations against each other.</p>

<p>To prevent this I seek a concise conclusion after weighing the evidence at my disposal and move on with my life.</p>

<p>Unless new evidence or actions force me to either change my point of view or solidify it, I pay attention to other things I find interesting.</p>

<p>With that being said I believe the reason is multifaceted. It has moved past the point of just money and power to currently being about maintaining control of money and power.</p>

<p>The military industrial complex needs justification to continue weapon manufacturing and new weapon research.</p>

<p>The government is filled with less than honorable self serving morons who don&#39;t want to lose their status or public office. They aren&#39;t able to outsmart the military industrial complex and are scared of having their skeletons exposed to the public.</p>

<p>Banks need to justify and maintain control of currency so they partner with the military industrial complex to create problems that cost ridiculous amounts of money to solve. </p>

<p>The upper classes of the world know this symbiotic relationship between them serves all of them so they maintain the charade. </p>

<p>Intelligence agencies of the world work to provide advisable Intel and covert counter measures to keep the upper classes steps ahead of the rest of us. </p>

<p>This system has no strategic exit for them in their mind. They don&#39;t entertain the idea of stopping because they believe it to be a suicidal fools errand to try.</p>

<p>The reason we on the outside looking in can&#39;t contemplate their motivations, reasons or purposes is because we don&#39;t think like them. </p>

<p>On a fundamental level there&#39;s nobody to blame. They were brought up in an existing system that was good to them and cannot understand why we don&#39;t like that system. </p>

<p>We were brought up manipulated by said system and cannot figure out why they won&#39;t leave us be. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a stupid cycle and the people in the middle are like you and I. We see inconsistent patterns, illogical behavior, irrational emotions and feel that it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. </p>

<p>So we search for something that concretely proves or disproves our beliefs. We don&#39;t find it so we discuss it. </p>

<p>All the while spinning our wheels while they do the same. </p>

<p>This is modern life. Enjoy it or hate it, we won&#39;t get out alive either way. </p>
