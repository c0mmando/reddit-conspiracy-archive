<p>Not saying there aren&#39;t racist people here.  No doubt there is, but I have been on for a while and can tell when there are just little hiccups or intentional pushes to show some kind of hatred here.  Easy to do, easy to demonize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of thing happens to info sources that cut a little too close to the bone.  Discredit the whole place by flooding submissions with mindless anti-jewish stupidity. Then go on mainstream subs, search for mentions of r/conspiracy (usually there will be a &quot; ..they were talking about this weeks ago on r/conspiracy&quot; comment) and disparage the whole sub as holocaust-deniers. Boom, psych-job complete. It&#39;s main purpose is to try to stop this sub from growing. Just be vigilant and downvote, point out users who are behind it, etc. And always put your in time at &#39;new&#39;.</p>

<p>That said, there was no intentional policy of genocide/extermination of the jews.</p>

<p>Even if, speaking hypothetically, there never was a directive or aim or the means to kill in an industrialized fashion all or as many Jews as possible, and all the suffering that was brought upon the Jewish people are merely the results of typical war time priorities, negligence, famine and sickness, it would still qualify as &quot;Shoah&quot; or &quot;Holocaust&quot;, meaning unjust persecution, internment, and suffering directed against a people based on their heritage and creed alone and would be <em>utterly</em> condemnable. My original statement aimed at the distinction between denial as in &quot;it never happened at all&quot; and historical revision as in &quot;it happened, albeit to a different extent, by different means, for different reasons than the prevalent narrative dictates&quot;. I hope I could make myself as clear as possible. </p>

<p>I suppose you can qualify things however you feel like.</p>

<p>By that definition there was a holocaust against allied POWs, homosexuals, gypsies, japanese prisoners in american internment camps, and german POWs at the end of the war as well. </p>

<p>The reason I want to clarify this is because zionists use the supposed holocaust as an example of intentional jewish extermination, and therefore a justification for modern day israel, and the genocide against palestinians happening there. If you remove the whole &quot;intentional extermination of jews&quot; and realize it (people dying in slave labor camps) was blanketed against everyone that the nazis didn&#39;t like, the justification for Israel essentially disappears, and the case for intentional genocide of palestinians disappears with it.</p>

<p>and all the suffering that was brought upon the Jewish people are merely the results of typical war time priorities, negligence, famine and sickness, it would still qualify as &quot;Shoah&quot; or &quot;Holocaust&quot;, meaning unjust persecution, internment, and suffering directed against a people based on their heritage and creed alone and would be utterly condemnable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose you can qualify things however you feel like.</p>

<p>By that definition there was a holocaust against allied POWs, homosexuals, gypsies, japanese prisoners in american internment camps, and german POWs at the end of the war as well. </p>

<p>The reason I want to clarify this is because zionists use the supposed holocaust as an example of intentional jewish extermination, and therefore a justification for modern day israel, and the genocide against palestinians happening there. If you remove the whole &quot;intentional extermination of jews&quot; and realize it (people dying in slave labor camps) was blanketed against everyone that the nazis didn&#39;t like, the justification for Israel essentially disappears, and the case for intentional genocide of palestinians disappears with it.</p>
