    <div class="md"><p>Save yourself a lot of confusion and get straight at the beginning the difference between what is sometimes called the Western Kabbalah, and the actual Jewish mystical Kabbalah.</p>

<p>The Jewish Kabbalah is a system of mysticism used by Jews for many centuries, mainly for religious purposes. The Western Kabbalah is a system of magic used mainly by non-Jews over the past century or so for occult purposes.</p>

<p>Neither one of them are Satanic or evil. At their center, they involve a kind of revisionist re-examination of verses in the Torah to extract a deeper mystical meaning from them.</p>

<p>There is an element of practical magic in Jewish Kabbalah, but the rabbis like to keep it under their little hats for the most part. They won&#39;t talk about it with non-Jews or with Jews who are not students of the Kabbalah. Jews doing Kabbalah do it mainly for mystical and religious reasons, and when they do it for magical reasons, they keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>Westerners, on the other hand, have integrated Kabbalah into Western occultism as a whole. Western Kabbalah is centered mainly around the ten emanations of God with which he created the world from himself in ten successive stages. These are rather rigidly codified in Western magic in a single diagram known as the Tree of Life. This diagram is derived from Jewish Kabbalah, but it has been transformed into something in Western magic that traditional Jewish Kabbalists would not recognize as valid.</p>

<p>But, you&#39;d find better info at <a href="/r/occult">/r/occult</a> than here, most people here simply don&#39;t know about it or assume it&#39;s satanic which is actually hilarious if you understand how it works.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ritualistic magic along the same vein as freemasonry. Go over to <a href="/r/occult">/r/occult</a> and ask them.</p>

<p>There are also a collection of various mystical practices whose intention is the same.</p>

Beyond that its a ritual based system created by the same people who killed the prophets and crucified Yahshua. Beyond that Yahweh has already shown explained the mysteries Romans 1:19-21, All that which may be known of Yahweh for his supernal nature to his eternal Glory, has been made manifest within them, so that man is without excuse. Interesting to note also Yahshua told them himself and who he told this to is important because he was speaking to kaballists &quot;You search the scriptures and think yee have found life but you know not the scriptures speak of me&quot;.
