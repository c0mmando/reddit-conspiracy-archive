       I think I'll start some "know your enemy" research, so I decided to study myself some kaballah. It looks very interesting, since it evolves math, which I think is the language of nature. Someone know some good links in that field for beginners? Or do you simple dismiss it as a satanic thing?

       Save yourself a lot of confusion and get straight at the beginning the difference between what is sometimes called the Western Kabbalah, and the actual Jewish mystical Kabbalah.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish Kabbalah is a system of mysticism used by Jews for many centuries, mainly for religious purposes. The Western Kabbalah is a system of magic used mainly by non-Jews over the past century or so for occult purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither one of them are Satanic or evil. At their center, they involve a kind of revisionist re-examination of verses in the Torah to extract a deeper mystical meaning from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an element of practical magic in Jewish Kabbalah, but the rabbis like to keep it under their little hats for the most part. They won't talk about it with non-Jews or with Jews who are not students of the Kabbalah. Jews doing Kabbalah do it mainly for mystical and religious reasons, and when they do it for magical reasons, they keep quiet about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Westerners, on the other hand, have integrated Kabbalah into Western occultism as a whole. Western Kabbalah is centered mainly around the ten emanations of God with which he created the world from himself in ten successive stages. These are rather rigidly codified in Western magic in a single diagram known as the Tree of Life. This diagram is derived from Jewish Kabbalah, but it has been transformed into something in Western magic that traditional Jewish Kabbalists would not recognize as valid.

       Definitely not a "satanic thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you'd find better info at
       <a href="/r/occult">
        /r/occult
       </a>
       than here, most people here simply don't know about it or assume it's satanic which is actually hilarious if you understand how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ritualistic magic along the same vein as freemasonry. Go over to
       <a href="/r/occult">
        /r/occult
       </a>
       and ask them.

       There is literally a body of ritual magic whose purpose is communication with the angels, and ultimately, god.
      </p>
      <p>
       This exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also a collection of various mystical practices whose intention is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case we are talking about rituals whose purpose is  not personal power, but what is considered personal salvation.

       Yep and there some startling implications. For one, it's almost certain that there was at least one civilization more advanced than us many thousand years ago. And that TPTB have kept this advanced knowledge to themselves all this time, using it to their advantage.

       It's basically the same principle most people cannot accept or understand and that is we are god or source or all that is or eternal being incarnating on this planet. It is intentionally misleading and complex. The concept even understood intellectually is pointless unless you have an experience that provides "proof", deep meditation, near death experience, DMT, ETC...

       A "friend of a friend of mine" have done DMT. It's a really changing experience, you kind of experience another realm of reality. But "he" said he don't consider it as a proof of the existence of God. The experience is very real, but some dreams are very real too, so... anyway, "he" recommends it a try for anyone seeking some truth, since you really feels as there is something more than this physical realm, and this feeling is worthy itself.

       Yeah, that is some plausible theory, but a hard one to prove by scientific methods. But I guess sometimes we have to believe in ours guesses and experiences, because science don't reach all the areas of knowledge we have.

       It's noteworthy to have mentioned that I have watched many NDE-ERS and the experience was parallel in many ways. I knew everything yet that was not as miraculous as a being of my power that could project him or herself to a finite flawed human being for the experience of limitation.

       There's nothing inherently Satanic about the Kabbalah. It's a Jewish form of Mysticism, that has exerted (varying degrees of) influence over magick and esotericism over the centuries, perhaps millennia.

       In some ancient languages the letters also double as numbers, notably greek and hebrew, among others.

       Its a ritual based system, which in this dispinsation all ritual based systems are carnal spirituality which is AntiYahshuan. Beyond that its a ritual based system created by the same people who killed the prophets and crucified Yahshua. Beyond that Yahweh has already shown explained the mysteries Romans 1:19-21, All that which may be known of Yahweh for his supernal nature to his eternal Glory, has been made manifest within them, so that man is without excuse. Interesting to note also Yahshua told them himself and who he told this to is important because he was speaking to kaballists "You search the scriptures and think yee have found life but you know not the scriptures speak of me". If someone's  going to argue the point, bring up spiritual points not carnal understanding, this is a spiritual subject.
