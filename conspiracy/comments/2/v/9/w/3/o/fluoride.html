        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Frederick McKay observed dental deformities in the Colorado Springs area as early as 1901 – teeth badly stained and in some cases brown and pitted. </p>

<p>Although initially resistant to decay, as children grew up into adults, their teeth grew increasingly damaged and unattractive. Dr. McKay sought to find out why this might be. Yet it was not until 1930 that he found out the cause.  </p>

<p>Mottled teeth were also observed in Bauxite, Ark., a mining town where the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) had set up shop. In 1930, a chemist with ALCOA determined that the water was contaminated with fluoride. When McKay learned about the analysis, he sent water samples to ALCOA’s chemist. Thus McKay finally learned that mottled teeth were the result of fluoride in the water. Bauxite abandoned its fluoride contaminated water supply, and piped in an alternate source.  </p>

<p>Between 1921 and 1932, Andrew Mellon, founder of ALCOA, served as Secretary of the Treasury. At this time, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) was under the control of the Treasury department, therefore under the control of Andrew Mellon.  </p>

<p>Also at that time, ALCOA and other industrial polluters were facing multi-million dollar lawsuits for fluoride waste contamination of crops, livestock and humans. To find a way to get rid of the mounting piles of fluoride waste, scientific research got turned over to the Mellon Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew Mellon, also founder of the fluoride polluting ALCOA, and now in charge of the USPHS.  </p>

<p>In 1939, Gerald Cox, an ALCOA-funded chemist with ALCOA’s Mellon Institute, announced that fluoride was good for teeth, thus spinning ALCOA’s greatest liability into an asset within the blink of an eye and no legitimate research.   </p>

<p>The conclusion that fluorotic teeth resisted cavities was never scientifically established, and the reality that hard water also contains calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and boron, which actually do build good teeth, was not only just dismissed, but totally ignored, swept under the rug.  </p>

<p>From 1947 to 1952, attorney Oscar Ewing served as head of the Federal Security Agency, which by now held jurisdiction over the USPHS. Mr. Ewing had just previously received a $750,000 a year salary representing ALCOA. By 1950, Mr. Ewing authorized fluoridation for the entire nation. ALCOA started selling its fluoride waste for public water supplies. Fluoride waste had previously been useful only as a rat and insect poison.  </p>

<p>At taxpayer expense, Mr. Ewing hired Edward Bernays to sell the concept of adding fluoride to public water supplies. 
Up until this time, everyone with a lick of sense knew fluoride was poison and to be avoided. Mr. Bernays had previously been employed as a public relations consultant for – you guessed it – ALCOA.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, e-cigs are progress. Frankly I think if we could grow our own tobacco without all the shit they put into it, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing. They put so many chemicals in it, it&#39;s sickening. I went from rolling my own to buying mass produced, there is a difference. Rolling your own is a pain in the ass, and you cannot grow your own unless you want a visit from ATF. Sick, sad world we live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I get a source on it being illegal to grow tobacco? </p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve seen says it&#39;s legal in the US: t16: <a href="http://www.ttb.gov/tobacco/tobacco-faqs.shtml#t16">http://www.ttb.gov/tobacco/tobacco-faqs.shtml#t16</a> </p>

<p>Maybe it depends on the state, but from what I read it only sounds  illegal to sell homegrown without a permit. </p>
