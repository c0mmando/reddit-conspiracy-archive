I&#39;ve spent most of the day roaming youtube watching random ufo and other such videos. I couldn&#39;t help but notice that a lot of these people trying to explain what is going on keep quoting from random bible passages.  This seems totally bizarre to me seeing as the bible, in my opinion, has been pretty well debunked and is just a work of fiction.  So why do people keep turning to it to try and explain what can be explain as bunk (in the case of the obviously fake videos), or genuine sightings.  I feel like i am spouting nonsense, but i hope this sub can answer my question.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of Biblical apologists use the historical basis of the stories to point to archeological findings, even if there are clear scientific explanations and no need to run to the supernatural explanations accepted by Christians. Yes, a lot of the Biblical stories are rooted in history, as they are a telling of the history of a culture. Unfortunately, a good majority of Americans-and Christians all over the globe-accept the supernatural explanations given by a nomadic, superstitious, Bronze Age culture. It&#39;s very telling of the kinds of people you&#39;re dealing with when you get into these kinds of debates. In a Bronze Age word: nimrods.</p>

Prior to Egypt was the Sumerians, in which 1 Egyptian pharoh, got the idea of monotheism. He learned it from the Zorostrians, and it never took hold in Egypt. The Greeks then expand the Egyptian polytheistic gods, which the Romans later expanded. Then a Jew go the idea from the Zorostrians of a monotheistic god, spread it which became Judaism which split into Christianity with a man name Jesus who was the

<p>Religion has been around for man years longer than christianity.  Christianity is also a bastardization of many of the other powerful religions at the time.  Thinks like easter and christmas evolved out of the spring and winter solstices.  easter even stole the symbolism from Beltane, hence the rabbits and eggs.  both are symbols of fertility as Beltane is a &quot;holiday&quot; of a new world reawakening from the slumber of winter.  I could go on and on disproving the bible as original, or you can look it up yourself.  either way, the bible, or any religious text especially from christianity, will ever be able to properly explain the extra terrestrial or otherworldly happening that probably occur every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheist, here, who views the contents of the Tanakh as a mixture of history, instruction, allegory and parable. So while I don&#39;t have a literal reading of Ezekiel, I understand and appreciate the story of this prophet through its own cultural and religious lens... and he was decidedly NOT part of a ufo cult. Ezekiel&#39;s vision occurred after Nebuchadnezzer took Jerusalem, while he - the son of a priest and as such a former member of the upper class - was in exile. The Lord appeared to Ezekiel during this ordeal, revealed to him the glorious creatures of heaven and the throne, and made Ezekiel His prophet. &quot;And He said to me; &quot;Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, which rebelled against Me; they and their fathers rebelled against Me to this very day.&quot; The visions and prophecies he received make perfect sense in light of the recently conquered - it both explains the ordeal (punishment for not obeying God), assures him of justice and order (judgement against rebellers and other nations) and promises eventual deliverance (restoration of the temple and success of Israel). And if we want to get cynical about it, it also establishes some authority for a member of the upper class, which he might have felt a wee bit entitled to (just sayin&#39;). That&#39;s a great deal better than &quot;fuck it, there is no God, Jerusalem is lost, the Babylonians are in charge, life is random chaos, and we&#39;re screwed&quot;. </p>

<p>Now, what the hell do Martians have to do with any of that???</p>

<p>Look, absolutely <em>anything</em> can scream &quot;aliens!&quot; if you put a template of preconceived notions over it and then view it through ufo goggles. Likewise you could make a case for Ezekiel being mentally ill if you view the story through the lens of modern psychiatry. Or maybe Ezekiel ingested some hallucinogens. Or maybe he was visited by the Fairy King. Or maybe he was a flim-flam man who made it all up for personal gain. Or maybe, just maybe, we can refrain from co-opting someone else&#39;s religion and history in order to play around with a self-serving, SyFy-ready exegesis. </p>

<p>Do we have any Jewish scholars here who would care to weigh in?</p>

<p>If I weren&#39;t inclined to consider these texts largely (if not entirely) allegorical in nature, I would say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel">Ezekel</a>&#39;s account of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub">cherubim</a> and their &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub#mediaviewer/File:Ezekiel%27s_vision.jpg">chariot</a>&quot; would pique my interest.</p>

<p>Atheist, here, who views the contents of the Tanakh as a mixture of history, instruction, allegory and parable. So while I don&#39;t have a literal reading of Ezekiel, I understand and appreciate the story of this prophet through its own cultural and religious lens... and he was decidedly NOT part of a ufo cult. Ezekiel&#39;s vision occurred after Nebuchadnezzer took Jerusalem, while he - the son of a priest and as such a former member of the upper class - was in exile. The Lord appeared to Ezekiel during this ordeal, revealed to him the glorious creatures of heaven and the throne, and made Ezekiel His prophet. &quot;And He said to me; &quot;Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, which rebelled against Me; they and their fathers rebelled against Me to this very day.&quot; The visions and prophecies he received make perfect sense in light of the recently conquered - it both explains the ordeal (punishment for not obeying God), assures him of justice and order (judgement against rebellers and other nations) and promises eventual deliverance (restoration of the temple and success of Israel). And if we want to get cynical about it, it also establishes some authority for a member of the upper class, which he might have felt a wee bit entitled to (just sayin&#39;). That&#39;s a great deal better than &quot;fuck it, there is no God, Jerusalem is lost, the Babylonians are in charge, life is random chaos, and we&#39;re screwed&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually inclined agree with the first portion of your analysis, hence one of the many reasons I consider these texts to be <em>allegorical</em>, social commentary and social engineering in the form of myth and parable. </p>

<p>Now, what the hell do Martians have to do with any of that???</p>

<p>Look, absolutely anything can scream &quot;aliens!&quot; if you put a template of preconceived notions over it and then view it through ufo goggles. Likewise you could make a case for Ezekiel being mentally ill if you view the story through the lens of modern psychiatry. Or maybe Ezekiel ingested some hallucinogens. Or maybe he was visited by the Fairy King. Or maybe he was a flim-flam man who made it all up for personal gain. Or maybe, just maybe, we can refrain from co-opting someone else&#39;s religion and history in order to play around with a self-serving, SyFy-ready exegesis.</p>

<p>Do we have any Jewish scholars here who would care to weigh in?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to be facetious, hostile and passive aggressive in your misinterpreting the intent of my original, largely candid remark..</p>

<p>The point was, in response to OP&#39;s question, if one were to take the depiction of Ezekiel&#39;s &#39;vision&#39; as a literal occurrence (which I do not), a theologian or mystic would interpret this as being some sort of supernatural event, that these were literally multi-headed &#39;angels&#39;, which is moderately interesting considering this &#39;vision&#39; had served as a key source of inspiration for the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism">Merkabah</a>, an early form of Jewish mysticism pre-dating the Kabbalah. </p>

<p>On the other hand, as OP had asked about &quot;UFOs&quot; and how they could relate to accounts in the Bible, Ezekiel&#39;s vision of the mult-headed cherubim arriving in a four-wheeled &quot;chariot&quot; came to mind, being vaguely similar to what some would interpret as a &quot;UFO&quot; or &quot;aliens&quot;. I do not happen to subscribe to that particular theory, however am aware it exists and had felt it was worth mentioning in response to OP&#39;s initial inquiry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to back this up a minute - I am sorry if my post came across as being hostile to you or your comment. I took it at face value, and in the spirit you intended. My comments regarding the specious and frankly exploitative (imo) attempts to co-opt Ezekiel&#39;s vision to fit the UFO agenda were aimed directly at those who attempt to do so... for that, I should have been more clear.</p>

<p>I agree that theologians (or mystics) would and do view this incident as supernatural - specifically, the Lord revealing himself to Ezekiel. Which is about as supernatural as it gets, really. </p>

<p>The descriptions of the cherubim are fascinating. The problem (imo) with people interpreting this as an example of aliens in the Bible is that what Ezekiel described was decidedly chariot-like, as in, the technology of his time. Why would aliens - advanced enough to travel through space and visit our humble rock - not have their own technology? And why would they take the form of a lion and other animals? Surely we don&#39;t think there are lions in outer space. And then there is the question of why aliens would bother to come all this way to discuss the fate of Israel and her people. What is described by Ezekiel is very much specific to a man of his time - the politics, the religion, the culture - not an alien event.  </p>

<p>UFO believers tend to completely rework what is written to make it sound like a UFO. The chariot wheels must have been turned on their side, not vertical, which is more like a flying saucer. The animals Ezekiel saw were really something else but he just didn&#39;t know what words to use. The tempest preceding the Lord was actually UFO engines. That&#39;s what I mean about &quot;ufo goggles&quot;. Ezekiel&#39;s vision could mean absolutely anything if one just makes stuff up to fit it, and so far as I&#39;ve seen that is exactly what happens when people point to UFO &quot;examples&quot; in the Bible. </p>
