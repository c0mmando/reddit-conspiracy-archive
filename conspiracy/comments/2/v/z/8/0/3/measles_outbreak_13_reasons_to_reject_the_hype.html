        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/measles-outbreak-13-reasons-to-reject-the-hype/">From Jon Rappoport:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hype a war, sell an invasion.</p>

<p>Hype a disease, sell a vaccine.</p>

<p>That’s the business model. Make no mistake about it.</p>

<p>And at the criminal liar’s club called the US Centers for Disease Control, men and women are working that business model every day.</p>

<p>Here are 13 reasons to reject the current hype about the “measles outbreak.”</p>

<p>One: Above and beyond all other reasons is the CDC’s track record of lying. There is no reason to believe anything they say or publish. And I mean anything.</p>

<p>For example, during the so-called Swine Flu epidemic of 2009, as Sharyl Attkisson reported for CBS News (10/21), <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/exclusive-an-interview-with-investigative-reporter-sharyl-attkisson/">the CDC stopped counting Swine Flu cases in America.</a></p>

<p>Stopped. Counting.</p>

<p>The real reason, as Attkisson discovered? Almost all the blood samples from likely Swine Flu patients in America, when sent to testing labs, showed no sign of Swine Flu or any flu.</p>

<p>For anyone who could see, the CDC was exposed as a complete and utter fraud. They were hyping the danger of the “epidemic” and the need for people to take the vaccine, based on zero evidence that there was an epidemic.</p>

<p>Then, WebMD reported on November 12, 2009 <a href="http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20091112/over-22-million-in-us-had-h1n1-swine-flu">(“22 million cases of Swine Flu in US,” by Daniel J. DeNoon):</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Shockingly, 14 million to 34 million U.S. residents — the CDC’s best guess is 22 million — came down with H1N1 swine flu by Oct. 17, the six-month anniversary of the beginning of the pandemic.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CDC had plunged ahead and estimated there had been 22 MILLION cases of Swine Flu in America. Almost no evidence for any cases of Swine Flu=22 MILLION CASES.</p>

<p>Yes. It sounds impossible, but it happened.</p>

<p>You have to understand that the CDC is THE US reporting agency on numbers of cases and types of cases of disease.</p>

<p>So…believing anything the CDC says now about the “measles outbreak” is like believing someone who wants to sell you condos on the dark side of the moon.</p>

<p>Two: The CDC is in the business of promoting vaccines. That’s how you make sense of such egregious lying. But that’s not all. The CDC’s budget includes huge money for the purchase of vaccines.</p>

<p>Here, from the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2015-hhs-budget-in-brief/hhs-fy2015budget-in-brief-cdc.html">“HHS 2015 Budget in Brief—CDC Budget Overview,”</a> we have this statement:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“CDC’s $4.8 billion immunization program has two components: the mandatory Vaccines for Children (VFC) program and the discretionary Section 317 program…In FY 2015, the Section 317 Immunization Program will continue to provide federally purchased vaccines to protect uninsured Americans from preventable diseases…CDC will work to…purchase and deliver vaccine for at-risk populations…”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy tons of vaccines, the business model dictates you promote fear about the need for the vaccines; you promote “outbreaks” and “epidemics.” It’s just business, not science, not truth.</p>

<p>Speaking of science, the CDC is also a research center, where many studies on vaccine safety and efficacy are conducted.</p>

<p>Do you expect that, while spending billions on the purchase of vaccines, the CDC will permit the publication of studies that conclude any of those vaccines (such as the measles vaccine) are unsafe and ineffective? Are you kidding?</p>

<p>Three: Regarding the current measles “outbreak” (a mere purported 150 cases, no deaths), where is the ironclad evidence that cases in more than a dozen states all stemmed from Disneyland—as opposed to occurring naturally in separate areas of the country?</p>

<p>Four: Where is the evidence that the current 150 cases of measles sprang from the natural wild measles virus, as opposed to the measles virus contained in the vaccine? Vaccinated children can shed and spread the measles virus in the vaccine to others.</p>

<p>Five: Among the potential adverse reactions to the measles vaccine is measles. Where is the proof that this has not happened?</p>

<p>Six: Where is the proof that the 150 cases of measles are all actually measles? For instance, conventional research indicates that an adenovirus (not the measles virus) can create the symptoms of measles.</p>

<p>Seven: Where are the lab tests (and which tests did they use?) to confirm that all the 150 current cases of measles are actually measles?</p>

<p>Eight: Children receive the measles vaccine as part of the MMR vaccine. As I’ve reported many times, there is a major scandal being covered up at the CDC regarding that vaccine.</p>

<p>CDC whistleblower, William Thompson, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-big-one-cdc-whistleblower-goes-public-now/">went public on August 27, 2014,</a> in a written statement released through his whistleblower attorney, Rick Morgan.</p>

<p>Thompson, a long-time researcher at the CDC, confessed that he and his colleagues, Coleen Boyle and Frank DeStefano, omitted vital data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">an MMR-autism study in 2004.</a></p>

<p>Omitting the damning data allowed the study, published in the journal Pediatrics, to conclude there was no connection between the MMR and autism—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128611/">when there was a connection.</a></p>

<p>Nine: In 2014, 644 cases of measles were reported in the US. Where is the proof that these cases occurred in unvaccinated children?</p>

<p>Ten: It’s clear in the case of the measles vaccine (and every vaccine) that proper standards of informed consent are being violated every day in the US. Doctors are not telling the parents of children about risks associated with the measles vaccine or about toxic substances contained in the vaccine. This violation is a crime.</p>

<p>Eleven: Most cases of measles are mild. Children recover without treatment. I see no studies analyzing the comparative nutritional levels of children who have mild vs. more serious cases of measles. This is an obvious area for analysis.</p>

<p>However, if the results showed that children with good nutrition tend to have milder measles, then the method of prevention would be obvious. Obvious and non-medical. Non-profit-making.</p>

<p>Twelve: What is in MMR vaccines? Aside from the measles/mumps/rubella viruses, the two current MMR vaccines contain a number of items, according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf">CDC’s Vaccine Excipient &amp; Media Summary.</a> (pdf)</p>

<p>You can look up the meanings of these items at <a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/">vaccines.procon.org</a> and other sites. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, <a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206">as you read the list,</a> that these substances are injected into the bodies of children, thus bypassing several ordinary portals of immune-defense.</p>

<p>Or to put it another way, imagine a doctor telling a mother: “I want to inject a whole list of chemical and biological substances into your young child. You don’t mind, do you?”</p>

<p>The MMR vaccine ingredients/excipients: MSG, formaldehyde, neomycin, sorbitol, chick embryo cell culture, WI-38 human lung fibroblasts, sucrose, bovine calf serum, recombinant human albumin, hydrolyzed gelatin, MRC-5 cells, Medium 199, Minimum Essential Medium, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium bicarbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate dibasic.</p>

<p>Thirteen: Back to the CDC’s history of lying about disease, in order to promote vaccines.</p>

<p>In March 2006, Harper’s published a stunning article by Peter Doshi: “Viral Marketing; The Selling of the Flu Vaccine.” Author Doshi discussed a key presentation at the 2004 National Influenza Vaccine Summit, where speaker and CDC flack, Glen Nowak, <a href="http://www.iom.edu/%7E/media/Files/Activity%20Files/PublicHealth/MicrobialThreats/Nowak.pdf">outlined a recipe for promoting vaccines to the public:</a> (pdf)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;One: Sell the idea that the flu can “occur among people for whom influenza is not generally perceived to cause serious complications (e.g., children, healthy adults, healthy seniors).”&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Translation: expand the target market for the flu vaccine—pretend that the people who would never need protection from the flu do need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Two: “Foster the demand for flu vaccinations” by bringing on board “medical experts and public health authorities publicly (e.g., via media) [to] state concern and alarm (and predict dire [flu] outcomes)—and urge influenza vaccination.”</p>

<p>Three: Make sure we are “framing…the flu season in terms that motivate behavior (e.g., as [flu is] ‘very severe,’ ‘more severe than last or past years,’ ‘deadly’).”</p>

<p>Four: Release continuing updates “from health officials and media” to emphasize that “influenza is causing severe illness and/or affecting lots of people–—helping foster the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza.”</p>

<p>Five: Present “visible/tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness (e.g., pictures of children, families of those affected coming forward) and people getting vaccinated (the first to motivate, the latter to reinforce).”&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CDC PR flack Nowak, on National Public Radio, explained the real crisis at the CDC by referring to the CDC’s client—every PR firm has a client for whom they work: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“…the manufacturers were telling us that they weren’t receiving a lot of orders for vaccine for use in November or even December…It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, sure. That’s the job. That’s what PR firms do.</p>

<p>And when the CDC has billions of dollars to promote their messages and “do research” that confirms those messages, they’re in the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>Just in case you think the CDC is engaging in good work by promoting flu-fear, because the flu really is a highly dangerous disease in the US…and “PR hype is a necessary strategy in this modern age”…</p>

<p>The CDC employs straight PR lies <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/welcome-to-the-medical-matrix-the-flu-isnt-the-flu/">when it counts the number of flu deaths every year in the US.</a> Even in its statistical tables, the CDC is carrying out sheer fraud.</p>

<p>Nowak didn’t mention that during his dog and pony show at the Vaccine Summit. It would have exposed the whole game.</p>

<p>Some years ago, when I was writing about the flu at nomorefakenews, I received emails from Peter Doshi and Martin Maloney. They fed me data from the CDC’s own charts detailing flu deaths in the US. And they pointed out the lies.</p>

<p>Doshi went on to write an analysis for the journal BMJ Online — <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7529/1412">“Are US flu death figures more PR than science?”</a> (December 2005). Here is a key quote from his report:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“[According to CDC statistics], ‘influenza and pneumonia’ took 62,034 lives in 2001—61,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might want to chew on that sentence for a while. Only 18 confirmed cases of the flu in a year in the US.</p>

<p>Talk about egregious hype, in order to sell a vaccine.</p>

<p>Believe the CDC?</p>

<p>Believe serial liars?</p>

<p>When selling fear doesn’t convince enough of the population to obey, the next step is selling the fear along with calls for mandatory obedience, by law, by force. </p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening now. Forced poisoning of babies, children, the whole population. </p>

<p>Seven: Where are the lab tests (and which tests did they use?) to confirm that all the 150 current cases of measles are actually measles?</p>

<p>And:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The former must be done, for any outbreak for any disease, before any credibility can be lent towards the remedies of such outbreaks. Then, the latter must be analyzed to figure out whether it is worth creating a vaccine or other remedy. </p>

<p>I dislike it when someone calls me an &quot;antivaxxer&quot;, just because i want the CDC to actually do their fucking job and be honest at the same time. They always say shit like &quot;the CDC and the experts know more than you&quot;, or the infamous and slightly sickening &quot;think of the children.&quot; Yea thats all fine and well, bit when we show that the CDC is less trustworthy than whst most realize, we get shot down. When we question the irresponsible manner in which the CDC conducts research, studies, and manufactures their shit, we get shot down. When we question the CDCs math because it doesnt add up, we get shot down.. when we give them the benefit of the doubt, and merely ask that we are shown the actual evidence for their decisions?? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>I like it best, how another user here put it. He said its not about vaccinations at all. Its about our ability to make our medical decisions on our own...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, i wouldnt have an issue with vaccines if the Pharmaceutical Companies were more forthright with information, and more honest in their studies, research, and tactics, and actually cared about people instead of worrying about their billions upon billions of profit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The decision you make about it affects other people around you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true on the individual level. But what is more important is that it is also true at the corporate level as well. The decisions that those Pharmaceutical Companies make, those affect <em>millions</em> more people than i ever could. Yet we target the individual? </p>

<p>The bottom line is, mandating vaccines is not the answer. They would have much more success in maintaining the general welfare of the populace if they won the Peoples trust through honest actions and open discourse. If the pharmaceutical companies can win back the trust they lost, i would bet most people would get vaccines. But the problem is thst some people dont trust the phsrmaceutical companies, and now thry are becoming pariahs because they dont wish to pay into a dishonest and immoral system thst cloaks itself behind false benevolence and hypocritically shouts trite arguments instead of fixing the root of the problem.</p>

<p>The problem is much bigger than just you or me. Its bigger than &quot;it affects others around you&quot; as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1: &quot;The CDC is lying&quot;
<a href="http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2013/03/457-sharyl-attkisson.html">http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2013/03/457-sharyl-attkisson.html</a></p>

<p>Here is Sharyl&#39;s report on the number of swine flu cases in 2009.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The ramifications of this finding are important. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Britain&#39;s National Health Service, once you have H1N1 flu, you&#39;re immune from future outbreaks of the same virus. Those who think they&#39;ve had H1N1 flu -- but haven&#39;t -- might mistakenly presume they&#39;re immune. As a result, they might skip taking a vaccine that could help them, and expose themselves to others with H1N1 flu under the mistaken belief they won&#39;t catch it. Parents might not keep sick children home from school, mistakenly believing they&#39;ve already had H1N1 flu.&quot;</p>

<p>It looks to me like the CDC were counting the cases and showed their method of doing so: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_October_17.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_October_17.htm</a></p>

<p>I googled &quot;cdc lying&quot; and the only other things I can come up with was about Dr. Gil Mobley <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/10/05/nr-intv-dr-mobley-hazmat-suit-at-airport-ebola.cnn">http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2014/10/05/nr-intv-dr-mobley-hazmat-suit-at-airport-ebola.cnn</a> and naturalnews.com. Are there any other unbiased sources for this?</p>

<p>2: Personal Opinion: Considering vaccines are important to people&#39;s health I can understand why they would want to get them to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>3: Best I can find is <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Measles.aspx">http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Measles.aspx</a> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/multi-state-outbreak.html">http://www.cdc.gov/measles/multi-state-outbreak.html</a> Can you explain why this question matters though?</p>

<p>4:Do you have unbiased proof (not naturalnews.com or infowars etc.) that vaccinated people can &quot;shed and spread&quot; the virus from the vaccine? I&#39;ve never heard of this and I can&#39;t find anything else about it.</p>

<p>5:<a href="http://www.immunize.org/vis/mmr.pdf">http://www.immunize.org/vis/mmr.pdf</a> Proving something has never happened could be difficult if it has never happened right? Looks like the biggest fear is an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>6 and 7: Same question basically...<a href="http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2015/01/disneyland-measles-outbreak-is-due-to.html">http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2015/01/disneyland-measles-outbreak-is-due-to.html</a>
&quot;Measles genotype information was available from 9 measles cases; all were genotype B3 and all sequences linked to this outbreak are identical. The sequences are also identical to the genotype B3 virus that caused a large outbreak in the Philippines in 2014. During the last 6 months, identical genotype B3 viruses were also detected in at least 14 countries and at least 6 U.S. states, not including those linked to the current outbreak.&quot;</p>

<p>9: Some of them were vaccinated but there may be an explanation for that... <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/measles-648979-vaccine-percent.html">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/measles-648979-vaccine-percent.html</a></p>

<p>10: As listed above the biggest threats are allergic reactions.</p>

<p>11: <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/measles/page3_em.htm">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/measles/page3_em.htm</a>
&quot;Although red measles is often a mild disease, a few serious complications may occur. Red measles makes people more vulnerable to pneumonia and bacterial ear infections. Pneumonia as a complication of measles is especially serious in infants and is responsible for most deaths in this age group. Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) occurs about once in every thousand cases of measles and is a serious complication that can be fatal.&quot;</p>

<p>12: This page is pretty informative about the ingredients <a href="http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients">http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients</a> and also may want to look at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm</a>.</p>

<p>13: Personal opinion: The CDC are trying to raise health awareness within the public for their safety and need to get the message out somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No kidding. Some people have weak immune systems already, and something as &quot;innocuous&quot; (as he makes it sound) as measles can be fatal. Why should we be bringing back diseases that we have all but eradicated? I absolutely do not see the benefit to avoiding vaccination. People will <em>die</em> from the diseases that resurface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason that measles wasn&#39;t a huge problem for decades, based off the information available, a reasonable adult can only surmise that it was because of vaccines. This line of thinking also brings up the fact the rising number of measles and other treatable cases coincides with the decrease in vaccination. </p>

<p>Also what infuriates me is these same people blame other entities for the &quot;under mining&quot; of America when, again any reasonable and sound person can clearly see, that they are doing way more damage to society as a whole and pin the actions and consequences onto others. </p>
