        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-02-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RedditRevisionist.html">RedditRevisionist</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Not a single document has ever been found which even refers to an extermination program.</strong> </p>

<p>To the contrary, the German documents show that the &quot;final solution&quot; meant removing the Jews from Europe -- by emigration if possible and by deportation if necessary.</p>

<p>The German &quot;final solution&quot; policy is clearly explained in three important German documents. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first is the letter from Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to SS security chief Reinhard Heydrich of July 31, 1941, which orders measures for &quot;the intended final solution of the Jewish question.&quot; As I pointed out, the document specifically confirms that the German policy was <strong>&quot;to solve the Jewish question by emigration and evacuation.&quot;</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The second document is the so-called &quot;Wannsee Protocol&quot; a record of the &quot;Wannsee conference&quot; of January 20, 1942, in Berlin. (Nuremberg document NG-2586-G) The document, which contains nothing about extermination, explains the policy of deporting Jews to the occupied Soviet territories in the East. &quot;The emigration program has now been replaced by the evacuation of the Jews to the East as a further solution possibility, in accordance with previous authorization by the Führer,&quot; it notes. The document refers to the eventual &quot;freeing&quot; or &quot;liberation&quot; of the Jews (&quot;bei Freilassung&quot; in German), which implicitly confirms the intention of the German government to free the Jews after the war. Interestingly, these words were deleted from the English-language translation published in the official &quot;green series&quot; record of Nuremberg documents issued by the U;S. government (NMT &quot;green series,&quot; vol. 13, p. 213) The &quot;Wannsee Protocol&quot; also states that elderly German Jews and Jews who had served honorably during the First World War would not be deported to the East, but would instead be housed in the special Theresienstadt ghetto in Bohemia.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the German Foreign Office memorandum of August 21, 1942, explains Germany&#39;s wartime policy towards the Jews in clear and unmistakable language. (Nuremberg document NG2586-J.) It was written by Martin Luther, who represented the German Foreign Office at the Wannsee conference. &quot;The present war gives Germany the opportunity and also the duty of solving the Jewish problem in Europe,&quot; it notes, and refers specifically to the &quot;territorial final solution.&quot; The policy <strong>&quot;to promote the evacuation of the Jews</strong> [from Europe] in closest cooperation with the agencies of the ReichsFührer SS [Himmler] is still in force.&quot; The memo mentions that, unfortunately, &quot;the number of Jews deported in this way to the East did not suffice to cover the labor needs.&quot;
The document quotes German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop as saying that &quot;at the end of this war, all Jews would have to leave Europe. This was an unalterable decision of the Führer [Hitler] and also the only way to master this problem, as only a global and comprehensive solution could be applied and individual measures would not help very much.&quot; This internal memorandum concludes by saying that the &quot;deportations [of the Jews to the East] are a further step on the way of the total solution ... The deportation to the [Polish] General Government is a temporary measure. The Jews will be moved on further to the occupied [Soviet] eastern territories as soon as the technical conditions for it are given.&quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the endless amounts of eye witness accounts from people on all sides? Thoughts like this would have been a joke 20 years ago when there were still millions of survivors alive.</p>

<p>There are real, actual conspiracies in the government and all along history. This &#39;conspiracy&#39; is a red herring that was started by people who are covering up real conspiracies and is perpetuated by people who believe any sourceless information on the internet. Even though some conspiracies are real statements like this take away a persons credibility across the board. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point he&#39;s tried to make here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that this document has been used every time to confirm that the mass extermination was planned and written down. Some go as far to say its written in the document itself and that&#39;s all the proof we need.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t say anywhere that he is trying to deny it even happened, of course those people died, the bodies didn&#39;t just appear. It&#39;s their means of death that is constantly being thrown up in the air - so dismissing him over your presumption is quite ignorant on your part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh yes. Google is the bastion of truth.  I don&#39;t get my education from movies in high school.  I read books, not what my google-fu can conjure up.</p>

<p>Why so jumpy and confrontational when I asked for proof?  You don&#39;t have to &quot;educate&quot; me.  Usually when debates occur there are points and counter points.  Telling me to google it lets me know you cannot be taken seriously.  If you are so passionate about the holocaust not occurring, you should be more than able to make the points you are trying to make.</p>

<p>6 million people were exterminated. Read the Nuremberg trials.  Documentaries like Shoah, and accounts from historians.  Same way your info was gotten if you believe a word of the documents submitted above.</p>

<p>Stew in your juices and believe what you want to believe , I know I will.  Good to have that right !</p>
