by Michael Crichton | January 25, 2005
National Press Club, Washington DC – </p>

<p>Michael&#39;s detailed explanation of why he criticizes global
warming scenarios. Using published UN data, he reviews why claims for catastrophic warming
arouse doubt; why reducing CO2 is vastly more difficult than we are being told; and why we are
morally unjustified to spend vast sums on this speculative issue when around the world people
are dying of starvation and disease.</p>

<p>To be in Washington tonight reminds me that the only person to ever offer me a job in
Washington was Daniel Patrick Moynihan. That was thirty years ago, and he was working for Nixon at the time. Moynihan was a hero of mine, the exemplar of an intellectual engaged in
public policy. What I admired was that he confronted every issue according to the data and not a belief system. Moynihan could work for both Democratic and Republican presidents. He took a lot of flack for his analyses but he was more often right than wrong.
Moynihan was a Democrat, and I&#39;m a political agnostic. I was also raised in a scientific tradition that regarded politics as inferior: If you weren&#39;t bright enough to do science, you could go into politics. I retain that prejudice today. I also come from an older and tougher tradition that regards science as the business of testing theories with measured data from the outside world. Untestable hypotheses are not science but rather something else.</p>

<p>We are going to talk about the environment, so I should tell you I am the child of a mother who 60 years ago insisted on organic food, recycling, and energy efficiency long before people had terms for those ideas. She drove refrigerator salesmen mad. And over the years, I have recycled my trash, installed solar panels and low flow appliances, driven diesel cars, and used cloth diapers on my child — all approved ideas at the time.</p>

<p>I still believe that environmental awareness is desperately important. The environment is our shared life support system, it is what we pass on to the next generation, and how we act today has consequences — potentially serious consequences — for future generations. But I have also come to believe that our conventional wisdom is wrongheaded, unscientific, badly out of date, and damaging to the environment. Yellowstone National Park has raw sewage seeping out of the ground. We must be doing something wrong.</p>

<p>In my view, our approach to global warming exemplifies everything that is wrong with our approach to the environment. We are basing our decisions on speculation, not evidence. Proponents are pressing their views with more PR than scientific data. Indeed, we have allowed the whole issue to be politicized — red vs. blue, Republican vs. Democrat. This is in my view absurd. Data aren&#39;t political. Data are data. Politics leads you in the direction of a belief. Data, if you follow them, lead you to truth.22
When I was a student in the 1950s,  like many kids I noticed that Africa seemed to fit nicely into South America. Were they once connected? I asked my teacher, who said that that this apparent fit was just an accident, and the continents did not move. I had trouble with that, unaware that people had been having trouble with it ever since Francis Bacon noticed the same thing back in 1620. A German named Wegener had made a more modern case for it in 1912. But still, my teacher said no. By the time I was in college ten years later, it was recognized that continents did indeed move, and had done so for most of Earth&#39;s history. Continental drift and plate tectonics were born. The teacher was wrong.</p>

<p>Now, jump ahead to the 1970s. Gerald Ford is president, Saigon falls, Hoffa disappears, and in climate science, evidence points to catastrophic cooling and a new ice age. </p>

<p>Such fears had been building for many years. In the first Earth Day in 1970, UC Davis&#39;s Kenneth Watt said, &quot;If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder in 1990, but eleven degrees colder by the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us in an ice age.&quot; International Wildlife warned &quot;a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war&quot; as a threat to mankind. Science Digest said &quot;we must prepare for the
next ice age.&quot; The Christian Science Monitor noted that armadillos had moved out of Nebraska because it was too cold, glaciers had begun to advance, and growing seasons had shortened around the world. Newsweek reported &quot;ominous signs&quot; of a &quot;fundamental
change in the world&#39;s weather.&quot;</p>

<p>But in fact, every one of these statements was wrong. Fears of an ice age had vanished within five years, to be replaced by fears of global warming. These fears were heightened because population was exploding. By 1995, it was 5.7 billion, up 10% in the last five years. Back in the 90s, if someone said to you, &quot;This population explosion is overstated. In the next hundred years, population will actually decline.&quot; That would contradict what all the environmental groups were saying, what the UN was saying. You would regard such a statement as outrageous. More or less as you would regard a statement by someone in 2005 that global warming has been overstated.</p>

<p>But in fact, we now know that  the hypothetical person in 1995 was right. And we know that there was strong evidence that this was the case going back for twenty years. We just weren&#39;t told about that contradictory evidence, because the conventional wisdom, awesome in its power, kept it from us.</p>

<p>I mention these examples because in my experience, we all tend to put a lot of faith in science. We believe what we&#39;re told. My father suffered a life filled with margarine, before he died of a heart attack anyway. Others of us have stuffed our colons with fiber to ward off cancer, only to learn later that it was all a waste of time, and fiber. </p>

<p>When I wrote Jurassic Park, I worried that people would reject the idea of creating a dinosaur as absurd. Nobody did, not even scientists. It was reported to me that a Harvard geneticist, one of the first to read the book, slammed it shut when he finished and
announced, &quot;It can be done!&quot; Which was missing the point. Soon after, a Congressman announced he was introducing legislation to ban research leading to the creation of a dinosaur. I held my breath, but my hopes were dashed. Someone whispered in his ear that it couldn&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>But even so, the belief lingers. Reporters would ask me, &quot;When you were doing research on Jurassic Park, did you visit real biotech labs?&quot; No, I said, why would I? They didn&#39;t know how to make a dinosaur. And they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>So we all tend to give science credence, even when it is not warranted. I will show you many examples of unwarranted credence tonight. But here&#39;s an example to begin. This is the
famous Drake equation from the 1960s to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy.</p>

<p>N=N*fp ne fl fi fc fL</p>

<p>Where N is the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy; fp is the fraction with planets; ne is the number of planets per star capable of supporting life; fl is the fraction of planets wherem life evolves; fi is the fraction where intelligent life evolves; and fc is the fraction that communicates; and fL is the fraction of the planet&#39;s life during which the communicating civilizations live.
The problem with this equation is that none of the terms can be known. As a result, the Drake equation can have any value from &quot;billions and billions&quot; to zero. An expression that can mean anything means nothing. The mathematical appearance is deceptive. In scientific terms — by which I mean testable hypotheses — the Drake equation is really meaninglessness.
And here&#39;s another example. Most people just read it and nod:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, the most relevant section of this piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you&#39;re being had.
Let&#39;s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.
There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#39;s consensus, it isn&#39;t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Michael Crichton had it right about man-made global warming from day one. He knew it was a scam that preyed upon the religious fervor of unintelligent white Christians who felt guilty about being alive. The AGW movement could only have started in the West. Asians didn&#39;t have time for this nonsense, they were too busy trying to dig themselves out of poverty. Africans are too busy fighting in tribal conflicts and dying from disease. Only whites can afford the self-indulgence of beating themselves on the breast about how evil they are, and how they need to be punished for their sins with carbon taxes and higher energy costs and a more inconvenient lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been volcanic eruptions producing more greenhouse gasses in the space of a few days than humans have to date, and their affect on global  temperatures lasted about a year and really weren&#39;t all that impressive anyways. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll produce some sort of source for your claim. I unfortunately can&#39;t do the same now, as I&#39;m at work, on my phone, and almost done with my break, but I can hardly see human industrial pollution causing any recent &quot;spike&quot; in global climate change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say they last a year and aren&#39;t impressive anyway as proof against humans causing the increase, yet the increase hasn&#39;t just been a few years, about 100 years now. Also, volcanos erupt throughout history and this spike is nothing like we&#39;ve ever seen before in history (from what I can remember if the data I read some time ago) and there is a strong correlation between the industrialisation of humans and the increase of greenhouse emissions. I am on my phone so can&#39;t source properly at the minute, as you can&#39;t, but I would like to see evidence as I&#39;ve never seen anything contrary to my claims that has real evidence that is substancial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is sort of like &quot;I am not doing anything wrong, why should I mind if the Government spies on me?&quot; Most people do not understand what this will lead to...</p>

<p>The goal is simple, a world wide carbon tax. Then those who manage its (ENORMOUS) funds will be the ones with the real power. </p>

<p>&quot;What makes AGW different is that the alleged pollutant is carbon dioxide — an odorless, colorless gas that is the basis of all life and human activity.  Regulation of CO2 is the gateway for those who control government to regulate all economic and most human activity.&quot;</p>

<p>Coersion did not work. World wide communism did not work. So tell a lie so big, no one who speaks out will be taken credibly, and the will willfully come under the control of those who yell the loudest.</p>

<p>It is all about control.</p>
