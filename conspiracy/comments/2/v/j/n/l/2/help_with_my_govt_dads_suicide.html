Document: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BMez8">http://imgur.com/a/BMez8</a></p>

<p>I am trying to keep my family&#39;s identity hidden until I have found/not found evidence in regards to my fathers &quot;suicide&quot;.  I will state the facts as we found them and am hoping that others may be able to help me either prove/disprove our concerns over my fathers death.  I will provide you with what he left and not show my own research to see what others conclude.  I am just hoping for some help.</p>

<p><strong>Before the &quot;suicide&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>He had no signs of depression and had never had signs of depression.  </p></li>
<li><p>He was a government contractor and had been in that position for 30 years.</p></li>
<li><p>He had worked in Top Secret/Secret Clearance areas and could never fully say what he did.</p></li>
<li><p>The most we knew is that he was a Quality Assurance Inspector on aircraft components, he had also worked on the Hubble.</p></li>
<li><p>A few months before it happened he told my mother there were people following him and was concerned about telling her to many details regarding work.</p></li>
<li><p>He showed her a document from one of his first inspections and said there were errors on it and something was wrong with it.  She had no clue what he was referring and told him to bring it to his boss.</p></li>
<li><p>He showed his boss the document and stated his concerns and was told to shred it.</p></li>
<li><p>The company he worked for had recently hired a new individual and would not tell my father what this person was investigating, but told him not to worry and that they were all the same team.
He asked to see the individuals schedule so they could coordinate but was told there was an error with the calendar in his email and to not worry about the new person.</p></li>
<li><p>He was told he needed to fill out new Top Secret Clearance paper work even though he was retiring, and that they would have to do an intensive background check.</p></li>
<li><p>He became more concerned and mentioned it to my mother and she told him he was just being paranoid.</p></li>
<li><p>She had called me with concerns and saying that something must be going on with his work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The day of the &quot;suicide&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>He went to work as usual and told my mom he would fix the sink when he got home.</p></li>
<li><p>She was at the vets with the dog.</p></li>
<li><p>He came home a little earlier than usual and did not have has ID tag for work anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>She attempted to get a hold of him but didn&#39;t think anything of it when she didn&#39;t.</p></li>
<li><p>When she came home the car was in the driveway as usual but the back door was locked, which never happened if he was home.</p></li>
<li><p>She saw his coat thrown on the chair, which was always hung up.</p></li>
<li><p>She didn&#39;t notice him at first until she went to the cellar to do laundry.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Semi-graphic details</em>-She found him sitting upright against the wall, he had a flannel over his head and some totes had been moved so he was semi blocked.  She saw the gun (.22 rifle) next to him and blood soaking through the flannel. She didn&#39;t touch him or go near him once she saw the gun, she went straight to the neighbors and called the cops, then called me. </p></li>
<li><p>The only thing he had done was write his bosses phone number on a folder, she called his boss and said what happened and within an hour he showed up.  He took my dad&#39;s computer and files, shook my moms hand and left.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The day after</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once my family and I arrived my Mom said that he had saved that document and he said if anything happened to him she would have a copy.</p></li>
<li><p>We searched the house and finally found it, but it didn&#39;t seem too important.  It was stashed with an article about a Newark man being arrested for &quot;phantom cards&quot; going through the system at Flight Line. 
Article: <a href="http://www.fltimes.com/news/article_75471374-b35f-11e3-96db-0019bb2963f4.html">http://www.fltimes.com/news/article_75471374-b35f-11e3-96db-0019bb2963f4.html</a> 
Document: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BMez8">http://imgur.com/a/BMez8</a></p></li>
<li><p>My dad worked at Flight Line previously.</p></li>
<li><p>His original document that he had concerns with was from Flight Line.</p></li>
<li><p>He &quot;committed suicide&quot; the same day that was on the document.</p></li>
<li><p>We asked for an autopsy due to the strange circumstance -When it came back there was no evidence of anything odd (tumor, blood clot).  The bullet entered in through the mouth and did not exit so obviously it was hard to examine the brain.</p></li>
<li><p>We asked to meet with his Supervisors so that we could ask some questions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Three days after</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two of the Supervisors from his work came over.</p></li>
<li><p>We initially asked if they had seen anything out of the ordinary with my fathers behavior, which they promptly said no.</p></li>
<li><p>We asked if he had brought up any concerns to them about anything, which again they said no.</p></li>
<li><p>At that point my mother mentioned having a document that my father was told to shred, which then they changed a bit and said &quot;oh yea, that..it is nothing, we didn&#39;t want him worrying about it&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>We then asked about the new investigator and that my dad had been worried about it.  They of course said there was no investigation going on, but then managed to slip out that she was just looking into some machines at Flight Line that RFI&#39;d circuit cards (the machine that my dad had previously worked on).</p></li>
<li><p>At that point they said if we had further questions regarding his work that they would have to get a lawyer.</p></li>
<li><p>They had brought back his office items in a bin, but there were only a few things and my mom insists there were pictures and other items there that never made it back.</p></li>
<li><p>The boss stated he was unaware that my father was asked to renew his Top Secret Clearance, even though my mother even had the documentation there with the request.</p></li>
<li><p>We also found that my father had researched benefits for deaths/suicide prior to retirement for the spouse. The document was saved six days prior to his death.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the calling hours</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Only a handful of his 30 year coworkers showed up and they all moved together and stayed with the boss. They all shook our hands and said &quot;sorry for your loss&quot; and that was it.  No work stories or anything, then they left.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The aftermath</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>My mother has reached out and talked to some of the company&#39;s previous employees, two offered to help her but she has not heard from them in over six months.</p></li>
<li><p>I began research into the part numbers and manuals but was not sure what to make of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is very hard for me to look into this more, no outcome is a good outcome.  Whether he truly did kill himself out of nowhere for no reason, he killed himself worried that he would go to jail and my mom loose everything, or he was murdered.  None of these bring him back, he was suppose to be here teaching his  grand kids to fix cars and how to build electronics.  That is all we had talked about; how fun we would have when he retired.  The whole thing just feels wrong and generally a gut feeling is the right feeling.</p>

<p>Thank you to anyone who took time to read and those that may decide to help.  I will respond to messages and replies with as much information as I have.  Those that may figure out who he is please don&#39;t add his name to the post, I am truly worried about my mother losing everything and she can&#39;t afford that.</p>

<p>I hope you get some answers, can&#39;t imagine what you and your family are going through. </p>

<p>One other question you probably shouldn&#39;t answer here, but might lead you down a path that too few know about - was he recently prescribed a new medication or have a dosage change or discontinuation of a medication?</p>

<p>Good luck, sending good thoughts you and your family&#39;s way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First things first, check internet browser history... second check his phone and all electrical shit. Go into his car check the GPS see if any new addresses were inputed. If it&#39;s a new car call the manufacturer and see if you can have GPS tracker information. Call ISP for Internet stuff and call your phone provider check for new phone numbers. </p>

<p>Edit: check visa and debit card/atm uses. Check outgoing/ingoing calls... your mom should check his past health records. Check anything that is electronic and can have data on it. I know all of this is a violation of privacy, but his dad has passed so it doesn&#39;t matter. If you do find something you&#39;re not supposed to as it pertains to his relationship with your mom or family, don&#39;t bring it up and do your mom and family a favour. Bringing dirty secrets to light without your dad having a chance to explain himself is just bad. </p>

<p>Edit2: not a paranoid schizo freak. But if you&#39;re met with resistance and it&#39;s becomes sketch I recommend you stop digging around . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your comment, you thought exactly what we thought too.</p>

<p>We looked up browser history on his personal laptop, but he had a habit of clearing that.  <strong>That is though were we found that he had been looking up policies on government contractor deaths and if the spouse still receives the benefits a week prior to his death.</strong>  We checked the phone records and it was the normal numbers he called; my mom, myself, his office, my moms office, Papoe and his boss.</p>

<p>His car did not have GPS but that would have been a great idea if we could have done it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like early on in your father&#39;s career, he was told by someone above him to falsify vibration ratings, which he did. These quality assurance tests were to ensure that certain electronic products for boats and planes could withstand the inherent vibrations of those vehicles, and still function properly. Later on in his career, something must have happened, something bad, involving a plane or boat crash perhaps, which reminded him of his previous alterations. Wanting to correct that before lives were lost, he found the record he falsified, and went to his boss for help. But the boss didn&#39;t help. He said he would, and with good intentions told your father to shred the document. But the boss also went to HIS boss, who got an investigation started. This resulted in confirmation of falsified documents, which would likely make the company legally responsible. The only solution was to destroy all evidence, then get rid of your father. </p>

Also, isn&#39;t it a bit hard to commit suicide with a rifle without some obvious signs?

    <div class="md"><p>Your intuition is correct but be a good child. OP, look and see reddit and see it is corrupted. This should be on the front page but it isn&#39;t. This is because the people you are searching for are a collective mind and discredit valid information. I will say that God himself is coming soon. As for these men who are involved, FORGIVE them and WOE to them if their hearts are hard. These days are passing away and you should focus on the legacy your father has temporarily left you. See that your father was righteous and he was taken away because of that, nothing more. Be blessed and great</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you not your fathers son and then was your father a small fish like you say? No, rather you are both larger fish than the ones you swim with. </p>

<p>The discontent with your fathers moral conflict set a chain of action that involved the secrets of the government. This is his character. Rest OP. Be great and know HE IS STILL ALIVE, HE IS FINE! THIS LIFE IS PASSING AWAY.</p>

<p>The ones involved, they are discovered. The blood of your father is on their hands and with everyone who gave that order. Though they may scream &quot;OH GOD&quot; during intercourse or within arguments, they will know the name they have used.</p>

<p>There is nothing they can do to avoid death themselves and they WILL NOT run. THIS should be your closure. They will have no choice but to go before God and at that point, yeah, truly their eternal pain will be your splendor, lest repented.</p>

<p>And you? The unbeliever? Yes, down vote this AND CALL ME CRAZY - you defined coward. See the signs and the testimony of this man has shown you and HOW REAL it is. The red hot revival coming</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if God created everything and you choose not to believe his house, his word or his son, then what&#39;s that make the listener?
Eternity isn&#39;t some later time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. This is it. If you don&#39;t get here you won&#39;t get it anywhere. The experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life</p>

Good luck OP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t asked him to speak. So the ones starving, sick or can&#39;t afford help; that&#39;s their situation and that&#39;s their personal journey. If you feel so passionate about it, be the difference instead of blaming something else for it&#39;s neglect </p>

TAKE self responsibility, AND YOU? If your GOD was as bad as you proclaimed in your statement, you would have no pleasure of taste or drink but would be suffering every day with no choice but suffering</p>
