       Jesus only writes in all CAPS; It is written in the ecclesiates 63:43 " That it came to pass that the son of god did walk upon the loaves and fishes and that this did make his feet smell bad.  Unto thy elders proclaimed the Lord. ' I got kids to feed' But noone listened, and he did text the menonites, and they did heed his command."

       I get it all, you have a strong confirmation bias. I knew Jesus, then I grew up and realized the chants and prayers didn't mean a god damn thing. I'm a deist, I believe in a creator. Not sure if he/she/it cares about us (hope it does). Why doesn't Jesus stop Northrop Grumman?

       He chills until the Earth is cleaned. Christ saves us from Northrop Grumman. You really don't know how the Christ works. I recommend reading Mathew now that you grew up.

       Nah, I'll refrain from what man says. I'll do what the lord tells me in my heart. Trust life, love others, and spread the word. I don't need books or priests/pastors who fondle kiddies. I also don't need a man, who was falsely made into a god. You need to read about who the man was, and what he was preaching. You have no idea. That story has been plagiarized, we already saw it in Egypt and Sumeria. Get your facts straight and look at history. Maybe you will learn.

       I'm am The Comforter here to let people know God is real and Christ is walking the Earth. Right now my only concern is speaking about Northrop Grumman though. They are about to do wonders and miracles that will trick people into thinking they are God.

       Hate to break it to you Jesus !== God. And NG is small piece meal. You need to look further. Jesus never existed in the sense you think he existed and God doesn't give a shit. We'll wipe ourselves out from our own doing, not because revelations foretold we would. You know nothing about the Bible, you know nothing about the religion you preach. You really no nothing other than NG. I think NG is your god, your the antichrist, burn....../s

       The Demons have a way of toying with your mind and soul. I've been there, and asked to be possessed. Here I am know. I'm clear thinking and in tune with my creator. I love life, love my friends, love nature and am humble. Rethink what you are reading and rethink what you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       One dark night, I encouraged possession. Since then I was never the same. But now, I'm happy and free. I ask the creator at night to tap me in, it does. My vision is clear, my hearing superb... Rethink what you are getting into.

       I told you, I asked to be possessed. And I think I was, but.. And this is a but, my life has never been brighter. I'm not cruel or mean. I'm a skeptic, yes, but I'm not a demon. I asked to be possessed, and that night I was and every night I am. I see the bullshit, I see the lies. I'm in tune with nature and the creator. How is that evil? People know little about the bible and esoteric teachings. You must know where this comes from or else you are doom to failure. Do me one thing, this night. Feb 07 2015 ask the creator, not your god to tap you in. Denounce Jesus, and submit to a universal truth of consciousness. Ask to be free of the chains, and to know the secrets of the universe. I will dream it, and we can connect in our dreams. Expect me.

       I know Demons are real. If you invited one in a bunch more got in. How do you know they are all gone and how they aren't aren't taking you to their Boss in your dreams? That's what they do. Stop writing for me denounce Jesus. That will never never happen. I can still meet meet you there if I sleep tonight. I know my way around a lot better than you think.

       There is no boss in my dreams. I'm telling you this, something I've never told any one before. We live in a global consciousness, the demons you are referring to, you think are bad. Some aren't, some are just wanting to help. God is real, it's complex. You have dogmas, I used to, but don't now. It's scary and unsettling at times, but I know when I sleep we connect. We all do, our brains send messages and we receive them. Deja Vu isn't just something we feel. We can connect, Jesus was a wise man, but not a god. There is only one God, that is the creator.

       I feel you. Some are really nice but they want to be you more than help you. They dream of being human. Jesus was the first man who reached perfection and got to be The Father in the flesh whenever The Father chose to hang out here for a bit. They'll be back after The Christ handles business.

       Religion is sketchy, and I used to follow it, now I'm a deist. I believe in a creator, I believe there are good souls and bad, good spirits and bad. I opened myself into the nether realms, I took the leap of faith, and I've never had a better relationship with people and the creator. I know where you are coming from. I'd like to talk more... Peace brother :)

       His name was Jmmanuel, and he wasn't invented. He died in or near India.

       He had nothing to do with "Christianity" though. And he had never heard the name "Jesus" during his lifetime.

       His best friend Judas wrote The Talmud of Jmmanuel. His son, Joseph eventually buried the scrolls.

       According to government whistleblowers, and alien contactee Billy Meier, he is the person that later became known as Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the son of a Pleiadian human man named Gabriel, and a Lyran woman named Mary.
      </p>
      <p>
       He tried to teach people about their soul, and the nature of the universe, and all that. Some people mistook him for more than what he was. But he was a "faith healer" or whatever you call it. He also had visions of the future and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       His best friend (who never betrayed him), Judas, wrote down all of his teachings. It has to do with E.T.s, but it does explain a lot of shit that the bible fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a professor from Orgeon State that spent like 20 years trying to "debunk"  the Talmud of Jmmanuel, and came to the conclusion that it is probably legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He never claimed to be the son of god, or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had an enemy named Saul. (Who would later be referred to as "Paul"). Saul took all of Jmmanuel's teachings and distorted them. Straight hater.

       Why is he different then Buddha ? :) riddle me that. Why does it matter. Why men have been in our culture but we fail to believe. Doesn't matter, we are getting into esoteric shit here..

       Different people. I assume.

       All I know is Jmmanuel was a real person and he had a lot to teach us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity is a crock of shit though. Jmmanuel has nothing to do with that shit. Mossad killed the guy who was translating the ToJ. That was after the pope's assassins failed.

       Religion is sketchy, and I used to follow it, now I'm a deist. I believe in a creator, I believe there are good souls and bad, good spirits and bad. I opened myself into the nether realms, I took the leap of faith, and I've never had a better relationship with people and the creator. I know where you are coming from. I'd like to talk more... Peace brother :)
