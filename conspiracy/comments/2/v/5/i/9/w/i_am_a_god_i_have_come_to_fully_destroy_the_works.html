I don&#39;t need books or priests/pastors who fondle kiddies. I also don&#39;t need a man, who was falsely made into a god. You need to read about who the man was, and what he was preaching. You have no idea. That story has been plagiarized, we already saw it in Egypt and Sumeria. Get your facts straight and look at history. Maybe you will learn.</p>

<p>One dark night, I encouraged possession. Since then I was never the same. But now, I&#39;m happy and free. I ask the creator at night to tap me in, it does. My vision is clear, my hearing superb... Rethink what you are getting into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told you, I asked to be possessed. And I think I was, but.. And this is a but, my life has never been brighter. I&#39;m not cruel or mean. I&#39;m a skeptic, yes, but I&#39;m not a demon. I asked to be possessed, and that night I was and every night I am. I see the bullshit, I see the lies. I&#39;m in tune with nature and the creator. How is that evil? People know little about the bible and esoteric teachings. You must know where this comes from or else you are doom to failure. Do me one thing, this night. Feb 07 2015 ask the creator, not your god to tap you in. Denounce Jesus, and submit to a universal truth of consciousness. Ask to be free of the chains, and to know the secrets of the universe. I will dream it, and we can connect in our dreams. Expect me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no boss in my dreams. I&#39;m telling you this, something I&#39;ve never told any one before. We live in a global consciousness, the demons you are referring to, you think are bad. Some aren&#39;t, some are just wanting to help. God is real, it&#39;s complex. You have dogmas, I used to, but don&#39;t now. It&#39;s scary and unsettling at times, but I know when I sleep we connect. We all do, our brains send messages and we receive them. Deja Vu isn&#39;t just something we feel. We can connect, Jesus was a wise man, but not a god. There is only one God, that is the creator. </p>

<p>He had nothing to do with &quot;Christianity&quot; though. And he had never heard the name &quot;Jesus&quot; during his lifetime.</p>

<p>His best friend Judas wrote The Talmud of Jmmanuel. His son, Joseph eventually buried the scrolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to government whistleblowers, and alien contactee Billy Meier, he is the person that later became known as Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>He was the son of a Pleiadian human man named Gabriel, and a Lyran woman named Mary.</p>

<p>He tried to teach people about their soul, and the nature of the universe, and all that. Some people mistook him for more than what he was. But he was a &quot;faith healer&quot; or whatever you call it. He also had visions of the future and such.</p>

<p>His best friend (who never betrayed him), Judas, wrote down all of his teachings. It has to do with E.T.s, but it does explain a lot of shit that the bible fucked up.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a professor from Orgeon State that spent like 20 years trying to &quot;debunk&quot;  the Talmud of Jmmanuel, and came to the conclusion that it is probably legit.</p>

<p>He never claimed to be the son of god, or anything like that. </p>

<p>He had an enemy named Saul. (Who would later be referred to as &quot;Paul&quot;). Saul took all of Jmmanuel&#39;s teachings and distorted them. Straight hater.</p>

<p>You should check it out. </p>

<p>Different people. I assume.</p>

<p>All I know is Jmmanuel was a real person and he had a lot to teach us.</p>

<p>Christianity is a crock of shit though. Jmmanuel has nothing to do with that shit. Mossad killed the guy who was translating the ToJ. That was after the pope&#39;s assassins failed.</p>
