       Most people have no understanding of just how evil and psychopathic people in power are.  They crave control because they relate to the world through power, and they accomplish it in all sorts of control systems because they have no psychological barriers like a conscience to slow them down on their way to the top.  Once there they revel in their psychopathy and engage in all sorts of disgusting debauchery that would horrify the average person.  They begin pushing normal people out of the organization under them and support and advance psychopaths so that they can more easily get away with their decadence.  This continues as long as the institution exists until ALL the leaders are psychopaths and at this point they are practically unstoppable.  They absolutely revel in causing pain and suffering to others and laugh at the naivety of the majority that defer to authority.  They are very good at feigning emotion and bald faced lying to fool people.  They are cocky, arrogant, and they say all the "right" things and make you believe they are kind-hearted souls; not always, but often enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are born this way and a certain small percentage of the population have this primary psychopathy.  These are more dangerous and incorrigible than people with the other type called secondary psychopathy, which is caused by the dysfunction in the environment.  These make up a larger percentage of the population and the numbers are growing as the society declines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly suggest that people do their own research and really get a handle on how these people think, how common they are in power structures and how influential they have become,  and the colossal evil they are capable of.  You might start with this

       and this

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I also suggest the more open minded to research the illegitimacy of authority and the concepts of anarchism, if you can get passed your instilled aversion to the word "anarchy".  You might start

       The problem is that you were even "fine" with all those other things.  Wut?  Shouldn't you be pretty damn outraged too at all the other horrible things going on in the world?  And if the individuals in question are capable of doing all those other things you're "fine" with, then why is it such a huge surprise to learn suddenly that they absolutely

       when i was a child, i loved reading stories of good vs bad, light vs darkness, but i was aware that the 'adult world' regarded these dichotomies as childish, naive, fairy tales.
      </p>
      <p>
       the funny thing is, the more i grow up and explore the rabbit hole, the more i begin to feel that there really is a very real good vs bad, dark vs light battle going on. it is a spiritual battle within each and everyone of us that extends to our collective physical realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if you can find some quiet space in nature and stop your attention/consciousness from being focused on these dark things, you might get a sense of the 'peace that passeth all understanding'.
      </p>
      <p>
       (i believe) there are dark forces running this world, but as with any good fairytale, there are also the forces of the light. people who speak for truth, goodness and love. this sub is one example, edward snowden is one example. the important thing is not to 'find out' who the good guys are (although i believe there are powerful, secret organisations dedicated to the GOOD fight working behind the scenes), but to find the inner peace within yourself, and from that state of peace, fight the battle in your own corner.

       The fact that they have to hide shows how weak they really are, it's taken them hundreds... maybe thousands of years to get to where they are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the internet happened and it threatens to wake everyone up from this nightmare. Of course they had their part to play in the creation of the internet, but I think they quickly lost control of it. 9/11 seems like such a desperate act to maintain power over us, it was such a risky play. I don't believe they are in as strong of a position as people like to believe. The system only works as long as people believe in this system, and there is one independent economist I know who is predicting a "global collapse in public trust of the government". The universe wants humanity to evolve and spread across the galaxy, it's the ultimate destiny of intelligent life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who seek power do so because they are arrogant enough to believe they can control the world. They want to control the world because they are afraid, and they let their fear control them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” - Frank Herbert,

       These sick fucks are delusional and very afraid of us, and it's quite laughable from my perspective. This doesn't mean we aren't in for some rough times. We still have to be very cautious, but I believe we will come out on top of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole fear thing is one reason I don't believe David Icke is a shill, because he doesn't use fear like Alex Jones and the others. I don't believe these people know how to manipulate us with anything besides fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know for a fact there will be some dramatic events this year. I believe Fukishima is much much worse than what we're being told, and is actually a huge cover up that can't be denied much longer. This whole Ukraine deal and anti-Russian propaganda seems like another huge act of desperation to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an optimist, but that doesn't mean I still don't have a plan B.

       No.  I haven't gotten a sense of hopelessness because I understand that our being and our identity is tied to a lot more than anything that goes on in this planet alone.  Do I think what happens here sucks?  Oh yeah.  Definitely.  Do I think it's horrible?  Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a planet of deep sorrow, however, and since I'm pretty well aware of that - and have been for a long, long time - the understanding that there aren't too many areas of hope here doesn't overwhelm me too much.  I understand that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       certain areas still that one can focus on that help one still develop and learn and grow - even here in this planet  - and that helps a bit even in the context of all the horrible stuff that happens.

       And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! (‭Matthew‬ ‭18‬:‭2-7‬ KJV)

       Some of us don't like religion organized or otherwise, yet still believe that we're all connected and linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word is
       <em>
        agnostic
       </em>
       and to bible thumpers and atheists we're an equal opportunity target.
      </p>
      <p>
       TKOSM might believe in, quote chapter and verse, lean on, by faith, what was taught, ingrained, yet is still making a strident effort to convey Spirituality apart from and outside of Human conditions. TKOSM shouldn't be marginalized nor battered by use of Bible scripts anymore than one that quotes the Torah, Koran, Talmud, Bhudda or MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Myself, I couldn't make it through my day to day, not believing that I'm a spiritual being and that my time and place here matters. Was I
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       ? My parents had sex. I'm the result. What I do with my limited time matters most to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I spiritual? Yes. Do I worship a figure, text or deity? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       I plod along, make huge mistakes, give it my best and love all the best I know how. My time here is what I know, the stuff on the other side isn't relevant. I'm here now.

       That's hardly a definition. I would say we're all connected because we all came from a single cell. We all come from the same thing. Everything in existence is in this together.

       Where did the single cell come from? I personally believe this planet has been inhabited for a very, very , very long time. I believe giants and the Star Child were here for a reason. That we're not the first and we probably won't be the last.

       I also believe this planet has been inhabited for a very long time, cataclysmic events have without a doubt reset human kinds advancements before. As for other species I don't know, I don't have any proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you believe giants and the Star Child have ever existed? What is your proof?

       To say without the honeybee we will go extinct is silly. Without the honeybee we wouldn't be able to maintain such a high population, but we wouldn't go extinct. Not every source of food is effected by honeybees. It would definite devastate our current world order though.

       OP began this thread from rage about pederasts and supported the same via his religious beliefs. Yet, if I pointed out that his/her
       <em>
        Holy Book
       </em>
       or another holy book supports the use of rape and abuse of a child he/she would flip their shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen pederasts clobber threads by using religious text that sadly, fully support their positions.

       It seems to me that you're talking nonsense but I want to see if you can actually back up your claims. If you don't wish to try to prove anything to me then don't reply, I'm starting to think something is wrong with you.

       Your creation was more spiritual and intentional then the ovulation cycle of your mother and the virility of your father.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see you used the word worship, almost derogatorily, then talk about walking without direction. If you drop the rebellion against what ever rules or judgemental deity you've come to resent, you'd see that parables, church teachings, etc are guidelines for progress and the fulfillment of your soul. Sin doesn't exist as a leverage system for a vengeful god to play out his punishments, it's the separation of your actions from the truth of your soul. Sin hurts you or others, so that's why it's advised against.

       As I said in another thread, thank you for your prayers/supplication for my family, for me.

       Am I spiritual? Yes. Do I worship a figure, text or deity? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm spiritual right where I am in the moment. Guess I also worship more than you might know. No building is required. I make mistakes and I make amends. Do I lack direction? No. Often times I'm fully aware that my actions could get me fired but I wing it, go on

       if you will that breaking a rule keeps someone off the streets. My

       My sin isn't your concern. Nor should you be judging me or my spiritual life by claiming I'm rebellious because I'm resentful!

       You asked what I meant about the punishment for people who harm children. Jesus promised a few times they would get dealt with severely. I believe Jesus. Pretty much know him. I don't like any organized profiteering churches though.

       Ooh! I know! Metatron uploads his voice to a private YouTube video and PMs you the link. Then you film yourself reacting to his voice, with a friend standing by (out of earshot) to upload the reaction video and link it here in this thread. If
       <a href="/u/TheKingOfSocialMedia">

       Yeah, it'll mean sacrifice and an awful clean-up job for your family. But on the plus side it'll be awesome karma for you and you'll finally settle the millennia-old debate once and for all.

       King, do you really think God's coming soon? I believe in God, I can feel His active presence in my life, but when it comes to His wrath, how much worse does it have to get? The technology is becoming God-like. This systemized history of Satanists, they can't be trying to destroy God, right? God created them too, He wouldn't create His own undoing?

       The Second Coming is already underway and time stops when The 3rd Woe starts. That's the moment The Christ appears to everyone, and the ones who get saved get saved. When that is done God shows up to live among us in this badass all gold everything Kingdom of Kingdom's.

       At this point it is about the Elect lifting the Son of Man. The ones doing the worse shit are going to crank it up because they really want to fight against Christ and God. Pretty much everyone just has to be on bored with WWIII. They will keep it up until it starts. It won't be a long war at all though. The Two Olive Trees wipe out some strong armies in grand fashion.

       That is exactly what they are up to, and not only do they have man power and computer power, they also have angel power.

       He knows He will win, and that this is just a lesson to the rest of the Angels to stay in line forever. He will make whole everyone who deserves it, and punish for eternity those who don't make the cut. Angels were made to serve us. Not the other way around.

       This is supposed to be the opening of the first seal from the book of revelation. The apostasy is the rule of the false prophet from the seat of Peter in Rome. Second seal will be WW3 and the Antichrist will then enter the scene to end the World War and bring a false peace to the world for a short time.

       This has been happening for centuries at minimum.  Did you know they found hundreds of bones, many of them belonging to children, buried under Ben Franklin's house?  Have you ever heard of the Marquis de Sade?  Or how about Gilles de Rais - at one time quite literally one of the most wealthy and powerful men on the planet, and also one of the most depraved.

       I sincerely wish you are right. However:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Allegations of horrific acts by outsider groups [...] may have served as a form of "othering" for minority groups, as well scapegoating to provide simple explanations to complex problems in times of social disruption.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Red flag. "If you believe this shit, you're too stupid to comprehend the complexity of things." - "If you believe this shit, you're an anti-semite." Therefor, this shit must be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say those allegations in the 80ies were all wrong, and now are utterly discredited - the same as with the "Boy's Town" allegations. Is there any material on how it is possible for a professional to discern "coached" answers to "leading" questions from victims
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       describing what they went through? It would be too easy to say "SRA proved to be wrong back then, so any allegation of SRA today must be bunk."

       And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! (‭Matthew‬ ‭18‬:‭2-7‬ KJV)

       King, do you really think God's coming soon? I believe in God, I can feel His active presence in my life, but when it comes to His wrath, how much worse does it have to get? The technology is becoming God-like. This systemized history of Satanists, they can't be trying to destroy God, right? God created them too, He wouldn't create His own undoing?
