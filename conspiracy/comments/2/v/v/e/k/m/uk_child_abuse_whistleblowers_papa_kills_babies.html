<p><strong>Here is some new information:</strong></p>

<p>Interview with Sabine McNeill - the campaigner and friend of the Mother who fled the country. She is German but her English is great. She is giving an interview from Germany and gives a ton of background info. <a href="http://newsinsideout.com/2015/02/pedophile-cover-hampstead-uk-police-social-services-courts-brainwash-whistleblower-kids-send-mother-legal-helper-exile-protect-satanist-abuser-father/">see here</a></p>

<p>A great article on Scott.net. <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/292461-Alisa-and-Gabriel-Dearman-and-pedophilia-in-high-places">see here</a></p>

<p>A story of a teacher in Hampstead who was able to walk free after sexually assaulting a nine year old girl. <a href="http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/.../hampstead_teacher_walks_free_after_sexually_abusing_nine_year_old_girl_1_1669170">see here</a></p>

<p>A story of a Catholic Friar in Hampstead who was freed (and was told he can continue working in the Church) after being caught with 5000+ pictures of child abuse (some graded in the most extreme categories of child abuse). From the article: &quot;The prosecution also brought up Gardner’s password to his computer account – described by the judge as “so revolting” that it should not be read out in court. ...Gardner admitted 10 counts of making indecent images and one count of possession of prohibited images of children.&quot; <a href="http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/../catholic_friar_caught_with_sexual_image_of_dog_and_child_could_return_to_camden_church_1_3518921">see here</a></p>

<p>A radio show with Clyde Lewis. It has some great info in there, especially when he talks to Ed Opperman (who is very knowledgeable and seems pretty legit. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/groundzeromedia/f2015-02-11">see here</a></p>

<p>A somewhat mainstream article about the whole case, with a mainstream perspective (protecting the status quo), but which does at least confirm some elements of the story. <a href="http://wideshut.co.uk/hampstead-abuse-allegations-court-seeks-removal-videos-campaigner-flees/">see here</a></p>

<p>And finally... something I just noticed... UK Column (who were quite active on this) have had their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIHfbRiqnLU#t=44">youtube account</a> taken down and now have nothing about this on their <a href="http://www.ukcolumn.org/">homepage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The following is older stuff, for people who are new to this story</strong></p>

<p>There is a statement from the Mother <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byzy22cCtwpdaFBaWFZIUDRyNms/view">here</a>.
More info and a petition to sign <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-rt-hon-theresa-may-mp-return-whistleblower-kids-and-abuse-survivors-of-london-school-to-their-russian-family">here</a>.
Mainstream press link confirming elements of the story <a href="http://downloads.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/default.aspx?id=5567710&amp;guid=9eaa536b-f4f9-48b3-8c04-80d751b874b8">here</a>
The father&#39;s acting reel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XryG23_33ZA">here</a> (it is worth watching for how bad it is). 
More information on the Aangirfan blog <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/satanic-child-abuse-in-hampstead.html?m=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, the kids were found by authorities to have been sexually abused. They have been taken away from the Mother and are in care. The Father now has more access to them than the mother (every week, as opposed to every two weeks for the Mother). </p>

<p>I personally think this is most likely real. The video is very compelling, in that the children seem to be acting in a very open and sincere way. The kids are naming names and they say that their abusers wear tattoos on their private parts - which is provable and therefore would give credibility or discredit the story. </p>

<p>There are plenty of stories of children being abused in satanic rituals. Famous (deceased) UK pedo, Jimmy Savile, apparently abused children during satanic rituals - <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring">see here</a> and <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/371936/I-was-raped-at-13-by-Jimmy-Savile-in-satanist-ritual">here</a>. 
And Cyril Smith was no stranger to Satanism either. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pervert-mp-cyril-smith-pals-1546290">see here</a></p>

<p>The one thing that bothers me about the video is that I can&#39;t work out why it has been allowed up on youtube for so long - I would have been sure that by now they would have found a legal reason to take it down... after all, it names names. </p>

<p>Interestingly, Alex Jones&#39; Infowars had a video report about this by Paul Joseph Watson, who repeatedly claimed that this is &quot;almost certainly a hoax&quot;. The youtube comments are overwhelmingly in disagreement. Paul Joseph Watson gives no reason at all for claiming it is a hoax - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlgEvvG8v6c">see here</a>. </p>

<p>David Icke did post about it on his web site, but has not posted the video - which is the most compelling evidence... I&#39;m surprised because I would have thought Icke would have been all over this one - after all it supports so much of what he has been talking about for years. </p>

<p>A lot of people have said the mother should just go straight to the police, but there have been several, well reported, cases of police and authorities covering up for pedophiles in the UK... Like <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10389041/How-far-did-police-go-to-protect-Jimmy-Savile.html">Jimmy Savile</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2602802/How-Liberal-party-police-MI5-concealed-MP-Cyril-Smiths-industrial-scale-child-abuse.html">Cyril Smith</a> and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2939129/Two-local-councillors-corrupt-police-officer-accused-having-sex-victims-Rotherham-abuse-scandal.html">Rotherham rape gangs</a>. The problem appears to be endemic, and it therefore makes it impossible to trust or rely on the police in these matters. And just a quick google search of UK care home child abuse scandals will illustrate how the social services cannot be trusted either. </p>

<p>Also, to put this into context - the UK establishment appears to be awash with sexual child abuse and cover-ups. You can see over 100 articles from the mainstream press over the last couple of years about establishment child abuse <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2boqzq/the_breaking_uk_vip_paedophile_scandal_what_we/">here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents of children on the trip sat in the public gallery to support the teacher, who pleaded guilty last month to one count of sexual activity with a girl under the age of 13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the other one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While saying he was not “deserving of any pity” the judge said he had to consider what was in the public interest.</p>

<p>...he noted Gardner was a man of previous good character and praised the work he had done tending to the sick while chaplain at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.</p>

<p>He said the chance of Gardner committing further offences was “very small indeed” and even said that it was “disproportionate to order that you not have contact with people under 16 years”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, ahmrbond, </p>

<p>MANY THANKS INDEED for your excellent way of summarising!!! </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to present the various aspects of the picture, since the whole explosion around the petition took its own momentum. Since there was no PR campaign, there was no coherent picture!</p>

<p>After I now have spoken with an excellent solicitor who has come forward in response to the campaign, I shall wait for the outcome of the court hearing, before I decide if and how to return. For the Police have a Warrant for Arrest out that can&#39;t be cancelled, I&#39;m told. That means they would take me off any train or plane and treat me like a criminal, thank you very much... </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even know how long I&#39;d have to wait for my solicitor! </p>

<p>Deep sighs and HIGH HOPES from abroad...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Sabine. Thanks for the message - I appreciate it. </p>

<p>Obviously, there has been a lot of new information coming out and it is making it difficult for everyone to get a clear picture. </p>

<p>How do you feel about doing a written interview with me, where I can ask you some questions to hopefully clarify the issue? It wouldn&#39;t have to be too long. </p>

<p>I would post it here to reddit... I think a lot of people would be interested. </p>

<p>Let me know what you think </p>

<p>I have no proof for my idea, it is just that an idea. </p>

<p>These kids are part of a truly horrible divorce battle and have been coerced into making these claims by the mother. 
Our efforts for truth will be scumbered by this case for the future.
In a similar way the Boston Bombing case, when the wrong dude got named.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that the mother coached the kids to say this stuff in order to discredit the father does not make sense. The kids talk about many other people involved who all have &quot;tattoos&quot; - which is easily verifiable. Therefore, if the kids are lying, it can be proven, and the kids (and mother) can be easily discredited. </p>

<p>Also, the kids have (apparently) showed signs of sexual abuse, which is why they are now in care. So someone has abused them. It was the mother that brought them to the authorities - which is not consistent with the behavior of someone abusing children. </p>

<p>It was consistent with someone who is mentally Ill. The children have also talked about how they are locked in cupboards for extended periods and verbally abused by the parents. How loving!</p>

<p>You may or may not also know that the mother released all of the names and addresses of children from the school, who have now recieved horrific abuse and hate mail from witch hunters. I hope you are not one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that the police cover up abuse, which is true, however in this case the ONLY evidence is the testimony of two children. Literally no physical evidence whatsoever. Now everyone on this sub thinks they are psychologists or some shit because apparently they can tell the difference between scared kids due to satanic rituals and scared kids due to a mentally ill abusive mother who has forced them to lie. If you look at the history of police cover ups they are always to protect someone (politicians, business people ect...). Who would they be protecting this time? A normal primary school with absolutely nobody of note present. It simply does not make any sense, regardless of your opinions of the police you cannot claim they go around covering up child abuse just for shits and giggles.</p>

<p>The mother is clearly not all there. Her facebook profile picture for example is her standing nude in a field of weed holding a bud bigger than my head. Not exactly a healthy environment for kids. I know this because a family member of mine works for social services in the borough and has had to deal with all of this BS. She herself has received death threats and hate mail, and for what?</p>

<p>After the kids were taken into care and realised they were away from their parents they started opening up about the treatment they received at home such as being locked in cupboards and denied food. You don&#39;t have to believe me now if you don&#39;t want, I understand that what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. You will however see the story unfold soon when social services release more information.</p>

<p>If the mother cared about the safety of the children in the school then why did she post names and addresses of all the children? If you believe, as I do, that this entire story is false, then the only conclusion is that the mother is mentally ill. Either that or a early April fools joke...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police cover a lot of these things up... What about Rotherham? The Holly Grieg case might also be a good comparison. Plus, how do we know that no-one of note is involved... perhaps someone is and we don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>It seems to me that if the Mother forced the kids to lie, she is kind of a genius, because it is not easy to get kids to learn a script and act that well... and also her friend Sabine appears to be a pretty amazing actress in that interview. </p>

<p>But the Mother would also be pretty stupid because she would be telling her kids to spread lies that can easily be found out... after all, the kids are talking about the adults (and children) having tattoos... this is entirely verifiable. Has anyone even looked?</p>

<p>The kids being locked in cupboards and denied food by their Mother might even be true - these are both parenting tactics that have been used for centuries, and although I may not approve of them personally (I&#39;m not a parent, so what do I know though) they are a drop in the ocean in comparison to the claims these children made about their teachers and father etc. </p>

<p>Posting the names and addresses of all the children and the social workers, teachers etc. is not legal and is questionable. However, remember that the courts are secret, and that this woman has had her children taken away from her. Mainstream sources have confirmed that the kids have been sexually abused, and if the Mother truly believes that Social Services and the Police are involved in the abuse (which the kids have claimed) then releasing names and addresses to the public would most likely have been done in the spirit of exposure and in an effort to rally public support and pressure the authorities to do the right thing. Whether or not this tactic can work remains to be seen. And I have not tried to spread any hate towards any individual myself, as I understand that people must be given a fair chance to defend themselves before we consider them guilty of anything. </p>

<p>I am not in the business of questioning anyone&#39;s sanity. And I&#39;m not in the business of making accusations. What I see here is a pair of kids with an horrific story which mirrors the stories of many kids who have gone before them, and who have found no justice. I also see a child protection service who are able to take children away from their parents for the thinnest of reasons, and who are protected by secret courts, despite the fact that a government report showed that children in care are six times more likely to be sexually abused. I also have read about far too many care home scandals and police cover ups of paedophilia to trust the authorities. So when I see a case like this that can easily be investigated and verified, where the kids seem so genuine, where the story seems so crazy-yet-believable, where the kids are taken by the very authorities who have been implicated in so many ways, and where a caring parent (as is so often the case these days) has children taken away from them for no discernible reason - then I quite naturally want to do something to help others know about this story.  </p>

<p>I hope that you are right, I really do. I doubt it though unfortunately. </p>

<p>I can think of two possibilities. Firstly that its all true as the little details raised by the kids is mindblowing. Or secondly that the mother has created a fictious satanic child rape club that encompasses many different organisations and brainwasherd the kids into believing it. both theories are plausible in my eyes but is without doubt is that these kids are very fucked up to the stage where talking about these horrific things is relatively easy. I feel for the kids. Its absolutly soul destroying to watch them talk about that stuff.</p>

Like Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith and the Rotherham rape gangs. The problem appears to be endemic, and it therefore makes it impossible to trust or rely on the police in these matters.
