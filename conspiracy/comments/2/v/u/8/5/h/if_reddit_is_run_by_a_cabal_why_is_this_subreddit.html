       Who is to say that r/conspiracy isn't heavily moderated or censored, and does it's very existence prove that reddit is perhaps just a normal website? Why does nothing suspicious happen here? I don't get why this specific subreddit is viewed as a bastion of freedom when other places are so easily shut down or moderated, according to various theories by people on this subreddit. Can someone please explain?

       Well your account tells a lot. Spend some time here and figure it out for yourself. Like this sub and the world around you, listen to yourself and your intuition. No one is going to hand you your own personal truth but many will happily offer opinions.

       The difference between this sub and others is that this sub has fewer dickhead mods who want to control what other people say and think. Whereas in other subs, there are mods who are determined not to allow any free communicaion of ideas beyond what they deem to be politically correct, here the mods will usually permit us to actually express our views. Not always, but usually. On Reddit, that's practically a miracle. You've seen how mindlessly restrictive other subs are. You get banned for making one post a mod doesn't agree with. Here, I presume the mods don't agree with everything that is posted, but we are permitted to post anyway. Radical concept, what? It almost resembles free speech.

       there is no "safe place" really, is there?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really think of this site or sub as a bastion of freedom. it's a place with many eyeballs, with similar interests. Its good to bounce your ideas off of other people. Sure there will be some trolls and misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think it's also important for the watchers to know they are being watched. just as they think it's important to let us know we are being watched

       They operate by infiltrating as many subs as they can by gaining mod positions and then they abuse those powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have already had big problems with that in the past, so no, this place is not a "safe haven".

       However, it's not like these people have access to everything either, and deleting stuff willy nilly leaves traces.

       About every 3-6 months or so this sub gets completely over run. To the extent that real discussion can no longer happen. These over run times last a couple weeks. In that time conspiracy talk and government corruption talk gets quickly shut down by down votes and official narrative propaganda by an invading army.
      </p>
      <p>
       The army trying to manipulate opinion must not realize people come here to get away from that crap. So during that time the real sub community gets pissed and revolts. Many "Fuck you I'm out" posts. And eventually the army is ran off. Usually with some finger pointing at mods. I have seen this at least a half dozen times.

       there's been soo much turmoil going on. I've lurked on here for a while now and have seen a lot of drama happen between the mods and the users. This subreddit and all others have been going through a downward spiral, there's topics that nobody can bring up and some that even get straight up deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of these deletions happen due to a violation of subreddit rules, but in the end the rules are set up to filter out certain actions and discussions by users. There was a time where the 'S' word was something you couldn't mention in this sub without getting banned.

       As far as I know, we don't have any words you can't mention here. You can't call an individual Redditor a "dirty nigger" for example, but you can use the word "nigger" if you are talking about the use of words, as I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it -- how fucking bizarre is it that there is a word that one race is allowed to speak, and another race is prohibited from speaking? What does that say about our sick culture? Yet this insanity is enforced over most of Reddit.

       This sub is portrayed as a sub full of 'crazies' by other subs. So no matter what goes on here other people from the 'normal' or 'mainstream' subs don't come here so its okay.
      </p>

       Its when our type of story appears in the mainstream subs that the cabal jump into action. Making sure the sheeple only get drip fed the regular bullshit and leave our crazy shit to the crazy subs. That's what I reckon anyway.

       Bastion of truth? I thought this was a forum to discus topics, reddit that is. And this sub is designed to discus the topic of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one that is a reg here is waiting for Snowden lvl (if you believe that's ligit, if not, what they made it out to be.) drops. It's more a puzzle building experince. Where one person will find a tid-bit of info here (a thread), and another there, and you, as the subscriber can put that puzzle together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can be like, "Ha ha, no place is safe! They already control everything!" Which is bullshit. You give them that power, and they've already won.

       That's how I see it too.  I have never felt that I found answers here per se.  What I find here is ever more interesting questions.  It's an on going process of learning, deducing, discussing and searching.

       no place is safe. not that they control, but there is no privacy. the watchers are watching. we are here, watching the watchers. i come here to seek out people who question the established narrative. there is much disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       much of the posts here, too be honest, i disagree with. i take everything on a case by case basis. i think it's important to seek out a range of opinions.

       The top mod here is a SJW, and he has several minions planted on the mod team as well.

       This sub is a Limited Hangout at best.

       This sub is a form of control. So people like you think you are getting some truth here, but really you are being told what you should and shouldn't believe.

       I never thought that I was getting absolute truth here. I've only been lurking for a month or two, but think some of the theories are interesting. But there seemed to be an inherent flaw in logic in thinking that this board would be especially immune to the so called "cabal" that supposedly controls the rest of reddit.

       It isn't, in fact if anything I would think it's one of the most "watched". I just don't care, I hope I piss tptb off at times if "they" are reading!
