    <div class="md"><p>The difference between this sub and others is that this sub has fewer dickhead mods who want to control what other people say and think. Whereas in other subs, there are mods who are determined not to allow any free communicaion of ideas beyond what they deem to be politically correct, here the mods will usually permit us to actually express our views. Not always, but usually. On Reddit, that&#39;s practically a miracle. You&#39;ve seen how mindlessly restrictive other subs are. You get banned for making one post a mod doesn&#39;t agree with. Here, I presume the mods don&#39;t agree with everything that is posted, but we are permitted to post anyway. Radical concept, what? It almost resembles free speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no &quot;safe place&quot; really, is there?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think of this site or sub as a bastion of freedom. it&#39;s a place with many eyeballs, with similar interests. Its good to bounce your ideas off of other people. Sure there will be some trolls and misinformation. </p>

<p>i think it&#39;s also important for the watchers to know they are being watched. just as they think it&#39;s important to let us know we are being watched</p>

<p>We have already had big problems with that in the past, so no, this place is not a &quot;safe haven&quot;.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s not like these people have access to everything either, and deleting stuff willy nilly leaves traces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About every 3-6 months or so this sub gets completely over run. To the extent that real discussion can no longer happen. These over run times last a couple weeks. In that time conspiracy talk and government corruption talk gets quickly shut down by down votes and official narrative propaganda by an invading army.</p>

<p>The army trying to manipulate opinion must not realize people come here to get away from that crap. So during that time the real sub community gets pissed and revolts. Many &quot;Fuck you I&#39;m out&quot; posts. And eventually the army is ran off. Usually with some finger pointing at mods. I have seen this at least a half dozen times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s been soo much turmoil going on. I&#39;ve lurked on here for a while now and have seen a lot of drama happen between the mods and the users. This subreddit and all others have been going through a downward spiral, there&#39;s topics that nobody can bring up and some that even get straight up deleted. </p>

<p>A lot of these deletions happen due to a violation of subreddit rules, but in the end the rules are set up to filter out certain actions and discussions by users. There was a time where the &#39;S&#39; word was something you couldn&#39;t mention in this sub without getting banned. </p>

<p>Think about it -- how fucking bizarre is it that there is a word that one race is allowed to speak, and another race is prohibited from speaking? What does that say about our sick culture? Yet this insanity is enforced over most of Reddit.</p>

<p>Its when our type of story appears in the mainstream subs that the cabal jump into action. Making sure the sheeple only get drip fed the regular bullshit and leave our crazy shit to the crazy subs. That&#39;s what I reckon anyway.</p>
