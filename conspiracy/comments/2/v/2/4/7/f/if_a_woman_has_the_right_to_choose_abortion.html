    <div class="md"><p>Anyone have peer-reviewed studies on vaccines we are giving to kids <em>today</em> that you think are bad, or shouldn&#39;t be used?</p>

<p>I already know of the faults of this year&#39;s flu vaccine, but I&#39;m unfamiliar with legitimate arguments against vaccines that are supported by science, especially when it comes to say meningitis, measles, whooping cough, etc. </p>

<p>In many different states, e.g. Texas, California, Washington, Oregon, etc. there have been those that do not vaccinate; almost on cue, we have measles outbreaks in those regions that do not require vaccines for that disease.</p>

<p>So, why should people not use vaccines that work over 95% of the time, with rare side effects?  And yes, people/kids that do have serious side effects shouldn&#39;t vaccinate, but they must rely on other people to not be carriers of the disease.</p>

<p>Other people not vaccinating harms the people that cannot vaccinate for medical reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take the establishment argument, since nobody else is doing so: If you refuse to carry a child, it affects you and the fetus and nobody else. If you refuse a vaccine, you affect the herd immunity and someone else&#39;s child may well catch something that will kill them from you.</p>

<p>If you have the right to refuse a vaccine, you could be voluntarily exposing others to something that could possibly kill them. Wouldn&#39;t a more apt comparison be the right to eat a peanut butter sandwich or cookies around someone&#39;s kid that was allergic to peanuts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the &quot;herd immunity&quot; argument is that getting <em>any</em> injection is a health risk in itself. So you&#39;re telling me I should get a vaccine (and risk my health) because at some future undetermined time, you&#39;re health may be at risk. You want my child to risk their health now because of some <em>future, potential</em> risk that probably will never even be an issue in 90% of the population. </p>

<p>If the idea is that we don&#39;t want to put each others children in harms way, then how can you force someone to take a (usually) unnecessary health risk right now (injecting chemicals into the body)? Furthermore, there is absolutely no guarantee the vaccine will actually work while, if you get a vaccine injury, the Pharma companies have 100% immunity from any kind of legal liability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would counter that the injection itself is a lower risk than what would happen if you, and others of similar mindset, did not get the vaccinations. We&#39;re already seeing measles outbreaks in unvaccinated populations, such as the Disney incident.</p>

<p>Further, there are children (almost wrote &quot;people&quot; here, but a shill has to use the &quot;think of the children&quot; argument at least once, amirite?) who can only be protected by herd immunity such as those with compromised immune systems. While this may not affect your current child, you may be putting at risk a future child of yours by not joining in the collective effort.</p>

<p>If these diseases are not kept out of our population, but instead allowed into small pockets, it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll see new strains develop due to survival stresses - such as MRSA - and some of those may well be both more life-threatening and able to ignore our current vaccination program.</p>

<p>Lastly, eventually, yes, these vaccines will stop working, but the pharmaceutical companies are for once making vaccines that have little profit, as the workers and owners of these companies don&#39;t particularly want to see their children dead either (ooh, another one!). They have to have the legal immunities lest their purely humanitarian efforts end up breaking the company under the weight of lawsuits from the ill-informed and unlucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s not just about the vaccine being a lower risk. It&#39;s also the fact that we are not actually sure how well these vaccines work. In this Disneyland outbreak, the majority of the sick people are vaccinated. Was it that 20% of the vaccinated people that were exposed to Measels got it or was it 90% of vaccinated people exposed ended up getting Measels? It&#39;s impossible to tell and there are not ongoing efficacy studies going on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The other side of this argument is that the &quot;herd&quot; is putting my child at risk <em>right now</em> for some <em>future, potential</em> risk that may never come. I understand that vaccine injuries are rare but they are real and it&#39;s disingenuous and dangerous for people not to acknowledge that. So what if I get my kid vaccinated and he&#39;s the 1 out of 1000 that just reacts bad for whatever reason and ends up with his whole life fucked up? And then in my state there&#39;s not a serious outbreak of any disease for the next 100 years. Why did I put my child in harms way again?</p>

<p>But those are all points that reasonable people could see differently and make different valid arguments for. The <strong>real problem</strong> in all of this is how the debate is being framed in the meta sense. It&#39;s not that there are two sides to the argument and we all have different opinions that need discussing and figuring out, it&#39;s that <strong>this is right, that is wrong</strong> and if you go against it you are an extremist.</p>

<p>Because every time any issue becomes ossified to one side or another, it becomes dogma, vaccines become a religion. There can be no rational discussion, there can be no doubting, you are either a believer or you are a heretic. And throughout history, we all know what happens to the heretics. If vaccines become mandatory, it literally means that the State own all children for all intents and purposes because your most private and sacred object, your body, is now out of your power, you no longer get to choose what does or does not enter your body. And the State ownership of our bodies and our children is what we should <em>really</em> be worried about, not Measels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, eventually, yes, these vaccines will stop working</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The MMR vaccine will be around forever regardless of whether Measels continues to exist or whether the vaccine stops working. That vaccine is a revenue stream so there are powerful people that have an interest and keeping that stream nice and fat and flowing. I assure you that Merck will never do a study to test the long term efficacy of their vaccines and I&#39;d like to see you call for that kind of study. Are you some kind of anti-vax nut job?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My logic is solid. Your fear misguides you.</p>

<p>Nobody (in the USA at least) is being forced to vaccinate. Everyone can choose not to. That might have other ramifications, like you can&#39;t send your kid to public school, but there are no fines, no jail time for not vaccinating. Nobody is holding anyone down against their will and jabbing them with needles.</p>

<p>You say my logic is flawed then follow with insults rather than refutations...</p>

<p>Whose logic is flawed?</p>
