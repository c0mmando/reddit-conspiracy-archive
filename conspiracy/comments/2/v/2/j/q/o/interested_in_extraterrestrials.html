       If you're like me, you want to find out who is really pulling the strings. You want to know who sits at the very top of the pyramid. You want to know what it all means. What the purpose is for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I have a lot of time to study and research, and I have come up with a list of people who seem to know an awfully lot about extraterrestrials. They also are in basic agreement on all the biggest facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I was exposed to David Icke a while back, and I thought he was pretty annoying, and all the "spiritual" shit turned me off, as I was a devout atheist at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then I have come to realize that, of course, all the religions are just dogmatic control, but they were based on some real truth, and a lot of that truth either came from or was concerning extraterrestrials. I now tend to agree with almost everything David Icke has to say, although I admittedly don't listen to him much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there are people in the government who confirm what he is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is a list of people who I consider to have truthful information about extraterrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Hancock (Ancient Aliens)
       <br/>
       Bob Lazar (Roswell, Area 51, MJ12)
       <br/>
       Dan Burisch (MJ12, Grays, Time Travel, Immortality)
       <br/>
       Preston Nichols (Montauk, Time Travel, Mind Control)
       <br/>
       Al Bielek (DUMBs, Time Travel, Montauk, Philly Experiment)
       <br/>
       Stewart Swerdlow (Time Travel, Psychics)
       <br/>
       Phil Schneider (DUMBs, Dolce Alien Battle)
       <br/>
       Peter Moon (Mind Control)
       <br/>
       Mark Richards (Secret Space Program, Super Soldiers)
       <br/>
       Lloyd Pye (Star Child Skull, Alien DNA)
       <br/>
       Steven Greer (6" Alien, Alien DNA)
       <br/>
       Billy Meiers (Pleiadians, Talmud of Jmmanuel)
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of these people have been interviewed by Project Camelot, which I found on Youtube. Most of them also have books that can be found on amazon.

       You should look into the alien agenda and the plan to make people think that demons don't exist and that the fallen angels are actually extra terrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       This and the rise in satanism and the occult coming mainstream and all the people trying to bring on the antichrist and are lucifarians. People like the Freemasons and most elite.
      </p>

       if you go off of the indian epics and the stories of the vimana's it lends more to aliens then to demons. I respect your point of view and I go back and forth on it myself.

       Oh I do too and the Indian stories do tend to make it seem alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have been doing some research on magic and demons and there is a lot of info on it. And if you look at all the people who are satanist like tptb the alien disinfo seems a lot more on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does make sense that demons use the thought of loved ones or aliens to fool people and the alien agenda will make it so people will welcome them and not think they are demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen a very strange thing I thought was a been from a ufo and then it shot off and I felt the energy from the beam inside me it was a exotic energy for sure. So I really want to believe aliens and I feel Like they are out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems like most if not all of the good ufo evidence points toward our own governments black ops and secret space programs and the stuff about aliens seeding life could be true. But it seems like most of the stuff out there is disinfo and the more I research the occult and black magic and demons the more it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the people that channel aliens and then kill themselves giving their energy and souls to a deity or alien or demon. And all the stars in my ultra who do satanic rituals to Invoke deities during shows and wanting the energy from the people they trap with their music it makes more sense and I can't actually see that they are doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more satanist and evil and Sogil Magic is going on the more this alien agenda advances. Think of the disclosure movement. Who is paying for it?  It seems there is a hidden hand that is very much trying to push the alien thing on the public all the while things get more and more supernatural and satanic while the mainstream and powers that be keep on rituculing God and Christians and keep pushing this satanic way of life as the live fast die young mind set.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not Christian or religious in anyway. I am spiritual though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I get into it. The more everything makes sense.

       Wait, make people think demons don't exist? They are just extraterrestrials. Same with all the gods and angels.

       Lucifer is a group soul matrix. If there is a physical body manifestation, it is surely a reptilian. Probably the Royal Ciakar, or whatever it is.

       Depends on which version, and which parts of the bible you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       YHWH and shit from the old testiment is mostly true, if you read it in hebrew. YHWH was a real reptilian.

      <p>
       Lucifer was the same entity.

       As I said. I'm not religious at all. But am spiritual. I've done the research i have to come to the conclusion I have at the time being. I'm always changing my view on things and have moved past the alien deception with the research I have done.

       Listen to the people I listed. Look at the star child skull. Look at the 6" alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of evidence for ET life is overwhelming. Look at the technology explosion in the past 50 years. God didn't do that.

       If you are a New Ager, listen to Stewart Swerdlow about it. The New Age movement was created in the 60s by the Illuminati. Some Agenda 21 bullshit.

      <p>
       It's a little truth mixed in with a bunch of bullshit.

       All of them straight up refer to the illuminati as the illuminati. No "TPTB" or anything like that. They are pretty direct about it.

       Look up black magic. And do the research. Their is most definitely something that has power that people can worship. With results in this dimension.

       If you can't come to that with the right research then I don't know what to say.

       You can worship whatever you want. Some people worship reptilian ETs called Lucifer, Satan, Ra, Enki, YHWH, etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Others worship a blue extraterrestrial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they worship out of ignorance. Because they don't understand that they are actually god. They are the creator of their universe. They don't understand that "god" is not something outside of you, but something inside. The reason anything has power in this dimension is because all thought is creative. You are the ruler and creator of your universe. If you want change to happen in your life, you make that change happen with your mind. With your consciousness. That is where God is found.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not some spirit or demon that you can ask for favors or sick on other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that puts the power outside of yourself is an illusion. A form of control.

       It's not your fault. They put a lot of chemicals in the air/water/food, and broadcast specific radiowaves and emit specific electromagnetic radiation that is used to control you in various ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pump it out in the media. They make you want to believe in stuff like religion for various reasons. One reasons is because if you're praying, you feel like you're doing something productive, even though you aren't. It keeps you from getting too aggressive with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have a spirit though, and do your thing without believing in good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just do you. Do whatever feels right. Do whatever you want to do so long as it doesn't prevent anyone else from doing what they want to do. You should also defend your right to do so at all costs.

       Death isn't something to be feared. There's no demons out there. Everything is love once you leave this 3D world behind.

       There's no such thing as angels or demons, buddy. I promise you. They are just entities from various places in space and time. Some maybe only exist in the astral plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       But angels and demons, and some god watching over you. Nah. That's nonsense to try to control you.

       Yes I know that. But if you do some research. It seems that some of these entities or energies soul matrixes will interact with this world the way that people think they are demons. Or Angels.
      </p>
      <p>
       And could be described as a demon. But you getting the whole Jesus God and devil thing to block the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't God be described as a soul matrix. It could be. But not if your hung up on some guy in the sky looking over you who will punish you. Yada yada yada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your letting your view of what you think those things stop you from even seeing that we can both be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone who talks about demons is a Jesus freak.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am Ra. The Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, as you call vibratory sound complexes, may be approximated by stating that all things are one, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is the only "God". The original thought. The highest level of consciousness. Where all things are one. Where all duality is canceled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are 3rd density entities. The infinite creator is the 8th density. YHWH was 4th density. Lucifer was 6th density.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of demons stems from some extraterrestrial phenomena. I forget the exact name for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But demons imply something "evil". There is negative and positive, I suppose, but that's all a matter of perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can anything be inherently good or evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just service to self, which is negative, and service to others, which is positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left hand path, to my understanding, is the theory that you can achieve unity, love, light, peace, through a strict service to self.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also my understanding that this has never been achieved in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is said that there are extraterrestrial entities that would like to pursue this path, and would like to encourage entire solar systems to take this path (that being their subdivided soul family).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not the path for me. It doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Do What Thou Wilt.

       There is no such thing as good or evil. Reptilians just believe that they are a superior race, and their creator told them to rape a pillage the entire universe. They believe they are doing what is right.

      <p>
       It's all just a matter of perspective.

       But there's no magical entities protecting anyone from anything. There is no heaven in the clouds. There is no tormenting of souls for all of eternity.

      <p>
       When you die, you return to the source. You become one again with the energy that is your creator, you experience ecstasy, and then you are reincarnated again. Maybe on Earth. Maybe someplace else, on some other timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       My soul was on Erra, orbiting Taygeta before I was incarnated on Earth. Others have been reincarnating here hundreds of lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heaven and Hell are used to control you. To scare you away from knowing things you shouldn't and offering a reward if you do as you are instructed. It's all a bunch of bullshit.

       When one discards all modern thought and conceptions of spiritual or otherwise celestial beings, and focuses their attention to ancient accounts of these same beings, it becomes more apparant that these beings could have very well been sentient and concrete beings rather than ethereally abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one abandons their original predispositions concerning angelic beings, or godlike beings, or otherwise mystical, and then investigate not only what, but also how, the ancients described these beings, it again becomes apparant that they may have actually been of flesh and blood, rather than a metaphorical respresentation of morals and virtues.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want evidence. And what evidence is there for aliens? I tend to ask the same of religion.  What evidence is there of God? Of Allah? Of YHWH?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer, imo, is the same amount. All records of such entities can serve as evidence for extraterrestrials as they can of Gods. And billions of people believe in God in one shape or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       That evidence is in ancient word. Somehow, i feel the lesson is being lost somewhere during the search for the answers. Or maybe the answers has been here all along?
      </p>
      <p>
       For any given argument, for or against any stance, there will be valid claims. There will be supportive evidence. Most of the time, the side that offers the best confirmation bias wins. I am a huge fan of some of the people you listed (like graham hancock and lloyd pye). But even they fall victim to logical fallacies and confirmation bias, as much as any of their hecklers or debunkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes down to it, we will not truely know until we have a specimen, a live example. Anything else depends on speculations and faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       So be it, the alien question is one theory i believe in mostly in faith.

       If you listen to the rest of the list, you'll see that they worked side-by-side with extraterrestrials.

      <p>
       There is a LOT of evidence for extraterrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       evidence of any "God".
      </p>
      <p>
       God is the original thought. The source. The infinite creator. But he is not a flesh and blood entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the flesh and blood of god. God is something that is inside of us. Love. Light. Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people used to call "Gods" were just more evolved and more technologically advanced beings from other planets. Sometimes human, sometimes reptile, sometimes other. But always flesh and blood.

       It is based on my own research and provided only upon my own conclusions. No control.

       And those live specimens you speak of, they are only as legit as the words that come out of those peoples mouths, imo, though i make the personal choice to attribute some validity to their accounts.. Nonetheless, the accounts of the ancients as well as other, more physical, evidence, leads me to believe in their existence.. though i dont necessarily bite on the reptilian hook...

       On one hand you have a

       of first-hand, eye-witness encounters. A lot of which are government/military whistleblowers.

       On the other hand, you have the Bible, and only the Bible. Written by the same group of scum that uses the media to brainwash you.

      <p>
       If you're going to read religious texts, at least read the original versions before they were edited to benefit the elite. I recommend starting with the Talmud of Jmmanuel and the Book of Enoch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find one of the many websites online that explain how the Book of Enoch is describing extraterrestrials. "Messenger from the Heavens" does not mean "Angel", it means a literal messenger from outerspace.

       Youve got me confused with someone who doesnt know of the things you just offered. Ive read the book of enoch. Ive researched the epic of gilgamesh and the ancient's texts that the abrahamic texts plagiarized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive also spent many hours reading eye witness accounts and researching government officials testimonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny. Ironic even. That you think my conclusions are borne by ignorance, your condolence for me is nothing if not arrogant. We share the same library of evidence, have come to almost identical conclusions for almost equivalent reasons, and yet because mine differ from yours slightly you say im duped?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny how this correspondence reads like an argument, yet both sides of the aisle believe essentially the same thing. Must we quibble over the small things? You might believe in reptilians. Thats fine. I think its plausible yet i turn the other way on that part. In the grand scheme of things, what does that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are on the same side, bro.

       Oh I do too and the Indian stories do tend to make it seem alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have been doing some research on magic and demons and there is a lot of info on it. And if you look at all the people who are satanist like tptb the alien disinfo seems a lot more on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does make sense that demons use the thought of loved ones or aliens to fool people and the alien agenda will make it so people will welcome them and not think they are demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen a very strange thing I thought was a been from a ufo and then it shot off and I felt the energy from the beam inside me it was a exotic energy for sure. So I really want to believe aliens and I feel Like they are out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems like most if not all of the good ufo evidence points toward our own governments black ops and secret space programs and the stuff about aliens seeding life could be true. But it seems like most of the stuff out there is disinfo and the more I research the occult and black magic and demons the more it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the people that channel aliens and then kill themselves giving their energy and souls to a deity or alien or demon. And all the stars in my ultra who do satanic rituals to Invoke deities during shows and wanting the energy from the people they trap with their music it makes more sense and I can't actually see that they are doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more satanist and evil and Sogil Magic is going on the more this alien agenda advances. Think of the disclosure movement. Who is paying for it?  It seems there is a hidden hand that is very much trying to push the alien thing on the public all the while things get more and more supernatural and satanic while the mainstream and powers that be keep on rituculing God and Christians and keep pushing this satanic way of life as the live fast die young mind set.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not Christian or religious in anyway. I am spiritual though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I get into it. The more everything makes sense.
