       <p>
        The FDA continues to be
        <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/top-10-most-dangerous-us-government.html">
         one of the most dangerous government agencies
        </a>
        in the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sheer scope of people it affects with its corruption is staggering.

        <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/12/27/murder-in-the-medical-matrix-the-fda/">
         As Jon Rappoport has highlighted,
        </a>
        the FDA's own webpage admits that the drugs it certifies as safe
        <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm114848.htm">
         contribute to over 100,000 deaths per year.

       <p>
        And as you'll see
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgf-nBeI1g8">
         in the video interview
        </a>
        with constitutional attorney, Jonathan Emord, not only does the FDA routinely approve drugs over objections from its own medical reviewers, but the FDA does
        <em>
         zero independent medical testing of its own.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a system built upon conflicts of interest that leaves consumers completely in the dark about the true consequences of taking Big Pharma products.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the newly inflamed vaccine debate rages across America, the fundamental role of the FDA in disseminating false information and flat-out covering up widespread health dangers must be examined more fully.

       Very early in my career I participated in batch record review audits at a few different companies that both manufactured and repacked pharmaceuticals.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing seemed very clear to me:  The auditing process was more about finding ways to ensure release of products for sale rather than to ensure the safety of those products.

       The FDA is a business arm of the government, simple as that. They are a rubber stamp for well connected companies and an impossible hurdle for smaller companies that might challenge the big pharma goliaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, as I have found is common in your posts, you provided a scary number with no context: 100,000 deaths. Let's give that number some context:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Institute of Medicine reported in January of 2000 that from 44,000 to 98,000 deaths occur annually from medical errors. Of this total, an estimated 7,000 deaths occur due to ADRs. To put this in perspective, consider that 6,000 Americans die each year from workplace injuries.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        However, other studies conducted on hospitalized patient populations have placed much higher estimates on the overall incidence of serious ADRs. These studies estimate that 6.7% of hospitalized patients have a serious adverse drug reaction with a fatality rate of 0.32%.2  If these estimates are correct, then there are more than 2,216,000 serious ADRs in hospitalized patients, causing over 106,000 deaths annually. If true, then ADRs are the 4th leading cause of deathâ€”ahead of pulmonary disease, diabetes, AIDS, pneumonia, accidents, and automobile deaths.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it more concisely, hospitals are prescribing the wrong medication/delivering drugs they should at an alarmingly high rate. The question that should be asked is how much of this is due to bribery? Pharma rep pays of doctor/hospital to use their drug. Patient gets sick and or dies. Doctor/hospital covers up that they prescribed the wrong drug for financial reasons. Patient and family don't have the expertise to know. FDA doesn't care.
