<p>George_Tenet has been banned.</p>

<p>He was banned for multiple reasons, firstly his participation here has become nothing more than an eternal plug for his subreddit.  Secondly, this user has become vindictive every time someone posts something that doesn&#39;t agree with limited hangout, and he tries to start a witch hunt.</p>

<p>Most recent example.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v1qjv/whats_the_future_of_snowden_and_his_leaks_is_he/codq5iw">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v1qjv/whats_the_future_of_snowden_and_his_leaks_is_he/codq5iw</a></p>

<p>Previous examples.</p>

<p>Was in response to</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uh57i/any_post_about_snowden_being_limited_hangout_or/co8dewo">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2uh57i/any_post_about_snowden_being_limited_hangout_or/co8dewo</a></p>

<p>Its ridiculous and its cluttering up the new queue just having random headlines posted with no content except a link to limited hangouts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this displeased anyone but his participation here is a mixture of self promotion and thinly veiled attacks.</p>

<p>Just a few quick remarks: I glanced through his posting history just now and GT seems not to be calling people shills very often (you gave the one example) and more importantly: in context. I also can see that he&#39;s a bit obnoxious, but hey we can downvote that sort of thing, that&#39;s what reddit is about.</p>

<p>I disagree. You can present a message but if all you do is promote that message every chance you get then it weakens the message significantly.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the one who got me thinking about Snowden as a LHO, he&#39;s also the one who made me sick of this sub constantly saying he is one without evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Limited hangout nonsense&quot;</p>

<p>Forcing the term limited hangout into every comment you make and making new posts that have a sensational headline with no content inside other than a generic redirect to your personal sub.</p>

<p>&quot;Witch hunts&quot;</p>

<p>Making a post with the intent to aim a critical mob at one specific user, presumably with no actual evidence to support your narrative.</p>

<p>GT can appeal his ban like anyone else can, but he won&#39;t be let back in unless he stops his disruptive behavior.</p>

I simply disagree with him on the extent of his conspiracy, which he seems to take pretty personally.  It&#39;s too bad, because the content of his message--once you strip off all the paranoia and hyperbole--is an important discussion about how far political and national theater stretches into our lives to manipulate us.</p>

<p>Hmm not sure what to think about this. I did try to debate him on his theory though, I dont get why he didnt&#39; pursue me on my offer to entertain / explore the idea, instead he just kept on creating new threats without exploring the validity of the claim/theory despite me being very open to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was using dishonest tactics to spread Limited Hangout theory(*such as sniping Articles from The Intercept, which produces solid reporting, and posting them on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with editorialized titles.) </p>

It would be a genious strategy if the LH theory was put into action for a global &#39;shadow government&#39; if it exists. I also am not certain he twisted the news, just his take on it; which my only criticism of which was that he just kept throwing it out there without even building up his theory. In essence, he was making a large claim but not following through with making a case/argument for it or presenting hard facts that proved it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the JIDF brainwash you into believing any criticism of the MSM brainwashing, or Israel&#39;s genocide of the palestinians, is &quot;antisemitic&quot;. The people we are criticizing aren&#39;t even semites. The Palestinians are the semites. So you may want to check your vocabulary.</p>

<p>Aside from that, yes, it is <em>very</em> suspicious that intelligent subscribers here are being banned for outing obvious conspiracies.</p>

<p>How come it&#39;s only SM and Flytape that ever want to censor everything they don&#39;t understand? Maybe they do understand, and have an agenda with their censorship.</p>

<p>As someone who has followed GT&#39;s posts pretty closesly I&#39;d be cautious calling him an intelligent subscriber. He called LHO on everything, every time, all the time. It was boring and really didn&#39; tbring much to the sub.</p>

<p>And despite his months and months of posting it he never actually showed any evidence that Snowden was a LHO other than pointing to the fact that he was treated differently than other real whistleblowers. So calling it an obvious conspiracy is wrong IMO.</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>He was in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald? Was George the shooter on the grassy knoll?</p>

<p>He was trying to tell everyone about a Limited Hangout (oh, this is what you meant by LHO? Limited Hangout Operation or something, my bad). That is pretty intelligent to me. Snowden is most definitely an obvious Limited Hangout.</p>

<p>What evidence might exist that a limited hangout is a limited hangout?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also guessing that you take everything Snowden says as gospel. But has he ever shown you any evidence? Have you seen any code of these supposed surveillance programs? Have you even seen any heavily redacted paperwork that would backup anything Snowden has claimed?</p>

<p>Has anyone else come out of the woodwork to backup Snowden&#39;s claims? </p>

<p>Has there been <em>anything</em> from Snowden beside his word? And rarely even his, it&#39;s usually Laura&#39;s or Glen&#39;s. Both of which are highly suspicious. </p>

<p>Snowden is alive, and he is on the MSM, and he hasn&#39;t leaked any NEW info, and he hasn&#39;t said anything about a plethora of <strong><em>important</em></strong> topics. But we know that NSA jacks it to my dick pix. So that&#39;s neat. Better put that headline on the front page of CNN.com and use that to distract from everything that matters.</p>

<p>Snowden is such an obviously load of bullshit that I am really disappointed that so many people here just swallow it all hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve just confirmed what I said. There is no hard evidence, only speculation, albeit very solid speculation. And now you&#39;re getting upset that I don&#39;t 100% agree Snowden is a LHO, just like <a href="/u/George_Tenet">/u/George_Tenet</a> would have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A decent limited hang out will not be noticed because any evidence will be minuscule.  It is my opinion that Snowden is a limited hangout for several reasons.  But I do think he works for Putin.  PRISM is basically Echelon 2 electric boogaloo and all of the NSA tactics were reported on 60 minutes back in 2000. This is one of the reasons why I had a hard time believing the official version of events regarding the Bush administration&#39;s  ignorance of 9-11.  I was aware of the NSA capabilities over a year before 9-11. He hasn’t released anything new but he keeps promising, like dangling a carrot to keep our attention. that is the key. The dangling carrot.  Assange, I believe is a limited hang out as well. He releases information but at such an overwhelming pace that if there are important details they are easily missed until much later. What Assange released is confirmation for what many other agencies (i.e. red cross) were reporting years ago. Bradley Manning I think is legit. But, he merely released information that confirmed what other agencies were reporting. Wikileaks is nothing but a limited  hang out. The internet was invented by the military, and all ports are tagged. If there was any real information, it wouldn’t make it on the internet, not even the dark web. All of it is tagged.  </p>

<p>that&#39;s my two cents</p>

<p>I think we should talk about the possibility that some of these theories  are limited hangouts.  </p>

He supposedly had access to all the NSA&#39;s computers and programs, and yet all we have is some code names for programs we already knew were in place. </p>

<p>But no mention of Israel. No mention of nukes. No mention of extraterrestrials or UFOs. No mention of MSM manipulation. He has no information that is actually important.</p>

<p>Instead, what he has done, is terrified the people paying attention into believing that they are being monitored at all times.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no use in having a police state if the people don&#39;t know about it.</p>

<p>Snowden is def working for the government. Or else he wouldn&#39;t be all over the MSM all the time. </p>

<p>If the NSA was as mad at him as they claim to be, then the CIA would just go kill him. And probably Laura and Glen too. But no, the shills of the jewish MSM are allowed to do all the reporting they want.</p>

<p>They killed the Gray Matter (or whatever it was called) producer, but they won&#39;t kill Laura for her doc? And this is supposed to be the biggest leak ever?</p>

<p><a href="/u/George_Tenet">/u/George_Tenet</a> was doing this sub a huge favor. It&#39;s sad to see he was censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conversely everything he said had been said already many times over, I 70% think Snowden <em>is</em> a LH myself, I also think he did the US citizens a big favour exposing the unconstitutional behaviour of the NSA and accidentally started a war between the alphabet agencies that has led to greater exposure of CIA crimes against humanity that we are better off being aware of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who didn&#39;t know before, still don&#39;t know. Any time I bring up Snowden IRL, I get &quot;who?&quot; for a response.</p>

<p>Sure, he may have raised the awareness a bit, but it&#39;s not that much. But like I said, it&#39;s no used having a gestapo if no one knows you have it and are willing to use it.</p>

<p>The public needed to know they are being watched at all times, in order to keep them in line.</p>

<p>So, everything that he has done that you say is in our favor, actually works against us to a greater magnitude. </p>

<p>But none of that is here nor there. The point is, a solid contributor to this sub got banned because he called out two corrupt mods.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real issue.</p>

<p>Sure, there may be a few more people. But it&#39;s nothing that isn&#39;t well controlled. I don&#39;t think the increase in concerned citizens outweighs the benefit of everyone knowing they are being watched at all times.</p>

<p>Sure, some people may be resisting, but I think more often than not you have &quot;I have nothing to hide, so I don&#39;t care&quot;, and &quot;They are watching everything, so I better not even think about dissenting&quot;</p>

<p>The people filing petitions are easy to deal with. Everyone knows that the people are powerless, regardless, until they realize that it will require bloodshed. But since they have no weapons any more, that point is moot now too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. Nothing we didn&#39;t already know. And of all the shit there is to say about Israel, the MSM, AIPAC, etc etc, there were just a couple small bullshit stories that got no real attention.</p>

<p>What about Israel dropping radioactive material in Palestine? What about Fast and Furious? What about Benghazi? </p>

<p>Nothing? Really.</p>

<p>So, once again, he confirmed some small things that we already knew, all of which serves their purposes by telling us.</p>

<p>Cool story.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think if someone like Snowden had complete access to everything, the first thing he&#39;d go for is Roswell and JFK.</p>

<p>But, nope, nothing about that. Nothing one way or the other. He must not have been interested. It&#39;s more interesting to know if anyone&#39;s stealing n00dz. </p>
