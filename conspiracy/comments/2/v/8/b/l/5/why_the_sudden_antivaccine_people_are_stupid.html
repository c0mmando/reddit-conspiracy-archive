    <div class="md"><p>Not really. It&#39;s cherry picked. No vaccine is 100% effective.</p>

<p>Example: 1003 people are exposed to measles. 3 are not vaccinated and get measles. Say the vaccine is 96% effective. 40 vaccinated people get measles. 43 total cases, 93% are people that are vaccinated-but only 4% of vaccinated people exposed actually contracted the disease.</p>

<p>You can get measles from entering a room that an infected person was in hours earlier. It&#39;s among the most infectious pathogens known to man. </p>

<p>Please downvote this post. Why bother. </p>

<p>EDIT-Actually read the abstracts cited. I dare you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, yesterday in some other thread, someone wished all anti-vaccers dead or in concentration camps. Another one opened a thread on <a href="/r/rant">/r/rant</a> against the &#39;idiot&#39; anti-vaccers.</p>

<p>Yet whenever I read both sides, the pro-v&#39;s come across as childish, use insults, swear but have actually nothing to say, whereas the anti&#39;s seem to be able to keep their calm, put up links to underline their argument or have something to say that should make sense.</p>

<p>Pro-v&#39;s on reddit have lost the plot and seem quite radical in their views. Some sort of misplaced righteousness that leaves no room for discussion.</p>

<p>I read this as either pro-vacs are all incapable of adult conversation, they are uneducated, young or maybe...they are paid.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, they are not painting a very good picture of themselves, always using the same old [empty] arguments.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Source is a dubious website</p></li>
<li><p>All anti&#39;s want everyone to die</p></li>
<li><p>There is no evidence against vaccines to be used</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yawn. All of these points can easily be countered when you know what you are talking about. And if all fails, we get swearwords. 
Definitely weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t noticed an uptick in anti-anti-vaxxing rhetoric here.  Maybe I&#39;m subbed to the right subreddits.</p>

<p>Anyway, the reason it&#39;s been getting more attention is that there was a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/images/measles-cases-616px.jpg">massive increase</a> (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html">context here</a>) in U.S. measles cases last year, and we&#39;re on track for even more cases this year.   The U.S. declared that it had <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html#measles-elimination">eliminated endemic measles</a> in 2000, so it&#39;s a big step backwards.  Most sufferers were unvaccinated, so this huge increase in human suffering and risk of death is widely regarded as resulting from a strange politically motivated skepticism about one of the greatest medical achievements in human history.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder whether the anti-vaxxer movement itself is a conspiracy intended to discredit anti-authoritarian sentiment in general.</p>
