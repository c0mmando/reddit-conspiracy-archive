       In the past 2 weeks or so all I've seen on front page is something to do with vaccinations, I'd never even heard of it up until a few weeks ago. Was going to ask
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit
       </a>
       but I'd get closed minded opinions only on there, so asking here for both sides of the argument be it for or against vaccinations.

       Part of the problem is people are conflating those who are anti-flu vaccine vs people who are anti-every vaccine. The former has more of a case to make then say someone who refuses to vaccinate their kids for MMR...

       Not really. It's cherry picked. No vaccine is 100% effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: 1003 people are exposed to measles. 3 are not vaccinated and get measles. Say the vaccine is 96% effective. 40 vaccinated people get measles. 43 total cases, 93% are people that are vaccinated-but only 4% of vaccinated people exposed actually contracted the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get measles from entering a room that an infected person was in hours earlier. It's among the most infectious pathogens known to man.

       I know, yesterday in some other thread, someone wished all anti-vaccers dead or in concentration camps. Another one opened a thread on
       <a href="/r/rant">
        /r/rant
       </a>
       against the 'idiot' anti-vaccers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet whenever I read both sides, the pro-v's come across as childish, use insults, swear but have actually nothing to say, whereas the anti's seem to be able to keep their calm, put up links to underline their argument or have something to say that should make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-v's on reddit have lost the plot and seem quite radical in their views. Some sort of misplaced righteousness that leaves no room for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read this as either pro-vacs are all incapable of adult conversation, they are uneducated, young or maybe...they are paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the reason, they are not painting a very good picture of themselves, always using the same old [empty] arguments.

         Source is a dubious website

       <li>
        <p>
         All anti's want everyone to die
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no evidence against vaccines to be used
        </p>
       </li>

      <p>
       Yawn. All of these points can easily be countered when you know what you are talking about. And if all fails, we get swearwords. 
Definitely weird.

       Were being hit hard here as well, you'll notice almost every reply is pro-vaccine, some even taking the "anti vaxxers are stupid" stance you came to question.

       I don't know what to tell you that isn't wild speculation, but those who can't argue a position attack a person instead.  Many people or quite sensitive and easily fall in line rather than research for them selves and face ridicule.

       The scientific method is pretty infallible.

       But anti vaxers completely ignore the science and use pro anti vaccine websites as "proof" that something is wrong with them. I'm not sure what their agenda actually is, but its clearly against science.

       Not just vaccines but with most pharmaceuticals, it is the company that produces said chemical that does all the testing. All the testing. Seriously.

       Doctors get trips and cash incentives to prescribe certain drugs and all the stats they have on this drug are from the company sending them to Hawaii.

       I hadn't noticed an uptick in anti-anti-vaxxing rhetoric here.  Maybe I'm subbed to the right subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the reason it's been getting more attention is that there was a
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/images/measles-cases-616px.jpg">
        massive increase
       </a>
       (
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html">
        context here
       </a>
       ) in U.S. measles cases last year, and we're on track for even more cases this year.   The U.S. declared that it had
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html#measles-elimination">
        eliminated endemic measles
       </a>
       in 2000, so it's a big step backwards.  Most sufferers were unvaccinated, so this huge increase in human suffering and risk of death is widely regarded as resulting from a strange politically motivated skepticism about one of the greatest medical achievements in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I wonder whether the anti-vaxxer movement itself is a conspiracy intended to discredit anti-authoritarian sentiment in general.

       I love that statistic people keep throwing around, the US "eliminated endemic measles in 2000."  They say it as if it means that there were zero cases of measles in 2000, but there were actually still measles cases - about 60 I believe - associated with 11 outbreaks.

       It is a hobby of the propaganda machine to give platform to the more ridiculous voices, so the reasonable people don't get heard at all.

       The collapse in measles infections since the introduction of the vaccine in the 60s has been
