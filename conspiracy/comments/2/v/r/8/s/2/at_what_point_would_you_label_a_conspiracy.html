       This is a genuine question I have, as there are thousands of conspiracies in the world and a lot of them out there have to be misguided or disproven (a conspiracy in itself) so I was wondering what are your limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also another question is what do you expect to happen if a conspiracy is true and what is the most likely one for you?

       World leaders are reptilian shape shifters from outer space drinking the blood of the newborn in occult rituals, the moon is their space station and Niburu its mother ship. They breed humans like humans breed cattle and feed on them by sucking their brain energy out of them with mobile phones and TV sets, boosting the yield by feeding them GMOs and poisoned water and injecting funny stuff into their veins. They collect all the gold and extract the monatomic elements to become immortal and keep their star gates going, but fear not, an intergalactic alliance of Aryan Greys will come to the rescue from within the hollow earth and bring us an everlasting utopia if we meditate real hard and remember to energize the atmosphere with that pyramid I have in my online shop for only U$ 350.-!

       Except, of course, for the Twin Towers, they really came down minutes after planes hijacked by religious extremists slammed into them because their structure was three times heavier than it could support, as Bazant/Verdure show in "
       <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf">
        Metaphysics of Progressive Collapse
       </a>
       ", 2007, Equation 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for the monetary system, of course. Usury, compound interest, inflation and deflation all are the canary birds of a healthy and prosperous economy and demurrage would totally catapult us back into the stone ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for the medical-pharmaceutical complex, of course, they are only interested in our well-being and inhaling d9-THC will turn you into a lobotomized child-rapist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for the educational system, it's all about empowering our children, shaping their minds and giving them the best start into a bright future. All that synergetic thinking and wild imagination only leads to nutty people without a job to pay their taxes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for the industrial-military complex, the best means to secure peace is superior firepower, and how would we fight for peace without handing all that sci-fi weapon tec out to our foes and friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for the media, nothing is as vital for a healthy democracy than voters who are well-informed about the issues at hand. Consensual decision-making on the basis of weighing all the pros and cons is a long and tiresome process and gets nothing ever done.
      </p>
      <p>
       And except for zionism. Every little backwards cult should have the right to produce an old scroll to prove they have a divine right to do whatever their high priests say is G-ds command.

       I use logic.  If a theory relates to John Lear, Ben Fulford, David Icke, Wilcott, Kerry Cassidy, Dan Burish, Mark Dice, Jordan Maxwell, etc I tend to dismiss them.  Especially John Lear, if he isn't lying his butt off he has to be insane.

       I also don't believe in Reptilians, remote viewing, that particle weapon from space brought down the WTC, that there is a secret space program with a base on Mars and that humans are working with martians, there were 2 underground cities of Illuminati personnel nuked, that the Chinese mafia are fighting the Illuminati, the satanic or Illuminati symbols at the Super Bowl have any effect on anyone, John Titor, crop circles.

       I do believe the US government routinely lies to the citizens.  The surveillance stuff, the total erosion of civil liberties, the IRS attacking the Right Wing, and the trillions of dollars that can't be accounted for by the government scare me.

       I like to read the post here when people debate each other without ending with one calling the other a shill.  Because using the word shill is really lazy.

       Grand highly and tightly orchestrated conspiracies are also hard to swallow. I don't believe there is a worldwide conspiracy of almost any type. At least not as tightly controlled as many here would believe.  The NWO agenda is likely a more loose conglomeration of leaders and those in power with somewhat aligned goals.  911 I think may have been a few smaller conspiracies, not one grand one (one Intel agency involved in the ignoring or even helping hijackers, and a separate one involving the pre-wiring of hi rise buildings with failsafe methods of demolition as a necessary evil in case of catastrophic damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a powerful antagonist to a proposed conspiracy that acts incongruous with the conspiracy it is likely false (russia agreeing the moon landing was real.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Many conspiracies are no more than conspiracies of greed, or simply a natural result of the legal and economic framework we have allowed to be constructed without questioning it's effects. Such as medical research and funding and the numerous issues around establishing safety or efficacy of medications.  I don't think it is a plot to chemically lobotomized or reduce the population. It is just human greed lumped atop human stupidity that let such an incestuous system to become the status quo.

       Outside sources tell me I have more common sense then them, and everyone is born with common sense.

      <p>
       Your hurling shitty assumptions around, and I don't see what kind of common sense lead you to thinking negative toward me and sarcastically air quoting to me online. You know nothing of me or my beliefs other than one question, a question that upon my answering, i feel, gave not enough insight into me for you to make an accurate assumptions on my feelings about NASA putting Man on the Moon.

       yes, i have also been told this, but it is just a clever deception.

       you are told you are smart, so naturally you want to believe it, even if its not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are given good grades, to reinforce the idea that you are smart, but in fact grades are just a measure of your brainwashing.

      <p>
       you are fed a steady diet of "education", information, and "news" that is actually just disinformation and propaganda, then when you fully swallow the "news" and disinformation then they reward you by telling you that you are "well informed"
      </p>
      <p>
       did you know that the Green Party Candidate Jill Stein was arrested outside the "presidential debate" that she was excluded from? oh, you didn't? and here you assumed you were well informed?
      </p>
      <p>
       now, because you feel so smart and well-informed, you naturally think everyone else is an idiot, crazy, and/or ill-informed.

       its hard to fathom the size and scale of the deception, but this poster might help visualize

       I pulled myself out of school when I turned 18....
Quit being pretentious you know nothing of me, or my ideas, School did tell me I was smart so did college, but I still didn't care and I wasn't talking about the school confirming I have common sense. You should get some though, that way you could actually preach the good things your trying to people that need preaching.

       Vaccines do cause autism. The so called science "debunking" any links itself was debunked by the #CDCwhistleblower when he admitted to being personally involved in the fraud... but ya know Snopes says the CDCwhistleblower story is "false" so who do you believe

       The CDC whistleblower himself (Dr. William Thompson) said this in response to anti-vaxxers trying to turn him into a poster child:

       If you actually read his own words, he said he had an issue with a small finding in the study being excluded, not exactly the bombshell everyone made it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it speaks to the desperation of anti-science folks when instead of producing studies they record a man without his knowing and twist his words to fit their agenda.

       That's bs. You can even look up the cameras that were there. There were at least 20 they should've been caught on, possibly more. Do you think we were all two years old back then?

       Yes, and I'm sure it was super serious and not at all a parody website. Yes, the best-laid conspiracies are achieved when shown to the world.

       The crisis actors site was real but it was for legitimate simulations for law enforcement and rescue workers.  The site was not for crisis actors at the Boston Marathon or Sandy Hook.  I don't believe in that shit either.  It his all been debunked.

       I must have missed the part where the allegation that FEMA deputy Richard Serino was the mastermind of Boston Marathon Bombing Hoax was debunked. Can you post a link? Thanks!

       Those "crisis actor" posts every now and then where people claim two other people are the same person. It's clear they aren't, but some people still stick to it.

       The official story of 9/11 has been utterly, thoroughly, exhaustively debunked, yet some people still cling to the conspiracy theory about 19 muslims flying a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon without getting caught on camera
