       I have been a victim of gang stalking and mind control for years. The extent ranges from being put in jail on false charges to being followed and mocked around town. I can't even buy the foods I like because by the time I leave my house someone is alerted and the items I would usually purchase are taken off the shelves. They have made me poor and I have no more friends and family to turn to. Can anyone provide information on where I can go to report this? Thanks in advance.

       The woman I have known for years. Has been taken out of my life on multiple occasions and she told me right before I got arrested that I had been followed for a while. The "cops" arrested ME for...get this...stalking.when i went to court the arresting police officer "no longer works for the dept) they have made references to me inheriting a large sum of money. Still why the hell constant abuse?

       Go 100% clean and sober. AA helped me, but I certainly don't talk about certain topics in meetings. Although, by AA principles, you don't talk about anything but alcoholism anyway.

Whereas Project Monarch was officially dedicated sometime in the early 1960's by the US Army. Project Monarch is a genealogical approach to define transgenerational (via genetic psychology) behavioral modification through trauma based psychological mind control.)[

       Not exactly, this happened before i knew about meditation.every time I got around this woman my consciousness grew almost instinctively, at first I had no idea what was happening. Then it got to an experience where it was like the whole world was in unison after one of our meetings.

       Stop doing the same thing, catch them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) if you have spare time, take a decent amount out of the bank, goto the airport, lose the tail. Hold onto the cash. They will be scrambling to find you. This also works at bus stations and train stations.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Change appearances regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) goto different stores, in different towns. Mix it up, buy some stuff at one place, leave and goto the other. easy way to spot a tail.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) Like #1, goto sporting/big events, get lost in the crowd, then leave. Free ones are the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) stop using any electronics that you cannot confirm are not spying on you. My suggestion is to find a really old computer on craigslist or at a pawnshop, but at least matches specs to be somewhat usable (early 2000s are ok, older the better)
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be unpredictable. they know when you do certain things, they know when you go for food. Trip them up. When you look like youre about to go foodshopping, goto the store, act like youre about to walk in and just turn around and leave, goto another store.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great way to really mess with them is to approach them. Act polite, ask for the time, how they are, etc. Never give away you know whats going on, but that agent will be replaced now since he has been approached by the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be boring, super boring. Bore them to death. The less interesting you are, the better chances they will not bother with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       My honest suggestion is to never work for someone when these are the cases. They will just ruin you and make you work the lowest paying job that will never leave you out of a hole. Pick up a profession that is self sustaining. Learn to program, its easy money and pretty easy to pick up work. You could also start a blog and pick up extra cash with advertising, check out google adsense along with blogspot.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.)
       <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">
        http://www.codecademy.com
       </a>
       - completely free, learn HTML &gt; CSS &gt; PHP &gt; Javascript &gt; you pick (I say these because of #2, if you actually want to progress and are interested, theres more out there)
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Learn WordPress, its literally free money, theres tutorials all over the internet, youtube, etc. Its a content management system that everyone loves and powers most of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) get cheap business cards from vista print, their free for 1k but shipping is $10, leave them everywhere. Fuck it, you need to eat.

       you'd be surprised how many people I've met (in LA) that have done exactly that. I watched a kid from living on venice beach boardwalk to living in decent santa monica apt.

       Also, its a suggestion, networking is involved, maybe even browsing ads to find jobs. Surely experience comes into play, but hell theres plenty of people who pay college interns a decent amount compared to flipping burgers.

       Any details?  You say you're a victim of Project Monarch, so tell me about it if you can.  What happened to you growing up, what type of family do you come from, what type of programming do you have/think you have?  I have to say that I'm pretty incredulous of your story based on the limited detail you've provided and somewhat vague responses.

       No problem. This is why I came here to disclose some details. For the first 5 years of my life I was "love bombed" by a man in thought was my grandfather. I was actually adopted so all these people have been actors basically. Around this time I met a girl we will call her J. J was at the daycare along with other adoptees. The babysitter coerced us into sexual encounters with each other. I wouldn't find out until later that J was actually my neighbor when I was younger."we kinda always had a thing for each other." I was a subject to satanic rituals involving the "church." After those years my handlers coerced me into a homosexual encounter(I'm not gay) and as I got older they got me hooked on drugs. I had multiple personalities depending on the handler 
and situation or triggers. Fast forward several years I meet J again although I didn't recognize her. I mean its been 20 years. She had training from her handlers as well and every time we got close to one another my programming would break and the handlers would intervene. I graduated college and had a great life for a while but they took everything i own  and eventually made me homeless.They even subjected me to rocky mnt spotted fever and almost killed me but thankfully J convinced them to bring me to her. I had been sick for weeks and miraculously started to heal when I got around her. They again saw this and put me in jail on false charges where I got pretty sick again. This was there attempt to kill me so that I would not speak out. I'm still looking for J. If she is out there and sees this I want her to know I love her and we will get our justice soon!

       You were adopted? What kind of church are you referring to? Have you seen
       <em>
        The Butterfly Effect
       </em>
       ? Maybe the best thing for you both is to stay away from J. Find your healing strength within.

       I've been subjected to sexual,self destructive, even what they call messiah training. Basically they tell you your Jesus Christ and make a stage around you. All the time hoping you speak out so you look crazy.

       The only person that believes me was forced out of my life on the false charges and i now have a fake restraining order in an attempt to further isolate me. I know this is all staged because she never went to court and yet still they made me plead guilty. They even attempted to recruit me for cult activities including drug trafficking. There are so many laws being broken here its insane.

       The whole point of gangstalking is to force you to engage in antisocial or dangerous behavior, which gives them fair cause to imprison or hospitalize you. Hold on to your truth, try journaling in a secure manner to process your frustration or anxieties. Don't "appear crazy", just hold on to your soul and try to live your life based on your decisions. I highly recommend some kind of spiritual study. Something that will help you understand the depth of your human experience and what/why someone would engage in evil acts. They are fucking with you and they will tire if you're stronger than their tactics. I don't think you're insane. I think this happens FAR more than it is reported.

       Update they stole my car key this morning but I got it back with the help of a sheriff. But now they are threatening to evict me so I will be looking for housing arrangements. But i agree totally with you. they use scare tactics, I've had death threats and even been slapped before when i spoke out.
