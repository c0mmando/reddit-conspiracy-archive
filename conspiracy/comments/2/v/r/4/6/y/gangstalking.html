The extent ranges from being put in jail on false charges to being followed and mocked around town. I can&#39;t even buy the foods I like because by the time I leave my house someone is alerted and the items I would usually purchase are taken off the shelves. They have made me poor and I have no more friends and family to turn to. Can anyone provide information on where I can go to report this? Thanks in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop doing the same thing, catch them up.</p>

<p>1.) if you have spare time, take a decent amount out of the bank, goto the airport, lose the tail. Hold onto the cash. They will be scrambling to find you. This also works at bus stations and train stations.</p>

<p>2.) Change appearances regularly. </p>

<p>3.) goto different stores, in different towns. Mix it up, buy some stuff at one place, leave and goto the other. easy way to spot a tail.</p>

<p>4.) Like #1, goto sporting/big events, get lost in the crowd, then leave. Free ones are the best.</p>

<p>5.) stop using any electronics that you cannot confirm are not spying on you. My suggestion is to find a really old computer on craigslist or at a pawnshop, but at least matches specs to be somewhat usable (early 2000s are ok, older the better)</p>

<p>Just be unpredictable. they know when you do certain things, they know when you go for food. Trip them up. When you look like youre about to go foodshopping, goto the store, act like youre about to walk in and just turn around and leave, goto another store. </p>

<p>A great way to really mess with them is to approach them. Act polite, ask for the time, how they are, etc. Never give away you know whats going on, but that agent will be replaced now since he has been approached by the target.</p>

<p>Be boring, super boring. Bore them to death. The less interesting you are, the better chances they will not bother with you.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My honest suggestion is to never work for someone when these are the cases. They will just ruin you and make you work the lowest paying job that will never leave you out of a hole. Pick up a profession that is self sustaining. Learn to program, its easy money and pretty easy to pick up work. You could also start a blog and pick up extra cash with advertising, check out google adsense along with blogspot. </p>

<p>1.) <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">http://www.codecademy.com</a> - completely free, learn HTML &gt; CSS &gt; PHP &gt; Javascript &gt; you pick (I say these because of #2, if you actually want to progress and are interested, theres more out there)</p>

<p>2.) Learn WordPress, its literally free money, theres tutorials all over the internet, youtube, etc. Its a content management system that everyone loves and powers most of the internet. </p>

<p>3.) get cheap business cards from vista print, their free for 1k but shipping is $10, leave them everywhere. Fuck it, you need to eat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. This is why I came here to disclose some details. For the first 5 years of my life I was &quot;love bombed&quot; by a man in thought was my grandfather. I was actually adopted so all these people have been actors basically. Around this time I met a girl we will call her J. J was at the daycare along with other adoptees. The babysitter coerced us into sexual encounters with each other. I wouldn&#39;t find out until later that J was actually my neighbor when I was younger.&quot;we kinda always had a thing for each other.&quot; I was a subject to satanic rituals involving the &quot;church.&quot; After those years my handlers coerced me into a homosexual encounter(I&#39;m not gay) and as I got older they got me hooked on drugs. I had multiple personalities depending on the handler 
and situation or triggers. Fast forward several years I meet J again although I didn&#39;t recognize her. I mean its been 20 years. She had training from her handlers as well and every time we got close to one another my programming would break and the handlers would intervene. I graduated college and had a great life for a while but they took everything i own  and eventually made me homeless.They even subjected me to rocky mnt spotted fever and almost killed me but thankfully J convinced them to bring me to her. I had been sick for weeks and miraculously started to heal when I got around her. They again saw this and put me in jail on false charges where I got pretty sick again. This was there attempt to kill me so that I would not speak out. I&#39;m still looking for J. If she is out there and sees this I want her to know I love her and we will get our justice soon!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of gangstalking is to force you to engage in antisocial or dangerous behavior, which gives them fair cause to imprison or hospitalize you. Hold on to your truth, try journaling in a secure manner to process your frustration or anxieties. Don&#39;t &quot;appear crazy&quot;, just hold on to your soul and try to live your life based on your decisions. I highly recommend some kind of spiritual study. Something that will help you understand the depth of your human experience and what/why someone would engage in evil acts. They are fucking with you and they will tire if you&#39;re stronger than their tactics. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re insane. I think this happens FAR more than it is reported. </p>
