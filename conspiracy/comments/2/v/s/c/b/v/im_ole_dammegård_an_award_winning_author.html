        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For more than 30 years I have worked very hard on solving the mystery behind the assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, something that has turned out to be a very dangerous task and has cost the lives of some dear friends. </p>

<p>Not only do I humbly believe that I&#39;ve now managed to solve one of the centuries&#39; biggest murder mysteries, my extensive research has also revealed incredible links to other big political &#39;events&#39; like the killing of JFK, John Lennon, Robert Kennedy, Che Guevara, Salvador Allende, Pablo Neruda and many others as well as the cold-blooded sinking of m/s Estonia, taking almost 1000 innocent lives.</p>

<p>I have made hundreds of international radio interviews on stations like Red Ice Creations, The People&#39;s Voice, Project Camelot, No Lies Radio, and The Real Deal, etc, which has caused a tidal wave of international interest. </p>

<p>I am totally dedicated to revealing the New World Order&#39;s agenda including False Flag-operations all over the world. It is important for me to point out that I am not here to spread fear by exposing the truth in whatever form it takes. My goal is to prevent the so called Global Elite from turning this beautiful world into a scary, controlled and fearful place. We all deserve so much better - it&#39;s time to stop the madness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Spiritual Gangster,
Olof Palme was the Swedish Prime minister. I have written a book called Coup d&#39;état in Slowmotion, it is almost 900 pages long, explaining the extremely complex case in great detail. You can find it here <a href="http://www.lightonconspiracies.com/coup.html">www.lightonconspiracies.com/coup.html</a> . I have also done a 9 hour long interview for Red Ice Creations which can be found in my membership area here <a href="http://lightonconspiracies.com/memberarea/membership-account/membership-levels/">http://lightonconspiracies.com/memberarea/membership-account/membership-levels/</a> . I wish I could have given you a simple answer, but this case is a complex and multilayered as the JFK assassination.</p>

And I got it confirmed as soon as they started naming Bin Laden as the guilty one, before any kind of evidence had come forward. And as soon as they started talking about this very abstract concept of starting a &quot;War on Terror&quot;, I felt for sure that this might be the major event many researchers had feared for a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe they have been identified (some of them).  They also do not seem to be static.   In order for there to be an &quot;elite few&quot; that are pulling the strings they would have one criteria above all that must be true of them.  1) Regardless of what government, politician, figurehead, is in power they are still present and able to influence the actions and sometimes demand the actions of that &quot;governance&quot;.   They must survive and persist beyond governments.</p>

<p>With that you can find out who some of them are, but this criteria means that others COULD potentially join their ranks.</p>

<p>Ask yourself some questions:</p>

<p>1) Do you know of any people that have been around regardless of which president is in power, which party is in power, who are able to get an audience with the government at any time and are known to have significant lobbying, banking, or otherwise influential power?</p>

<p>2) Do any of these people from question 1 go back decades, centuries, etc?</p>

<p>How can they NOT be the elite few if they can influence EVERY supposed ruler, yet they themselves are unelected, and by using the rulers as a proxy they do not get their own hands dirty as far as the public is concerned, and thus they have an unelected eternal position of power and influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I leave them alone, you can never reach to them, unless the &#39;open the door from the inside&#39;. All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident. Focus on yourself, inform yourself, stay balanced, loving, live as an example, show that you can handle this type of dark information without getting depressed or hateful. Only then can you really make a difference. When spreading very negative information it is so easy to spread fear, which is exactly what the forces behind the New World Order does everything in its power to create. And when people see who you really are and start respecting you - that&#39;s when they will start listening.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like events are coming to a head, and it seems like things are ramping up across multiple fronts (arming Ukraine, ISIL propaganda and the AUMF proposed, Cyber attack conditioning, et cetera).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not in the prediction business but fear they are going to try something soon.  The only way I feel we can combat this type of control mechanism is to carefully and critically analyze all news coverage of such an Event, and demand sources and urge those that run things to not fall for a reactionary solution.</p>

<p>My question is - is there a medium set up to crowd source these type of spontaneously-occuring events used to control us, and disseminate the truth? Because I think we all know by now that our media is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James,
I don&#39;t think there is any &#39;crow source&#39; used, but we are looking at the so called Elite, I prefer calling them the Minority, using what I believe to be the same team to carry out a lot of these false flags globally. See it like if it was a rock group doing a world tour. I do believe we are seeing the same background extras, the same teams taking care of logistics, and the same core group setting it all up. Doesn&#39;t matter if it is a &#39;mass shooting&#39; in Ottawa, Peshawar, Sydney, Sandy Hook, Boston or Paris. they will have local backup everywhere, and will most probably be flown around in military planes, landing in secrecy on military bases, etc. Media is for sure NOT to be trusted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy the world tour reference.</p>

<p>It&#39;s especially poignant as you really do have to look at these geopolitical events (just because Charlie Hebdo was in France, doesnt mean it&#39;s not geopolitical) because they have geopolitical reactions and solutions, like the suppression of free speech and internet controls in affected countries.</p>

<p>I think their media control is far more sophisticated compared to 9/11, and they&#39;ve even got the newsreaders warned to stay with the program considering what they did with Brian Williams (sacrificial lamb, IMO).</p>

<p>How hard would it be to set up a crowd-sourced spot free of moderation and censorship? That could be mobilized when an Event is being propagated?</p>

<p>I believe you have expressed the idea before that you believe Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley were killed because of their ability to unite people - do you think there may have been other reasons as well?  To me the motivation for political assassinations can be ascertained fairly easily with some context, but when entertainers are killed these questions seem a little more difficult to address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are more or less always more than just one reason when we are talking about assassinations on this level. But I believe that one of the main reasons why Mahatma Gandhi, JFK, Lady DI, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Kennedy, JFK Jr., John Lennon and Bob Marley got taken out was because of their POPULARITY. They were LOVED BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS, which put them in a position where they could accomplish REAL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER in the world. This was what the NWO deeply feared.</p>

<p>Are you aware of JFK Jr&#39;s Assasination? Or MLK&#39;s and Malcolm X&#39;s? <a href="http://rense.com/general78/reas.htm">http://rense.com/general78/reas.htm</a></p>

<p>Are you aware that if Germany had won WW2, none of the conspiracies or wars of today would have happened? CIA, Mossad, MI5, Israel, Russia, Vietnam, Rothschild, Assassinations, 9/11, The Middle East, ect.</p>

<p>Can you explain John Lennon&#39;s assassination? There was a conspiracy behind that? </p>

<p>Can you explain ms/ Estonia for me? First time I&#39;ve heard about it.</p>

<p>Actually if you don&#39;t have time, you can just source me some links for me to look at :D</p>

<li><p>This is very possible. At the same time, so much new information is coming out now, showing that we have been totally duped regarding WWII and the &#39;Nazi&#39; war machine, the concentration camps its. So many layers of lies that we now have to un-ravel. What today would have looked like had Germany won, I can only speculate.</p></li>

<p>I very much appreciate the links you shared from Dr. Judy Wood and the film September Clues; and I look forward to viewing them this afternoon.</p>

<p>Indeed, the disparity between the interviews which were aired on TV and the first person commentary that can be heard on some of the &quot;raw video&quot; which came out in subsequent years in startling; mostly with regards to the amount of folks in the &quot;raw clips&quot; who talk about hearing (and feeling) massive explosions as the towers fell. </p>

<p>I also very much appreciate the James Corbett clip you included at the end. He did a wonderful job with that video and was kind enough to have also participated in an AMA with us in the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know the red house report you are referring to. Regarding Nazis still being around... The OSS / CIA was built in cooperation with hardened Nazis imported via Operation Paperclip. So was NASA and the CDC and many other major companies, still very big and powerful, sometimes under new company names. In my humble opinion, the NWO could just as well be called The Forth Reich. So yes, I think &#39;Nazism&#39; or a very similar corrupt mindset is still very alive and thriving.</p>

<p>This is the intelligence report that is commonly referred to as the red house report.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the NWO may as well be called the 4th Reich.  I think that its the 4th Reich not just because the name sounds deliciously evil based upon what the 3rd Reich did, I think the NWO is a literal continuation of the Nazi power structure that existed during the 3rd Reich.</p>

<p>I also believe that Hitler was nothing more than the equivalent of the POTUS today in that power structure.  Anyone who believes that the POTUS is the most powerful man in America are just as silly as all these people who think that Hitler was the most powerful man in Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Powerful people lost their desire to be public figures when poor people started chopping their heads off, and that was long before Hitler.</p>

<li>I am the wrong person to ask, since I have not focused on this area. But more and more Chinese people have been invited to their secret meetings.</li>
<li>Once again, my main focus over the years have been to expose the methods used, as well as the identifying the assassins, so it is better if you ask another more knowledgeable expert about this.</li>
<li>I believe we have to re-learn this part of history as well. A lot of facts are pointing towards that we have been fed absolute lies regarding WWII.

Jews are victims of Zionists too.
Zionists hijacked Judaism and Jewish people in order to create their own country and wealth in Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I leave them alone, you can never reach to them, unless the &#39;open the door from the inside&#39;. All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident. Focus on yourself, inform yourself, stay balanced, loving, live as an example, show that you can handle this type of dark information without getting depressed or hateful. Only then can you really make a difference. When spreading very negative information it is so easy to spread fear, which is exactly what the forces behind the New World Order does everything in its power to create.
