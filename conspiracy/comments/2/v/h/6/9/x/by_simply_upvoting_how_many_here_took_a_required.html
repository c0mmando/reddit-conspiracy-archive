<p>This is his &quot;belief&quot;, and it&#39;s stupid and makes little sense. He&#39;s trying to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look bad, he&#39;s one of those guys.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a &#39;&#39;clever&#39;&#39; way to ask for up votes for sure.  We mass read text and do the exact same exercises in all of the classes, that is how school works, with less of that as you get older and more variation.  Some subjects inherently have less and more variation allowed in process and results.  in my comp Sci courses they were pretty free form at the high school level.  My teacher didn&#39;t mind me coding in extra features and tweaking the ui and such on the assignments.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Programming for what and how? By what mechanisms.</p>

<p>Are you implying that they were employing observational tools on children in computer classes?</p>

<p>How would that have been done on the computers which the schools owned which you can prove were not rigged up with any surveillance equipment in any manner?</p>

<p>I know of schools that still actually have apple 2E computers.</p>

<p>None of the school faculty was ever there writing down any form of data either or gathering it from any machine.</p>

<p>Why would they need to gather data for programming people from children in computer classes when they had already done extensive psycho-analytical research on people and have already proven many mechanisms of mind programming through television?</p>

<p>What does the refresh rate have to do with it, how does that work in?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the mass reciting the same text, which is also done in church, clubs and meetings, concerts, classroom book reading, and many other places?</p>

<p>THE FINAL QUESTION.</p>

<p>What evidence is there of the capability of presence of input analysis on the computers in the schools at the time of the eighties and nineties?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to ask a vague question with no explanation as to why which forces you to open the whole post, then be prepared to flesh out your entire supposition.</p>

<p>Please answer every single question I have asked, otherwise you are just wasting all of our time with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The programming has always been OBEY and CONSUME, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but that is programming that is used frequently. It is not the only form of &quot;programming&quot;, however, and has not always been the method employed.</p>

<p>Obey? Yes. Consume? Not so much, but that&#39;s besides the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To not question authority, not investigate alternative theories, that the whole point of public schools is the standardized system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes but their indoctrination centers are not 100% effective, for example I am here and you are here, I went through their whole &quot;education&quot; indoctrination system, clearly it failed as I still don&#39;t believe in their bullshit nonsense theories that can&#39;t be proved like evolution and their other bullshit theories that are constantly being disproved like the &quot;big bang&quot; just was.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never listened to their bullshit theoretical unproven based on partial evidence theories, what a waste of time that proves no benefit to your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s subtle and ingrained</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ingrained? More like inherent. Subtle? Not whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing subtle about the &quot;YOU WILL ATTEND COLLEGE&quot; propaganda they plaster every inch of their walls with starting from Kindergarten all the way up through the end of high school.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so that individual teachers don&#39;t recognize they are reinforcing messages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stupid ones don&#39;t, but that&#39;s just the thing, teachers are humans just like everybody else. The smart ones damn well know what is going on, and that&#39;s the reason why there are so many stupid teachers, because smart people don&#39;t become teachers because they don&#39;t want to be a part of the indoctrination system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The social conditioning is through &quot;science&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you couldn&#39;t tell by what I&#39;ve said about evolution and the &quot;big bang&quot; theory which has now been disproved ( I always knew it was bullshit because I am a Christian and I know THE TRUTH in that God created the universe intelligently and not by chaos ), I know. &quot;Science&quot; is indoctrination to condition people into accepting a world view set so that they will go along with the demands of the globalists.</p>

<p>People think that this &quot;science&quot; is liberating them, but it is truly the means to their further enslavement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>education, &quot;acceptable&quot; entertainment, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, this is all very obvious to anybody with half of a brain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m implying that the surveillance is deep, yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are implying that it is FAR too deep, as they have absolutely nothing beneficial to gain from gathering the progress data of new typists learning to type. What insight will that give them on how to more effectively program people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why else have testing at yearly intervals, to track the learning of individual students, especially the &quot;gifted&quot; students?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See now this I can get behind. I do feel that they keep tabs on individuals who show promise to be of use to them. The yearly testing though is actually to track the student progress to ensure that the teaching methods are effective, and now so that the schools stay funded because if you&#39;re not actually teaching kids then you&#39;re not getting money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The technology used by the government is reported to be at least 10 years ahead of general use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard more around 2 or 3 generations ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so what&#39;s to say even programmers/hackers would recognize the means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What means would they use to gather any form of useful data from an HP computer running Mario teaches typing? Did they use a special version that sends info back automatically, on computers that aren&#39;t online..........</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As one user here stated, he played around with the networked computers. How many people actually have the access to the computers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did and so did every other person in the building who could walk into the library. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting at here, besides maybe that since you can&#39;t tell that somebody may have gone on it you can&#39;t tell that it wasn&#39;t tampered with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, AT&amp;T IT techs weren&#39;t even aware/informed that the NSA has special access to their servers?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking idiots should have known, as it&#39;s been public knowledge that the NSA spys on all forms of electronic communications across the entire globe, this fact was revealed in 1991 and I believe before then as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The refresh rate could induce a hypnotic or receptive state. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could. Could you provide any support to that claim?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mass reciting is key to programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah duh, cult indoctrination 101, you do know who you&#39;re speaking with here right?</p>

<p>You know I&#39;ve been here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a little over 4 years, I&#39;m 25, and I know everything you&#39;re saying already.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re wrong on this one though, I do not think they were using typing classes for anything but teaching kids typing because they full well knew the future was going to require people to type on computers every day at work.</p>

<p>If you can provide actual substantive evidence to support your theory of typing class being used for anything but typing, then I will change my stance.</p>

<p>Otherwise, this is all just speculation that quite frankly makes this place look crazy when there are obvious examples of programming that are much more easily explained and shown to people so that they do not instantly reject the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First rule of reddit is don&#39;t ask for upvotes. And that&#39;s ridiculous, because I took several typing classes and they just string words together. Taking a typing class is one of the best things I did in high school, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t know how to change margins in word, or be able to type nearly as fast as I think. I downvoted and reported because your title is stupid, and your idea is even stupider. I understand it&#39;s a great opportunity for what you&#39;re suggesting but I can tell you&#39;ve never taken one of these classes because I&#39;m pretty sure typing zebra won&#39;t indoctrinate me to do anything. </p>

<p>(Sideshow reason: you failed the turing test. Your grammar did not convince me that you were human. )</p>

<p>Fucker, tell me you can operate an abacus. 
Tell me you do not have an electronic calculator. 
Tell me you at least have basic proficiency in the math required to do calculations of three digits or less in your head. </p>

<p>I learned how to calculate in my head. 
I learned how to use an abacus, and became quite good at it. </p>

<p>You want to rail against computer classes? Fine. </p>

<p>Do not blame the computer. The computer is a thing of beauty, The computer is immaculate. I can still remember how we had the first computers in school. how the elite stayed longer, to get acess to the spare ressources. To compile code they had written with their hand, on paper, because their parents did not have a few thousand to spare. 
I remember the rush of sucess when by year two of my computer classes, I was more profficcient in IT networking then the dedicated system administrator. By year three, we usd side channels to chat during classes, as they became mandatory. We did not need to learn how to type with ten fucking fingers, we managed to get by on two. </p>

<p>Because we cared. </p>

<p>Shit, computer classes are to make sure that you at least have basic level marketable skills. I know, your poem analysis is marketable. I know, the way ou have to write will make it into the newspapers of the world. </p>

<p>Do you care one bit for what you learn in computer classes? </p>

<p>In art class, we learned how to mix acid for etchings. late at the evening, We would bring a chip and a microscope to the arts lab, etch off the layers, and photograph the electric conductors, gates and bridges. . </p>

<p>Arts taught me iconography. I used that to make ascii art for my fellow students, when graphical interfaces were too uncommon. </p>

<p>I learned english entirely from reading way too many computer hndbooks, and researching every word I did not know in the english to german dictionary. </p>

<p>I learned math when we discovered, by our selves, how binary addition worked. How it was possible to substract and add with just cables. </p>

<p>Fuck. Just fiddling with the computer taught me more skills then any teacher I had. That wanted me to do poem interpretations, wanted me to write what I thought about social injustice, and so forth. </p>

<p>I can literally trace half my ernings in my current job back to one evening when the inofficial computer club met in the lab, gathered around the only computer, opened a can of cheep bear the onl one of us with an upper lip fuzz had brought to this, and went, &quot;Lets install this copy of basic and see what all the fuzz was about. &quot;</p>

<p>Fucker, I type my 60 words using two finger power speed. I can go up to 75 in a hurry, but heck, back then, it was enough, and today, it is enough. </p>

<p>Dude, if you do not like learning to type, fine. 
I still remember having to write the same sentence 50 times on the blackboard, because I did something wrong. </p>

<p>If you really dislike learning things so much, then why don&#39;t you, for a change, try to ask the &quot;alternative&quot; people, the ones that are not &quot;min controlled by the fucking man, man&quot; to tell you how many make thjeir way without what they learned?</p>

<p>If you really thought that way, ou would take your apple device out of your pocket, and piss on it, go home, take your computer, piss on it, and live in the woods.  </p>

<p>But sadly, you are just an other byproduct of generation pretentious. </p>

<p>The reddit browsing, upvote hungry, iphone having, ironic glasses wearing, starbucks slurping, big business cursing, games playing, not having worked a day in their lives, alternative rock listening, social justice promoting, himalaya salt buying, facebook using faceless masses. </p>

<p>I have hope for you., Do what you want. But if you care about upvotes, and go, OMG, I am so controversial, I will post something about masses repeating that I once got while mommy drove me to soccer practive after glassblowing class, thgen sorry, kid. </p>

<p>Show the ability to devellop independant thought first, maybe then you will be taken seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny little story about Keyboarding class:</p>

<p>Our high school classroom had a bunch of Windows 98SE machines that used Novell NetWare for login and application distribution. This allowed them to lock down the machines and give students the ability to only pick from approved applications (instead of a full desktop).</p>

<p>I was already a pretty adept QBASIC programmer and was starting to get my feet wet with Visual Basic. I would finish the keyboaring exercises early and play around with Visual Basic via Microsoft Office (VBA).</p>

<p>Since we did not have assigned computers, I would save the &quot;Word&quot; document with the interactive VBA form on the shared network drive. This way I could access and update it from any computer in the school (class, library, etc).</p>

<p>It started out with more &quot;gag&quot; features like open/close CD drive and sending network messages via WinPopup. Eventually it became a launcher for AIM, ICQ, MSN, and a host of other &quot;forbidden&quot; applications. (Novell would let you install the apps but it wouldn&#39;t display or execute them from the launcher itself.)</p>

<p>One day I was called to the office and I was walking there thinking &quot;what could they possibly be calling me there for?&quot; When I walked in the office I saw the principal with the system admin. Turns out I stored my &quot;Word&quot; document on the <strong>student</strong> shared drive, <strong>not</strong> my personal shared one... Oops! Apparently some other students found it and started using it so they traced it back to me.</p>

<p>I was scolded pretty heavily by the school and they did delete the file, warning me to never do such a thing again or I&#39;d lose computer privileges. I wasn&#39;t too worried about the VBA cause &quot;we&quot; (the nerds) had moved to VNCing our home computers instead (over HTTP and Java plugin, no app required!).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During my time in elementary school I would use the computers every single day. I loved it because I felt like I was being challenged, then I went on to master computer usage like I&#39;m sure many others here have. I see the conspiracy in a lot of things but this is just not one of those things. Computers are necessary for our advancement in this world, if we want to become connected and eventually liberated out of this system for good. We program computers, computers do not program us. Computers will become a necessary tool for the inevitable revolution of this world (us vs <em>them</em>) therefore we should learn everything we can about computers, programming, mechanics, engineering, communications, networking, etc. At this stage I do hope people aren&#39;t looking at computers as something that will &quot;program&quot; us, that&#39;s just asinine thinking...we program them, we control them and they cannot and will not control us if we don&#39;t let them.</p>
