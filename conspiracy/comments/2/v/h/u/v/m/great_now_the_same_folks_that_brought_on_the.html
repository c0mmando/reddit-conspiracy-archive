<p>This is a pretty fair examination of Mark Gold&#39;s claims. I would agree that the circumstances of that study (from 1977) wouldn&#39;t be accepted today, but that hardly qualifies as proof of some incompetence.</p>

<p>No one likes corporations but parroting this nonsense from a holistic snake oil salesman just seems silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as long as we are naming logical fallacies...</p>

<p>Even if you reject that the FDA claims amount to strong evidence (and the FSA claims...and the CFIA claims...and the FSAus claims...and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17828671">this</a> metastudy...), you still cannot make a positive claim that Aspartame is harmful without substantive evidence of your own - and considering the weight of the evidence you have rejected, your own must be absolutely extraordinary. The burden of proof lies upon those who make a positive claim. I believe that Aspartame is safe to consume, because I yield to the weight of evidence, but you are perfectly within logical rights to claim the evidence does not satisfy you, leaving you with a null hypothesis (that there is not yet sufficient evidence to support Aspartame as being either safe or unsafe). In order to make a claim that it is NOT safe, you need evidence of your own that objectively outweighs that of your opposition.</p>

<p>Fruits contain a sugar called fructose, which is what gives them their sweetness.</p>

<p>You may be thinking of methanol, which aspartame metabolizes into (~10% by weight). Methanol is also created by the body when consuming fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>The difference is that natural sources of methanol typically carry along ethanol with them, balancing out (methanol poisoning is cured by consuming ethanol). However, aspartame has no ethanol, thus can lead to methanol (ADH into formaldehyde) poisoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypothetical but what if some of the sicknesses we have been seeing on the rise in recent decades (heart disease, cancer, obesity, autism, etc.) are in some way linked to the massive increase in artificial sweeteners?  It isn&#39;t like people need to be dropping dead from a can of Coke for there to be some issues with the products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not a lot of mystery here; Cancer rates go up in direct proportion to longevity. Heart disease and obesity, aside from going hand-in-hand with each other, are pretty much in lockstep with diet(Japan doesn&#39;t have the same rates as us and it&#39;s fairly clearly due to diet). Every scholarly article I&#39;ve seen regarding autism links it with older sperm and eggs(people waiting longer to have kids).</p>

<p>Look if someone did some studies and there was some science behind it it could be true, but I don&#39;t see that, I see people who already don&#39;t like artificial sweeteners looking for a way to demonize something they already hate.</p>

<p>It happens everywhere and no one talks about it.. SO WE MUST bow before the throne and altar of &quot;the scientific community&quot;(lol) because in all reality, their jobs depend on parroting mediocrity that gets funding... not to mention the egos at play in the grant system itself...</p>
