<p>There&#39;s so much being covered up right now that any of these guys could have been chafing under the veil of what we&#39;re not being told -- 9/11? Jeffrey Epstein? Global pedophile ring? Ukraine Coup? </p>

<p>Who knows? Brian Williams is such a pretty boy zero, I doubt he was on to anything serious. But Carr, Simon, Kroft, even Jon Stewart, were serious forces in news and &quot;news.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just read the times article on Carr and the wiki article on Sun News.  Do you have any kind of connection other than both of them seizing to exist?  It feels pretty unrelated to me although it is strange that all these + the Brian Williams scandal have occurred in such a proximity.  Carr didn&#39;t look very healthy at 58, to me, anyway.  Everything I&#39;m reading just says &#39;he collapsed&#39; in an NYT newsroom.  Lots of things can cause a sudden collapse.  I&#39;m not on board without more evidence, but i&#39;ll keep an eye out.</p>

<p>EDIT: yeah Ned Colt, AND Carr had just given a talk about &#39;Citizenfour&#39;, the Snowden film, before his collapse. hmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>more facts to be linked in -</p>

<p>Murdoch overpaid for the rights to English Football last week -
Awards Season is when media studios really lay out their ad rates -
Stewart also dropped out -
Also the Sun dropped its Page-3 girl -</p>

<ul>
<li>My guess is Murdoch had to pay a price for Message Hacking - so he cut a deal with the FCC and the UK to avoid further litigation -</li>
</ul>

<p>in return he got to keep his valuable properties and the access to power they all provide -</p>

<p>I think the media guys who all went out this week were killed or compromised by the Russian SRV  - and the Russians thought they could play full-spectrum hybrid warfare in America by taking out key opposition media -</p>

<p>Except the Russians have no idea what oppo media is, and by sheer incompetency they think that anybody who publishes an opinion must therefore be taking bribes or deliberately smearing on behalf of some previous bribe-</p>

<p>Simon revealed that the Bush White House knew there were no WMDs</p>

<p>Carr most recently was a big cheerleader for The Interview -</p>

<p>Stewart probably cheated on his wife -</p>

<p>Williams probably had no Russian contact - probably anonymous Russian money funded whichever Veterans Group NGO began the takedown -</p>

<p>Much in the way the Russians saw how the murder of Anna Politkovskaya complicated Putin&#39;s political life, I assume the Russians thought the same would happen if they began to target key figures in US media -</p>

<p>The error occurs when it turns out that US Media is a commercial enterprise, and subject to many, many layers of scrutiny - no one agency or organization can prop up or take down one voice -</p>

<p>so the Russians keep killing as the Kremlin negotiates Ukraine and Crimea business in a panic over last weekend - </p>

<p>but the Russian killings are wide of the mark each and every time because the Russians don&#39;t realize that in the US, nobody cares about Russia or Putin very much, and nobody really pays attention -</p>

<p>While back home in Russia, because of the propaganda model in place, Russia&#39;s population has been mobilized to think constantly about Obama and the United States - </p>

<p>and the unspoken assumption is &quot;if we in Russia are always fixated on enemy number one, then enemy number one must therefore be equally fixated on Russia&quot;</p>
