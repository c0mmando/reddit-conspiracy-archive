        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by first saying, I personally do not doubt the authenticity of any of the Apollo moon landings, or the historical accuracy of any particular aspect of human space exploration; I once considered it <em>possible</em> that the moon landing/s had been faked (many years ago, before I was better educated on the science of spaceflight), but never with any serious conviction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about one thing however, which is something that only a moon-landing doubter could answer, and that is: do you only doubt that the first manned moon landing occurred (Apollo 11), or do your doubts extend to other space missions, manned or otherwise? Specifically, do you doubt that the other manned moon landings occurred? (Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17). I wonder this because I have often heard of the Apollo 11 landing discussed as possibly being a fake / conspiracy, but never any other of the manned lunar landings to my recollection (this is possibly because I normally don&#39;t go out of my way to learn details of conspiracy theories).</p>

<p>Please explain your beliefs and reasoning in as much detail as you like, because I am very keen to hear it!</p>

<p>Note also that I may have follow-up questions; in which case I promise to be respectful of any and all beliefs expressed on the subject of this post.</p>

<p>OK. Well, you were close.</p>

<p>Yes, the Apollo Missions were fake.</p>

<p>But we def have the technology to go to any planet we want. Our solar system, or not. </p>

<p>We dont have the capability to send men to the moon and back in the present day because A) we don&#39;t have a working rocket powerful enough (Saturn V was retired), and B) because sufficient funding has not been made available to the appropriate agencies for the development of a contemporary moon mission and appropriate launcher, though there are a few launchers in development on the near horizon like (China) Long March 9, (USA) SLS/Orion, and (USA SpaceX) BFR/MCT...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be of the opinion that perhaps some of the footage was faked, but that we &quot;definitely went&quot;. Why did I think we definitely went? I think perhaps it was just because it was easier to swallow.</p>

<p>I looked into it again recently, and particularly on reading this entertaining and highly informative chronicle <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html">&quot;Wagging the Moondoggie&quot;</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s really long (13 parts) and the HTML is shit, but I found it a really worthwhile read. It covers so many inexplicable anomalies about all the missions that by the end, one is left feeling like there&#39;s no hope to continue believing the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never looked into the Lunar landings, but I&#39;ve heard that Russian scientists at the time believed it to be impossible because of inadequate radiation shielding. </p>

<p>But this recent story caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, secretly took home a bag of mementos from the mission including the camera used to film his &quot;one small step&quot; and the planting of the US flag on the lunar surface. </p>

<p>The white cloth storage bag itself was known as a &quot;McDivitt purse&quot; and, along with its contents, was supposed to have been left in the Eagle lunar module and destroyed. </p>

<p>It was not unusual for astronauts to keep small surplus pieces of equipment from their missions as personal mementos.</p>

<p>Experts have surmised that Armstrong decided to take the camera and other objects home for sentimental reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The van Allen belts.  External to the protective layers of the Earth.  The heat at such altitudes/space is unbelievably hot.  The noon, in the sun was also unbelieveably hot.  Using the air cooling tech they claimed to have used doesn&#39;t begin to explain how hot/cold reactions could have occurred where water fizzles and dissipates.  Evaporation of water in a vacuum?  This doesn&#39;t provide adequate cooling whatsoever.  The math and science doesn&#39;t add up.   Their heaters for the trip the 290k miles makes a little sense.  Another great topic is how they suited up to enter the moon&#39;s maurina.  Using the same cool/hot management utkilites.</p>

<p>What sealed it for me, and mind you, I want you to learn what you believe to be real I&#39;m your own.  Of your own free will. The interior of the craft physically could not allow suit up, egress, and reentry for the boots in the wet dust time.</p>

<p>With all of the fatal proveable errors, having done nothing above low earth since, and knowing now we&#39;re away more time than they originally invested to make it, for us to now make it.</p>

<p>Why do they worship the timecube Satan?  Is space real?  Are planets Real.  With the moon the way it is, we don&#39;t have a single photograph of any probe turning out from to earth to captue both the earth and the moon in the same shot. Why wouldn&#39;t they simply snap a pic?  We&#39;ve only ever seen composities.  again, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thermal conduction and radiation in a vacuum don&#39;t work the way you seem to think they do... solar radiation is conducted into objects in vacuum so inefficiently that they will always get colder unless they are generating it from their own sources, but they also lose heat very slowly depending on the mechanisms available for thermal radiation, which is why astronauts inside their highly insulated suits require active heat removal systems to prevent them from cooking in their own built-up body heat.</p>

<p>Im not sure what you mean about the interior of the craft (which one) not allowing suitup, egress and reentry? perhaps you can clarify what you mean.</p>

<p>I cant parse your third paragraph at all.</p>

<p>Timecube, Satan, what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth&#39;s moon has a very weak magnetic field, but its not a dipolar magnetic field such as the one which generates Earth&#39;s magnetosphere.</p>

<p>The only planets besides Earth that have a magnetosphere are the gas giants, and the only moon in the solar system that has a dipolar magnetic field is Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede, though it is well within Jupiter&#39;s much stronger magnetosphere so it doesnt have Earth&#39;s characteristic interaction with solar particles.</p>

<p>The Command Module and Lunar Expedition Module offered sufficient protection from solar radiation (and that of the Earth&#39;s van-allen radiation belts) to its occupants from its aluminium hull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sure the VA radiation belts would have been a bad place to hang around in, but that&#39;s not what happened on the Apollo missions; the trajectory taken through the belts was relatively brief to deliberately limit radiation exposure - read here: <a href="http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/Algebra1/3Page7.pdf">http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/Algebra1/3Page7.pdf</a> - a lethal radiation dose is 300 rads in 1 hour, but the astronauts were exposed to only 2 rads over 6 days, and even outside the craft where it was unshielded, the trip through the VA radiation belts only involved exposure to 11.4 rads in under 1 hour.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dr. James Van Allen has personally refuted claims that the radiation exposure to the astronauts during the Apollo missions would have been fatal; <a href="http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html">http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got one for you, and this goes for <em>all</em> Apollo missions.</p>

<p>How is it possible that there&#39;s no time lag between mission control speaking and one of the astronaut&#39;s speaking?  The Apollo craft was supposed to have been well over 220,000 miles away. Assuming speed of light travel (around 186,000 mile per second), the radio waves carrying the sound <em>should</em> have taken about 1.25 seconds to reach the Moon, and then a reply from the astronaut would take the same time to come back. There should therefore be a definite, obvious, even annoying pause of over 2 seconds between Mission Control speaking and an astronaut replying.  But there isn&#39;t. The only pauses are natural pauses, while someone thinks or is distracted.  Most of the time the two groups are speaking in real time with no lag whatsoever.</p>

<p>Explain to me how that&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>And all through these videos, at least some of them, the Lunar Module&#39;s descent engine is supposedly running at near full throttle in the background yet can&#39;t be heard on any of the recordings.  Again, how is that possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It likely you&#39;ve only watched / heard edited clips with the delays removed... if the audio were faked, wouldnt it have been recorded with pauses included? its not like the delay due to distance wasnt expected by NASA, and explained contemporaneously to the general public.</p>

<p>Im not sure why you expect the LM&#39;s engine to be audible on the inside of the cabin... a rocket engine acting on a vacuum doesnt produce noise, because sound waves cant promulgate through a vacuum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because there&#39;s a vacuum outside the ship, it&#39;s not simply the interaction of the expelled gas in air that produces sound on account of turbulence, it&#39;s the high-velocity expulsion of gas through the rocket that creates the sound &quot;inside&quot; the plume of escaping gas. Yes, you wouldn&#39;t hear it from outside the ship because there is no medium to transmit the sound, but inside the ship there is a continuum of non-vacuum that would adequately transmit the roar through the rocket engine itself ultimately to the inside the ship, where it would be heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rocket plume generated in a vacuum just doesnt act the same way as it would for a rocket firing in an atmosphere... there is no characteristic &#39;roar&#39; heard within the cabin because the force of the engine is entirely directed out, away from the ship, and the vibrations of the engine (if any) upon the ship&#39;s frame are negligible, assuming they can even be felt at all, but they are certainly inaudible.</p>

<p>What audio from inside the LEM I&#39;ve listened to demonstrated to me that the noise from the fans that circulate the cabin&#39;s air were also fairly loud, and could easily drown out a low-frequency hum such as that produced by an engine; the same has been reported by shuttle astronauts, who say the engine noise on launch drowns out everything and requires headphones to be bearable, but after they reach a decent altitude all they can hear are the air ventilation fans. Ive also read similar reports from high-altitude test pilots going fast enough, high enough through the upper atmosphere, who describe it as &#39;eerily silent&#39;.</p>
