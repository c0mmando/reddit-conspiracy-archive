    <div class="md"><p>Haha holy shit- letsgetmeta... Not to take away from the physical and mental abuse of the State literally owning you (IMO) ; but it is interesting how the politics and the psychology (macro/micro) of  &quot; personal growth &quot;  for most any significant positions of power within this contradictory socio-economic paradigm seem to be based on (mostly unspoken) <strong>principals of sociopathy , manipulation, coercion, violence and blackmail ect.</strong></p>

<p>Why cant we each work within our communities and espouse things like mutal benefit, cooperation, collaboration and non-violence ; working together to enable eachother with Open Source, emulation encouragement with this awesome web2.0 style AMA-TIL-FAQ-troubleshooting culture. We all have unique interests and skills; we each have unlimited potential to build a better civilization. Okay, jusy saying OS CIV BLD COOPS should be a thing- we gotta just start operating reality with a different programing language, if that metaphore makes sense...</p>

<p>I just think geographic limitations are stupid; lets collaborate and crowd-source fund our way with alt currencies, OS collaboration, and chartered mutual benefit projects ! (bygod!!) Haha damn what a rant this turned out to be -- INDIVIDUATED UNITY should be our mantra.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember that the most common crime that people are prosecuted for in federal court is Lying to a federal agent. Usually, it is something very trivial, but they can prove that you were recorded saying x, y, or z to agent M. The prosecutor then says &quot;Ladies and Gentleman of the jury, here we have documents showing that <a href="/u/dovakin422">/u/dovakin422</a> clearly knew it was actually x, y, and zede. He lied to a federal agent, minimum 18 months in prison. Case closed.</p>

<p>Also, remember there are 5 types of spies:  (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies. </p>

<p>Never let them manipulate you into becoming a doomed spy. Negotiate up your position if they make you an offer. Honestly, inward spy is the job you want to be put into. Never let them talk you into being a local spy without a high degree of compensation. Seriously, make yourself a political prostitute. You&#39;ll have a better life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Local Spies are the local <del>dopes</del> assets for an operation. They perform essential duties to make an op work and act as cannon fodder when the shit gets real.</p>

<p>Inward Spies are the middle managers of the enemy&#39;s organizational structure who have been turned to work for your operational objectives.</p>

<p>Converted Spies are the double agents who&#39;ve been caught, turned, and returned to work on your behalf and against their original masters.</p>

<p>Doomed or &quot;Dead&quot; Spies are those that are either intentionally or unintentionally exposed as spies to the enemy. They are often used to give credibility to disinformation and psychological warfare campaigns. Also, they are often used to increase the prestige and credibility of other spies that can use exposing a doomed spy to elevate his or her position within the enemy&#39;s ranks.</p>

<p>A Surviving Spy is any spy that succeeds in his or her mission while also living to fight another day (not a common expectation for spies as it turns out).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During an &quot;Investigation&quot;, the officer/agent will intentionally word questions in a way to get you to give up your rights, correct?</p>

<p><strong>&quot;You don&#39;t have anything illegal on your person or car right? Would you mind if I searched you car?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The above is 2 questions in 1 .. and if you answer <strong>&quot;NO&quot;</strong> then the officer can assume you answered both questions.</p>

<p>If you know your rights then you can stop the officer in his tracks, or at the very least force him to follow the laws to get probable cause to legally search.</p>

<p>So ya ... If by &quot;cute&quot; you actually mean being informed of your rights and exercising them.  It&#39;s cute.</p>

<p>Ok.  I believe, you believe this is legit.  The good thing here is that if it really was a SS agent that called you and asked you to come to them, they do not consider you a threat.</p>

<p>I would just chill, call them in the morning, and if it turns out to be real meet in a neutral environment.  Like a coffee shop. </p>

<p>They just want to scare you. Most likely you have not broken any laws at this point. But who knows what laws will be passed in the coming months. The feds are just getting accustomed to handling these cases, and eventually they can arrest people for &quot;hate speech&quot;, &quot;unlawful content&quot; on the internet, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I spoke to two FBI agents from the Atlanta Georgia area in 2003 after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (a newspaper which had a total circulation of over 1/2 million) published a short letter I wrote questioning the wisdom of attacking a tiny country without cause.</p>

<p>One of them agent told me, &quot;in war, we all have to be prepared to sacrifice some freedom for the security of our country.&quot;</p>

<p>That hit me like a ton of bricks; for two reasons:  1) I was under the lifelong impression that freedom was worth dying for and that was why soldiers died in wars, to defend that freedom and 2) I realized that if someone did follow through with those threats; say someone shot my cattle, burned my barn, or worse, much worse, I could not expect even the FBI to take my side, let alone the local constabulary or my neighbors.  </p>

<p>That scared me badly.  It was intended to.</p>

<p>I was alone.  And that, more than anything, changed the direction of my life in the Spring 2003.  I acted alone.  And two years later, in October 2005, without even giving notice to my employer, I moved my family and farm here to Canada.</p>

<p>No regrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was literally sitting on the toilet and saw a phone call coming in on my cell from an area code from the adjacent county. I figured it may be someone from my school or someone I know so I answered. He literally just said &quot;hello this is agent bla bla from the Secret Service&quot; and went on about setting up a time to talk. This is COMPLETELY out of the blue. I have absolutely no idea what this could be about and I have NEVER been contacted by law enforcement in this manner before.</p>

<p>edit: To add, he would not tell me what it was regarding over the phone. He insisted that it had to be in person. He said it was his &quot;hunch&quot; that it was probably nothing, and that at this point it is not a criminal investigation but he needs to &quot;wrap some things up&quot;. He claims it will only take about 20 minutes and he promises I will be walking out of there.</p>

<p>So basically, he called, said &quot;We want to talk to you&quot; and you didn&#39;t get anything out of him as to WHY?  All you got was &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything&quot;?</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I just wonder if this is as absolutely random as it totally seems by what you&#39;ve mentioned here.  I mean...on one level, it totally sounds like a random thing IF YOU DIDN&#39;T DO ANYTHING...but, considering I think most people feel that the secret service doesn&#39;t just go randomly contacting people for questioning, it <em>does</em> seem that they have some sort of &quot;extra&quot; reason to be contacting you in particular.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just trying to assess what that reason might be.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Anyone in your family/parents, siblings, etc that you think they might be going after?  Any friends you think they might be going after and want to question you about?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service">United States Secret Service</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service has two distinct areas of responsibility:</p>

<p><strong>Financial Crimes</strong>, covering missions such as prevention and investigation of counterfeiting of U.S. currency and U.S. treasury securities, and investigation of major fraud.[3]</p>

<p>Protection, which entails ensuring the safety of current and former national leaders and their families, such as the President, past presidents, vice presidents, presidential candidates, visiting heads of state, and foreign embassies.</p>

<p>Seems unlikely that they would be interested in talking with regarding their Protection Services, so it could well be work related.</p>

<p>Not really sure how scammers would think that would help over giving a fake address, because if you went in the SS might wonder who was trying to impersonate them and might investigate. Then again, if you were given a fake address you could be more likely to bring it to their attention. And maybe they&#39;d think that the SS would just think that someone working there called the wrong person and it would look like a mistake rather than someone trying to pull something? Yeah... it would be pretty ballsy to impersonate the SS in the first place, so that wouldn&#39;t seem too much of a stretch to try to make it look like an agent accidentally called the wrong person.</p>

<p>Well, even if it is really the SS, the situation is still something to be leery of. :P</p>

<p>I think there might be three options.

    <div class="md"><p>They probably want to interview you about someone in your circle making what could be construed as a threat against the president.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no lawyer, and the general rule of &quot;anything you say canand will be used against you&quot; is probably sound, but as far as I understand, the Secret Service is not in the habit of charging people who aren&#39;t guilty.  I would personally feel comfortable interviewing with the Secret Service.  </p>

<p>If you do feel that something YOU&#39;VE said could be construed as a threat or if their line of questioning seems to be headed towards accusatory- you need to lawyer up.</p>

<p>Do they also investigate identity theft and credit card fraud?</p>

<p>(Doesn&#39;t the US Secret Service officially apply to just the President&#39;s security?)</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service has two distinct areas of responsibility:</p>

<p>Financial Crimes, covering missions such as prevention and investigation of counterfeiting of U.S. currency and U.S. treasury securities, and investigation of major fraud.[3]</p>

<p>Protection, which entails ensuring the safety of current and former national leaders and their families, such as the President, past presidents, vice presidents, presidential candidates, visiting heads of state, and foreign embassies.</p>

<p>If you are an American then I would assume it is something financial.  You one of them whackadoo Rand Paul supporters son?  Know any?  Any that might have ... pissed you off in the past you might wanna tell them about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone here is mad paranoid but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s something harmless. What I think it is is that you used counterfeit cash and they want to ask you how you acquired said money. </p>

<p>Do you do drugs? Sell even? You don&#39;t have to answer just ask yourself. My friend was a drug dealer and the secret service left a note saying they want a meeting. He bugged out but it was only that he had used counterfeit cash by chance and they wanted to know how he got it. He told them from selling drugs and they were on their way continuing to trace it. </p>

<p>It sounds odd that the secret service contacted you but they actually handle counterfeiting. They&#39;re under the department of homeland security and treasury. </p>

<p>So yeah you probably accidentally used counterfeit cash and they are tracing it. They give zero fucks if you sell drugs or whatever as long as you aren&#39;t involved in the counterfeiting.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh and should you be detained, remember that our lovely Supreme Court recently ruled that you must positively assert your 5th amendment rights or they can continue questioning you. It&#39;s not enough to simply say &quot;no&quot; when they ask you if you will talk to them.  You have to actively invoke your Miranda rights: &quot;I wish to exercise my right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during any proceeding or questioning.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok.  I believe, you believe this is legit.  The good thing here is that if it really was a SS agent that called you and asked you to come to them, they do not consider you a threat.</p>
