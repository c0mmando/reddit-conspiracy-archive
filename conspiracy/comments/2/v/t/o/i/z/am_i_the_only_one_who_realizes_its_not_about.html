The media push, the framed pre-packaged dialectic; this is not about making sure people are vaccinated as much as it is about making sure they can utilize marketing, social pressure, and media to regulate and control their &#39;chattel&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Measles outbreaks in the U.S. are not uncommon.  This isn&#39;t the first and it won&#39;t be the last.  There is nothing special about this one over the last one or the next one.  Would it be nice if we could achieve 100 percent vaccination?  Sure, but even if we did there would still be outbreaks because we don&#39;t screen illegal immigrants, we don&#39;t screen foreign tourists, we don&#39;t screen returning American tourists, and the dirtiest secret about the measles vaccine is that it doesn&#39;t last forever.  If you haven&#39;t received a booster shot in the last decade or two, you stand a good chance of coming down with it if you are exposed.  Herd immunity gets a little dicey when the immunity expires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a shill-for-hire job posting.  Read the responsibilities carefully.  And the purveyors of the MMR vaccine (which is what the whole debate is about) are specific clients.</p>

<p>As for the link you posted, the US doesn&#39;t have information so that doesn&#39;t help.  This link <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries</a> is a little better for actually comparing the US with other countries, although the actual immunization rate will be higher since it really only touches on infant vaccinations.</p>

<p>edit: also, your link disagrees with mine, by understating.  Perhaps it is only considering specific vaccines as opposed to disease immunizations?  I don&#39;t know how to resolve this without a whole lot of digging, but neither link seems to have a vested interest in lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herd immunity would be a majority of people developing solid immunity through getting the measles virus naturally. As you can see through many outbreaks, the contamination rate is around 50/50 for unvaccinated vs vaccinated. The vaccines aren&#39;t working, and they are causing side effects to boot. </p>

<p>If it was about herd immunity, vaccine efficacy would be right up there with vaccination rates in the dialog. Mainstream media is not talking about efficacy or virus shedding, only slamming those who don&#39;t vaccinate as if that&#39;s the sole cause. We should be talking about how vaccines need to be made more efficient and safe, the scientific fraud disclosed, and what can be done to augment natural immunity. The media push seems to be about herd control, not critical analysis of the problem and strategic solutions. That&#39;s must my opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, &quot;proof&quot; is subjective. What exactly are the &quot;proven to be safe&quot; criteria? What&#39;s being measured after a vaccine is administered, and for how many years?</p>

<p>Reproductive anomaly rates?
Allergy sensitivity to other substances?
Effect on cancer rates?
Resistance to other disease and infection?
Effect on psychological health, &quot;brain chemical&quot; levels?
Auto-immune susceptibility like arthritis, psoriasis, etc?</p>

<p>The problem is, the &quot;debate&quot; on vaccines never brings these questions to the public discussion. Partly because the data&#39;s not there, partly due to some modern-day &quot;science&quot; arrogance, and partly due to someone&#39;s profit agenda.</p>

<p>Instead, the public debate against vaccines relies on nebulous assertions like freedom, privacy, individualism etc. While the argument for carries the notion vaccines are like a &quot;freebie&quot; for your body -- a magical, cheap solution to prevent disease!</p>

<p>There are legitimate, analytical tradeoffs and risks one should be aware of when making the decision to vaccinate and this almost never comes to light in the broader discussion.</p>

<p>Combined with big pharma&#39;s and the FDA&#39;s decades-long track record of mingling corporate interests with public health responsibility and you may understand why I&#39;m a bit skeptical, perhaps cynical on this topic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that the holistic/macro approach isn&#39;t ever brought up. Like how to grow and consume your own superfood, benefits of probiotics, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there is debate to be had and further research to be done before we can categorically state that each vaccine is safe. The issue I have noticed in a lot of the anti vax side&#39;s claims is they seem to think that &quot;Vaccines&quot; can be viewed and critiqued as a whole. This is about as inaccurate as critiquing drugs as a whole. &quot;Im not going to give my child medicine because my uncle did heroin and died&quot; is not an argument you should be proud of putting foreward. </p>

<p>When we look at the MMR vaccine, the studies have been done exhaustively by people with moneid interests in finding problems and proving the verracity of antivaxers claims, and they have found no negative effects in the current version. Its true that older vaccines had some slight side effects and negative interaction with certain scenarios (nothing on the scale or type of current antivaxer claims). These issues have been fixed. The fact is that there has been numerous studies on not just our current crop of vaccines but also much longer term and older studies on the effects of each of the component parts, to me, settles it. Claiming that a vaccine can give you autism or arthritis is tantamount to claiming your car can travel twice the speed of light if you put your dick in it. We know enough about all the component variables that it is utterly inconceivable that your assumptions could hold any water. Yet tests still have been done to (unsuccessfully) quiet the science illiterate.</p>

<p>Yes, big pharma has monied interests in vaccination. They stand to loose a huge amount of money in sales of medical supplies, hospital beds, drug sales and doctor-patient billable time, should vaccines become common. If you are wary of accepting vaccinations from a certain group of  fair enough, get them from a better source and have a conversation with several medical professionals about how to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make valid points and to counter; testing on modern vaccines (clinical trials) are no longer last long enough to document long-term effects before they are rushed to market.  These Big Pharma companies are not being open with the public about exactly what is in the vaccine (which is a practice that would never fly in <em>any</em> other industry) and if we are to be consumers we should have some better consumer protection than we currently do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Claiming that a vaccine can give you autism or arthritis is tantamount to claiming your car can travel twice the speed of light if you put your dick in it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While funny, assuming there are no side effects what-so-ever because the manufacturer and their paid shills told you so is tantamount to saying &quot;this poison is safe to drink because the person who made it told me so.&quot;  We know very little about what is in these injections because the info is kept from us by the manufacturer as a &quot;trade secret&quot;.  This is true of drugs, medical devices,etc.  Testing isn&#39;t about quieting the &quot;scientific illiterate&quot; (because that classification belongs to both sides) it is about knowing what is being injected into us.  A vaccine isn&#39;t just the protein sheaths of viruses prompting an immunological response.  The &quot;active&quot; ingredients only make up a small percentage of the whole.  So what is the rest of it?</p>

<p>I believe in the proper, informed use of vaccines that have been proven to work (polio, small pox, mumps, etc.), but I also believe that no one in the general public can trust these large corporations manufacturing this stuff.  Their sole goal is profit not humanity&#39;s well-being.  This whole issue isn&#39;t about vaccines, their effectiveness, or what/how they are made.  The real issue is whether or not one trusts these big corporate entities.  All the evidence I have seen shows these big corporations (all of them) to be untrustworthy.  And should you or anyone else decide the opposite, then I respect that choice.  The problem comes from people who insist I follow them regardless of my own views.  No one should trust any group that cares only for profit, ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientists are discovering new &quot;component variables&quot; every day. It&#39;s unknown how much we don&#39;t know about health. The old view of independent bodily systems operating in isolation is starting to give way to a macrobiotic understanding of the human body and its enormous complexity. Each blob of trillions of micro-machines all operating autonomously we call humans are very different to from person to person, diet to diet, environment to environment, on and on and on.</p>

<p>Hence I think it&#39;s a bit risky to rule out vaccine&#39;s long term effects on seemingly unrelated areas of study.</p>

<p>Remember when BPA was safe? Or cholesterol caused heart disease but sugar was fine? Or myriad other vaccines deemed safe? Or how about the slew of medical drugs you see reimbursement commercials for on TV every day? Or even penicillin which is technically &quot;safe&quot;, but its widespread use unpredictably caused a panacea of &quot;super germs&quot;? </p>

<p>The list goes on for decades. What about the new paradigm of scientific testing truly rules out health risks in the human body with any statistical significance? They don&#39;t, they just appear to be safe until some point in the future when we find out they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>We&#39;re learning, but slowly.</p>

<p>Oh but wait! It&#39;s really safe this time we tested it! No thank you. As a healthy adult, I&#39;ll take my chances with trivial diseases (for my body) like measles and the flu. And If I do get sick, I&#39;ll lock myself indoors until I&#39;m better.</p>

<p>Institutionalized medical science, in my day-to-day life at least, has failed to impress. I still get intense seasonal allergies, for which the doctors ran a 140-allergen test on and prescribed pills for. However, I noticed simply avoiding wheat and dairy consumption (which the test failed to catch) all but eliminates these. Much more effective the medication.</p>

<p>Another example was tender underarm lymph nodes which I was prescribed antibiotics for, but actually turned out to be a slight gluten intolerance (I had regrettably consumed lots of pizza and hefeweizen the day before).</p>

<p>The large majority of my minor ailments are better served by a judicial dose of Googling rather a few hundred dollar doctor visit it seems.</p>

<p>Never implied vaccines cause arthritis. Rarely do such simple &quot;cause and effect&quot; one-size-fits-all situations present themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, if you have any sort of theory that falls outside of our current consensus, you&#39;re not going to receive a serious review from mainstream scientists, because they&#39;re generally afraid of anything that challenges the consensus. As a prominent example I like to bring up, Lynn Margulis had to submit her theory of endosymbiosis explaining the origin of human mitochondria at least a dozen times (I forgot the exact count) before anyone was willing to publish it. Today it&#39;s scientific consensus.</p>

<p>However, that shift in consensus merely happened because scientific consensus doesn&#39;t like to be challenged. Consensus only changes when it&#39;s forced to change to preserve its credibility, when the damage to scientists reputation becomes less by accepting that they were wrong and allowing a consensus change than by sticking to their current consensus.</p>

<p>Anyone who proposes any sort of fringe theory receives this answer from the &quot;rationalist&quot; crowd, that he should submit it for peer review, but in reality peer review mostly serves to protect the dominant paradigm, not to improve it through challenges...</p>

<p>...Even the Climategate emails that were leaked showed attempts by prominent scientists to manipulate the peer review process to prevent certain papers from being published, and serious climatologists voiced their concerns about this at the time. The Climategate emails didn&#39;t so much disprove global warming, as they demonstrated the painful shortcomings of science and the fact that systems with a high degree of complexity don&#39;t reveal their secrets after systematic observation.</p>

<p>In reality, what is necessary is for us to accept the fact that scientific consensus doesn&#39;t tell us something about the nature of reality, but rather what institutionalized power believes reality should look like. I would take it a step further and argue that new observations don&#39;t lead to a shift in consensus, but rather, that a shift in consensus is what leads to new observations...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Peer review is not perfect. Would you care to suggest another method? Also, there are plenty of publications that will publish eve the most dubious claims.</p>

<p>The fact is that when we see these controversial paradigm shifts in scientific thinking, they are preceded by an increasing number of scientists entering the debate on the matter. Were we to poll the body of scientists literate to the issue at hand on their opinions we would have seen a steady increase in the number of people on the correct side. This has already happened for vaccines and (not to make litteracy a competition but) we won.
The biggest issue in science today is a lack of replication. With issues like string theory, climate science and the mitochondrial thing (gotta look that one up) it can be costly to replicate the study. If people do not believe the study to be true then they wont spend the time/money. Vaccine studies are simple to replicate and cheap because they are stricly imperical. We just need to look at the data that exists or gather our own data. No, equipment, no lab time, just questioning people. Everyone and their dog has replicated these studies all over the world and found the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ad hominem... as for peer reviews, it&#39;s great, but not everything gets submitted for peer review, there are information filters long before the peer review stage, who do you think control science teaching? financing? publishing? vulgarizing?

<p>As for peanut allergies, it&#39;s interesting you would pick this example because it barely existed before wide scale vaccination of children, the filtering has buried most of the data though (you would think science would consider gathering data on the potential effects of peanut oil it uses as adjuvant, but nope...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not making an ad hominem attack. I was merely noting a common flaw in American education in teaching the basics of the peer review process.</p>

<p>Firstly, you are laughably wrong in your explanation of the peer review process. Im not insulting you, I&#39;m assuming you have never been informed or misinformed. I challenge you to do some personal study and growth.
Anything can be submitted for peer review, that is the idea. You can write a hypothesis, your testing methods and your conclusion on toilet paper and submit it for peer review.</p>

<p>Science teaching is controlled by science. Where I&#39;m from we teach people to be very skeptical of any science and to investigate any issues we perceive. Science is not a monolithic lexicon of knowledge it is a constantly revised body of hypotheses and theories. </p>

<p>Financing of science is less ideal. It is becoming increasingly hard to find funding for things like stemcell research for the fear it will make the majority of the medical industry redundant. Vacxinations however are a gold mine of funding. There is practically infinite money avaliable to people who wish to investigate any problems with vaccines. The fact that time and time again they come back with the answer that vaccines are safe, is a testiment to the fact that whenever a study concludes otherwise (not uncommon), changes are made to vaccines to prevent these issues from occuring again.</p>

<p>The publishing of scientific papers returns us to the ideal scenario. Anyone can publish a scientific paper should they choose. They are private institutions only separated from regular publishing houses by the acomplishments they have made (some more than others).</p>

<p>Science does not vulgarise any more than maths. If you claim that one time you found 5+5=11 you will be laughed at untill you show your proof. That is not to say that science can be reluctant to change (ugh... String theory). But in situations like this there is at least debate on the subject within the scientific community before a change in consensus is arrived at. This is also extremely common. Vaccinations are not being debated, nor is flat earth, nor is evolution.</p>

<p>Pharma is a bag of flaming cunts. Lucky then that vaccines are overseen by the WHO, CDC and other entities.</p>

<p>On to penut allergies. This was based on an old and problematic study that only looked at correlation, not causation. There have been several studies debunking the hypothesis of vaccines causing allergies (and 99% of other claims) <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/06/26/peds.2014-1079.full.pdf">here is a great one</a></p>

<p>Bassically to summarise the correlation =\= causation statement we can look at icecream sales and violent crime. Every year we see a spike in icecream sales and violent crime at the exact same time. Every country for as long as we have studied it. The culprit is correlation, Ice-cream sells well in the summer; also, in the summer more people are walking about being ready targets for violent crime.</p>

<p>Another correlation we have is the rise of autism and the rise in organic farming. Once again we have what we call a confounding variable. In this case it is an increase in medical literacy of the population. They understand the dangers of non-organic food and also the diagnosis of Autism. Where before they would just be considered weird, with an increase in medical literacy of the population, people were able to submit their weird childeren for diagnosis (the sharpest increase in the number of autistics came just after the first diagnosis of the condition when we went from 0 to some)</p>

<p>As for the claim that there was an increase in food allergies after the introduction of vaccines, that is just patently false. You cant make a claim like that without evidence. &quot;Everytime you downvote my comment, Hitler kills a puppy&quot; (ok maybe you can make false statements but it doesn&#39;t make them true). And before you cite a number of natural health websites do me the honour of filtering the ones with no or contradictory statistics.</p>

<p>American kids are not the sickest. The fact is America has a broken medical system. Diagnosing every child with something and prescribing a costly treatment is a paycheque to the American healthcare industry. They are also some of the least vaccinated childeren in their economic peers.</p>

It is about publicly ridiculing anybody who questions the medical or pharmaceutical industry. To paraphrase the political activitist Ailinsky, ridicule is the most powerful tool of persuasion. What is interesting is that whenever they start a new propaganda regimen, they are constantly gauging public opinion to see if the idiots are buying it.

    <div class="md"><p>so herd immunity is effective in measles, which is the primary issue in this debate. so in other words, the vaccine proponents shouldn’t debate herd immunity issues when it comes to measles.</p>

<p>If a vaccine is not as effective as they have sold it then maybe there is a good reason not to trust the entities that have forced this upon us? We are constantly being told to get a flu vaccine. it is bombarded on us but yet its not very effective at all. In my case, and many others, nurses, pharmacists, even doctors say they get sick more often in that flu season when they get a flu vaccine. Which seems to me that the theory on immunity or viral behaviour is seriously flawed. And that means those that create these concoctions really don’t know as much as they pretend to. Either they are more ignorant than they have let themselves appear to be or they are frauds. What else will they lie about, I mean besides the CDC studies co-authored by Paul Thorsen? </p>

<p>You believe what the govt and pharmaceuticals say because &quot;science&quot;. Others see them as the corrupt institutions that they are. That is what is becoming very dangerous, is this blind faith in science. Anyone can slap on that word and many , especially the young adults, will take it as gospel. Of course, it doesn’t help that access to these studies require monetary payment which limits many of us from understanding. </p>

<p>instead of blaming the antivaccine crowd maybe the &quot;Educated&quot; people should try to understand where these people are coming from and start fixing those issues. just telling people to do it, or calling them names is not going to solve the problem. </p>

<p>FWIW, my family has all their vaccines. But, I think it is important to question what is being put in our bodies because you never know when some one evil (yes there are some fucked up people in this world) gets in a position to do some serious damage. Question everything and do not be fooled by labels. </p>

<p>Well, the info I gave came from the CDC, they weren&#39;t exactly hiding the idea that vaccines aren&#39;t 100% or anything.  Are vaccines 100%, no, this fact isn&#39;t hidden or anything.  They are effective enough though in most cases (flu vaccines are one where they are less effective).  I mean, we&#39;ve all but wiped out things like polio, whooping cough, measles, and small pox.  </p>

<p>That is why people get so frustrated with anti-vaccine people.  I understand people&#39;s concern, and perhaps there could be better efforts for education.  But, because of this crowd some of these things are coming back, things that were all but eliminated.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issues with the CDC is that the vaccine autism link studies they did were co-authored by a thief who stole money from those specific studies. So it is best when debating antivaccine people to not use those tainted studies. Find other studies that demonstrate that autism and vaccine are not linked. The other issue with the CDC is that the head of the CDC in the 2000&#39;s went to work for Merck pharmaceutical in 2008 /2009.  Add the missing vial issue from last year the CDC is not a reliable source. </p>

<p>Access to the studies is a major issue. The other big issue is this: Were these vaccines studied/created scientifically or where they created and studied politically but because they were done in a laboratory environment people assume they are sound because people assume they were studied/created scientifically. There is a big difference and I know as a fact that a vast majority of studies are not as pristine and purely scientific as many believe them to be. </p>

<p>I hope I made sense.  </p>

<p>It is important that we have open access to studies concerning public health and public health policy. It is important we question what is going in our bodies and it is important that we have an independent study examining the roles vaccines play in all these new disorders/diseases.  They may have nothing to do with them or it may be a co-morbid issue. We need to have independent studies of pesticides, car exhaust, foods, antibiotics, electricity, lead piping, lighting, etc.  But instead we have corporations controlling the debate and hiding the truth for as long as they can get away with it and by that time many people have suffered or died. </p>

<p>This is such a hot issue because if it came out that what was being injected was causing issues and they lied about it (like how they lied about prescription drug side effects) it could cause panic. </p>

<p>From my personal experience, My serums were bad. I got whooping cough at 15 and they discovered my measles and polio vaccines serums were bad. they could have had a vaccine but the serum was bad.  A lot of people assume it is a wilful denial of a vaccine. Also, some vaccines require boosters but not many adults get them.</p>

I was raised unvaccinated and had the measles. You take cod liver oil, make sure to not have antibiotics and it&#39;s over. Then you have lifelong immunity that also helps protect your children through the placenta and breast milk. That is the real herd immunity.</p>

<p>This is up there with homeopathy. If that was true, why didn&#39;t we just naturally develop an immunity to measles? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in a sourced presentation that doesn&#39;t mention autism a single time, watch this. Truly. </p>

<p>And the rate of measles was already dropping significantly before the year the vaccine was even introduced, which would have to do with better nutrition, more people breastfeeding, better sanitation which was helping the real herd immunity. Now we are completely wrecking our immune systems with an awful diet, overprescription of antibiotics and over 40 vaccinations for young developing immune systems in children. </p>

It shows your unwillingness to open your mind and think past these bullshit constructs of what you think people are.</p>

<p>Some of us aren&#39;t wearing tin foil hats, we see true corruption in so many fields that have a strong corporate profile. Like Merck, with so much to gain from creating hysteria and taking the spotlight off the fact two virologists from their own company are blowing the whistle about their shitty and ineffective vaccines. Drug companies spend more than ten times marketing to doctors than they do consumers. We are inundated with crap pharma commercials when every other country doesn&#39;t allow it. </p>

<p>Here let me copy paste.</p>

<p>&quot;The measles vaccine is effective at preventing the disease. Vaccination has resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013 with about 85% of children globally being currently vaccinated&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Measles affects about 20 million people a year,[1] primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia.[4] It resulted in about 96,000 deaths in 2013 down from 545,000 deaths in 1990&quot;</p>

<p>Wow, I wonder what could have caused the death toll to drop so much in such a short time period, could it have been the massive vaccination push?</p>

<p>Look at these graphs.  Seriously, do you think people were bathing is waste or something in the 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s?  They washed their hands and bathed regularly in those days, and yet, magically measles dramatically decreased and was all but eliminated once vaccines were introduced.  </p>

<p>Looking at the graphs you see peeks and low points, again at point when people knew about basic hygiene and nutrition, and then once vaccines were introduced measles very quickly go from hundreds of thousands to basically nothing with a handful of years.  </p>

<p>How do you explain these graphs with nutrition and hygiene?  </p>

<p>Imagine there&#39;s a disease called XYZ. 2M people every year die from XYZ in the U.S. Now, there&#39;s a vaccination for XYZ, and they whole population is succesfully vaccinated. However, there is a 1/100,000,000 chance of dying from the vaccination, and 3 U.S. citizens end up dying from it.</p>

<p>So now, 3 people die from the vaccination, and nobody dies from XYZ.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely correct.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the rub: each of those babies died because a doctor injected a proprietary serum into their little body, and most likely earned money for it.  You can cut it how you will, and claim it is appropriate in order for preservation of public health, but for the parents of those children, don&#39;t you think that sounds a bit hollow?</p>

<p>Whatever happened to the precious value of every <em>individual</em> life?</p>

<p>For that matter, whatever happened to people being in control of their body?  Or does that only apply to abortions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, for the parents of those children who die from the vaccination, of course it will be very difficult.</p>

<p>But, in these situations, the parent has 2 choices. They can choose to vaccinate their child, or not vaccinate their child. If they choose to vaccinate their child, their child will face an extremely low chance of death. If they choose not to vaccinate their child, their child will face a much higher chance of death. It&#39;s far more likely for an unvaccinated child to die of measles than for a child to die from a measles vaccination.</p>

<p>From this perspective, it&#39;s highly irresponsible of parents to choose not to vaccinate their child against measles. By choosing this option, they are greatly enhancing the probability of the death of their child.</p>

<p>As you said, in terms of autism, yes of course death is a great deal worse than autism. On top of that, the links between the MMR vaccine and autism are tenuous to say the least. It would be very odd to suggest that a weak chance of autism suffices as a reason not to vaccinate your child against measles, a potentially fatal disease.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That probability is still extremely small.  We&#39;re talking way less than one-in-a-thousand.  As evidence, I point to the fact that no children have died from measles in the US in several years despite the fact that many hundreds of people have gotten it.  Furthermore, if the child does come down with measles (and survives, but of course the odds are very much in favor of that in the US where children have good nutrition and good care), they are guaranteed not to get it again and they do not need booster shots.  Unlike vaccines, the immunological memory from getting actual measles is fully effective and permanent.</p>

<p>Indeed, the situation with booster shots is particularly problematic.  We don&#39;t really tell people they need to get booster shots, and we don&#39;t screen for it the way we do for tetanus.  What we are really doing is creating very large populations of people with waning immunity to measles, who don&#39;t know they are increasingly at risk as they age.  This would be disastrous, except that measles just isn&#39;t a very dangerous illness in the West.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And now, for the news... </p>

<p>2015: &quot;Parents not vaccinating their children has caused a measles outbreak! Only horrible parents would leave their children un-vaccinated! The government should do something about this!&quot; </p>

<p>2016: &quot;The President has signed a new law that requires all parents to have their children vaccinated in order to go to school. Homeschooled children however are not affected by this new law.&quot; </p>

<p>2017: &quot;The President has signed a new law requiring that all parents must have their children vaccinated, without exception. Failure to do so will have the children removed from their homes, their parents arrested for child neglect, and the children placed into foster care and given their proper vaccinations.&quot; </p>

<p>2018: &quot;A rash of kidnappings around the country by a child molestation ring has parents on edge for the safety of their children. Activists are calling for government action to prevent future kidnappings.&quot; </p>

<p>2019: &quot;The kidnappings continue, but it looks like someone is finally doing something about it! TrackingTech, the leading child security company is testing the waters with their new SafeChip, a microchip that will be implanted in a child&#39;s hand, in order to make sure their location is always known, and that they are always safe.&quot; </p>

<p>2020: &quot;After intense pressure from activists and concerned parents, the President has signed into law a requirement that all children under the age of 18 must be implanted with a SafeChip by the end of the year. All parents who refuse to do this will have their children taken away from them and they will be arrested for child neglect.&quot; </p>

<p>2021: &quot;SafeChip has thwarted over 200 kidnappings over the past year. Children are now more safe than ever before. In an unrelated story, crowds of terrorist protestors violently stormed a SafeChip manufacturing plant with protest signs and loud chanting. Over 300 of these terrorists were arrested before the end of the day.&quot; </p>

<p>2022: &quot;TrackingTech, makers of the popular and legally required SafeChip are partnering with the United States government in order to introduce a new legal ID system to the public. This IDChip will allow you to make transactions, receive your paycheck, and have instant access to all of your vital personal information at all times. Older SafeChip microchips will also be receiving a mandatory downloadable upgrade to IDChip in the near future.&quot; </p>

<p>2023: &quot;IDChip is proving to be a massive success, making life easier for everyone. Some activists are calling for IDChip to be made mandatory in all citizens. In unrelated news, yet another terrorist protest outside of TrackingTech&#39;s headquarters took place today. This is the 4th such terrorist attack this year against TrackingTech. Rogue - and highly illegal Independent Websites on the Internet have incorrectly stated that there were over 5,000 people at this terrorist attack, but our official Government sources put this number closer to 150. In related news, the Government has continued it&#39;s crackdown on these Independent Websites, which have been deemed harmful for the citizens of the United States to read, and have been banned since 2019. Just remember, if it doesn&#39;t have the Official United States Internet Seal on it, it&#39;s not okay to visit that website.&quot;  </p>

<p>2024: &quot;Today, the President signed into law a requirement that all American citizens must be implanted with IDChip by the end of the year. This coincides with the elimination of paper and coin currency, and a switch over to IDChip Dollars on January 1st, 2025. Please remember to get your IDChip before then, as not having it - or one of the older SafeChips, is highly illegal.&quot; </p>

<p>2025: &quot;Violent terrorist protestors ditched their signs and megaphones today, in a physical attack on TrackingTech headquarters. However, the United States Military Police stepped in and quickly eliminated every last terrorist. Independent Websites once again attempted to lie to the public, saying that over 10,000 innocent people were killed in the retaliative attack on the terrorists, however, official Government sources state that the number was closer to 200, and it is notable that each and every one of these terrorists was not chipped. Some reports even state that they weren&#39;t even vaccinated.&quot;</p>

Have you ever studied 20th Century German politics? Or 20th century European politics in general? I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t because then you would know those Germans were not tricked. History transpired how it did because those German citizens were getting exactly what they wanted.</p>

<p>In our country, outrage builds every day. Not one of my friends is trusting of the government. We have rally&#39;s against financial and racial inequality. We had riots over police killings of civilians. For every powerful asshole we have trying to muck up our country, we have a group of people who will oppose them. Americans WILL express their disdain the worse our country becomes. A revolution can no longer happen overnight. Open your eyes and drop that defeatist attitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time studying pre-WWII Germany. The German economy was decimated by the Great Depression. The Germans accepted the risks of increased militarism in exchange for prosperity. What excuse do Americans have for ignoring the fact that their government went from the most successful democracy (representative republic) to the kleptocratic oligarchy we currently have? </p>

<p>Over the last 40 years, Americans have stood by while their public education system was systematically dumbed down to the point where most Americans lack the ability to think critically. Americans slavishly think whatever the idiot box tells them to think. The current state of the US media makes Goebbels&#39; propaganda machine look amateurish, at best. </p>

<p>The Reichstag fire was a frat prank compared to 9/11, yet most Germans suspected it was a manufactured event. Not most Americans. Do you realize how ridiculous events like 9/11, the Iraq invasion, and the 3 engineered asset bubbles/collapses are going to appear to future generations? The Germans&#39; excuse was that they wanted a better life, ours will be that we were busy watching Dancing with the Stars. </p>

<p>This is laughable. Germany did not militarize so heavily because they wanted a better life, everything they did was rooted in nationalistic pride and designed to spread German culture and values across all of Europe.</p>

<p>And regarding German public opinion, may I see any source that states most Germans suspect it was manufactured by Hitler? </p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t about Germans, this is about Americans and you generalize so much when it comes to your opinion of the American people. Really, step out of the basement. Talk to people. Engage in critical discourse. True, you might find that people eat the bullshit that&#39;s spoon-fed to them (mostly older generations). You also might find that there are a lot of people out here who see through the bullshit corporate propoganda; who are educated enough to know of all the horrible, horrible, things our government has done since becoming a superpower post-WW2; who are concerned for the direction of our country but don&#39;t yet see the way to change it.</p>

<p>The Nazi party won the elections of 1932 due to the economic hardships that resulted from the Depression and WWI reparations. The majority that won in said election allowed Hitler to be appointed Chancellor in the following year. The militarization and nationalism followed once Hitler consolidated his position as dictator.</p>

<p>Well, at least you didn&#39;t mention the Time Masheen or Charlie Chaplin. Your simplistic,  juvenile understanding of history is a prime example of the dumbing down that afflicts US public education. I don&#39;t blame you, you simply don&#39;t have the tools to do the job. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret, the time to do anything of consequence was 25 years ago. For those who don&#39;t realize what dire circumstances we are currently in, it is pointless to explain it.  </p>

<p>Heh.</p>

<p>Surely you do not doubt that the State sees you and I - and <em>all</em> citizens - as its &quot;property&quot;... as assets to be bought, sold or used as collateral, do you?  </p>

<p>For example, when the Federal Reserve Bank &quot;loans&quot; money to the United States Corporation, it is expected to be &quot;repaid&quot;, <em>and with interest</em>, no? </p>

<p>So, by what means CAN a government, <em>any</em> government, secure the funds necessary for repayment?</p>

<p><strong>Taxation</strong> - the extraction - by force or threat of force - of a portion or percentage of the labor/productivity/<em>life energy</em> of the <em>human resources</em> over which they rule, and from which they are able, whether by assent, coercion or brute force, to exact the life&#39;s energy necessary to repay the BOND to which the Government Corporation has committed.</p>

<p>We can quibble over whether said &quot;loans&quot; (bonds) and the means by which they are repaid are benevolent - &quot;good for society&quot; or not, but the cold fact remains: We, and our productivity, are <em>assets</em> to the State... at least as long as we produce more than we consume, at which point we are regarded as <em>liabilities</em>.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the State, we, <em>and our children</em>, are the property of the State, and are treated as such - at least to the extent that they are able to do so without raising insufferable insurrection.</p>

<strong>OP you bring up a great point and I wish there were visible people saying more of this.</strong> Maybe there are and they&#39;re being drowned out.</p>

<p>You know, I&#39;m just a little confused by this whole immunizations argument so maybe a rude expert can make this personal and clear it up for me and the rest of the peons.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re immunized by a vaccination, and your neighbor isn&#39;t and he gets sick, aren&#39;t you safe anyway? Isn&#39;t that the whole point? <strong>I was under the impression that vaccinations and exposure produce the same response in our bodies</strong>, and that once you&#39;ve been vaccinated exposure is safe. I don&#39;t know of any science that says vaccinations are only effective if everyone gets them.
Who cares if everybody has the measles and you&#39;re immunized? </p>

<p>Another question, off-topic: if everyone keeps getting vaccinated, won&#39;t our viruses just evolve into something else? Maybe we should give measles a few little victories so, you know, it doesn&#39;t get mad and turn into HIV.
Kidding, kidding. Chill out, measles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual answer which everyone in this sub seems to be so blissfully ignoring is herd immunity. The idea being that if enough healthy kids get the vaccine that the disease will be so remote that unhealthy kids/people who CANT get the vaccine wont be exposed as often either since no one has it.  And while theres plenty of people taking a piss with the whole &quot;its for the children&quot; argument, no one is actually explaining why it doesnt make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">Herd immunity</a>, which can require 80 to 95 percent participation, is the reason that widespread vaccination is important. To understand this you need to understand disease life cycles.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases are parasites that need people to sustain them. We are their food source. They don&#39;t need to survive in a single host forever, just long enough to reproduce and spread to another host. But what if there was no new host? Herd immunity is the point when infectious disease will theoretically become eradicated, like smallpox, because it will not be able to reproduce as fast as it dies off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>aren&#39;t you safe anyway?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are personally safe from the strain of the disease you are immunized for. However the fact that your neighbor didn&#39;t get vaccinated means that a measles virus is reproducing in him. Which leads me to your next two questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who cares if everybody has the measles and you&#39;re immunized?
if everyone keeps getting vaccinated, won&#39;t our viruses just evolve into something else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We care because measles is doing more than reproducing in your neighbor. It is evolving. The speed that diseases evolve is directly proportional to the number of reproducing viruses. So if everyone has measles you will very quickly become infected with a new strain that has evolved to affect people immune to the old strain. Then it becomes harder to eliminate the disease, because now we have to convince 90 percent of the population to get the new vaccine. So as you can see vaccinations prevent evolution, unlike reckless antibiotic use.</p>

<p>I still think there&#39;s a major problem with vaccine efficacy that&#39;s being covered up by big pharma. They&#39;re going to blame the shit out of the anti vax crowd to influence public opinion before letting the cat out of the bag. Merck is already being sued over falsifying efficacy data for the Mumps portion of the MMR, and I&#39;m guessing there are major issues with the effectiveness of the measles portion of the vaccine too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that this is a huge 180 from your theory, but consider this: what if it isn&#39;t about vaccinations, and it isn&#39;t about medical decisions. What if its about profit.</p>

<p>I believe that this entire debate, just like public concerns over vaccine safety, has been orchestrated by big pharma to <em>prevent herd immunity</em>. </p>

<p>There have been no legitimate studies about the harmfulness of vaccines to my knowledge, but people still rally against them. Vaccines are one of the only preventative treatments, and treating symptoms is how pharmaceuticals make their real money. So what would happen if everyone was immune, the disease eradicated like smallpox? No new vaccines to sell! Fewer symptoms to treat! No new strains evolving that require new vaccines to be developed and sold! Fewer people hospitalized!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t accept my premise that vaccines are good, and herd immunity is a legit goal, please see my other <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2vtoiz/am_i_the_only_one_who_realizes_its_not_about/col5hb2">comment on herd immunity</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I don&#39;t believe the state should be able to force injections of any kind on children. However, if you choose to not vaccinate your children you shouldn&#39;t be able to have them in public schools because there is a genuine risk to other people&#39;s children when you leave your kids unvaccinated. Vaccines don&#39;t work 100% of the time, but when all the kids in school are vaccinated, its a very small chance for a disease to spread, because a large group of kids would have to have the same failed vaccination and at least one exposed to the disease. With unvaccinated children in schools, the child who first gets the disease will spread it to the kids without the vaccine, and increase the likelihood of other children getting it if their vaccine fails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If vaccines are so harmless, why is there a <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/vaccine-programoffice-special-masters">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (&quot;Vaccine Program&quot;) comprises Part 2 of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (&quot;Vaccine Act&quot;). See Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755 (1986) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-1 to -34). The Vaccine Act became effective October 1, 1988. It establishes the Vaccine Program as a no-fault compensation program whereby petitions for monetary compensation may be brought by or on behalf of persons allegedly suffering injury or death as a result of the administration of certain compulsory childhood vaccines. Congress intended that the Vaccine Program provide individuals a swift, flexible, and less adversarial alternative to the often costly and lengthy civil arena of traditional tort litigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since doctors never offer more than opinions, how can any medical procedure be made compulsory for adults or the children in their care? </p>

<p>I see the shills are already voting this down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said that people are shamed for making their own medical decisions, I was merely pointing out the reason for this is it implies that you have a better understanding of the situation then your doctor. Your doctor can&#39;t force you to have it done but you will be treated differently as you are a public health risk, which is fair enough. </p>

<p>I just find this whole anti-vaccination movement to be full of uninformed people and whilst I personally don&#39;t have a problem with people opting out of vaccinations it angers me that people can force their opinions onto their children and endanger them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s even worth countering, TBH. Because we&#39;re already off topic. The argument is t about efficacy (IMO), it&#39;s about the ability of parents to choose whether or not they wish to vaccine according to the CDC (government&#39;s) pediatric schedule. I have a 2 year old. This is important to me.</p>

<p>If me and Mrs. ColesPardon want to space out the vaccines more, the kiddo will not be allowed in public schools, and one of us will have to home-school. I&#39;d love doing it but I&#39;m a debt slave and the primary breadwinner anyway.</p>

<p>However - this is the argument. Patients should be able to make this choice, but at this point be willing to pay the consequences. And it seems the restrictions are expanding, which is troubling.</p>

<p>This is where unfortunately, through legalese in the Constitution and 200+ years of legislative creep, they actually can do this with a few documents.</p>

<p>And the Supreme Court will approve it, due to the <em>general welfare clause of the Constitution</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to concede anything, zorbinthor. I can read clinical trials. I work in health care and academia. I know the value of vaccines. I just question the State&#39;s Authority to mandate it. Difficult concept, when you&#39;re parroting talking points.</p>

<p>If your children can get vaccinated, and you concede (see... I can do this too), then how much risk are your kids in? See how this works? I can understand the argument regarding children who cannot utilize the vaccines do to allergies or contraindications to the vaccine components, but we both know these patients are few and far between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow second favorite fallacy, completely anecdotal evidence offered up as if it can possibly be used in a debate!  On top of that you&#39;ve missed the point completely (shocking).  The point isn&#39;t that vaccines cost a lot or a little or nothing, its that while huge pharma companies are posting record profits, they could easily afford to make the vaccines (whether they work or not) much safer in terms of both ingredients and they way in which they are produced.  That is not done however, they are produced as cheaply as they possibly can be, which shows that these companies do not give one single fuck about you and your health as long as you are able to pay them.</p>

<p>To simply for you, if they really cared (as they say they do, and as many argue they do) they would make said vaccines in a different manor that was safer and healthier.  This is HARDLY the only thing big pharma does that invalidates its claims of caring for you: from fake drugs, bribing the FDA, keeping drugs on market with known problems, bribing politicians, bribing doctors, releasing known contaminated drugs, not fully testing drugs, taking public funds and research and parading them as their own, MASSIVE patent trolling, massive price gouging, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the WHO website when I did a search on statistics of measles deaths before the vaccination. In 1980 an estimated 2.6 million deaths per year due to measles. Between 2000-2013 measles deaths dropped to approx 145000 deaths per year. </p>

<p>If the vaccines are unnecessary and dangerous, why can we see actual proof that they are doing exactly what they are supposed to do? Mercury was removed from vaccines in 2000. The &quot;report&quot; that said this vaccine causes autism was proven bullshit. </p>

<p>So without an asshole answer please, because I am asking, what proof, with facts you can link to, do you have that it&#39;s better if we just avoid this medically proven protection from a deadly highly contagious virus? 2.6 million people a year. Would you really want to risk that your family will become another statistic of measles deaths or complication? It strikes elderly and children the hardest, it&#39;s most dangerous to them. Please tell me, what scares you more than that?</p>

<p>Unless you think all those people were full of shit, they didn&#39;t die from this and it&#39;s not something we need to worry about? If this was a vaccine for the plague, would you risk letting the Black Death loose on the world because you don&#39;t want to get a shot? I&#39;d pick my evils. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m guessing I keep missing something. So don&#39;t just say &quot;it&#39;s unhealthy and they could fix it&quot;. Please tell me, what is worse than children dying from a preventable disease?</p>

Millions of people each year being knowingly killed by the pharmaceutical and medical industry for profit.  O, and pathetic individuals such as yourself who A.) regurgitate party propaganda without the slightest clue as to what the OP is talking about or what my IP was either and B.) dont know how to debate or argue, and skip parts of an argument they dont like (cherry pick much).  It is astounding that you ignored both my pointing out your own fallacy, and my point about the massive corruption and harm the pharmasuitical industry (you know the one that produces vaccines) perpetrates on the rest of mankind.  On top of that you go on some fear-mongering tangent so far we may as well be talking about bicycle repairs, except not really because you did it with the express intent of (dishonestly) deflecting the conversation to something you are comfortable spewing BS about.</p>

<p>So again, my argument has nothing to do with vaccine effectiveness, but you brought that up because as someone who is just parroting propaganda, you cannot think critically about an issue.  This is about companies making money at the expense of others health, well-being, and lives.  However your request to see some evidence (although buried in a heaped pile of intellectually dishonest propaganda, bullshit, and fear-mongering) is well received and I will of course give you plenty (although honestly this is all pretty obvious stuff). </p>

There is a decent bit here so browse at your leisure, some of the links contain more links (be sure to follow through, most are sourced, pay attention to the sources).

<p>Ok with that done I realize that you may also want some information on my characterization of the pharmasuitical industry as a vampiric, greedy, murderous, corporations who will do anything for profit, or at least that they do not have anything close to you or their consumers best interests at heart.

<p>You &quot;not getting it&quot; is only a very small part of the problem, the larger issue is that you appear to be unable to think critically about such things.  If/when you have A.) reviewed the evidence and B.) are capable of have a fallacy-free discussion let me know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about the MMR vaccine for measles and the effects of measles, not whether or not to think all medicine should be boycotted because of big pharma. So you would avoid a vaccine on principle, specifically the MMR vaccine that would specifically keep my family members safe to a threat we are facing NOW. It&#39;s not hypothetical to me. If 2 people in my family are exposed, their lives are in severe danger. You&#39;re concerned about long term effects of big pharma and the fact that they are unethical and making money. </p>

<p>I agree that the big pharmaceutical companies, specially in the states, are horrible. The fact that there is no free health care should be a national embarrassment. They should not put money before their patients. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll risk lives by refusing a proven vaccine. It&#39;s not even the public I&#39;m concerned about, I have family who will at the very least be hospitalized. There is a 17 year old girl who might not be able to finish highschool because there are unvaccinated kids there and cases of measles nearby. That&#39;s not worth it to me. It&#39;s selfish? Fuck ya. Life is selfish. The chances of you having a bad reaction TO THIS SPECIFIC VACCINE is low. The rate of the virus&#39; decline after the vaccine was invented was great. The chance I will lose people I love because of people who think like you is high. We&#39;re both being selfish, but I&#39;m protecting lives, you&#39;re risking them. </p>

<p>From the MEASLES VACCINE which is what we wrote talking about, what dangers are there to you and your (potential, current?) children to get their shot? Now what are the chances those dangers will come to pass?
The family that&#39;s at risk for me? Due to other medical conditions, they need to visit doctors and hospitals often. That&#39;s exactly where you&#39;ll be going for treatment if you catch it. If measles come to either of their towns, they WILL be exposed. If everyone that could be vaccinated would, the chances of them being exposed is minuscule. So I&#39;m asking you, personally, can you give me a reason for avoiding the MMR vaccine, which is the one that is in the news now because measles is spreading. It&#39;s like avoiding every restaurant because you for sick at one in town, it doesn&#39;t make sense. 
Measles is spreading. We have a vaccine. It doesn&#39;t make sense not to use it, unless there is something horrible in the MMR vaccine I didn&#39;t think was that bad. They removed the mercury. So even tho I received it with mercury, children today would not be exposed to it. But they have a greater risk of being exposed to measles at places they should be safe. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to just talk about all vaccines in general, then let&#39;s just stop here tho. If you have something specifically about the MMR vaccine, I am interested in. In fact, I will be going to be revaccinated because I live on a small island and deal with tourists. 
I don&#39;t want to waste both our time going in circles. If that&#39;s the case, thanks for the links and I&#39;ll look at them at some point. It just wasn&#39;t exactly the topic I was on. </p>

<p>TL;DR can we talk about MMR and measles specially, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. If not, thanks for the chat and I&#39;ll look at those links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, you are attempting to deflect again.  We were not EVER talking about the measles vaccine, not until you arbitrarily decided to bring them up.  Clearly by making this claim you are either extremely delusional or mentally challenged.  This is further supported by the fact that in the light of so very much evidence and so very many warnings by me, you have failed to respond to my arguments, or even acknowledge them (in so far as they apply to vaccines).  On top of that you continue to commit logical fallacies and give single stories to support your claims.</p>

<p>That said I am glad we agree that the pharm companies are awful, however the logic needs to extend to their products.  If they are proven to produce harmful things, then yes it is up to you and SHOULD BE UP TO YOU as an individual what you choose to do.  All information should be examined and presented (its not, its heavily controlled and manipulated) and then as an individual you need to be able to decided what is best for you and anyone in your care.  The entire point of OP&#39;s post was that they (gov+pharma) are attempting to not allow for informed choice, and instead force things upon us.  The same people who have been proven to do massive harm and produce awful things want to have more power over the individual, and limit their choices.  This is a horrible thing.  Now again it should be a choice (well really we should dismantle the system and reconstruct one where we dont have to worry about what pharma companies are putting out...but I digress) based on evidence so sure, if it works (and I&#39;m not saying it does) and you want to take the risk from w/e else is in said vaccine go for it I wouldn&#39;t limit your choice.  BUT THEY WOULD and that is the point.</p>

<p>I hope you read and learn from my links, and that nothing bad is in your MMR vaccine (and that it does what it&#39;s supposed to). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote something and then deleted it. Phone decided I didn&#39;t need to see your whole comment until I posted my response. </p>

<p>I was not deflecting. The topic I was on the entire time was measles and the MMR vaccine. I wrongly assumed that because current news story about vaccines was directly caused by the measles outbreak, that that was also what others were talking about. </p>

<p>But I still have to ask, if there is nothing bad or dangerous in the MMR vaccine, specially, and there is so much danger of measles, why boycott a medicine that is statistically proven to save lives. Over 2 million down to under 200,000 deaths a year, because of that vaccine. I am all for free will and the right to decide what&#39;s right for your family, but when it&#39;s proven that it will do no harm, or at least an incredibly low chance of a bad reaction, then you&#39;re not choosing what&#39;s right for your family, your taking away safety for mine. Forget the other  vaccines. Forget the big companies that profit, or the doctors who care more for money than helping people. Why is the MMR, the vaccine that is not dangerous but does save lives, why isn&#39;t it required. Even if it&#39;s not required. Why is it being refused? Just because? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to go on with this but I do not understand. As I think I said, I have a 17 year old family member who&#39;s life is in serious danger if she is exposed. She may have to leave school, not because other kids aren&#39;t vaccinated for everything, but because of the measles threat and their lack of MMR. If they got this one vaccine, that doesn&#39;t have anything bad in it, my 17 year old niece might not die. Her life is not worth proving a point to big pharma. She is not a sacrifice. If it will harm NO ONE to get that single shot, why is her life not worth it. Every baby under a year of age is in severe danger if they catch the measles. If the prevention is harmless, why are their lives not worth it. My mother has a compromised immune system. Even though she&#39;s vaccinated, she is at risk. Someone at the store who &quot;exercised their right&quot; to refuse vaccination could kill my mother. 
But no, it&#39;s not even the adults, because the majority if them were vaccinated. They are safe. It&#39;s their children&#39;s lives they are playing with. Again, talking MMR and measles specifically at this point in time in North America. 
I&#39;m sorry, big pharma is bad, but I&#39;m not willing to sacrifice my family to let them know I think they are bad. In the big picture it might be worth it. To me, anyone refusing this specific vaccine is a threat to those I love, it&#39;s as simple as that. So while you may be able to convince me that overall, vaccines should not be mandatory and it should be our right to choose, there are limits to those rights. You should not be able to choose to put me and my family at risk because you refuse something that will not do you any harm, but will actually protect you. If you are part of society, you need to do your part and protect society. So unless getting that shot will harm you, personally, in any way shape or form, why refuse it and risk killing someone else?</p>

<p>I&#39;m done for the night. Like I said, I do intend to look at those links. I just haven&#39;t had the time today. Happy Valentine&#39;s day, or Happy Weekend if valentines isn&#39;t your thing :)</p>

<p>I just find this whole anti-vaccination movement to be full of uninformed people and whilst I personally don&#39;t have a problem with people opting out of vaccinations it angers me that people can force their opinions onto their children and endanger them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to concede anything, zorbinthor. I can read clinical trials. I work in health care and academia. I know the value of vaccines. I just question the State&#39;s Authority to mandate it. Difficult concept, when you&#39;re parroting talking points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re conceding that they work, you are conceding that not vaccinating is not an option for those who wish to be around the rest of us. </p>

<p>False dichotomy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your actions no longer only have consequences for you and your children, but the rest of us as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your children can get vaccinated, and you concede (see... I can do this too), then how much risk are your kids in? See how this works? I can understand the argument regarding children who cannot utilize the vaccines do to allergies or contraindications to the vaccine components, but we both know these patients are few and far between.</p>

<p>Its like smoking in a restaurant. Sure, you have the right to smoke, but not when your bad choices have negative consequences for innocents around you. </p>

<p>Are you seriously equating the negative effects of second hand smoke with anti-vaxers and their moral and communal obligations? Is this ad-lib? Or a new line? I like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about the MMR vaccine for measles and the effects of measles, not whether or not to think all medicine should be boycotted because of big pharma. So you would avoid a vaccine on principle, specifically the MMR vaccine that would specifically keep my family members safe to a threat we are facing NOW. It&#39;s not hypothetical to me. If 2 people in my family are exposed, their lives are in severe danger. You&#39;re concerned about long term effects of big pharma and the fact that they are unethical and making money. </p>

<p>I agree that the big pharmaceutical companies, specially in the states, are horrible. The fact that there is no free health care should be a national embarrassment. They should not put money before their patients. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll risk lives by refusing a proven vaccine. It&#39;s not even the public I&#39;m concerned about, I have family who will at the very least be hospitalized. There is a 17 year old girl who might not be able to finish highschool because there are unvaccinated kids there and cases of measles nearby. That&#39;s not worth it to me. It&#39;s selfish? Fuck ya. Life is selfish. The chances of you having a bad reaction TO THIS SPECIFIC VACCINE is low. The rate of the virus&#39; decline after the vaccine was invented was great. The chance I will lose people I love because of people who think like you is high. We&#39;re both being selfish, but I&#39;m protecting lives, you&#39;re risking them. </p>

<p>From the MEASLES VACCINE which is what we wrote talking about, what dangers are there to you and your (potential, current?) children to get their shot? Now what are the chances those dangers will come to pass?
The family that&#39;s at risk for me? Due to other medical conditions, they need to visit doctors and hospitals often. That&#39;s exactly where you&#39;ll be going for treatment if you catch it. If measles come to either of their towns, they WILL be exposed. If everyone that could be vaccinated would, the chances of them being exposed is minuscule. So I&#39;m asking you, personally, can you give me a reason for avoiding the MMR vaccine, which is the one that is in the news now because measles is spreading. It&#39;s like avoiding every restaurant because you for sick at one in town, it doesn&#39;t make sense. 
Measles is spreading. We have a vaccine. It doesn&#39;t make sense not to use it, unless there is something horrible in the MMR vaccine I didn&#39;t think was that bad. They removed the mercury. So even tho I received it with mercury, children today would not be exposed to it. But they have a greater risk of being exposed to measles at places they should be safe. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to just talk about all vaccines in general, then let&#39;s just stop here tho. If you have something specifically about the MMR vaccine, I am interested in. In fact, I will be going to be revaccinated because I live on a small island and deal with tourists. 
I don&#39;t want to waste both our time going in circles. If that&#39;s the case, thanks for the links and I&#39;ll look at them at some point. It just wasn&#39;t exactly the topic I was on. </p>

<p>TL;DR can we talk about MMR and measles specially, because that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. If not, thanks for the chat and I&#39;ll look at those links. </p>
