    <div class="md"><p>I would like to respectfully disagree. I believe it would be much more strategic for them to continue the slight advances that they have been making, piece by piece, bill by bill. By going gun-ho they risk setting themselves back from generations of perserverence. I tend to see them as opportunivores. As in chess, a match isnt won in the first few moves; move by move, the board is set in favor of the winner until the other has no more good moves and must yield.</p>

I tend to believe they already have mostly everthing they wanted for this generation of TPTB.

<p>Not to change the subject, but the 2nd amendment is one of those things, imo, that could expedite things for them. So, merging that with your prediction might help ya out? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-reasons-why-rome-fell">http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-reasons-why-rome-fell</a></p>

<p>On a more &quot;recent&quot; [~250 years or so] historical tip, the pattern would be that once the economy declines past a point where it doesn&#39;t work for the financial sector anymore, there is a large scale war. See WWI after the invention of the Fed and the first time the US economy&#39;s back was broken for the people who actually do real things. </p>

<p>Essentially, when the bankers start hemorrhaging money, and see their money becoming worthless, weird shit like Goldman Sachs employees will end up in the Defense Department. I know that is some serious conspiracy minded shit right there, but that&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;ll see to a greater degree.</p>

<p>The next war will involve Iran, undoubtedly. Hopefully we don&#39;t go head to head with China, because quite frankly they will fucking own us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to believe that. I still think the US is more free and honest than China. But they have an incredible economy, more natural resources, they aren&#39;t afraid of things like Eugenics, and their engineers are better educated. </p>

<p>We lack the manufacturing capability we once had, and simply controlling the Atlantic shipping would be relatively devastating for us.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget the space race either. Our aircraft carriers are not safe against space based attacks. There is a reason the US military only goes against technologically limited countries. We would not fare well against China.</p>

<p>Not that I am rooting for that - it would be bad for everyone.</p>

America is a melting pot of those with a nature to hold thier own. we are a land of the free, we are the home of the brave, and if you think only the rich are ready for the next big war, then you&#39;ve obviously never heard of militias, the prepper movement, hell, even most communities are ready to aid and defend themselves if that&#39;s what&#39;s called for. The spirit of freedom in the hearts of men is the phoenix. the shell is the oppression. When 9/11 happened, they killed her, but she is slow to die into the ash. Once she has,she will be reborn, breaking the shell of oppression and shining brightly once more, but only until some bastard comes and kills her again, and we gotta start the whole damn thing over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the force already reigns, it doesn&#39;t require your assitance. if you are called on, trust me, you&#39;ll know it. you will be guided to do so, not enforcing your will onto the existance, certainly not in a harmful mannor. And you are responsible for your own sins, you are the one who commited them, but Christ is willing to wash those clean of you, so you may reign with Him in heaven for all eternity. It&#39;s a pretty sweet deal actually and why I always meet ppl as a clean slate. =) to me they are sinless, and if they do wrong me, I forgive them, because Lord knows i&#39;ve done more than my share of damage to the world when I thought much as you do, now Metatron. =)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was the point. We also armed em, several times over. It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re posting up an Iranian strike force or somethin&#39; e.e</p>

<p>Gun laws have done nothing to decrease the number of school shootings, that&#39;s a fact. If we followed the 2nd amendment correctly then it wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But when you are a free land of brave ppl, sometimes ppl will bend and break rules because <em>gasp</em> they&#39;re free and brave! </p>

<p>The native american genocide was the cruelest act of humanity ever in it&#39;s history, and those that survived it were also kind enough to contribute to the foundation and growth of america. I don&#39;t think those Germans have yet figured out how to decode that navajo cryptation lol Those natives that survived not only this nation&#39;s, but human history&#39;s greatest sin (if we stay secular), became a strong ppl that benifit the culture of our melting pot in numerous ways. God bless the native american. </p>

<p>Being poor in america is better than being a king in some third world countries, so you&#39;re just drinkin kool-aid buddy, and the squeeky wheel gets the greece, but i don&#39;t have a problem with any of my black, jewish, hispanic, or caucasion friends. <em>gasp</em> I&#39;m white, and american. Fuck, worse, i&#39;m in the south! I should be burnin a cross on someone&#39;s lawn! So fuckin ignorant. You must come from a nation with worse schools than ours, congrats on that fail. lol</p>

<p>Your lack of gun laws have caused these school shootings. </p>

<p>What did the natives get in return for saving the first colonists? Apart from losing their right to be free. </p>

<p>Also remember all the dictators which America has propped up or macarthyism where you didn&#39;t have the right to support communism or be left leaning. </p>

<p>I know for a fact that much of America is racist, not all obviously but it never is, the police force are, think of katrina and the massively delayed response compared with sandy which was unimportant but affected a rich community</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I misunderstood your query. It&#39;s a good thing because natural born americans will be free to not die in another war in the hellest place on earth. Cold as that sounds, i don&#39;t care about the middle east. it&#39;s been a problem since the beginning of time, and being nuked won&#39;t come soon enough. Except for Jeruselum. I pray for nothing but peace and safety for the city and those withen the walls of the city of Jeruselum, and fuck the rest of that whole part of the globe. Been killin since cain. </p>

<p>Actually maccarthyism was voted down by the powers that ran the nation, or we would&#39;ve dropped 50 nukes on chinas most populated 50 cities while the russians were still trying to play catch up. They won that race btw, but not at that time. We showed mercy, and it resulted in the cold war. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>your black and white perception of race in america is alarmingly uninformed because stories of racial unity don&#39;t make the news like ferguson does. you gotta remember the slant of the road if ya wanna stay ahead of the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if Saddam Hussein wasn&#39;t deposed and the arm wasn&#39;t destroyed then you wouldn&#39;t have got ISIS. Also if nukes were going to go off in the middle east most likely they would be on Jerusalem launched by Israel if they were about to suffer total defeat. </p>

<p>Macarthyism and the rest of the &#39;red scare&#39; showed the lack of freedom. </p>

<p>I know there are stories of unity but the systematic discrimination, right down to small things, like my dad was in America and was staying with a mexican friend (who had done 3 tours of vietnam because he was thankful for America letting him immigrate). He drove my dad around a white neibourhood where there were loads of deer wandering about. They were going 5mph tops when a cop pulls him over and gives him a speeding ticket. My dad begins to say something but his friend tells him to shut up as it wasn&#39;t worth it. </p>

<p>And setting up dictatorships? Or what about how US politics is wholly reliant on being an aristocrat and is comparable to Rome in someways. Or how you have 2 parties? Or Guantanamo bay where you have no rights?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can with 100% assurance say that Jerusalem in a nuclear war is the safest place on the planet, bar none. no nuke is getting withen 50 miles of the outer city wall. You have no idea who you guys are fuckin with. How old thier stucture is, and what they hold most precious indeed. They&#39;re never letting go again guys. Not til Jesus comes back and cracks that mountain on top of em. </p>

<p>the red scare showed ppl are easily motivated to fear an enemy they&#39;ll likely never meet. sound familar?</p>

<p>it&#39;s not worth it. you can&#39;t argue witha  cop and everything said will be used against you. now you take that ticket, show up for court, tell the da it&#39;s all bullshit, and get to walk out with only court costs. is it crooked, yes? but that cop was filling quota, not profiling, huge diff.</p>

<p>Gitmo is proof america is dead. Sad thing is we&#39;ve had that place forever now and only in the last decade does anyone care. where was your protest in the 70s? no one gave a shit then. talk about droppin the ball. And yes the whole system is a show, a stage, a song and dance, because tptb realized that if they don&#39;t preform for the masses and only spoil themselves, then the masses tend to rise up and murder them and then take all thier shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. If Israel was on the verge of total defeat then they would make Israel into ash. When saladin was about to take Jerusalem by force he only let the defenders leave in peace because they said they would destroy every temple in the city, including the Christian ones. They were serious. </p>

<p>It took away people&#39;s freedoms. </p>

<p>It was racial discrimination, Mexican in white neibourhood. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t exist in the 70&#39;s and I am British, one of the main reasons I believe Britain to be much better than the US is the NHS, and how our political process is much less a 2 horse race (though sadly it is first to the post)</p>

<p>Oh but Gitmo did. just because the CIA didn&#39;t claim it on thier taxes that year doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Sure, play the race card. no way it was just a quota fill. had to be racism. e.e racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, i already replied to all your other stuff. i&#39;d just be forced to repeat, and i don&#39;t do that. But back to something we can more forward on.</p>

<p>Yeah, but is &quot;Israel&quot; Israel? Does she show any similarities to Israel of old? No, no i don&#39;t think she does. See, when Israel first took back Jerusalem in the 6 day war, that was true. And it was providence from God. Not a popular opinion in this parts, but the truth rarely is welcome. But those victors lost, just like Israel of old, she was quick to whore herself outta and make a fool of herself, knowing the mighty beast that came from the ocean (america) was her protector. So she fornicated with the beast. So therefore I know that&#39;s not really Israel. That&#39;s Babalyon the Whore, and she&#39;s now got her old cities back (thanks ISIS, powered by the beast from the sea.) and holds Jerusalem. Now all they have to do is build the temple with dome in the court and the scralage will be complete and then I promise you you will know there is a God in heaven, who cherishes Jerusalem. He called that city the apple of his eye, it was the city of David, a man who God said was after his own heart. And don&#39;t forget, in proverbs i believe, it states God uses wicked men for his glory, so don&#39;t you think Jerusalem has the best defense network on the planet? There&#39;s a reason the us supplies thier airforce and keeps em as uptodate as our own. </p>

<p>i love how in the original star wars, america was protrayed as the rebels, and the communists the empire, but later, as Lucus saw the world change, he made the prequels scream how the republic was truely america, and was transformed into an evil miltary empire in the name of &quot;safety&quot;. </p>

<p>Those sith are cleaver guys. If any reps the sith today, it would be the heads of the illuminati (military industerial complex, if you like. it extends past just wpns makers and what not though...but anyways). That&#39;s why I have to wonder why anyone would make the willful decision to be a sith. <em>shrugs</em> seems like an obviously unenlightened path, that while it claims life, offers only death. The force is ment to guide us, we are not ment to guide the force. and just because one can, does not mean one should. The force has no personality, it is neither light, nor dark. Allowing it into our lives and letting it flow through us, we can preform great works. When we try to bend it our will we lose jaws, and limbs, and life. All it does it take because that&#39;s all you tried to do with it. Let the force be the force. Let God be God, because in the end, it&#39;s only through our faith in Him that we might be truely saved from the real destruction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>only a sith would see the force as something that requires evolution lol</p>

<p>Edit:  That&#39;s an absolute, terrible to start or end on, so doing both was lame. Okay, the Force is like water, it will go as it will and where it pleases. you can dam(n) that water up, and use it for your own purposes, if you will. But at the end of the day, it goes to sky  and returns to the soil, giving life, as it&#39;s always intended to do. Was the dam a good thing? perhaps, and so the sith using the force isn&#39;t the inheritant problem, it&#39;s the consumption of a desire to control power, the force to thier will and not to the will of what brings life.</p>

<p>Also remember all the dictators which America has propped up or macarthyism where you didn&#39;t have the right to support communism or be left leaning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, i already replied to all your other stuff. i&#39;d just be forced to repeat, and i don&#39;t do that. But back to something we can more forward on.</p>

<p>Yeah, but is &quot;Israel&quot; Israel? Does she show any similarities to Israel of old? No, no i don&#39;t think she does. See, when Israel first took back Jerusalem in the 6 day war, that was true. And it was providence from God. Not a popular opinion in this parts, but the truth rarely is welcome. But those victors lost, just like Israel of old, she was quick to whore herself outta and make a fool of herself, knowing the mighty beast that came from the ocean (america) was her protector. So she fornicated with the beast. So therefore I know that&#39;s not really Israel. That&#39;s Babalyon the Whore, and she&#39;s now got her old cities back (thanks ISIS, powered by the beast from the sea.) and holds Jerusalem. Now all they have to do is build the temple with dome in the court and the scralage will be complete and then I promise you you will know there is a God in heaven, who cherishes Jerusalem. He called that city the apple of his eye, it was the city of David, a man who God said was after his own heart. And don&#39;t forget, in proverbs i believe, it states God uses wicked men for his glory, so don&#39;t you think Jerusalem has the best defense network on the planet? There&#39;s a reason the us supplies thier airforce and keeps em as uptodate as our own. </p>
