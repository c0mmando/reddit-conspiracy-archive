        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guy. Yesterday I was searching deep into some non official theories (I think it&#39;s more accurate and less pejorative than conspiracy theories), and I watch for the first time a video of the No planes theory, which suggests that no plane ever hit the WTC. </p>

<p>[link] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=YQHD4trjCo0">https://youtube.com/watch?v=YQHD4trjCo0</a></p>

<p>But them I did my &quot;own research&quot; as you aways advices. So I found a compilation of amateur footages of the planes hitting the Tower. It&#39;s too much footage to fake, right?</p>

<p>[link] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=814rcm4KC5w">https://youtube.com/watch?v=814rcm4KC5w</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, both the theories got a point. What do you think? No planes theory is that crazy??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as in not passenger planes, as in military drones painted to look like airplanes.  Plus the close up vids are tampered with if you look close you can see wings pass behind distant buildings etc.</p>

<p>No jets in field or pentagon.
Military RC jets outfitted to look like passenger jets.  Or, perhaps no jets and edited into every one of those tapes. Collective amnesia?  Just cannot fathom how a jet disappears into a building tail and all. 
What is crazy is how everyone on reddit is all about &#39;science&#39; and facts, but believe this crap, and other historical nonsense, without critical thinking. </p>

<p>The real question you need to ask: why are there no F14&#39;s in the air?  Sure one plane could sneak in and hit the WTC, but a second one an hour later is beyond imagination.  When you look at this you find out the air controllers took the day off, as did the pilots at the behest of Cheney.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s just no way you could fly 2 jets into downtown new york like that without the best airforce in the world being on deck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt the first coukdve gotten through if people were doing their jobs dutifully. How many small planes have been intercepted by the air force for going off track, not communicsting, and flying too close to no fly zones? And then these get off without a hitch? </p>

<p>When you look into the timelines of when the jets were scrambled, and how fast thry can go, and when they arrived, it doesnt add up. Theres just no way they couldve sneaked on by without someone allowing it.</p>

<p>Im with you, im more concerned with the neglect of duties than the cause of the towers collapsing. Plane or no plane, somebody didnt do their job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I have an issue with is a report made that morning.  I was driving to work about 2 hours away about 20 minutes after this all went down.  I remember the call distinctly, but have never found it or read it.</p>

<p>The caller was a pilot staying at an Arlington hotel after a flight in to National the previous night.  He was out walking and saw a 757 fly over his head, and said to himself, &quot;That guy is WAY too low!&quot;  And then said that the plane hit the ground and bounced before striking the Pentagon.  </p>

<p>This was within minutes of the strike.  Was he a plant?  Or a true eyewitness?   I generally find that the earlier you hear something, the truer it is, before the spin hits and story has been determined and parroted.    If it was a plant, why wouldn&#39;t it be used on every government communication?  And it is was true, why wasn&#39;t it used on every government communication?  Just so odd.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the no plane theory is disinformation used to muddy the waters. Planes hit the towers, be it modified military aircraft, drones or otherwise. Anything to the contrary, be it holographs or computer graphics, don&#39;t hold water considering the amount of people watching the second plan come in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first plane hit, I don&#39;t know, and I have nothing to argue that with, however the fact that Georgie Boy said he saw the first plane strike on local TV, does raise some eye brows. Maybe he smoked some good weed (which then i also want some of that good weed).

<p>Interesting enough, when the Missile theory came out a couple of months after the attack, I went to do a little research on that.... Have a look how the SNARK SM-62A Cruise Missile looked like. They were built and tested between 1946 and 1960, until JFK scrapped the project:
<a href="http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/sm-62.html">http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/sm-62.html</a></p>

<p>Now, if such tech existed in late 40&#39;s, where is that tech today? Have a look at the AGM-86B Cruise Missile. I&#39;m not claiming that missiles were used, but it is very interesting.</p>

<p>The second plane:</p>

<p>The report says that a Boeing 767-222, Flight 175 flew at a speed of 590mph (950km/h - which borders at Mach 1), at an altitude of 700ft. Boeing have confirmed and even laughed at the question, and said that it is IMPOSSIBLE for a Boeing 767 to fly that fast at that altitude, which you will find that this Boeing&#39;s max speed is 530mph at 35,000ft  as advertised on the manufacturing website.
<a href="http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/767family/pf/pf_200prod.page">http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/767family/pf/pf_200prod.page</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrCqlr026W0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrCqlr026W0</a></p>

<p>Only 2 live broadcasts showed the 2nd plane. Other footage only came out later that day and all the other &quot;amateur&quot; footage came out days after the event. All eye witnesses who supposedly saw it, are conveniently behind the camera. 
Here is a comparison of &quot;Live&quot; vs &quot;Evening News&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fjTfl1BXBQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fjTfl1BXBQ</a></p>

<p>Here is footage showing the 2nd hit. At 00:19 the left wing is going behind a distant building, which looks like masking done:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSDfbm8OhCg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSDfbm8OhCg</a></p>

<p>Then there are the ones who conveniently cancelled their flight on that day:
<a href="http://www.truthin7minutes.com/luck/">http://www.truthin7minutes.com/luck/</a></p>

<p>From the moment it happened, people knew something was wrong with the second plane, which spawned the idea that it had a missile pod underneath it.</p>

<p>This is an eye witness:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1KNAEKRkJE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1KNAEKRkJE</a></p>

<p>Also an interesting piece of info to have a look at is Crisis Actors. If you want conclusive proof of Planes or No Planes then you will never find it. Research all the evidence that proves that there was planes, and then research all the proof that there was no planes, and then accept whatever resonates with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your first question....Here is a nice analysis of the &quot;planes&quot;
<a href="http://septemberclues.info/wtc_airplanes.shtml">http://septemberclues.info/wtc_airplanes.shtml</a></p>

<p>By amateur one would assume that a person with no experience in the field of photography and/or videography had their camera handy.... With 911 this is not the case.... Here are the &quot;amateur&quot; footage source:

<p>Here are more inconsistencies:</p>

<p>The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades reported a seismic spike at 9:02.54. </p>

<ul>
<li>The official timeline (released by the media and the FAA) claims that &quot;FLIGHT 175&quot; hit WTC2 at- 9:03.11. </li>
</ul>

<p>These following different impact times as they are viewed on the channels clocks and in various reports. 
CBS- 9:02.58. 
ABC- 9:02.59. 
NBC- 9.03.00. 
WNYW- 9:02.54. 
FOX Archives- 9:02.54. 
CNN 9:03.05. </p>

<p>In the documentary &quot;Reflections on 9/11&quot;, they interviewed a nurse at St. Vincent Hospital... her name is Diana La Carozza.</p>

<p>“… we all had to leave there and come up to the hospital and wait for the people and people have seen the pictures… we all had teams outside the emergency room waiting and no one came.”</p>

<p>The speed you listed is the typical cruise speed, it even says that. So if the speed the plane was traveling was only 60 miles per hour faster than its typical cruising speed, why would it be impossible for the plane to be traveling that fast?</p>

<p>As P4911T argue, at only 700 feet, at that velocity, the whole frame of the plane would start to &quot;flutter&quot; and become uncontrollable, if not even begin to fall apart. That, plus the path the ST plane took, makes it almost impossible - or a matter of sheer luck - to come anywhere near the tower, let alone hit it as precisely as it did, for the most experienced of pilots. </p>

<p>This is irrelevant. Show me numbers that conclusively prove a a Boeing-767 could not physically fly at that speed at that altitude instead. And there is such a thing as pushing the envelope and while dangerous, I don&#39;t think the hijackers would have cared much about safety.</p>

The planes mentioned in the article were damaged at altitude due to pressure differences, not due to speed. Also the flights mentioned in the article landed safely. Had such a thing happened to flight 175, it could have still hit the tower.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a cause of the failure anywhere in that article, and it never mentions that the plane was damaged due to speed. Also the plane landed safely, so obviously even if this had happened to flight 175, it could have still hit the tower with no problems.</p>

<p>First off, these are jets, not passenger planes and there is also no mention of speed at low altitude as a cause of damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_611">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_611</a></p>

<p>That flight was at 35,000 feet and again speed was never mentioned as a factor. In fact the disaster was caused by bad repairs.</p>

<p>(From the wikipedia page)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 15:16, the flight was cleared to climb to flight level 350 (approximately 35,000 feet).</p>

<p>the in-flight break-up was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet</a></p>

<p>Again in none of the crashes listed are high speeds at low altitudes cited as a cause.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not all &quot;solely due to traveling at those speeds&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, none of them are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>however these historical examples of planes falling apart mid-air should suffice to drive home that planes falling apart mid-air is a common and expected failure mode</p>

<p>Yes. Planes falling apart mid flight is a thing that happens, just not for the reasons you claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one that won&#39;t become more unlikely if a plane is well outside its flight envelope and the wings experience massive flutter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no evidence that flight 175 was outside of its flight envelope or that the wings experienced flutter. Even if they did, such flutter would have to be great enough to cause the plane to completely break up as even severe damage would not hinder the plane from hitting the tower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Planes can turn around. <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413273828685_wps_5_map1_JPG.jpg">This</a> image came from one of the articles you listed. Clearly planes have no problem turning around and as you can see in the flight path of flight 175, once such a turn was completed, it is a relatively straight path into the tower.</p>

<p>None of your sources had anything to do with high velocities at sea level though. And the concept of a flight envelope is irrelevant for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) You have given no information on the flight envelope of a Boeing 767</p>

<p>2) Even if flight 175 was outside its flight envelope, it would have still been able to hit the tower with no real problems. Planes do not explode the second they pass beyond their flight envelopes. While flying outside the flight envelope can cause damage to the plane, I don&#39;t think the hijackers cared too much. Its not like they were planning to return the plane in perfect condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, if that is your argument, I will share your opinion so you are not wrong alone. </p>

<p>Because my argument was that professional pilots had big trouble replicating that feat in a simulator / flight trainer, even with &quot;falling apart in midair&quot;-mode switched off. So when you speak of &quot;no real problems&quot;, I must assume you are some sort of master pilot with a laundry list of degrees in engineering who knows exactly how the last minutes of the approach played out, the whole frame shaking under the vibrations from the wings, the cockpit alarms blaring, the last seconds of reckless descent, just one or two final, minimal banking maneuvers, right on point, pulling Gs to no end, fuselage shrieking, engines hot from the dense air, bull&#39;s eye, right where the towers were most vulnerable... you&#39;d do it? Man, why would I argue with you. I mean, who wouldn&#39;t kiss your feet if you only claimed to have a <em>friend</em> who can emulate that precision with that descent at that speed with that approach including the last bank, step out of the plane and say &quot;no real problems!&quot;?</p>

<p>And yet another straw man. I never said it is impossible. I said it is almost impossible, as in highly unlikely, just as I never said high velocity alone inevitably leads to disintegration, but presented it as a very possible worst-case scenario for the results of wing flutter due to extremely high velocity at near-sea level altitude. I said it must have been fucking ace if experienced pilots have great trouble to replicate the maneuver, even with fall-apart-in-midair-due-to-out-of-flight-envelope-wing-flutter-mode off, which is why I find it hard to believe it was done by an inexperienced pilot who just hijacked a normal 767-200 for the first time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes explosives had to be used if there were no planes. Those explosives must have been planted weeks, probably even months in advance with a team who have all somehow kept quiet. </p>

<p>Also the live broadcasts would have to have been faked, which means all those reporters who &quot;saw&quot; the planes must have been in on it and they are also keeping quiet. Also all the amateur  footage was faked, so there are even more people keeping quiet. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the question of what happened to the actual flights. Where they completely fake? What about the people who died on those flights? Did they not exist? Are their families paid actors? If so, there are even more people who must keep quiet. Maybe those people were real and &quot;they&quot; killed them. In which case what happened to the planes? Shot down? Landed and destroyed? Either scenario requires even more people to keep quiet. </p>

<p>What about the plane wreckage found near ground zero? Someone must have planted it. There&#39;s another person who has to keep quiet.</p>

<p>What about flight data? Air traffic controllers would have known if the planes were real. Were they lying? Are they being paid off? If the planes weren&#39;t real the flight paths must have been faked as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious as to how you explain these holes in your hypothesis. Please enlighten me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i dont like (from the arguments ive heard) about the &quot;no planes theory&quot; is how they claim the video footage shows laws of physics being broken in some shape or another, yet they fail to address the fact that cameras back then had much less resolution and poor framerates and were overall shitty. At least st the consumer level. Most of the time, ive seen the arguments use the poor quality videos to their advsntage, when there is a simpler, more plausible explanation.</p>

<p>Honestly, i believe the planes hit the towers. I harbor no doubt on this. But, was it enough to take down the towers (including the third, albeit &quot;indirectly&quot;)? Thats where i do not know, and i hold out on attributing faith to any argument. Was it orchestrated by &quot;terrorists&quot;? I find that plausible, but i tend to think that either way, the US government had some influence, directly or indirectly (either with the actual logistics, or criminal neglect of duties and abandonment of responsibility). </p>

<p>Imo, the no planes theory doesnt hold water. But there are certainly other aspects of 9/11 that i think the &quot;truthers&quot; are on to that seem like a bettet explanation than the official narrative...</p>
