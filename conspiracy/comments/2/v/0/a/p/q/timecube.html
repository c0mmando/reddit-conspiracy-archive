      <p>
       In this thesis I will attempt to explain to misled readers, in odious words, how time is cubic, and nature is harmonious opposites, binaries and antipodes. To explain briefly, the Earth has a North and South pole, these are
       <strong>
        static opposites
       </strong>
       that are required for the
       <strong>
        dynamic opposites
       </strong>
       at the equator, which are both, again, opposite to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth does not revolve on a linear plane of time, but around the pulsating cylindrical static duality of the North and South pole; thinking that it does spin on a linear plane of time, cancels mentally the spherical Earth to a
       <strong>
        flat circle Earth
       </strong>
       ; that, when you have not been educated cubic time, doubles in stupidity and cancels to a singularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opposites would have been in your mind naturally, they are genetically induced; inter alia, you would seek the opposite sex for intercourse, you would find the central opposing factor to quench your hunger or thirst. Of course, you will do this anyway, and the harmonious opposites in nature resonate in your mind however evil you have been educated.
      </p>
      <p>
       A man can only see from one quarter of the
       <em>
        spherical Earth
       </em>
       , and so the best wisdom for the mind is to cube the Earth. A static duality, and a dynamic duality?!
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       are at one end of the dynamic duality, that's made
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       by the pulsating static duality; and if this is the case, then "the Earth is cubic", is the wisest statement in existence, and a necessity for education, voiding cube-less education as stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are educated cube-less, then, of many stupidities, you will be out of control of your emotions and cognition because you don't know your top from bottom, your left from right, or your front from back, which can have, amongst other things, harmful social, political or geological effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could be talking to the enemies, with an unknown sign language or sarcasm; one may be over-nihilistic and others may be ignorant to this fact; and one may think depression is a mental disease rather than a natural mechanism. You'll be surprised how stupid academia is, can one not see the evil in society? This can be abolished with education, but we are educated stupidly-- it was abolished prior to education, and so non-education is the key, but what exactly is non-education? Cubic-ism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Words are a virus, you may notice that a word will become common throughout society; for example, "mysticism" is the commonly used word by singularity-scientists in the present, as an attack against conspiracy theorists, etc. At one point it was "schizophrenic", these common words are but one piece of evidence that the word is a virus, because it has virus-like effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a malicious virus, we talk to ourselves with our tongues which we have called thinking, but an argument using this
       <strong>
        fact
       </strong>
       leads to the response "thought is not only in words", making it an impassable argument, and word-slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course thought is not only in words, but it's unnatural and stupid to groom your mind with sounds made by the tongue, that are understood, in the dim sense, by using rote-educated signs and symbols. Word-thought is singularity thought, it leads our species to extinction and our planet into severe conditions. 
Words are used in a possessive way, and here I'm using both meanings for 'possessive', we name in word relative Earth or species as resource, even if unknowingly. Killing the planet is fun; but killing each other is considered immoral-- but the two go hand in hand, we will kill each other by killing our planet, and this another evident factor that words are stupid; sometimes it is better to kill another human, especially if the human is evil.

       To some extent but he is an old man, plus I like being shouted at, especially if it's important. I was akin to nature at birth, which I learned through that website and it's sister site cubicao.com. So, partially I agree.

       To be honest, I don't believe you're a "thinker" of any kind. If you have coherent thoughts, you certainly can't articulate them.

       Kind of sad that you feel the need to attempt to minimize a valid point because it doesn't fit into your very limited world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to feel threatened, buddy.  It's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your whole "I am the creator.  I am a he." shtick is good...at the level it's at.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll have to grow out of it eventually if you are to move forward on to better things though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with it.  You'll get there.  I know it.

       We all will.

       I excuse your ignorance, as I was once ignorant too.

       Here is a resource for you to begin your quest for knowledge, if that's what it is you seek.

       I do research and experience - a far different, ultimately much more valuable thing.

       Regardless, this is a stupid, girly, catty thread.  I'm done with it.  The other conversation being had here is better.  Respond to this one if you like - or not.  Either way, I'm done here.  I'll stay with the other conversation.  Won't be responding back to this one.
