        : Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Gilbert

        : There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

         the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country

       I think many people just don't want to think about it. It's easier to look the other way and keep living my life is what they tell themselves. Not everyone but s lot of them. With all this police militarization I think a protest would get ugly fast.

       Correct. The average American dumbfuck doesn't even want to know that their democracy was bought out from under them, let alone do something about it. It has become so obvious, yet they keep telling themselves it will get better.

       No, I am well past the point of trying to change anybody's views. The US has devolved entirely too far to have democracy restored. There are only a few ways this ends and none of them are good, if you're not a billionaire. There is a cost associated choosing to remain ignorant and I believe we are rather close to paying it.

       I think pepole are waiting because they don't want to be the first to stand up.  And despite the fact that we're more connected online we are less connected with our own neighborhoods so unless people live close to where a protest is happening that someone send already started.  I think people don't want to be first to stand up because they don't want to be the first out down.

       Alot of people know whats up when it comes to 9/11 but they are poor working stiffs that are too socialized to keep busy financing/upgrading the minimal lifestyles they supposedly 'live'. 
When maintaining lifestyle is more important than prosecuting war criminals. The war criminals keep making that dough.

       Most people don't know the facts. Even if they know the facts, they usually can't put them in the broader context (historical and social), if they can do that, they usually do not have the a. time b. money c. energy to organize a fight against ALL of society.

       People forget American politicians are just people like you and me.  What does that say about the rest of us?  It says we're probably all dicks who'd act the same way if we were put in their shoes.  We say 'they' are the bad guys and 'we' are the good guys.. which is their argument as well.

       Yeah remain in slavery over what a mediocre old man sang about, Bob Dylan himself spoke about selling his soul to the "big guy, head honcho". The prime creator is not male or female so that tells me who he is serving. Service to others is not about service to state. As far as I'm concerned those who serve the state are robots and not human beings.

       That's true, more or less. A corporation is a person. Personhood is a legal definition and I suppose could be seen as a legal fiction. But the constitution is a legal framework and to participate in that framework and access the protections provided in it, you have to let it apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       A man-on-the-land who sheds his personhood, which is different than shedding your citizenship, hasn't the legal protections afforded the fiction that is the person. If that's how you want to roll, that's your prerogative as far as I'm concerned but you will have to conduct yourself within the norms of society anyway. Folks don't just get to claim the law doesn't apply to them and start acting like feral animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, sovereign men, or legal men or whatever they call themselves, just want to be left the hell alone, I can certainly relate to that.

       I actually was pretty ok with the old system, before I found out that it was essentially run by organized crime and everything was a lie. If we actually has a representative government that didn't interfere with news and other media, that didn't start illegal wars.. I'm good with that. I just don't know if that's realistic anymore.
