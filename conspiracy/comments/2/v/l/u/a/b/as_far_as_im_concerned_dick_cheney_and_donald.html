<p><strong>Göring</strong>: Why, of course, the people don&#39;t want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don&#39;t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert</strong>: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.</p>

<p><strong>Göring</strong>: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, <strong>the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, more or less. A corporation is a person. Personhood is a legal definition and I suppose could be seen as a legal fiction. But the constitution is a legal framework and to participate in that framework and access the protections provided in it, you have to let it apply to you.</p>

<p>A man-on-the-land who sheds his personhood, which is different than shedding your citizenship, hasn&#39;t the legal protections afforded the fiction that is the person. If that&#39;s how you want to roll, that&#39;s your prerogative as far as I&#39;m concerned but you will have to conduct yourself within the norms of society anyway. Folks don&#39;t just get to claim the law doesn&#39;t apply to them and start acting like feral animals. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, sovereign men, or legal men or whatever they call themselves, just want to be left the hell alone, I can certainly relate to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually was pretty ok with the old system, before I found out that it was essentially run by organized crime and everything was a lie. If we actually has a representative government that didn&#39;t interfere with news and other media, that didn&#39;t start illegal wars.. I&#39;m good with that. I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s realistic anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then we&#39;ve decided that use of the term citizen by government officials is an aggression because it subjects you to their whim and folly. Self-identifying as a citizen is self-imposed indentured servitude, voila better pay taxes.</p>
