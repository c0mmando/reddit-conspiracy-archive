    <div class="md"><p>Ok, this is just basic math.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/vacc-effectiveness.html">The CDC claims that the Whooping Cough vaccine is only 70-90% effective for most people, depending on how long ago you got it.</a></p>

<p>Hypothetical situation:</p>

<p>1000 people are exposed to enough Whooping Cough virus load that they would catch the virus (let&#39;s say 10% of those exposed catch the virus, so 10000 people were exposed in their everyday life).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say 95% are vaccinated.</p>

<p>That means 50 people get it no matter what by being un-vaccinated</p>

<p>So that&#39;s 950 people vaccinated that are exposed to enough virus to catch it. That means with a max 90% effectiveness, 95-285 people with the vaccine would have caught it.</p>

<p>95% vaccination rate leads to 2-6x more vaccinated people catching it than un-vaccinated. Why? Because most of the people that <em>would</em> have caught it, didn&#39;t catch it. As long as the vaccination rate is greater than effectiveness, the number of vaccinated sick people will outnumber the number of un-vaccinated people </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/faqs.html">CDC also claims the vaccine decreases the severity of infection</a>, but I assume most won&#39;t take their word on it.</p>

<p>Edit: Changed 98% vaccinated to 95% vaccinated

    <div class="md"><p>In large groups of vaccinated people, it will trend to around 70-90% of people are immune.</p>

<p>Vaccinated children tend to be higher, as effectiveness decreases over time for this virus (I don&#39;t think this is true for all vaccines and viruses, I think some/most are most constant through life).</p>

<p>So you could randomly have a group of 100 vaccinated people that are all immune, but odds are more likely that only 80 people are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much, based on the report (it says 5 doses gives 98%, but I don&#39;t think most people get more than two, which gives 90+% in the short term, and then drops over time).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the medical reason exactly, but it sounds like you lose antibodies over time for this vaccine, plus sometimes your body just might not respond to the vaccine. Or the vaccine could be bad (too old, got too hot/cold in transit, or just a manufacturing error or something). Nothing is guaranteed when talking about the human body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lose antibodies.  Your body won&#39;t produce the same ones over and over hour entire life, it stops looking for disease it has not seen in a long long time to focus on the ones that it does see.</p>

<p>There is no way to make a vaccine 100 percent effective, unless you say crippled your body by making you have a constant and perpetual immune response to the disease you don&#39;t have.  That&#39;d kill you pretty quick itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your entire hypothetical situation is that you&#39;re not considering that <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200850">pertussis vaccination efficacy wanes each subsequent year after vaccination</a>.  A fully vaccinated individual is essentially no more resistant to pertussis than an unvaccinated individual after 5 years.  </p>

<p>Secondly, you haven&#39;t considered that <a href="http://www.cidd.psu.edu/research/synopses/acellular-vaccine-enhancement-b.-parapertussis">the acellular pertussis vaccine greatly enhances colonization of parapertussis</a> (another strain of whooping cough).  </p>

<p>So, not only is the DTaP vaccine one of the least effective vaccines on the market, vaccinated individuals are much more likely to be the source of, and vector for the spread of certain strains of whooping cough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on the data from the first link, it looks like adults either have a natural/built up immunity, or the virus doesn&#39;t have a enough of an impact on them to be diagnosed with Whooping Cough. It mentions a control group of unvaccinated people, but I couldn&#39;t see the data.</p>

<p>With my non-medical analysis of the data in the report, it looks like the virus has the largest impact from 0-17 years old (especially at 0 and 7-12), and then drops off significantly. It could be that people should get a 6th dose  at 15, or the 5 doses should be spread out more to protect those at 16 and 17 who are still at risk, but effectiveness of the vaccine is reduced.</p>

<p>As for the second article, I don&#39;t know enough about the subject to make a proper judgement, but it should warrant more investigation. Although what I&#39;ve looked up, says Parapertussis is a much lower danger than Pertussis, so it may be acceptable to have an increased risk to that virus to protect from the other.</p>

<p>End result is basically what you said, it&#39;s not that great of vaccine. We may want to investigate a new type or version that protects from Parapertussis as well, and a version that lasts longer/requires fewer boosters</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>95% vaccination rate leads to 2-6x more vaccinated people catching it than un-vaccinated. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because, 19x more vaccinated people than unvaccinated... So let&#39;s see:</p>

<p>70-90% effectiveness according to CDC... So we should expect 1.9-5.7x as many vaccinated people to get it as unvaccinated (at a ratio of 19:1, or 95%) <strong>because of the limits of the vaccine itself, and not because of unvaccinated people</strong>.</p>

<p>Edit: This actually assumes that all unvaccinated people will get it, which they won&#39;t</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not sure what you&#39;re trying to say with that 2-6x stat... Maybe I misunderstood and you&#39;re not blaming the unvaccinated people.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m using a hypothetical that would be basically impossible to track in real life by saying 1000/10% would have definitely gotten the virus from everyday exposure. So in the thought experiment, 50/500 unvaccinated exposed people in the 10000 person &quot;study&quot; group would catch the virus.</p>

<p>The idea behind the post is to show that articles that say &quot;more people with the vaccine caught the virus than those unvaccinated&quot; don&#39;t really add anything to the discussion, since mathematically, you&#39;d expect vaccinated infections&gt;unvaccinated infections as long as vaccine effectiveness&lt;vaccination rate </p>

<p>There is a lot of <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article">evidence and studies</a> showing that the Pertussis &quot;Whooping Cough&quot; vaccine is fairly useless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We found that immunity does not even persist into early childhood in some cases. We also observed that DPT vaccine does not fully protect children against the level of clinical disease defined by WHO. Our results indicate that children ages 5-6 years and possibly younger, ages 2-3 years, play a role as silent reservoirs in the transmission of pertussis in the community. More studies are needed to find the immunologic basis of protection against infection and colonization and thus an effective way to eradicate pertussis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There can be beneficial effects from actually getting the disease. In addition to life time immunity some diseases help prevent cancer.</p>

<p>Letting your child get mumps (described in the attached article) as a &quot;generally mild disease&quot; can help prevent ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>&quot;Prior to vaccination, mumps was generally a mild illness but could have serious sequelae including orchitis and sterility, meningitis and deafness, and pancreatitis. Nevertheless, our study suggests there could also have been unanticipated long-term anticancer benefits of a mumps infection, such as we have described in this paper. Understanding the scope of and basis for the potential benefits of childhood infections may allow immunologists to duplicate the beneficial effects at the same time that vaccination provides the means for avoiding a natural infection and its possible immediate consequences. Further study of individuals going through a mumps infection, especially with a focus on mucin immunity, may provide clues to mechanisms for duplicating the beneficial effects of mumps parotitis suggested by this study.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/</a></p>

<p>I guess we will need another vaccine to correct the unintended consequence of the previous vaccine. And so it goes.... 300 new vaccines are in development.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s get the facts straight here.</p>

<p>The acellular DTaP puts a lot less strain on the immune system, at the cost of waning immunity and some efficacy.</p>

<p>The problem is that people don&#39;t know they are supposed to be getting revaccinated.  It&#39;s not that it doesn&#39;t work.  It doesn&#39;t work as well and for as long, and that is the reason for higher rates of pertussis, NOT anti-vaxxers, as some might have you believe.  </p>

<p>But honestly, I&#39;d rather have this vaccine than the old one which came with a slew of side effects.</p>

<p>While the rates have not yet dropped down low enough to completely compromise herd immunity, enough people have refused immunization to cause small outbreaks (&gt;20) of easily preventable diseases.</p>

<p>Its not going to back up what the user posted.  Essentially what they did is whenever there was a case of small pox, doctors would swoop in and vaccinate everyone around the person so that it couldn&#39;t spread.  Now some say that people were completely quarantined in this process.  Some say they weren&#39;t.  Fact is, I don&#39;t really know more than what I&#39;ve read.  So its possible they quarantined them and thus effectively cut it off from the greater part of the world and slowly eradicated it.  But since the vaccine was certainly present during this time, and applied at the same time, its hard to say the vaccine had no effect.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  It would seem that quarantine is perhaps still necessary, in order to prevent the sort of slow background spread we are seeing now of measles in our own (highly vaccinated) population.  So in order to eradicate, you must vaccinate+quarantine.  Makes sense, since vaccination isn&#39;t quite 100 percent effective even if you could achieve 100 percent vaccination.</p>

<p>Small Pox was eradicated through quarantine</p>

<p>Source? My history books tell me that it was a combination of quarantine and vaccines, both playing major roles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Polio was renamed to make the vaccine appear a success</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m calling baloney on this. Polio used to be rampant. People with withered legs or arms were fairly common before Jonas Salk came along.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scientists involved with the Mumps vaccine have now admitted that Merck faked the effectiveness tests i.e. the vaccine doesn&#39;t work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Is there another factor involved in mumps cases dropping to 0.1% of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5553a1.htm">what it was in 1968?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measles - The outbreaks are coming directly from the vaccine, it&#39;s the vaccine strain of the disease which is spread via shedding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s less than a chance in 10,000 of getting measles from the vaccine. I haven&#39;t read a single reliable report of the vaccine starting the outbreaks and many reliable reports saying that it was due to a large, close knit community that refused immunization. If no one gets immunized, the chances of getting measles skyrockets.</p>

<p>If there were no vaccines, we&#39;d be back in the 19th century with miscarriages, deadly childhood diseases and antiimmune diseases destroying the world. Not to mention various permanent health defects that can occur in young people who get a disease like measles or polio.</p>

Measles has not been responsible for a death in the US for over ten years. You&#39;re far more likely to die from MRSA. It kills almost 20,000 a year in the US yet everyone is going apeshit over measles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment made me chuckle. You admit that vaccines aren&#39;t 100% effective. Which is interesting, because the propaganda is always some variant of, &quot;oh but if only 100% of people were vaccinated!&quot;. Even if that happens, as you pointed out, they wouldn&#39;t 100% effective.</p>

<p>Of course I expect you to say, &quot;oh, but the rates would be so much lower.&quot; Except there are pretty clear indications that some vaccines cause the very condition they are purported to prevent.</p>

<p>Citation needed. Let&#39;s compare disease rates (polio for example) with adverse vaccine effects. In 99% of polio cases, there were no long term effects. 1% had paralysis. Most vaccines probably have a 1% adverse effect rate. Considering polio is no longer around, and was already almost extinct due to health standards anyways, how is it logical to vaccinate for something that no longer exists, when the vaccine is worse than 99% of polio cases?</p>

<p>I mean, think on that one for a second. </p>

<p>charts pretty much says it all. and youre right, we pretty much almost eradicated polio. almost. i look forward to it coming back and ravaging the lives of the spawn of imbeciles who deny science and claim they went to the &quot;university of google.&quot;  the fact is, vaccines have prevented far more illnesses than they may have caused. if you doubt that, feel free to watch as these diseases we had controlled for decades come back.</p>
