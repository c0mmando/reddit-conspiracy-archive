<p>So you are going to just ignore all the supporting evidence for the official story being correct? I assure you, there is far, far, more forms of far, far, more credible evidence that supports the official story. These are all cherry picked sources, now all of a sudden the mainstream media is credible but all the other times when they are supporting the official story they are lying. Please. Look at what is happening now with Brian Williams when he was called out on one incredibly unimportant lie on nightly news and he is now taking some time off.  There are checks and balances on the media to a degree.  Not perfect ones, but ones that prevent obvious bullshit from being perpetuated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence is not being held back by anyone, it is in the public domain for everyone to see. These few details presented to you here are cherry picked to tell a narrative that goes against what all the other evidence shows to be reality. ALL the evidence just does not support the truther position, which is why political scientists and historians on the matter overwhelmingly support the official story and the only people who don&#39;t support it are uneducated(untrained historians) people who are prone to crafting fanciful narratives based on cherry picked sources and data(not proper way independently knowing anything with any degree of accuracy and is the product of confirmation bias).  </p>

You&#39;re funny. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re legitimately arguing this but either way I don&#39;t care. Either way this is a joke. </p>

<p>I could not possibly care less about the media. I look at the fucking facts. Why did FBI confiscate security footage? Guess what. That&#39;s called a coverup. Why did Bush and Cheney have to meet together and not under oath while speaking with 9/11 commission? Hmm. (Pretty hilarious they knew the moron would fuck it up). Why did the US stand down? Do you understand the defences that have been put in place?... Many times the evidence for has been fabricated. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m even wasting my time here. </p>

<p>And I absolutely love when you call the people who know what&#39;s going on &quot;untrained historians&quot;. Makes it SOO much sweeter when this comes out. Just remember calling all those people dumb. I&#39;ll remember you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all assumptions... and proves my point. When I said untrained historians, I mean uneducated people who don&#39;t know how to derive the truth in an accurate and objective way.  Your list of questions proves my point.  You are a person who makes  assumptions based on preconceived notions that are often not based on complete context, any reality at all, or the minority view amongst specialists. That is not how accurate investigation and fact finding takes place. The reality that you view your ASSUMPTIONS, as some absolute truth just shows how much objectivity you lack.</p>

<p>Do you think you know more than these people(academics from all over the world) whose job it is to be accurate and as informed as possible on a subject? Why is it only uneducated(by and large) and people/sources that are not credible that espouse these ideas/narrative?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You must be too young to remember the diagrams of bin Laden&#39;s extravagant mountain bunkers, complete with their own power plants and air filtration systems, published in every major newspaper, or the behavior of the media in the run-up to the obvious fiasco of the Iraq War.</p>

<p>Yes, much evidence is in the public domain for all to see. As such, we can evaluate the different theories against the evidence we have.</p>

<p>For example, we have tiny pieces of firefighters&#39; bones found on the roofs of neighboring buildings (among hundreds of fragments of building occupants). Could some sort of explosives explain a firefighter getting cremated <em>and</em> his remains being forcefully ejected hundreds of feet? Yes.</p>

<p>NIST doesn&#39;t even have a coherent theory (&quot;we are unable to provide a full explanation for the total collapse&quot;). Can this explain the firefighters being cremated in midair? Er, no, it doesn&#39;t explain very much.</p>

<p>Really, what evidence is there that&#39;s better explained by fire theory than by explosives theory? The total collapse, the rate of collapse, the total dismemberment of the steel structure, molten steel found in the rubble, over 1100 people totally vanished and most of the rest turned into mulch and bone meal...all of these are more easily explained by explosive events than by fire and gravity.</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence that&#39;s better explained by gravity than explosives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I ask a &quot;FreeThinkingMan&quot; to comment on specific evidence, and you simply reiterate an argument from authority based on a completely unsubstantiated &quot;general consensus of historians and  political scientists&quot;? Do you think each of these academics could respond to the questions I asked?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it only uneducated(by and large) and people/sources that are not credible that espouse these ideas/narrative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now who&#39;s cherry-picking? Funny you bring that up, though. I&#39;d wager a lot that the vast majority of the general public who believe the official story have no familiarity with the actual details of the &quot;investigation&quot;.</p>

<p>Further, almost every day I come across a debunker talking about all the structural damage in WTC7 and how it helped cause the collapse. But NIST ruled out structural damage as a factor in the collapse. </p>

<p>So...Who is really uneducated and uncredible here?</p>

<p>Who is basing their opinions on the actual evidence, and who on their own preconceptions?</p>

<p>Your entire argument is based on faith in the media and academia, not evidence. Totally ridiculous. Orwell would have such a laugh at your username.</p>

I&#39;m just bummed I didn&#39;t get invited to the International World&#39;s Smartest People Symposium on 9/11 where apparently they all came to this &quot;general consensus&quot;. I guess I&#39;m just a dumb idiot who will believe anything! </p>

<p>I love how he calls verifiable facts he can&#39;t explain and won&#39;t address &quot;truther talking points&quot;. He&#39;s got a funny impression of academia as well, but I&#39;m sure that will be rectified when he&#39;s actually old enough to go to university.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking the word of the most read and educated people on the subject is more of a heuristic for acquiring an understanding of something given limited resources and time. Cherry picking details would be ignoring or not reading the entire 9/11 Commission Report(the most credible and detailed account of 9/11 coming from a bipartisan investigation) and favoring a small detail that supposedly contradicts the conclusions of all the other facts gathered and presented in it. By the way the person presenting you with this information has no formal educational background in anything relevant and is only mentioned by other gullible people who weight uneducated people&#39;s perspectives more credibly than the relevant experts on the subject, academics.</p>

<p>My argument is not based on any faith in media at all, my argument is based on multiple things. One of them being the heuristic that I mentioned earlier which was an understanding of how academia works, and how the thorough investigative methodology employed in multiple disciplines produces a more accurate conclusion than uneducated people who are experts in nothing, and who on top of it all, have not consumed a fraction of the information that the academics have.</p>

<p>I am willing to bet a lot of money that your perspective on the subject comes from consuming &quot;well-crafted&quot; documentaries that employ numerous film making tricks to produce a feelings or imply ideas that the facts and specific details alone would not lead you to believe. If not that then some incredibly biased blog posts from a conspiracy nutjob regurgitating the same talking points detailed in documentaries and equally unqualified sources. If you are concerned about details and forming &quot;your own&quot; conclusions, then you should have read the most authoritative, credible, and qualified source of information on the subject, the 9/11 Commission Report. Most people who repeat the truther talking points have not consumed this information and are therefore not qualified to discuss this subject in ANY meaningful way. Based on your positions and your regurgitation of truther talking points, I doubt you have read it, and if you haven&#39;t, you have no reason to consider yourself informed on the subject. Worst of all, if you haven&#39;t read it, that means you genuinely don&#39;t care, you are just talking about something to give yourself and imaginary people on the internet the impression that you know something revelatory that the most educated people in the world(literally) widely disagree with you on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like most you don&#39;t look around, many credible people understand this. The fact so many claim otherwise is because these people have been convinced, like you, by the official narrative. They are small minded and don&#39;t believe the government is doing anything behind their backs. It&#39;s sad this is the case but it&#39;s been this way for almost 70 years thanks to disinformation campaigns by the CIA, etc. You are lied to every single day. You really are. Anyway I&#39;d like you to give an explanation for at least half of these points. Comments included.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stress enough the effectiveness of psychological warfare. It prevents people from accepting facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is just a bullshit assumption that you have made based on some OLD CIA mind control experiments that were necessary and justified at the time they were developed. Imagine if you are the government and you have information that is necessary to know to understand why a conflict is necessary for the greater good of the people, but to publicly disclose this information would greatly reduce the chances of success, cost American soldier&#39;s lives, and harm numerous diplomatic deals and relationships that directly involve the well-being of the economy. Since the consensus of the population is necessary to wage war effectively, how do you convince a population to go to war when you can&#39;t give them the exact reasons of why it is in their interests? Of course you have to develop methods to convince them, for the greater good of your people.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know how academia works. It is these people&#39;s entire lives to understand one very specific subject matter in the most objective way possible.  They are not small minded, that is exactly something a person totally oblivious to academic pursuits(pursuit of truth or reality) and academia in general would say. If you don&#39;t know how academic pursuits work then you don&#39;t know what a credible person is. I am not going to waste my time researching and debunking some cherry picked talking points. The majority of those points are just mundane details, but when put in the false context that the evil government is trying to hide something, they become  ominous. You have been brainwashed by documentaries and delusional bloggers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t stress enough the effectiveness of psychological warfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do stress what psychological warfare is being used against Americans. I guarantee every single instance or example of &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, if it indeed exists is in the best interests of the people and not apart of some plot to depopulate the earth. This concern is a paranoid delusion, point out some of the examples of what you think psychological warfare is currently being used and I&#39;ll explain/debunk each one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course your not going to provide me with what you think are examples of the government conducting &quot;psychological warfare&quot; against its people. But you know enough to know it worked on me, because I disagree with you. I must be the victim of a government psyop because I don&#39;t accept unsubstantiated conjecture as complete fact... please. Why don&#39;t you share your knowledge of these government psyops, why make me go look for this information you already have? That is kind of a dick thing to do if you actually think they exist and I am falling prey to them everyday. That is a cop out. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know how academic institutions work, if you actually cared about what you were talking about you would pursue the truth the proper way. I&#39;ll give you a hint of what the proper way is, it does not involve watching documentaries. It involves reading a lot of dense literature written by academics and phds, the most educated people on the specific areas they studied. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the definition of willful ignorance. I think it was Socrates who said, &quot;All I know is that I know everything&quot;. It was either &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot;, I forget.  A dialogue that discusses the truth is never a waste of time. Out of the many positives that come from discourse, the major ones are that you learn about gaps or possible holes in reasoning that you may have(we all have beliefs that have no rational foundations, we must be constantly vigilant of adopting unfounded beliefs), you learn about what other people know and believe to be true and why, and you learn what mental tricks the brain naturally performs to maintain its beliefs. The latter means we must fight nature to insure rationality because if we are introduced to information on matters we currently know nothing about we tend to latch onto those beliefs despite all evidence and reasoning saying otherwise. </p>

<p>The reason you don&#39;t present your examples of how the government conducts psychological warfare against us all is because you yourself are aware you will come off as an irrational crackpot, these views will NOT withstand the smallest scrutiny(but hey, people seemed to know what they were talking about on this forum or blog and they all agreed with each other, they got to be correct), and most importantly the examples you provide defy common sense and all the academic literature that shows us how the human mind works and acquires beliefs. With a small degree of rational inquiry we can trace the ACTUAL origins of most beliefs we have, none of which are caused by A GOVERNMENT PSYOP... It is a common philosophical exercise to reflect on where your beliefs come from, it aids in making us more self aware and rational.  I should mention that psychology is one of the most well-researched areas of inquiry and very few if not none of the experts in that field would say that human behavior is a product of government psyops.  They would laugh at you for a good second if you proposed that human behavior and beliefs are governed by the will of a shadowy government agency.  There is literally no model of the mind and human decision making processes that has government psyops at its core.  You will never know how ridiculous this sounds because of your inability to think objectively. Even a basic understanding of psychology and basic interactions with other people should show you how this is a ridiculous thought. </p>

<p>In the end you are saying I am the product of a government psyop, without telling my why my positions are untrue and what psyop I am falling victim to. Not only is that incredibly unethical, but of course highlights your very real protective bubble you create  to nurture  your delusions that are based on pure assumptions. You don&#39;t know what government psyop I have fallen victim to because you have not read anything that would support this view and under basic very real scrutiny, your claim clearly becomes an absurd assumption. I disagree with you, I must be the product of some government psyop... please. Imagine if the human mind and psyche were that simple, that gross over simplification of the nature of man must be appealing and one of the reasons you hold on to it.  I suggest you read some psychology and philosophy if you really want to know the origin of people&#39;s irrationality and beliefs because you couldn&#39;t be further from the TRUTH.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like your head is about implode and you are leaving. Talk about being a hypocrite.</p>

<p>You are a bad/unethical person by most people&#39;s standards for the following reasons. You have expressed numerous times that I am stupid throughout this discussion and when I express a willingness to learn how I am being manipulated by the government to believe inaccurate views, you vaguely refer to a vague list on wikipedia. I am not understanding the same things you are by reading that &quot;list&quot; and you are convinced somewhere within that &quot;list&quot; lies the reason for why I believe what I do. Let&#39;s just say that I am stupid and I am not understanding what I need to, you are just going to allow me to live the rest of my life delusional. That is the conduct of a shitty person, you can&#39;t even go through the effort of copy and pasting what things from that &quot;list&quot; caused me to believe what I currently understand to be true(it would take like 3 min tops).  </p>

<p>I am pretty sure you are a good person and genuinely care but your actions(not listing how my beliefs are being manipulated by the government) is just a way that you hide from your own lack of information in these specific aspects of life(defense mechanism). You, yourself, are afraid to confront your own ignorance and you are 100 percent aware of how producing this list would make you come of in the eyes of anyone with any sense. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you this link, maybe it can deprogram you from all the nonsense you have read from the uneducated assholes who don&#39;t care about spreading misinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the only subreddit where a person will initiate a discussion about how people who don&#39;t agree with the central premise of a post and will simply get flustered and leave as opposed to staying around and having a healthy back and forth discussion where people provide reason and evidence </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want to list what you may or may not have believed because you&#39;ll keep coming back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me explain to you how a rational dialogue takes place. A person makes a claim and then the person who disagrees offers a refutation of the argument(reasons presented for the claim to be believed).  In order for a person to be rational and for an idea to be correct, the person making the claim then has the burden of addressing the refuter&#39;s counterarguments to their argument for the original belief. Again, this in order for a claim/argument to be correct, rational, and justified. There is a back and forth until either the counter arguments for a claim are rebutted and the argument for the original claim is rational and has literally no presented reason to not be believed, or the original claim and argument cannot be defended by counterarguments and therefore has no rational reason to be believed based off of presented arguments and should be dismissed. </p>

<p>A few problems emerges in this rational discourse when</p>

<p>A) the person making an argument for x does not rebut counterarguments(cannot admit his argument has been refuted) and then acts life if his argument still holds up. 
B) the person making an argument for x quits mid rational discourse, and makes the rebuttal of a counterargument to be something like, &quot;all your positions are a product of government psyops so therefore they are all wrong&quot;, while at the same time not explaining how this is the reality. The last part of this is crucial in that it is the same thing as a kid putting fingers in both of his/her ears and repeating, &quot;I can&#39;t hear you, I can&#39;t hear you&quot;. While then smugly walking away from a conversation as if his point is still valid... this is a clear cut case of delusion and the defense mechanism to protect one&#39;s belief system from reason and evidence. </p>

<p>Your reasoning for you doing this is that &quot;I&#39;ll keep coming back&quot;, but that is how rational discourse works! A person &quot;keeps coming back&quot; with counterarguments and refutations of refutations until there the original idea/argument survives rational inquiry and is therefore a rational belief based on arguments presented.</p>

<p>Of course you are not aware of how rational discourses work. You are not providing logic and arguments for your position, that is what you don&#39;t get. Some mental gymnastic maneuver is taking place here, where you act like you no longer have some burden of proof or burden to refute presented arguments. And YOU are claiming that logic is on your side... That is obviously not the case when you break down our discussion into its main points and counterpoints. That requires the ability to follow and construct a logical argument, two things you demonstrated an inability to do. </p>

<p>Being aware of what and how to properly conduct a rational discourse is necessary in order for your conversations/dialogues to actually be a part of some accurate truth seeking process. Having your positions survive the onslaught of ALL counterarguments is required in order to be justified in holding that belief. Your positions cannot be defended evidenced by your inability to respond to counterarguments and because of your inability to articulate logical rebuttals to my counterarguments. </p>

<p>The irony of it all is that this all started with you saying that anyone who disagrees will just leave or their head will just implode, when it is in fact you and people who hold your positions that cannot withstand objective inquiry and make up nonsense reasons to leave... Time to confront reality, you are not rational.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find myself falling in the confirmation bias trap often. But on the 911 topic, there is simply too much information involving inconsistencies that have transformed into fairy tales.</p>

<p>The onus for confirmation bias goes both ways, and a &quot;drive by&quot; like this shows that you suffer from it. If you, like me, look at all the information you can find on both sides with an open mind the only conclusion you will come to is any true narrative is very different than the official narrative.</p>

<p>The President and the Vice Present ask that no investigation be done into the biggest attack on US soil?  Their oath of office should force them into investigating it, for the constituents that elected them.   They have an obligation to do this for the people.  But nope.   </p>

<p><em>The American People</em>:  Terrorists just hijacked a bunch of planes and destroyed a bunch of buildings for the first time ever.  Should we find out how and why this happened Mr. President?</p>

<p><em>Bush</em>:  Meh.  Not that important.</p>

<p>Then after Tom Daschle said he was gonna do it anyway, he conveniently gets Anthrax mailed to his office.  It&#39;s like Tony Soprano is running things behind the scenes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/30/terrorism.afghanistan2">US Security officials rejected key information on bin laden by Sudan</a> (theres a theme here with investigating bin laden before 9/11 isnt there)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally &quot;the database&quot;, was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden&#39;s organisation would turn its attention to the west.&quot; - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">Robin Cook, former UK Foreign Secretary</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.millat.com/democracy/Foreign%20Policy/Briefing_Paper_english_11.pdf">The CIA created and armed the Mujahideen with 7.5 billion in 1979 </a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6033383.stm">the Saudis matched them dollar for dollar</a></p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens MAK, precursor to Al Qaeda, received funding from the ISI (which received funding from the CIA)</p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens tunnel complex, which he would later use after 9/11, was <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/pittsburghpostgazette092301.html">financed by the CIA</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The Sudanese security services, he said, would happily keep close watch on bin Laden for the United States. But if that would not suffice, the government was prepared to place him in custody and hand him over, though to whom was ambiguous. In one formulation, Erwa said Sudan would consider any legitimate proffer of criminal charges against the accused terrorist.&quot; Their negotiations concluded as such: &quot;&quot;We said he will go to Afghanistan, and they [US officials!] said, &#39;Let him.&#39;&quot;- <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800593.html">Washington Post 2001</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/cron.html">Clinton declined to charge bin laden with a crime in 94</a> even though he had been clearly linked to the WTC bombings.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/10/uk.davidshayler">MI6 paid large sums to al qaeda in Libya to assassinate gadhaffi in 96</a>. Gadaffi issued an INTERPOL arrest warrant for bin Laden in 98, US and UK downplayed it, likely because they had recently funded the libya cell. 5 months later, al qaeda bombed US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya</p></li>
<li><p>Al Qaeda and the US fought on the same side of the war in Kosovo and Bosnia. They recently repeated the process with Libya and Syria</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, bin Laden turned against the US after they occupied military bases in Saudi Arabia. This doesnt make sense, because: Scott Armstrong, at the time the top investigative reporter for the Washington Post, <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/news/arming-i.htm">stated that the United States and Saudi Arabia had jointly conspired to covertly build $200 billion worth of military installations between the years 1979 and 1992</a>. Steve Coll, eminent Bin Laden biographer, states that the Binladen group received a multitude of these contracts, with the knowing intent to support to house US military personal during wars that may threaten Saudi territory. This was occuring at the same time that Osama was tight with his family and using Binladen group assets to build bases in Afghanistan. Of course he was aware of the business dealings between the company.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/01/lkl.00.html">Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, on Larry King Live</a>: &quot;In the mid-&#39;80s, if you remember, we and the United - Saudi Arabia and the United States were supporting the Mujahideen to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets. He [Osama bin Laden] came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists. Isn&#39;t it ironic?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>And then there is the fascinating story of Egyptian Ali Muhammed, only tangentially related but thoroughly interesting nonetheless.
He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">In 1984, he was hired by the CIA</a>, though they claim that their relationship was short-lived. He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima">providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima</a>, convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen</a>, returning just months later.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early 1990&#39;s he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. According to former FBI special agent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html">Jack Cloonan, in an interview with PBS</a>, his first training session included Osama bin Laden, as well as Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al Qaeda.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Sacred-Terror-Radical/dp/0812969847">Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged</a> that Muhammed took maps and training materials from Fort Bragg and used them to write the Al Qaeda terrorist training manual.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/">His superior at Fort Bragg, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, has stated that</a> “I think you or I would have a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery, than an Egyptian major in the unit that assassinated Sadat would have getting a visa, getting to California, getting into the Army and getting assigned to a Special Forces unit. That just doesn’t happen.”</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php#page-2">Elsewhere he stated that</a> &quot;It was unthinkable that an ordinary American GI would go unpunished after fighting in a foreign war,&quot; and that he assumed that Muhammed was sponsored by the CIA.</p></li>

<p><strong>THE TOWERS&#39; COLLAPSES</strong></p>

<p><strong>SOUTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">this was the expected movement of the top</a> if it was simply collapsing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>

<p><strong>NORTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symmetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;amp;amp;t=26">debris fall occurring on the right face of the building.</a></p>

<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact <del>93%</del> 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;&quot;The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within <strong>12s</strong>, the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">NIST file NCSTAR1 section 2.9</a></p>

<p>If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that <em>-according to NIST-</em> all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).</p>

<p>Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.</p>

<p>2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in <strong>0.029s</strong></p>

<p>29/<strong>1000ths</strong> of a second.</p>

<p>According to NIST, each floor -composed by concrete and steel- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.</p>

<p>Despite the top being only ~<strong>16%</strong> of the building (weaker and lighter), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining <del>93%</del> 83% perfectly intact structure (<em>stronger as well</em>) defying yet again another law of physics -Newton&#39;s third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the <del>93%</del> 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.
A better explanation of the laws of physics violation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=2329">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=2329</a></p>

<p><strong>TOWER SEVEN</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the debris <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">top to bottom gash.</a></p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">large quantities of smoke,</a> there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of<a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg"> soot in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">fires that were already extinct.</a></p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">normal office fires</a> (or just plain office fires) and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">infernos</a>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.</a> This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616">http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616</a></p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers&#39; debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to say that I was the one who would be explaining things, just that not all differing views are going to be correct, it is through explanation that people collectively arrive at the most correct view. If your views are correct and you explain them, perhaps more people will arrive at the same correct views if they understand your explanation.</p>

<p>How do you know the attack wasn&#39;t done to start a war, or those who undertook it weren&#39;t cultivated and permitted to do it so that a war could take place? Where is the proof of that?</p>

<p>Are you certain that a passport could fall out of an exploding airplane without much damage?</p>

<p>Do you believe that cellphones could make calls midflight in 2001?</p>

Throwing a phone out of a plane and then jumping after it is nothing like a papered passport, located in the interior of a plane, presumably in the confines of another bag or on the person of a hijacker, moving forward in velocity and exploding upon impact with no remains left behind.

<p><strong>THE AIRPORTS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>19 alleged terrorists (to be referred just as terrorists from now on) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.
Of those 3, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">one of the recordings</a> (which will be named Dulles from now on) that was only <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5485376/ns/us_news-security/t/sept-panelcriticizes-dullessecurity-screeners/">released in 2004</a> poses a serious problem:</p>

<p>At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (including the Pentagons&#39;) only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the Dulles was recording at +12FPS(if I am not mistaken) and has no timestamp.</p>

<p>The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">Dulles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNVWpjOjLe0">Portland, Maine</a>) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.
The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">constant tracking via CCTV</a> of the navy yard shooting using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.
Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE HIJACKS</strong></p>

<p>Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;amp;amp;t=46">-7500-</a> is the code for <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=57d_1392620694">hijacking</a> and it takes 3s to input and send.
Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.
The alleged Flight11&#39;s FDR shows that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;amp;amp;t=251">the airplane was too high</a> to have struck the lamp posts.
Todd Beamer, one of Flight93&#39;s passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/5Vx2cxf.jpg">at 9:43 AM</a>) when in fact this event had already happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">~20 minutes earlier.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE CRASHES</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE PENTAGON</strong></p>

<p>Only 2 cameras recorded an object crashing into the Pentagon, one recorded only a flash.
The 2 cameras that recorded the object show a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EvtM7nN.jpg">white smoke</a> coming from the object that the Flight77 could not have produced:</p>

<p>Engine damage from lamp-posts impact: Not possible, airplane engine smoke produces a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE">thin and dark smoke</a></p>

<p>Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn&#39;t catch fire when the airplane exploded, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dJkv2XB.jpg">the lawn has no jetfuel burn marks.</a></p>

<p>Contrails: Not possible seen that the humidity levels were not enough, corroborated by the lack of those on both airplanes that crashed into the twin towers</p>

<p>Condensation: Not possible, same reason as contrails</p>

<p>Rocket/missile-like smoke: Strongly resembles the smoke produced by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WXrH3vv.jpg">missiles/rockets</a> and <strong>might</strong> explain why Pentagon personnel stated that they noticed the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Even+before+stepping+outside+I+could+smell+the+cordite">smell of cordite</a></p>

<p>These 2 cameras have all frames perfectly synchronized -including the moment of the high speed explosion- except the one where the object enters the frame. According to the cameras, the airplane existed in 2 different places in the same moment of time.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE PENNSYLVANIA</strong></p>

<p>Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CvyJNQw.png">engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site.</a> This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason.</p>

<p>The engine that was buried under the ground was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4IcZzuY.jpg">compressed along it&#39;s length under ~3 and half feet of dirt.</a> This engine had a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r0dxyQB.jpg">clam shell</a> of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.</p>

<p>There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmTLqpx.gif">flying on the opposite direction</a> and not the one officially told. This also fits <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF5vSXo.png">Val MacClatchey&#39;s testimony of the plane path.</a></p>

<p>Val MacClatchey&#39;s famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P0bEagi.jpg">consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.</a> When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">another witness.</a></p>

<p>In contrast with Flight 93, here is an airplane crash of a Boeing 737-200 of 17,November 2013 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUV3xRIraU">nose dived</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan_Airlines_Flight_363#Crash">70º</a> and still had plenty of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509388/Video-shows-Boeing-737-plane-crash-Russia-killing-50-people.html">easily identifiable airplane parts</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/">both engines were found in the same location.</a></p>

<p>Here you can see more airplane crashes comparisons with Flight 93 and see how unique Flight 93 was. <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html">http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html</a></p>

<p><strong>THE CALLS</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s.</a></p>

<p><strong>Todd Beamer:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flight 93 hijack occurred at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></p></li>
<li><p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></p></li>
<li><p>Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></p></li>
<li><p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">3925 seconds.</a> It last 45 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p></li>
<li><p>Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">&quot;We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.&quot;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jeremy Glick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Call starts at 9:37</p></li>
<li><p>Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</p></li>
<li><p>Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above,</a> seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official government conspiracy theory in regards 9/11 and subsequent reports, are scientifically impossible, completely ridiculous, based purely on fantasy and pseudoscience.</p>

<p>I implore all American patriots to go read and research this stuff, even at the most basic level, then make your own conclusions, away from any MSM propaganda.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building (without the use of explosives) </p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>What and why are they hiding this? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Pentagon attack does appear of some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">Red herring</a> but there is not a single bit of evidence that a 757 airliner crashed at the Pentagon (the alleged photos of tiny scraps of the plane on the lawn are easily disproved by basic physics), in fact, all available evidence suggests the exact opposite.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/killtown/images/flight77/generator/tgfshr.jpg">Before roof collapsed</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.osha.gov/as/opa/911/images/pentagon.jpg">After roof collapsed</a></p>

<p>Make up your own mind here, but ponder</p>

<ul>
<li>Where have the wings, literally, disappeared to?</li>
<li>Where are the two 4 ton engine impacts?</li>
<li>Why is there no physical evidence for a airliner crash at this site?</li>
<li>Why is the alleged pilot of this plane, not on the flight manifest and how did he avoid all CCTV at the airport, along with all the passengers?</li>
<li>Why does the alleged Flight11&#39;s flight data recorder show that the airplane was too high to have even struck the lamp posts?</li>
<li> Why did they tamper with the only video they ever released, which does not show an aircraft, only a small explosion and why did the FBI confiscate all CCTV in the area, in a coordinated, almost pre-emptive swoop</li>
<li>Why does the NTSB not plan to issue a report or open a public docket? The NTSB has issued a report for all planes that crash in the U.S, not for 9/11, Why?</li>
<li>The physically impossible Barbara Olson phone calls</li>
</ul>

<p>How would it even be possible that the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation”s capital?</p>

<p>and the above is just scratching the surface, the official account is truly bizarre, the probability that it can be true, really is zero.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All evidence suggests that flight 93, which crashed over at Shanksville, broke up before impact, there were <a href="http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h79/willuk7/flight93crash.gif">debris fields</a> miles and miles apart to support this conclusion, Donald Rumsfeld even said the plane was shot down</p>

<p>But still, we are led to believe that the ground literally consumed the plane! That’s right, the government claims (without a shred of proof or any evidence at all offered to the world) that the plane ended up completely underground. Remember though, they found the drivers license of one of the alleged hijackers, a bit burnt and found ABOVE ground, i am not making this up, this is the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people bought the 9/11 story hook, line and sinker. That event triggered off so many things in one mind its really hard for most to grasp the entire monumental lies behind it. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>It got more people to signup to fight these manufactured wars. </p></li>
<li><p>It setup an endless budget for these manufactured wars. </p></li>
<li><p>The US is now in the process of militarizing the local police forces and justifying just about any type if killing based on &quot;national security&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>We are moments away from getting &quot;anal probed&quot; at the airports because of the CIA Underwear bomber asset</p></li>
<li><p>Relentless bombardment by the MSN about all the threats from the other side of the world</p></li>
<li><p>Local &quot;false flag&quot; events that attempt to take away more peoples rights and freedoms</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So many holes in the official government story are being brought to light everyday. We have to realize that there are people behind the curtain planning and executing these massive mind altering events. The amount of money these wars are draining / wasting from the system is just another form of control. </p>

<p>Guess once you start the lie, you have to continue it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Free fall speed is a fact that proves that Building 7 was not a natural collapse.  Free fall means ALL resistance was removed from ALL structural support columns at the exact same time.  This does not happen in a collapse caused by fires on a few floors on one side if the building.  It is impossible for a steel framed skyscraper.  This is not an opinion.  It is a fact whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Of course NIST has a THEORY about how Building 7 collapsed but they refuse to release the model so that it can be peer reviewed because &quot;security&quot;.  Really, they refuse to release it because it is impossible and if they did release it we would see that it is bullshit immediately.</p>
