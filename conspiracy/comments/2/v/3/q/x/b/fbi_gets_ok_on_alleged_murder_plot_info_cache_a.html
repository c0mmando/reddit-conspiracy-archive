<blockquote>
<p>The FBI was right to withhold records about an alleged murder plot targeting the leaders of Occupy Houston, to protect its informants, a federal judge ruled.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Ryan Noah Shapiro is a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research includes &quot;the policing of dissent...especially in the name of national security&quot; and &quot;examining FBI and other intelligence agency efforts to preserve domestic surveillance capabilities while simultaneously subverting the Freedom of Information Act,&quot; according to his MIT profile.</p>

<p>Shapiro sent the FBI three Freedom of Information Act requests in early 2013, asking for records about &quot;a potential plan to gather intelligence against the leaders of [Occupy Wall Street-related protests in Houston] and obtain photographs, then formulate a plan to kill the leadership [of the protests] via suppressed sniper rifles.&quot;</p>

<p>Shapiro told Courthouse News he learned of the alleged plot from FBI documents obtained by investigative reporter Jason Leopold.</p>

<p>The Houston group is an offshoot of a movement that started in New York City in 2011 and focused on the widening income gap between America&#39;s richest people and everyone else.</p>

<p>Shapiro said he wanted the records for his doctorate work and he intended to release urgent info about Occupy Houston to the public.</p>

<p>The FBI had refused to give Shapiro any documents until he filed an April 2013 federal complaint in Washington, D.C., after which the agency gave him 17 pages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/2014/03/17/66220.htm">U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer found last year</a> that the FBI had properly withheld some records, but took issue with its use of Exemption 7 under the FOIA, which protects from disclosure &quot;records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>Collyer dismissed the lawsuit this week after reviewing the documents in her chambers.</p>

<p>Shapiro challenged the FBI&#39;s withholding of the names of its murder plot sources, claiming there is no privacy expectation for people who could be called to testify as trial witnesses.</p>

<p>But Collyer found Monday that the FBI correctly invoked FOIA exemption 7(c), which shields law enforcement records from disclosure if they could constitute an invasion of personal privacy.</p>

<p>The judge also agreed with the FBI that exemption 7(d) applied to the case. It allows records to be withheld if they &quot;could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source.&quot;</p>

<p>Citing a declaration from FBI agent David Hardy that said the confidential sources are &quot;individuals who are members of organized violent groups,&quot; Collyer said the likelihood of retaliation justified keeping the sources&#39; identities under wraps.</p>

<p>Shapiro vowed to keep fighting for the records. &quot;I&#39;m of course disappointed in, and disagree with, the judge&#39;s ruling. I&#39;m now conferring with my attorney to determine next steps,&quot; Shapiro said in an email.</p>

<p>He said he is concerned that the FBI collected dossiers on Occupy protestors while publicly denying it. &quot;The FBI even flatly asserted in a separate FOIA lawsuit of mine that, &#39;(T)he FBI determined that it had never opened an investigation on the Occupy movement,&#39;&quot; Shapiro wrote.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet, in the course of my FOIA lawsuit against the FBI for records about the sniper plot against Occupy Houston, the FBI contradicted its own position.&quot;</p>

<p>Shapiro said that with recently released FBI documents about Occupy Chicago, &quot;We are coming ever closer to finally forcing the FBI to concede it actually possesses a large volume of documents about this FBI-coordinated nationwide investigation of political protesters as supposed terroristic threats to national security.&quot;</p>

I don&#39;t know if Cody went FED informant, but he never came to town and we aren&#39;t friends anymore.
