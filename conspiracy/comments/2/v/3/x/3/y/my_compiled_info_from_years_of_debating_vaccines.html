<p>But I am against trusting the sudo-government pharmaceutical corporations. <a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PharmaVenn.001.jpg">http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PharmaVenn.001.jpg</a></p>

<p>There is a long history of vaccine contamination. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40#Polio_vaccine_contamination">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40#Polio_vaccine_contamination</a> When they knowingly have a HIV contaminated product they just sell it in foreign countries.

<p>The CDC hid connections between MMR and increased autism risk. <a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/</a></p>

<p>stuff snuck in</p>

<p>Everyone knows they put mercury into vaccine when obviously it wasn&#39;t necessary.
But what about the use of vaccines as a eugenics program?</p>

<p>FLUARIX (influenza virus vaccine) does not contain thimerosal. Each 0.5-mL dose also contains octoxynol-10 ( TRITON® X-100 ) ≤ 0.085 mg, α-tocopheryl hydrogen succinate ≤ 0.1 mg, and polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80 ) ≤ 0.415 mg.&quot;</p>

<p>1977 study in the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, triton X-100 was listed in a table of &quot; most potent spermicides &quot; that would produce 100% stripping of human sperm and the dosages needed for such an effect.</p>

<p>polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80 ) is a known sterility causing agent in rats . It caused changes to the vagina and womb, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles and this impaired the rats&#39; ability to reproduce. And is often used in foods as an emulsifier.</p>

<p>Ingrediants list in section 11 descriptions. <a href="http://www.gsksource.com/gskprm/en/US/adirect/gskprm?cmd=ProductDetailPage&amp;product_id=1244169218783&amp;featureKey=600572">http://www.gsksource.com/gskprm/en/US/adirect/gskprm?cmd=ProductDetailPage&amp;product_id=1244169218783&amp;featureKey=600572</a></p>

<p>You provided examples and links and studies, which is great.  I didn&#39;t.  I simply mentioned that not <em>all</em> vaccines should be blindly relied upon...and WHAM!!  Downvote tsunami happened.</p>

<p>I linked your OP there as well, just so people could see that there <em>are</em> studies supporting what I mentioned.</p>

<p>Just...<em>way</em> too many blind sheeple.  People get offended by that word, but what&#39;s worse is that so many actually fit the description of it accurately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will win over no one who has an emotional commitment to seeing their point of view as the right one <em>only</em> and under any circumstances.  No amount of &quot;intellect&quot; will help some types.  Seriously.</p>

<p>And if by &quot;us&quot; you&#39;re referring to &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, then I am not one of &quot;us&quot;.  I do not now nor have I ever identified myself with the word &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; in the least.</p>

<p>If by &quot;us&quot; you mean &quot;critical thinkers&quot;, then I guess I <em>do</em> associate myself with that.  However, there are, again, some people that are so <em>obviously</em> placating and condescending in their responses that it is more than obvious they already have their mind made up with regard to a certain issue, and statements like &quot;Show us the <em>proof</em>, man!&quot; will 9 out of 10 times reject pretty much any amount of evidence you show them.  I&#39;ve seen and experienced the very thing FAR too many times to not be very familiar with it already.  Heck, in this very thread there are already some posts that are finding a way to reject even the mountain of evidence that OP presents.  WTF</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I simply don&#39;t waste my time too much with these types.</p>

<p>There are some people that are so intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically immature and underdeveloped that you CAN&#39;T win them over with your &quot;intellect&quot;.</p>

<p>In the end, I&#39;m not here to make you or me or anyone look good <em>or</em> bad.  I&#39;m here to try to learn and research.  If I come to certain conclusions and some want to poo poo or naysay the information, then sometimes telling someone who&#39;s not interested in investigating all areas of a dynamic to fuck off <em>is</em> a good response.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_experimentation_in_Africa">And of course the number of human medical experimentation (including vaccines) conducted in less fortunate regions (mainly Africa)</a> , which is much more of an ethical problem.</p>

<p>says who, the people who wiki&#39;d &#39;mercury&#39; and saw it was toxic? </p>

<p>1977 study in the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, triton X-100 was listed in a table of &quot; most potent spermicides &quot; that would produce 100% stripping of human sperm and the dosages needed for such an effect.</p>

<p>how much is required for this to occur? size is relative you know... </p>

<p>polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80 ) is a known sterility causing agent in rats . It caused changes to the vagina and womb, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles and this impaired the rats&#39; ability to reproduce. And is often used in foods as an emulsifier.</p>

<p>Bleach can probably do the same, yet I can still drink it (8 drops per gallon. dilution, yo)</p>

<p>dat spelling. you can&#39;t even blame that on a typo. I&#39;m supposed to believe vaccines are dangerous from the guy who can&#39;t spell &#39;ingredients&#39;? </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for open-mindedness, but this proves nothing. I&#39;m a science guy, if you&#39;re going to tell me vaccines are bad you should prove it with science. </p>

<p>Posts like this scream &quot;I barely passed grade 11, the government is lying to us!&quot;. I like some reasonably sound evidence with my main dish of conspiracy.</p>
