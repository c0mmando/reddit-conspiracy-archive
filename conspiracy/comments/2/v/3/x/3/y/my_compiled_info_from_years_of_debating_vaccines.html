       Everyone knows they put mercury into vaccine when obviously it wasn't necessary.
But what about the use of vaccines as a eugenics program?
      </p>
      <p>
       FLUARIX (influenza virus vaccine) does not contain thimerosal. Each 0.5-mL dose also contains octoxynol-10 ( TRITON® X-100 ) ≤ 0.085 mg, α-tocopheryl hydrogen succinate ≤ 0.1 mg, and polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80 ) ≤ 0.415 mg."
      </p>
      <p>
       1977 study in the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, triton X-100 was listed in a table of " most potent spermicides " that would produce 100% stripping of human sperm and the dosages needed for such an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80 ) is a known sterility causing agent in rats . It caused changes to the vagina and womb, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles and this impaired the rats' ability to reproduce. And is often used in foods as an emulsifier.

       What's horribly sad about the world we live in is that the same type of sentiment that you expressed here in this subreddit, if expressed in almost any other subreddit in this website, will be absolutely

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You provided examples and links and studies, which is great.  I didn't.  I simply mentioned that not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       vaccines should be blindly relied upon...and WHAM!!  Downvote tsunami happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I linked your OP there as well, just so people could see that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       studies supporting what I mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just...
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too many blind sheeple.  People get offended by that word, but what's worse is that so many actually fit the description of it accurately.

       <em>
        somewhat

       .  It's quick, short, unqualified, ambiguous, and seems like it can possibly be taken in a couple of different, more insensitive ways...but -1000?  Yeah, the hive mind really went after it on that one if it got downvoted

       You will win over no one who has an emotional commitment to seeing their point of view as the right one
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       and under any circumstances.  No amount of "intellect" will help some types.  Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if by "us" you're referring to "conspiracy theorists", then I am not one of "us".  I do not now nor have I ever identified myself with the word "conspiracy theorist" in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       If by "us" you mean "critical thinkers", then I guess I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       associate myself with that.  However, there are, again, some people that are so
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       placating and condescending in their responses that it is more than obvious they already have their mind made up with regard to a certain issue, and statements like "Show us the
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       , man!" will 9 out of 10 times reject pretty much any amount of evidence you show them.  I've seen and experienced the very thing FAR too many times to not be very familiar with it already.  Heck, in this very thread there are already some posts that are finding a way to reject even the mountain of evidence that OP presents.  WTF
      </p>
      <p>
       It is for this reason that I simply don't waste my time too much with these types.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some people that are so intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically immature and underdeveloped that you CAN'T win them over with your "intellect".
