       No. None.  Remember the US wasn't after him for 9/11 but for a car bombing in the 1990's.  He was not under scrutiny for 9/11 because there was never any proof at the non MSM level that he had anything to do with that.

       The only proof presented to the public in an alleged Bil Laden confession video obtaind in Afganistan.  The video has a Bin Laden with not much but definately different facial structures and features, enough to question it anyway.  Other than that I have never seen any evidence,  and the person was correct about the FBI site not having him as a suspect.  But then again, a few of the suspected hijackers have turned up alive.  With the same name, common in muslim countries, and the same face, unique to the individual.  So there is that too.  There were also reports out there that Bush jr received loans from the Bin Laden family.  google it.

       Yeah there is tons of evidence that he did it according to the government just ask them. Just like with Iraq and the W.M.D
       <code>
        s that were there. And like the first gulf war was because Iraq invaded Kuwait it was not because we were side drilling into Iraq
       </code>
       s oil no. Or the gulf of Tonkin, JFK, Sandy Hook. Just stating a track record and there is more but with that as a track record what would they say if it was you or me doing that the only thing you hear is the slam of the door to your jail cell.

       Ironically, OBL also claims to have had nothing to do with it (in another video).  So if you believe one, why not the other ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, it's pretty obviously the Trade Towers were controlled demolitions.  So unless Osama paid Larry Silverstein to plant the bombs in his own buildings...  OBL had very little if anything to do with it.

       I acknowledge that Bin Laden initially denied having any involvement in the attacks. But I think a video released in 2004 he admits to it, and again in 2006 where there is footage of him with two of the alleged hijackers. Again, I can't confirm the validity of those videos but his change of appearance isn't enough for me to say that it wasn't Bin Laden (as I believe that is why a lot of people believe those videos to be fake).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I suspect that Bin Laden's involvement was purely financial anyway. I think the current leader of Al Queda was the mastermind, Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not obvious to me that it was a controlled demolition. I don't subscribe to that theory. I can however entertain the LIHOP idea though. But that's for another conversation.

       What did Al Qaeda gain from the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it didn't hurt America. In fact it was extremely beneficial to Americas wealthy, who are at the end of the day, Al Qaeda's enemy. Americas poor, the ones killed in the attack, have nothing to do with US forign policy in Afganistan.

       Hijackers (who were linked to Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda) made little effort to conceal their names on flight, credit card, and other records.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day of the attack both American and German intelligence networks intercepted communications that pointed to Bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       In October 2001 the Al-Qaeda spokesman sent a video to Al-Jazeera saying: "The Americans should know that the storm of plane attacks will not abate, with God's permission. There are thousands of the Islamic nations' youths who are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live"
      </p>
      <p>
       a videotape from a bombed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan which showed a man purported to be Osama bin Laden talking to Khaled al-Harbi. In the tape, bin Laden talks of planning the attacks. Translations from the tape include the following lines:
      </p>
      <p>
       ...we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all...We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day. We had finished our work that day and had the radio on...Muhammad [Atta] from the Egyptian family [meaning the al-Qaeda Egyptian group], was in charge of the group...The brothers, who conducted the operation, all they knew was that they have a martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to America but they didn't know anything about the operation, not even one letter. But they were trained and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin Laden also claimed responsibility for the attacks multiple times

       Yeah good thing that their passports were found intact at ground zero after the planes exploded into the buildings.  That was just a bit convenient so that we could ID them wouldn't you say?  Very believable.  The plane crashes could destroy the towers, just not those passports.

         "Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally "the database", was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden's organisation would turn its attention to the west." -

         "The Sudanese security services, he said, would happily keep close watch on bin Laden for the United States. But if that would not suffice, the government was prepared to place him in custody and hand him over, though to whom was ambiguous. In one formulation, Erwa said Sudan would consider any legitimate proffer of criminal charges against the accused terrorist." Their negotiations concluded as such: ""We said he will go to Afghanistan, and they [US officials!] said, 'Let him.'"-

         According to the official story, bin Laden turned against the US after they occupied military bases in Saudi Arabia. This doesnt make sense, because: Scott Armstrong, at the time the top investigative reporter for the Washington Post,
         <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/news/arming-i.htm">
          stated that the United States and Saudi Arabia had jointly conspired to covertly build $200 billion worth of military installations between the years 1979 and 1992
         </a>
         . Steve Coll, eminent Bin Laden biographer, states that the Binladen group received a multitude of these contracts, with the knowing intent to support to house US military personal during wars that may threaten Saudi territory. This was occuring at the same time that Osama was tight with his family and using Binladen group assets to build bases in Afghanistan. Of course he was aware of the business dealings between the company.

         And then there is the fascinating story of Egyptian Ali Muhammed, only tangentially related but thoroughly interesting nonetheless.
He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">
          In 1984, he was hired by the CIA
         </a>
         , though they claim that their relationship was short-lived. He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima">
          providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima

         , convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">
          He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen

         In the early 1990's he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. According to former FBI special agent
         <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html">
          Jack Cloonan, in an interview with PBS

          Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged

       What did Al Qaeda gain from the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it didn't hurt America. In fact it was extremely beneficial to Americas wealthy, who are at the end of the day, Al Qaeda's enemy. Americas poor, the ones killed in the attack, have nothing to do with US forign policy in Afganistan.
