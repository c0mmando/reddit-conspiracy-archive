<p>Brief bio:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Ole Dammegård, I&#39;m a prize winning author, investigator and former journalist. For more than 30 years I have worked very hard on solving the mystery behind the assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, something that has turned out to be a very dangerous task and has cost the lives of some dear friends.</p>

<p>Not only do I humbly believe that I&#39;ve now managed to solve one of the centuries&#39; biggest murder mysteries, my extensive research has also revealed incredible links to other big political &#39;events&#39; like the killing of JFK, John Lennon, Robert Kennedy, Che Guevara, Salvador Allende, Pablo Neruda and many others as well as the cold-blooded sinking of m/s Estonia, taking almost 1000 innocent lives.</p>

<p>I have made hundreds of international radio interviews on stations like Red Ice Creations, The People&#39;s Voice, Project Camelot, No Lies Radio, and The Real Deal, etc, which has caused a tidal wave of international interest.</p>

<p>I am totally dedicated to revealing the New World Order&#39;s agenda including False Flag-operations all over the world. It is important for me to point out that I am not here to spread fear by exposing the truth in whatever form it takes. My goal is to prevent the so called Global Elite from turning this beautiful world into a scary, controlled and fearful place. We all deserve so much better - it&#39;s time to stop the madness.</p>

<p>In Peace and Joy, Love and Light - Ole     </p>
</blockquote>

I grew up in &quot;folkhemmet&quot; which was the start to a completely brainwashed nation and still is today. It was because of Olof Palme we got the Swedish Public Service TV which was and still is the PC spewing leftist propaganda machine. It&#39;s well know that Palme knew the power of TV as a tool to change the public opinion and he wasn&#39;t afraid to use it as such.</p>

<p>The majority don&#39;t disagree, that&#39;s what you people never get. People just don&#39;t bother saying what they think openly because of people like you.

<p>The majority do disagree. Some might want to limit immigration to a certain degree but don&#39;t necessarily share nationalist values, especially since immigration/asylum has spiked in the last 2 years because of Syria.</p>

<p>Your definition of far-right is also very flawed. You clearly don&#39;t even know what far-right is. You just label people according to what someone has told you is far-right. Would you say that the conservatives in say... the UK are far right?</p>

<p>Do so if it makes you happy. A good starting point in your quest for clarity beyond the leftist mumbo jumbo of glorifying him is that he was very supportive of many dictators in the world. He fucked over the Swedish pension system with (AP fonderna) and the list goes on.</p>

<p>You can hardly lay the blame with one short-lived politician. Cultural Marxism has been forced onto the EU via the back-door. There has been no discussion, no debate, no choice, no vote; and to oppose it is to be labelled a bigot and a racist.</p>

<p>It can only be the work if the secret-societies, the think-tanks and other organisations that corrupt the very notion of a true democracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL looking at the downvotes I&#39;m getting I don&#39;t think people will like it. But Olof Palme was the first major politician to sway the country towards cultural marxism.

<p>Somehow people in Sweden but especially outside of Sweden have concocted this idea that Palme was some sort of hero. He really wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. People here get wrapped up in the false dichotomy that is the left-right paradigm. Many think the far right is so insane that they have to balance it out with being as far left as they can. End up turning into a bunch of SJWs without even knowing it. Ultra-Liberalism. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Nobody here seems to wonder why they have all the most famous celebrities telling you every day that every mother/wife should have a black/brown baby.  Want to be like the rich and famous? Wear stupid looking sunglasses and find yourself a black baby, by any means necessary. If you don&#39;t you&#39;re a nazi. Good goy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still haven&#39;t said anything.  Be more specific as to why people would have wanted him gone (aside from the powerful people he was clearly pissing off with some of the views I noted above).  You said he was a &quot;twat&quot; and that you basically understood where his assassin was coming from so I assumed you actually had a reason to hold those opinions but you haven&#39;t given any indication that you do yet.</p>
