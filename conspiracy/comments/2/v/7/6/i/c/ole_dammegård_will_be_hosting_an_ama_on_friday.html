       Brief bio:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My name is Ole Dammegård, I'm a prize winning author, investigator and former journalist. For more than 30 years I have worked very hard on solving the mystery behind the assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, something that has turned out to be a very dangerous task and has cost the lives of some dear friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only do I humbly believe that I've now managed to solve one of the centuries' biggest murder mysteries, my extensive research has also revealed incredible links to other big political 'events' like the killing of JFK, John Lennon, Robert Kennedy, Che Guevara, Salvador Allende, Pablo Neruda and many others as well as the cold-blooded sinking of m/s Estonia, taking almost 1000 innocent lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have made hundreds of international radio interviews on stations like Red Ice Creations, The People's Voice, Project Camelot, No Lies Radio, and The Real Deal, etc, which has caused a tidal wave of international interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am totally dedicated to revealing the New World Order's agenda including False Flag-operations all over the world. It is important for me to point out that I am not here to spread fear by exposing the truth in whatever form it takes. My goal is to prevent the so called Global Elite from turning this beautiful world into a scary, controlled and fearful place. We all deserve so much better - it's time to stop the madness.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Peace and Joy, Love and Light - Ole

       Olof Palme was such a twat that I'm not surprised someone decided to get rid off him. I grew up in "folkhemmet" which was the start to a completely brainwashed nation and still is today. It was because of Olof Palme we got the Swedish Public Service TV which was and still is the PC spewing leftist propaganda machine. It's well know that Palme knew the power of TV as a tool to change the public opinion and he wasn't afraid to use it as such.

       The majority don't disagree, that's what you people never get. People just don't bother saying what they think openly because of people like you. And I don't have any issues nor do I feel discomfort in people disagreeing with me, while you do seem to have issues having to resort to calling me a "far-right racist shithead" just because I don't share your world view.

       The majority do disagree. Some might want to limit immigration to a certain degree but don't necessarily share nationalist values, especially since immigration/asylum has spiked in the last 2 years because of Syria.

       If the vast majority agree with the far-right then it would be people who aren't far-right who would not speak openly. I'm sorry but people like you are in the minority.

       Your definition of far-right is also very flawed. You clearly don't even know what far-right is. You just label people according to what someone has told you is far-right. Would you say that the conservatives in say... the UK are far right?

       He opposed the involvement in Vietnam, opposed nuclear weapons, opposed Pinochet, opposed western involvement in the Middle East, and he was assassinated under mysterious circumstances.  I won't claim to know an incredible amount about the guy, and I don't live in Sweden, but from what I do know he was anything but a "twat", he seems like a far better man than most others who are in positions like his around the world.  So what are you basing all of that on?

       He was nothing more than an overrated socialist. I'm not saying he didn't have anything good to say. But there are many reasons people even within Sweden would have wanted him gone. Even average Joes.

       You still haven't said anything.  Be more specific as to why people would have wanted him gone (aside from the powerful people he was clearly pissing off with some of the views I noted above).  You said he was a "twat" and that you basically understood where his assassin was coming from so I assumed you actually had a reason to hold those opinions but you haven't given any indication that you do yet.

       Do so if it makes you happy. A good starting point in your quest for clarity beyond the leftist mumbo jumbo of glorifying him is that he was very supportive of many dictators in the world. He fucked over the Swedish pension system with (AP fonderna) and the list goes on.

       You can hardly lay the blame with one short-lived politician. Cultural Marxism has been forced onto the EU via the back-door. There has been no discussion, no debate, no choice, no vote; and to oppose it is to be labelled a bigot and a racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can only be the work if the secret-societies, the think-tanks and other organisations that corrupt the very notion of a true democracy.

       LOL looking at the downvotes I'm getting I don't think people will like it. But Olof Palme was the first major politician to sway the country towards cultural marxism. I don't know if you read Swedish, but there's a lot of hate for that guy because of exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow people in Sweden but especially outside of Sweden have concocted this idea that Palme was some sort of hero. He really wasn't.

       I honestly don't know anything about him, and next to nothing about Sweden in general. I am an ignorant American. I just happen to be aware of the problem of cultural marxism there, and never really researched how that began.

       Yep. People here get wrapped up in the false dichotomy that is the left-right paradigm. Many think the far right is so insane that they have to balance it out with being as far left as they can. End up turning into a bunch of SJWs without even knowing it. Ultra-Liberalism.

       : Nobody here seems to wonder why they have all the most famous celebrities telling you every day that every mother/wife should have a black/brown baby.  Want to be like the rich and famous? Wear stupid looking sunglasses and find yourself a black baby, by any means necessary. If you don't you're a nazi. Good goy.
