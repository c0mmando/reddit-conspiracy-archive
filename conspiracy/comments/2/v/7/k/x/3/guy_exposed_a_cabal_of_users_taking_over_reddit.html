       Text of the original AskReddit comment below:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        SRS is actually an internet cult and they meet most of the criteria needed for being a cult. The way in which they effectively serve as an internet cult is that it is possible for anyone to easily join the cult so long as they have an internet connection and a reddit account and are willing to do exactly what they are told by the SRS moderator hierarchy and the people who control and run the subreddit. The worst thing about Shitredditsays, however, isn't that they have their own shitty subreddit that makes zero sense to the outside world and to those who are sane and don't believe in the views of social justice warriors and radical feminists. The worst thing about SRS is that they and their friends from other like-minded subreddits on reddit - with the cooperation and unspoken support of a few reddit administrators - have managed to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 where a clique of users who are chummy and friendly with each other have managed to take over a very large portion of this website. The users who have turned reddit into Digg 2.0 and who threaten to ruin the site are what I and some others who understand the situation have come to know as and refer to as "metareddit cancer." I have taken it upon myself to go ahead and create the subreddit
        <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">
         /r/metaredditcancer
        </a>
        to act as a watchdog that chronicles everything that this cabal of reddit users are doing to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 and - in particular - to turn the site into a place run by social justice warrior and feminist moderators who tolerate no deviation from their beliefs in the numerous subreddits that they have come to control as moderators.
       </p>
       <p>
        My hope is that after reading this comment of mine that you will subscribe to
        <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">
         /r/metaredditcancer
        </a>
        so that you can stay well-informed about a very serious situation that has arisen - largely unknown to most users - on this website so that we can all gain a greater understanding of what a powerful cabal of agenda-driven users are doing to and have done to this site that we all love. I am a long-time user on reddit who has intimate and in-depth knowledge of this cabal and who has modded multiple subreddits both large and small, who has been intimately involved in discussion with this cabal of users regarding their control of reddit, who knows what their agenda is and what they want to do with their power and control, who has sat in their private discussions in internet chat rooms, who has seen leaks from their private subreddits, and who has absolutely had enough of what they have done to reddit and of what they will continue to do to this site unless the rest of this site is exposed to who and what they are and what their endgame is. What happened to Digg and what has happened to 4chan very recently is undeniably and positively what is happening to reddit now and what has been happening here since 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cabal of users and moderators who I refer to as "metareddit cancer" hail from the subreddits Shitredditsays, circlebroke, Braveryjerk, circlejerk, TheBluePill, SubredditDrama, SRDbroke, and Drama. This cabal of users are - for the most part - the moderators of these subreddits and these users also control many other subreddits with thousands and even hundreds of thousands of subscribers. They mod subreddits like
        <a href="/r/news">
         /r/news
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/politics">
         /r/politics
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/worldnews">

        <a href="/r/TIFU">
         /r/TIFU

        ,
        <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">
         /r/explainlikeimfive
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/changemyview">
         /r/changemyview
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="/r/LGBT">
         /r/LGBT
        </a>
        , and numerous other subreddits where they have managed to worm their way into moderator positions over the years and then go on to have total control over the type of discussion that goes on in their subreddits. They make sure that any discussion that goes against their social justice and feminist beliefs is censored and controlled and/or they mod their subreddits like ban-happy dictators who get rid of anyone who breaks the circlejerk that goes on in their subreddits every week. This is absolutely the case with offmychest, creepyPMs, and Subredditdrama. Maybe the worst example of their way of worming into moderator positions and destroying subreddits is that of
        <a href="/r/LGBT">
         /r/LGBT
        </a>
        and how 2 transsexual radfem SRS trolls - one of which has become infamous on reddit and other chan websites - managed to take control of the subreddit in 2012 and then acted like dictators and abused their power so badly that reddit's administrators had to be called into the drama. The admins refused to remove the two SRS moderators, the LGBT subreddit went into meltdown because of them, and this led to the subreddit being ruined and people having to flock to the newly created
        <a href="/r/ainbow">
         /r/ainbow
        </a>
        subreddit because one of the biggest forums for discussing LGBT issues on the internet was taken over by members of Shitredditsays. This is the first notable time that SRS and other metareddit cancer have taken control of subreddits and they've gone on to manipulate reddit's subreddit request system to bring even more subreddits under their control. They organize subreddit request attempts in private subreddits where they plan out their agenda and they do the same in their internet relay chat rooms as well. I can say with total confidence that there is
        <em>
         no other reddit clique and group operating on this website that looks to take over and control as many subreddits as they can in a clear and indisputable attempt to control the flow of conversation so that conversations in any given subreddit always lean and kowtow to radical feminism and a perverted form of social justice.
        </em>
        NO OTHER GROUP EXISTS that is looking to take over as much of this site as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the more troubling things that I have come to understand having been an intimately involved user of reddit for years, is that some of reddit's current and past administrators support and belong to this cabal of metareddit cancer. An administrator who was fired from reddit two years ago immediately was added as a mod of Shitredditsays as soon as he left his admin role and made clear what some users had already known: he was literally a member of Shitredditsays and as an admin he used his power to carry out SRS's agenda. He routinely ostracized and terminated the accounts of (shadowbanned) people who posted in subreddits that SRS want destroyed and now he sits as a moderator of SRS. This is one of the biggest yet unknown bits of corruption in reddit's history yet you wouldn't know it because the subreddit created as a watchdog for this sort of thing -
        <a href="/r/Subredditdrama">
         /r/Subredditdrama
        </a>
        - was taken over by SRS and reddit metacancer in 2013 and they censor discussion about themselves so that people aren't aware of what is going on. The takeover of SubredditDrama is one of the worst things that has ever happened on this website because of its 150K subscriber size and because the very people who are the problem that I am discussing happen to be in control of SubredditDrama. This is clearly a monumental conflict of interest given that anything nefarious that this group of users do cannot be openly discussed in SubredditDrama without their consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        What caused this  cabal to come to be and what is it that unites them in their desire to control the site through moderator power and through cliques?
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          A need for friendship that's lacking in real life. A # of users involved in this cabal are depressed, aren't "cool", are LGBT (more difficult to be included socially if you are a member of this group in real life), are social outcasts, or just want to have some internet friends because they spend a lot of time on this site. This last reason differs a bit from the other reasons and is different in that some users - a smaller number - belonging to this cabal get drawn into it without knowing what the agenda is and they simply just want some internet friends. However, they
          <em>
           always
          </em>
          cave to the agenda when it is brought up (perverted feminism and social justice and tightly-controlled, censorship-happy moderation in the cabal's subreddits) and so it doesn't matter that their intentions for joining the cabal were innocent. In the end, they always come around and you can already see how this is cult-like behavior. Anyone who doesn't toe-the-line and go along with the agenda is shunned or cast out. I've spent time talking to one of them who was cast out of one of the cabal's private subreddits after realizing that the nature of the cabal and "group of friends" wasn't innocent and that everything revolved around feminism, social justice, and the ego-driven desire to control as many subs as possible. The scary thing about my interaction with this cast-out former member is that the cabal looks to get your name and personal information. They do this through their everyday IRC chats and in Facebook groups where some choose to take friend requests with their real names. Others use new Facebook profiles with their reddit names. This cast-out user used his real account and he knows now that a reason why they send friend invites is so that you think twice about going against them because then they have your personal info and can come after you with threats at home, work, and anywhere else.

          <strong>
           What the users in the cabal do to gain entrance is act smug and superior (social justice, feminism, morality policing) to redditors. The cabal acts as their cool kids club that they weren't good enough for in real life.
          </strong>
          THAT IS HOW AND WHY THEY ARE FRIENDS AND WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE ANYONE CAN ACT THIS WAY.

       </ul>
       <p>
        A cabal on Digg is what led to the deterioration of the site and is what led to the migration that saw users flood to reddit. I'll be damned if I watch the same type of behavior from a group of a few dozen users continue to move reddit towards becoming Digg 2.0. 4chan has been thrown into a serious mess like this after Moot gave mod positions to authoritarian mods in the last year who now control the site given his recent abdication as site admin. Let's not let this develop further on reddit because there's a point of no return.

       <p>
        TL;DR: The SRS cabal controls too much of and is ruining reddit

       I only saw the last dying embers of whatever that whole situation was, and then mods started deleting everything about it. What the fuck actually happened with this? There was something about a daycare but thats all I know.

       Bunch of redditors thought some shitty daycare was a CIA blacksite and it lead to harassment of the business in question. If it is a blacksite then its pretty stupid to harass them. If its not a black site then its pretty stupid to harass them. Like a Sandy Hook Truther calling the parents of victims "actors" to their faces. That kind of psychotic dissonance from reality is terrible. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks like that.

       How do you know it was only a few? How do you know what they were saying when they called?

       The shutdown of the whole topic likely was because 4chan had people showing up and claiming they had brought guns and such just in case it was something scary.

       Mmmmmm....no. No, that's not what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could prove that to you, except the reddit admins deleted everything...so there's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was participating in the SLC daycare shutdown well before the admins deleted everything, and I can say, based on that, that the gist of the conversation had nothing to do with harassing that building (you can hardly call it a daycare), but had more to do with analyzing publicly available information and documents.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If that even happened, it was such a small part of the conversation that day that I don't even remember it. That said, why would the reddit admins delete something because of what  some 4chan users did?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep trying...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: You're obviously trying to make the conversation about harassment, something that never happened.  Don't waste your time. I'm done even entertaining the idea of something that never happened. Nice try. Have a good day. Bye.

       You couldn't prove it to me since there is absolutely no way you could even if things weren't deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also keeping up with it throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both know people called. Neither know how many, we only know the ones that posted, which almost certainly is less than who did.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know how many times the people who got no answer called either. Could it be twice? Could it be ten times? Who knows!
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know what all of them said either. Could be just questions of how to get kids in there. Could be asking if they like fiddling kids! Also could be 'hey, just telling you Reddit thinks you are some black ops kid bang factory. Cheers!'
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also posted on Reddit and not 4chan that a couple friends had at some point broken into the building to find a room with a chair and a tv seemingly closed circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the gun stuff on 4chan, I saw it myself. It was one post. Probably bologna, maybe not considering Utah's carry laws. If I'm Reddit. It's time to shut the shit down before one single mentally ill person decides it's time to be a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if you've noticed or not but Reddit doesn't have to care what you think, or care that they may err on the side of definitive caution.

       Thats not the point. He stated a couple people just called a phone number. Thats bullshit. Tons of people called that number, this hunt spread beyond reddit. People were on site with cameras. I remember one cringy picture where a guy was right up to the window taking pictures of a lady cleaning what looks like a kitchen or something. That made me cringe. That dude should feel like a creeper now if he has moral's.

       things escalated to the point that you say (doubtful) then I would lay the blame on the HIGHLY suspicious actions of the admins. If that original thread stays of r/SLC, no one gives a damn, it never gets to r/conspiracy, and we aren't having this conversation at the top of a thread that's approaching nearly 4,000 total up votes. Oh, and more importantly, the high levels of "harassment" you claim took place, never would have.

       So the potential for something happening is reason enough to shut it down? Let's just go ahead and revoke people's right to assemble peacefully since there is a potential that any assembling of anyone could turn into a riot.

       Strange, recently painted "daycare" that people in the area never saw anyone go in or out of. When it was brought up on Reddit, people were threatened (99% most likely by trolls but given Reddit's reaction, who knows...).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people called the place and the actions of the people on the phone (when they ever got someone to pick up) was very non-business like. Lies about how to get a kid admitted to the daycare were told by the person on the other end of the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       People started looking up publicly available information on the ownership of the building, the business, and the beyond Geocities basic website. Reddit began deleting threads from everywhere they were posted. Somebody from 8Chan ordered them a pizza and this is now considered the
       <strong>
        greatest harassment in the history of the internet
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       After the discussions on Reddit, activity at the location suddenly picked up, with two (and only two) kids appearing at the "day care" to be let in (this is while the "day care" is no longer even a legally registered business)
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire topic was subsequently banned Reddit wide, with Reddit admins even going so far as to delete small private subs that were discussing the topic. I was a member of one and no one ever discussed or planned harassment nor doxxed anyone in the subreddit but it was still deleted. Not only that, discussions of the topic on other forums disappeared as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the "cool kids" (that don't like the users on the conspiracy sub) that don't know shit about the situation spread BS about us "harassing a day care" and "doxxing" when neither happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows, I might be shadowbanned for even explaining this.

       Strange, I recall at least a few posts of people claiming to be parents who had previously had their kids in that daycare and at least one post from a guy who attended it years ago when he was younger.

      <p>
       Too bad all that stuff got deleted when it turned into a community doxx. Thats why all that happened you know. Its not some conspiracy. I stand by my point. Whether or not it was a blacksite, doing all the crap people did was stupid. Even if they were involved in something nefarious or criminal, this is not how you go about things.

       Also, I remember those posts that you speak of and all of those people were there when the daycare was owned by it's previous owners, not the people that occupy the building now.

       Doxxing is the process of finding out someone on the internet's real identity, home phone number, DOB, home address, etc. Finding out who owns a public business based on publicly published filings is not doxxing.

        Note to self
       </strong>
       : screenplay idea
      </p>
      <p>
       Protagonist realizes lifelong petit bourgeois dream, secures location at a bargain, spruces it up, and proudly installs outdoor sign right before opening day. However, petit entrepreneur has some untimely and unfortunate turn of events. Dream stalls as protagonist suffers and struggles to get dream back on track. Meanwhile, unwitting (antagonist) neighbor slowly grows more suspicious of colorful building after months of no activity. Finally posts photo with paranoid caption on popular website which suddenly makes building and oblivious owner infamous. All sorts of freaks start calling, some even showing up at the door. Protagonist is approached by down-and-out journalist who takes up the story of all the psychopaths...while falling in love with protagonist. They make a fortune from book and screenplay and ride off into the sunset, leaving building to OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starring: Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waites, Harry Dean Stanton and Abby Cornish.

       It itself could be a distraction (for all I know). Sometimes you need to distract the proles with something fantastic (Grammy's, Superbowl) and then throw us a bone or two (SLC, ISIS videos to debunk, not Donetsk), and then make your move.

       Stay tuned.

       Lol this post got me shadowbanned. to the mod or mods who did that, you need to study retalation laws regarding free speech you may cost reddit more that karma points (self.conspiracy)

Guy exposed a cabal of users taking over reddit yesterday, spawned a watchdog subreddit of 2500 subscribers overnight, was then banned by reddit's admins, all the subreddit's mods then banned, admins won't say why, and now they're handing the subreddit to the corrupt cabal of users who were exposed. by redditiscorrupt0in conspiracy

       What can be done to protect the integrity of reddit then? Ban the users, and put up strick guidelines and screening measures asking why they want to join? No. Use their ip address to prohibit any one from its address in signing up? No, too many ways around that. Employ paid hunter killer redditors to figure out the new accounts they are signing up with, shutting them down in a permanent game of wack a mole?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being new to reddit, sounds like the work is cut out for the site administrators, and who ever approves mods. This has the potential imo to turn into a witch hunt, that the only thing that can stop it is a temporary freeze on new membership, to stop the bleeding, then eliminate the cancer, not just by banning the account, but by figuring out who these little reddit terrorists are and start taking them down where they are trying to harass people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this site, its going to suck if a bunch of little dick insecure bitches who have nothing better to do, shuts this site down, or causes so much drama that the site is no longer fun to use. I am all for people haveing their own view points, opinions, and a place to express them and exchange idea's with one another. I dont down vote people that I dont agree with what they are saying. I appreciate counter points on issues, and debating them. Its how we learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so quick to get butt hurt here, because they disagree with what you are saying and down vote you like the kid at the playgroud who takes his ball and leaves cause they loose.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sadly has become their main interaction with people, and is where they feel they are on equal ground or have the advantage, because truth of the matter like you said, if they acted like that in the real world, they would get their ass kicked, and probably have.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can have their opinions, beliefs, feelings, im all for it. But when they start to act like Nazi's and not able to be put in check, this site will probably end up like you are fearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things I can think that would mabye stop it is diligence from the people approving mods, banning the accounts of the "cabal".
      </p>
      <p>
       A freeze on new accounts is a terrible idea, but either not giving them "voting rights" for a certain period of time, or give them the illusions that their votes count, observing thier voting habbits with a bot that monitors them, when they are observed being reddit terriostits going into someones page and downvoting all their stuff, shut em down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a 30 day period for new accounts not being able to vote would help. If someone pisses you off, most sane people are not going to wait 30 days to down vote someone. Then set up monitors for "bulliing" votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that moderators that are shadow banning people, deleting peoples posts, or collabaroting against users, or subs should be banned from this site. The only way I think post should be removed is already in the reddit rules. Maybe even requiring a year of redditing before you can qualify as a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or find a trusted group of mods who have not partaken in the bs that was going on to be reddits own secret super mods callit the RIA, to monitor them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The administrators at reddit have some tough decisions. Left unchecked, this site will go the way of myspace. (i dont know the history of digg)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or will have to unfortunately go on a temporary witch hunt, clear the crap out, have a plan or system in place to prevent the crap from coming back in by changing policies on new accounts voting ability, heavely scrutinizing posts from the new users have approved by actual human mods during that time, to prevent obvious manipulation and sabatoging of the subs. That should stop the bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using fire to fight fire isn't alsways the best answer, but at some point they will make it come to that. Just from reading what you had to say there is no way around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do hope you get it figured out, because that is absolute bull shit to let a bunch of little punks ruin the site. As it is, they are going to at the least effect new membership policies. Good luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the exact definition of retalation, on a public forum, reddit is on us soil, and im looking into if this is in violation of first amendment rights. Or CA laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you have any information, please let me know, im diving into this now.

       I rarely ever post these days. yesterday, for simply stating my opinion. (It differs from their's ) was attacked by multiple accounts bully style. numerous insulting posts assigning heinous crimes and labeling me as an angry child abuser with abusive parents. I continued to receive angry hate 12 hours after my last post. anything in cospiracy I have posted magically gets one down vote for every up vote.  It's like someone is turning reddit into a mouth piece to shepherd public opinions. I know that if your goal was to shepherd public opinions,  having a small group with many usernames would be an effective way. people are more easily convinced of something if the majority of respondents are saying the same things.

       I had a similar thing happen to a post I made.  My post was old by Reddit standards, over 24 hours old and subsequently inactive but all of the sudden it received a surge of responses (all negative in nature) from several accounts. The responses flooded in at the same time. The only way I could see this happening was from a group of people who opposed my post working together via some channel.  I attempted to sleuth and see if I could find the channel they used without success.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always been weary about hive mind things on Reddit like for example the recent vaccination posts, they seem really out of the ordinary to me and orchestrated (another example are post regarding circumcision, they quickly get flooded with people opposing it and anything in favor, science included, gets downvoted). Reddit is a powerful tool, obviously, and I feel a lot of effort has gone into controlling/manipulating it. What I experienced seemed like a small taste of that.

       The circumcision debate gets people real emotional. I'm European, so I only ever really see these 'discussions' online, but they seem to be more knee jerk anger to me, as opposed to the more ideological/almost religious fury anti-vaxing and radical third wave feminism spawns.

       As a French man, who hasn't been circumcised and knows no one who is (because the whole thing is kinda retarded), my guess is that people in the USA have some kind of, uhh, complex where they can't accept that something wrong was done to them. So they try to justify it with every argument they find. Some of them just can't integrate that the whole thing is the result of a wide publicity campaign orchestrated by doctors who wanted a quick and easy buck.

       Just because it goes under the same name doesn't mean it's equivalent. A male equivalent of female circumcision would involve
       <em>
        removing the head of your dick

       And they lose a great part of the sensation that their foreskin used to let them feel; they can't masturbate properly without lube; their dick is constantly irritated until the glans' skin is hardened enough to be rubbing constantly on their underwear without feeling terrible... Plus,

        it has huge effects on the emotional health of people, going as far as to cause PTSD for circumcised babies; it ruins the natural lubricant in the vagina by pulling it out, and makes women who had sex with cut and uncut guys to prefer cut to uncut by a ratio of as much as 8.6 to 1;

       So salty that youre going out of your way to lie and use personal attacks. But thats what really secure people do right? But I guess the mountains of medical data are just a big conspiracy of greedy doctors. I guess the 80% of women who prefer it in studies done are just shills for greedy foreskin eating jews right? Do you realize how youre acting? Nobody is saying anything negative about you not being circumsized. People calmly point out the medical and aesthetic benefits and back them up with studies. You freak out and accuse everyone of being insecure about their mutilated dicks, and rant about how its all some conspiracy by greedy doctors. Talk about insecurity... Theres no need to get furious and start attacking people for having different preferences. When you get in a fit of rage and attack people for being different from you, it makes you look really insecure.

       It's an association of movements: one of "greedy doctors" who just wanted easy money, and one of religious integrists who wanted to crack down on boys who masturbated. Circumcision makes it harder, so, it was an easy way for them to enforce the belief that masturbation is a sin.

       Sorry bud but Im going to have to agree with the CDC. Im pretty sure they know more about this subject than you. They have a whole section on their site dedicated to the results of circumcision studies. 
Regardless of any of that, why cant you understand that different people have different lives? I chose to get circumcised. Ive exoerienced being "natural" and experienced bein cut. Being circumcised is better for me. Nothing you say can change that. I make 15k more a month because of it. The aesthetics are more desired in my country because of it. I enjoy sex more because of it. My STD risk is greatly reduced because of it. Why are you trying so desperately to convince me that none of that is true?

Furthermore, probably that most of the people at the CDC are actually circumcised, which would influence greatly their stance on the matter, as

       That, right there, confirms what I said earlier: most circumsized americans have a validation complex that makes them try to justify their genital mutilations because they can't face the truth. Health scientists aren't an exception, they're people too.

       Yes, your STD risk is reduced. But it doesn't really matter. Anyone with half a brain and an uncut dick won't get STDs because all you have to do is use a condom or choose other partners.

       Maybe, but you don't know anything about anything else than your life. And you don't know anything about other people's lives and the effect circumcision may have on them. You only think about yourself and your stupid job that requires cutting off a part of your dick. That's why you are what you are.

       You seem to be confusing infant circumcision and circumcision... When did I ever condone operating on a baby? Babies dont have sex. Babies cant consent. Why are you showing me what health organizations think about infant circumcision?
Oh there you go again with the personal attacks. I have a bachelors econ/finance and biology. I have a more useful ad lucrative degree than you. I chose to drop out of med school and do something else. I didnt want to spend 5 years and 350k of my savings in med school. Just to be left with hardly any savings and working 60 hours a week for a low 6 figure salary. I wanted to earn more money and have more free time. See, thats something I learned when studying economics. Making more money for less time is a good thing. Why would I work 60 hours a week for 10k a month, when I can work 10 hours a week for 25k? Pretty easy choice. But go ahead and attack my profession because youre insecure and immature.
And stop telling me to use condoms. It is literally a job requirement not to wear them. Also, why would I wear a condom and decrease my sexual pleasure, when I have a fraction of a percent chance of getting an STD? Thats like avoding planes because youre afraid they might crash...

       <li>
        Or you're a fuckin moron and you stick your dick in something that may very well be infected with a terrible STD. If you are circumcised, the lower % will barely help you.

        You don't use a condom, and you're a fucking moron who got himself an STD for sure. If you're circumcised, the lower percentage will barely help you.

       Youre so bad at this. Dont ever become a lawyer. A person who just cleared a full STD panel is comparable to a plane with engine failure?" Like I said numerous times, I dont enjoy sex with a condom. I would rather not have sex. Not having sex means I wiuld have a zero chance of catching an STD. Why do you still keep trying to convince me to use condoms when Id rather just not have sex?
Youre acting like a 12 year old who's favorite toy go insuted. And now youre furious and attacking everyone and throwing out absurd arguments trying to convince people otherwise.

       Alternately you could not rely on slicing skin off, and use these things called condoms. I've heard they're pretty effective. Seriously, if your argument for circumcision is to stop STIs you've not got much. Condoms are a hell of a lot more effective.

       The condom levels playing field, if both wear it they have the same chance. You should wear one because it's safer so saying its a good idea to snip is basically saying it's better to use if you want to go have risky sex, and if on the small chance a rubber breaks (they're pretty strong) you have a slightly better chance of not copping an STD. Personally I'd at her just ask for an STD check and wear a rubber anyway. Seems a roundabout way of scoring a smaller percentage anyway. Seeing as female to male AIDS transmission is around 1% anyway I'm not particularly scared by that, so removing my foreskin to prevent that when I wear a rubber anyway seems redundant.

       You know what stops 100% of STDs? Not ever having sex!  Your argument makes no sense. Do you think circumsized people dont wear condoms? Youre basically saying "why pay more for a car with an airbag, when a seatbelt is even more safe?" Nobody thinks an airbag is a replacement for a seatbelt. Its ridiculous to say "why take that precausion, when never leaving your house is even more safe?" You were born because your dad didnt wear a condom, just like billions of other people dont. So what exactly is wrong with lowering your condomless STD risk?

       When the argument that the reason for circumcision is to lower rates of STDs compared to uncircumcised the implication that it is without condoms. A condom would level the playing field so the point of snipped or not has little to no bearing. Calm your tits, no need to get worked up.
      </p>

       Edit: going to take a punt and say you're circumcised right? Can't imagine you'd get so touchy about something unless it was done to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'd rather just wear a rubber which protects me from an STD at the same rate as a guy with the snip. I use them properly and they don't break, seems redundant to go get a permanent procedure that in that case provides no benefit. Male to female AiDS transmission is what? 1%? Mate I'm more concerned about the drive over to the chick's house than that, especially with the aforementioned device that prevents it anyway. If you're that scared of STDs that you're happy to snip away, go nuts. I'll just chuck a rubber on.

       Saying that you have a bad argument means that this is a touchy subject? Youre using that same argument that antivax people use. "im more worried about a car accident than getting measles, why do something that has a tiny chance of side effects when Ill probably be fine?" "I can wear a surgical mask and gloves to lower my chances even more!"
I have unprotected sex hundreds of times a year, odds are that Ill get an STD at some point. Probably many times. If I get and STF 5 times in my life compared to 8 times, its worth it for that reason alone. Thats 3 times less Ill be sick and home from work making less money. I chose to be circumsized, I even paid a decent amount of money for it. I chose to do so because of the decreased STD risks, a bigger percentage of people prefer the aesthetics of it(in my country) increased earning based on lower STD risk that might keep me home from work, and a few other reasons. I also hate wearing a condom, as most people do. Id rather not have sex at all than have se with a condom on. So I only have sex without a condom. I never said that everyone should be curcumsized. If you dont have sex all the time and you always use a condom and live in a country where being natural is prefered, you dont have as much of a reason to be circumsized as I do. But theres no reason to pretend like the benefits dont exist.

       So basically you'd rather get snipped and run the gauntlet of an STD rather than just wrap it? You're saying I have a shit argument? That's hilarious! You make piss poor comparisons to try discredit my message that if you're worried about STDs then wrap it to fit your self absorbed hatred of a perfectly valid method of preventing STDs. If we go back to your original and faulty car analogy, you're the guy doing 30 over the limit and swerving lanes because you have ABS, traction control, seat belts and airbags. It might be fine for a while, but eventually it's not going to work out so well. Mate, suck it up, if you're so scared of STDs wear a condom rather than taking a risk and hoping the snip will help.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're closer to the anti-vaxers than me mate, it's amazing that you can't see otherwise. I know the risks are out there, I have no intention of accidentally spreading it unknowingly (you do know not everyone shows symptoms straight away right?) so I take measures to prevent that. You on the other hand rely on a less effective method, and get around. You're the anti-vaxers not me.

       Whats with the freak out? No nees to be so insecure. Did you miss the part where I said I dont like having sex with a condom on? Why would I have sex if Im not enjoying it? Did you miss th part where I am happier with the aesthetics of it? Or that my earning potential is greatly improved? I chose to do something that would make me look better, feel better, be cleaner, reduce my STD risk, and increase my earnings tenfold. Why is that making you so mad? It improved my life, and thats the end of it. You just ignored all of my points and proceeded to freak out and try to insult me. What going on bud? Why are you getting so angry about other people having different lives and prefferences? Stop worrying so much about my penis.

       Why exactly would being circumsized and greatly resucing my chance of infection give me a bunch of STDs? Im assuming you dont have an actual reason and are just continuing to act like a 13 year old because you dont like being wrong. Not agreeing with you = freaking out? Glad you were able to be so mature about someone not agreeing with you. You should really work on not getting furious when someone has a different lifestyle and preference than you. Otherwise you'll have some issues when you grow up or get a job. People dont always think the same thing or have the same life, theres not need to get worked up about it.

       Getting snipped makes sex worse, doesn't let you see your orgasm from a mile away like being uncut does. It's not dirty despite what you've been led to believe. Mutilating your genitals is bad, it's bad when done to women, and bad when done to men.

       Don't bother mate, the guy will just flip from aggressively having a go at you to condescending while conveniently ignoring everything you say and not seeing the hypocrisy in his claims about what you're saying. Save your breath, I'm not engaging him anymore.

       I have experience having sex uncircumcised, and anecdotal evidence from a couple different women I've slept with saying that circumcised guys don't last as long. Maybe I'm just a badass, or maybe my dick just works as nature intended. Don't be jealous your mutilated pecker makes you a 2 pump chump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you understood a little anatomy you'd know that although the tip has the most nerve endings the foreskin is not without. Furthermore it serves as a barrier preventing overstimulation, so instead of having the orgasm come on like a light switch, it comes on as a gradual wave, and let's me know exactly how close I am to orgasm allowing me to pace myself better than some other lesser equipped male.

       It is extremely common knowledge that circumcision reduces sensation, causing prolonged time to orgasm. Just google it... One of the conplaints circumcized guys have and one if the main reasons people talk down about circumcision is that it takes longer to cum. Im make a living as a porn star...so I dont really have problems being a "one pump chump" regardless. Not sure why youre resorting to personal insults though.

       Think about what you're saying, how can having the most sensitive part of your penis exposed possibly lead you perform for a longer time? What you're saying goes against all legitimate research on the subject. Which basically states that it's all in your head, the one with hair and eyes, not the nerves in your wang. I will say this, I can see my orgasms from a mile away so if I want to prolong sex I can do something else and have plenty of time to react. I believe that window isn't as large with circumcised males.

       Just google it.... the foreskin isnt the sentative part, its the skin underneat that the foreskin protects. You remove the protective foreskin and the area beneath dries out and loses sensation. Seriously just google it, there is no point in arguing this.

       Okay so show me one single study that shows circumcision increases sensativity. Every study literally says the opposite. I really dont know how you came to conclusion when searching "circumcision loss of sensativity" brings up pages and pages of the opposite of what youre saying.

       CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality.

       For the record, I very rarely use lube and didn't do so until i was an adult. I started when I was 11. I see pros and cons to the procedure, like anything else. My personal opinion is that I'm glad I got the ol' choparoo.

       I also think that a lot of the arguments are in part based on incorrect information about circumcision or lack of it such as the requirement of lube.

       Anti-vaxx posts are gaining popularity because the CDCwhistleblower story,  and even more so because the silence of the media and medical establishment to address the CDC fraud reinforces the idea that the CDC /vaxx industry has something to hide. So far the only reaction has been a Snopes articles that did more damage to Snopes' reputation than it did to subdue the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the core anti-vaxx people are parents of vaccine injured children, who are very angry that their once-healthy child is now obviously injured, and the parents have to deal with that every day. Its not like other issues where you can be upset about something one day and forget about it the next. To add insult to injury, these parents are often mocked/ridiculed for daring to suggest that vaccines had something to do with their child's injury, which very often is an almost immediate cause-and-effect called "sudden onset neuro degeneration". Parents witness their child degenerate in front of their eyes and dont give a shit what the "research" says because they witnessed it first hand happen to some on they love.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-vaxx movement will not go away easily, and will likely only grow as more people become aware of what is going on. We have seen the establishment concoct story after story to try to bury the CDC whistleblower scandal, from the ebola hoax, to the Disney measles hoax, to the little boy fighting leukemia who really needs you to get vaccinated because he cant...
      </p>
      <p>
       And through it all, the parents saw through the lies, and became even more determined in their quest for truth and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im glad these anti-vaxx posts are being made. It helps people understand that vaccines are more controversial than the medical establishment would have us believe

        Conclusions: This first systematic review of male circumcision and ulcerative STI strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis. There is less association with HSV-2. Potential male circumcision interventions to reduce HIV in high risk populations may provide additional benefit by protecting against other STI.

       Absolutely does. The point I'm making is you can repeat the lowers chance of catching an STI all you want, fact is its a pretty moot point at best. I have no issue with circumcision, it's circumcision of babies that I take issue with.

       Of course not, that would be absurd. I chose to get circumsized as an adult beause it would increase my earnings 5x as well as the aesthetic and health benefits. Its not something I have any opinion on as far as what other people do, but there certainly were benefits for me.

       I don't care about STD probabilities, what I mean is that a circumcised dick isn't magically cleaned everyday and free of smegma or anythine else forever. Of course, there's lower risks of STDs, but STDs still exist and can still be transmitted; dirt still accumulates; and, most important of all: there's an undeniable loss of sensation, and having no foreskin is impractical because it sometimes creates a need for lube when there isn't any need for lube for people with foreskins in the same situation.

       See, there's the problem. You seem to think that only uncut people can get dirty. Well here's the trick: it happens to everyone who doesn't shower. In other words, cut or not, it doesn't matter, your dick will still get dirty over time if you don't clean it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to the corollary: people who say that uncuts are dirtier most probably can't be bothered to clean their dicks once in a while because they're the embodiment of the foul bachelor toad.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the loss of sensation, if it isn't a bad thing, why does no one on earth anesthesize their dick before having sex? I mean, with medical grade stuff, so you don't feel a thing. It should be a viable strategy to let the woman achieve multiple orgasms, right?

       I'm not saying its dirtier, the guy before me did. Even if I didn't shower or bath for a few weeks (happens every so often), I didn't have dirt accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim, and the others, is that the lost sensation I'm supposedly experiencing is a negative. I've had no issues with sensation with my dick. Meaning, whatever loss there is doesn't appear to have any measurable effect on me. Or others. The loss of sensation we supposedly have is only a big deal to the uncut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I use a numbing agent to rid myself of residual sensation in my hands, since a life of working with my hands has dulled the sensation? See the logic you use? Makes no sense does it.

       Seems you're reading into things instead of actually reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lack of sensation is not a negative. If it was there wouldn't be condoms made for that express purpose. Condoms aren't just used by the cut. Stop foisting your beliefs upon others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do you believe everything people with a title tell you? Everything you read in the internet? I have a cut dick, and it functions fine. There is no benefit to the foreskin. It has increased maintenance needs, and marginal increased sensitivity. Frankly, its not worth keeping. And if you want to compare it to "female circumcision", they aren't the dame thing.

       Some condoms include small doses of anesthetics because of premature ejaculators (and/or people who have general troubles with the mastery of their orgasm even if it's not classifiable as premature ejaculation). All they have to do is train. Everyone is sensible, what you need is to control your PC muscle and stay focused. It's all I need to get my girl to cum 2 or 3 times before I let go.

       But of course, if you don't care about either of those, fine. Cut it away and enjoy your mutilated dick. People will laugh at you in a few years, you'll see. Circumcision percentage is going down, and has been doing that steadily for 50 years. 
Plus, except for the US, no one does that in the world. You guys are literally the only country where it's done to a significant portion of people for non-religious reasons.

       You dont seem to know how any of this works... there is no buildup of smegma, cut penises dont produce smegma...  There is no dirt building up, not sure how thats happening to you. You also cant really say that loss of sensation is undeniable and a bad thing when youve never experienced being circumsized.

       According to Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Smegma (Greek smēgma, "soap"[1]) is a combination of exfoliated (shed) epithelial cells, transudated skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both female and male mammalian genitalia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So we have a mix of dead skin, lubricant generated by glands inside the penis, and "humidity" (pee, cum, or water, whatever). Cut penises don't have any of that? Are you sure?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no dirt building up,

       When you're dirty enough to have smegma on your dick, there's also other kinds of dirt in general.

      <p>
       Well then, you can't really say it's not a bad thing if you haven't experienced being un-circumsized magically. Yay for logical fallacies!

       The glans dont produce any smegma on a circumsized person... thats half the reason of the procesure, and is why circumsized guys are telling you they dont have smegma. There is no place for smegma or anything else to build up. Circumcision gets rid of a warm and wet pocket of skib the the penis. It gets rid of the place where smegma builds up and stops the glans from producing smegma. Nothing "build up" on an uncircummsized penis, even if a person goes a week without showering. 
And I chose to get circumsized as an adult, so I most certainly know what its like both ways.

      <p>
       Also, circumcised dicks still produce smegma. Circumcision doesn't remove the glands, and as far as I know there's still skin cells and moisture on a circumcised penis. Unless I'm mistaking circumcision for ablation, in which case you're right. Ablated penises don't produce smegma, indeed.

And dude... Im circumsized. I dont produce smegma. Neither does any other circumsized guy I know. Pretty sure I know more about my penis than you do. The glans do not produce moisture on an uncircumsized penis...How many times do I need to repeat that? Maybe youve come across some that do, but it certainly isnt the norm.

       Does not ALWYS. Just like a vasectomy doesnt always stop sperm from escaping. Almost everyone with a circumsized penis does not have smegma. Please stop preteding to know more about my penis than I do. I have seen plenty of uncircumsized penises up close, no smegma or moisture of any kind.
I also dont pee on myself or cum all over myself and not clean it up. Youre comparing smegma to general hygene issues.

       How are you not realizing what Im saying? You can get smegma without having hygene issues or not cleaning urine/cum off yourself. Getting yourself covered in your own urine/cum is a seperate hygene issue than normal buildup of smega. You dont even get a say in this arugument considering you have no idea what its like to be circumsized. Smegma cannot build up if you dont have a flap of skin for it to build up on. Fresh smega contains squalee and prostatic/seminal secretion from the littre glands.
This does not happen for 99% of circumsized people, and it is completely different from "dirty" smegma that is caused by peeing on yourself and letting your dead skin cells build up from lack of hygene. Just because one anticircumcision site said "does not always" doesnt chanhe the fact that every single other credible source will tell you otherwise.

       Logical fallacy. Does not stand. If I  use the same logic, I can say you don't have a say on the matter of death penalty because you didn't experience it. Pretty paradoxical, isn't it? You can't protest against death penalty unless you're dead. Yeah, that doesn't sound right, don't you think?

       It's not a required element for the formation of smegma. All smegma needs is skin cells, bacteria, and a little moisture to keep it all stuck together.

       What a horrible argument. Nobody has experienced the death penalty. That is entirely different than you telling me about my own dick. But I guess I just have a better understanding of this sort of thing because I have a bachelors degree in biology and have spent some time in med school. Sometimes I forget that not everyone understands these things or has any common sense. But thanks for the insults.

       Unlike you, I dont need to lie or insult people to make my arguments. I'll ELI5 for you. Warm wet pocket of skin traps residue/bacteria/moisture etc. No pocket of skin, nothing gets trapped. Not simple enough? Wear a pair of pants with pockets. Start grabbing everythin you see and putting it in your pockets. They statt to fill up huh? Until you empty them out. Now take your pants off, and start the same process over again... Weird.. you have no where to put stuff. Shoving a handful of stuff in your ass doesnt count, it just makes you full of shit.

       Aside from the

       As for the probability thing, it doesn't matter to me. If you catch an STD, you fucked something you shouldn't have fucked. Cut or not.

       in some instances, yes. there are women who are genetically predisposed to breast cancer who have taken that road. if every woman in your family before you died of it at an early age that would give you some strong motivation to get rid of the problem before it killed you.

       Yes, but that isn't what he was suggesting. Would you be okay with removing the breast buds from newborn girls in the name of cancer prevention? Or would it make more sense to wait until the girls were old enough to provide informed consent?

       I replied the way i did because his comment made no sense to me. There is no breast tissue to remove following the birth of a female. It's only when they reach maturity and develop breast tissue that such a surgery can be viable. I chose to respond to the common sense "after birth" meaning basically puberty. It's nonsensical to say you can remove something that does not exist. Newborn girls don't have "breast buds", wtf?

       Yes they do. There are undeveloped mammary glands in both male and female infants. The hormonal changes brought about at the onset of female puberty causes this tissue to develop into breasts.

       The entire point is irrevelant however, because it violates a human's basic right to body integrity. Parents have no right to perform non medically-necessary irreversible operations on their kids. It's morally abhorrent and indefensible. History will judge it as barbaric.

       A few things I'd like to mention....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are studies that show circumcised and uncircumcised males share the same sensitivity as well as studies that support your point. This is inconclusive and cannot be stated as fact scientifically.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The primary cause is a dirty diaper in children that have been circumcised and bacteria in children who have not. Change your babies diaper and this won't happen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Without the foreskin there won't be an excessive buildup of bacteria. Also....
Researchers conducting immunological experiments with the foreskins of bulls have found that plasma cells in the mucosal lining of the foreskin secrete immunoglobulin. (11) The researchers
         <strong>
          hypothesize
         </strong>
         that this provides immunity from bacteria and other germs. This is likely to work the same in other mammals, including humans.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sunburn? Really? I'd like to know how many babies get a sunburn on their penis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When searching for actual scientific evidence supported by the scientific method, I found more information about popped blood vessels in the foreskin than vascular benefits. If you're going to the arctic, wear warm clothes. Nuff said.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         See number one.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why is a rolling bearing needed? A vagina lubricates itself. If it doesn't, obgyn visit should be in the nearest future. If you're looking to stick it in someone's butt, use lube. You don't need lube to masturbate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Go to the wiki page. There's a quick mention of the glans and a whole lot of mention about foreskin problems. This is just false.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That's what the penis does. If your partner isn't already stimulated then you moved to fast, your partner has a medical issue, or your raping someone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Actually there are many issues with tightness arising from keeping foreskin such as not retracting over the glans, becoming stuck behind the glans, and drawing back to tightly causing number eight. The former two are believed to increase penile cancer risk.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pheromones? Your body has glands all over it. Science is at odds with itself over the actual effect of human pheromones and there have been studies showing they have little to no measurable effect.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Smegma buildup around foreskin emits a strong odor when not cleaned in a timely manner. Without foreskin, it isn't needed. This argument is invalid.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         An erection is a visual signal. So are dilated pupils, vocalizing, involuntary pelvic thrusting, etc.. You're going to know that's going on prior to seeing it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Scientific backing needed. Sperm counts vary due to so many variables it's almost impossible to state this with any amount of certainty.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Actually, studies show that it doesn't.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I've shown the fallacy you're stating as science,
       <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Functions.html">
        HERE
       </a>
       is a website with the exact verbiage you've used. Number 11 on the website is excluded and number 16 is included. You should read some of the others above number 16, they're good examples of how important foreskin isn't. This leads me to believe you either plagiarized another website that plagiarized this one that probably plagiarized another on..... You get it. Instead of regurgitating try to research and learn about what you're stating.

       TLDR: scientific fallacy about circumcision is set straight and plagiarism/regurgitation of information stated as fact with no scientific backing is exposed.

       Awesome, and with all of that out of the way and with risk benefits analysis being shown, lets let the 18 year old decide if he wants to have part of his body cut off or not.

       Well, it makes it a lot easier to masturbate.. And so what if you think it's so good for you. They should leave it alone until you had a say in it. When you were old enough to decide if the religion was even right for you. Then you go get the information about how it prevents STD's and so on. 
Bet you would make that choice in your adult life too, huh?

       Dude, get over it. You got your penis chopped off because of an old jewish custom that became culturally accepted in your country while you were born. It's not 'better', its just a ritual done to appease 'God', whoever that is. I'm sorry, but it's not how we naturally are, and to say that it is better because you might get less syphillis is really short sighted. If you are in danger of getting syphillis, you have much bigger problems than whether or not you are circumsized....
      </p>
      <p>
       My son is not circumsized because I couldn't justify allowing somebody to chop off the tip of his penis. Not my thang. Sorry bud.

       You have just described breasts as a woman's primary sexual characteristic. Are you OK with that?

       Also if im reading you correctly you contrast the disfigurement of breasts as a primary sexual characteristic to the disfigurement of the penis as something other than that?

       Many infants have the procedure done without any sort of numbing agent, regularly go into shock, and there's around 117 deaths per year because of infant circumcision.

       Also, breasts are not a woman's primary sexual characteristic. But hey, I assume you're pro FGM, since it reduces smegma. That actually WOULD be a woman's primary sexual characteristic.

       It's balancing risk vs benefit just like everything else in medicine (nothing is 100% risk free for 100% benefits). Removing both of your breasts incurs the extra risks of surgery (even if it's a minimally risky surgery), anesthesia and post-op complications including infection and impaired lymphatic drainage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision in a newborn is done without anesthesia and only with a local lidocaine(? if I'm remembering correctly) shot. Sure, not fool proof, but much much less dangerous than a mastectomy. The extra public health benefits of circumcision (harder to contract and spread STDs) far outweigh the risks (see american academy of pediatrics recommendations), just like vaccinations. Of course there can be permanent debilitating consequences of immunization (e.g., Guillan Barre), but the public health benefits far outweigh the miniscule risk to a single person.

       Is the circumcision obsession still happening? I hadn't noticed any of that for a while...but I also haven't seen any incidental mentions of circumcision lately either, maybe the "I hate my parents for cutting my dick" gang has trained people to stay away from the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: looks like I have my answer.

       It's not that I care about the points.  Many people use the points as a guage. If a comment is down voted to hell people with a similar view, seeing the comments, might second guess themselves, even if their point of view is sane and valid.

       Worse yet is having valid relevant discussions buried, while meme's and uninformed propaganda take the geopolitical centre stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see it daily with discussions on Russia, we saw it with the coup d'état in Libya. The opinions of people the world over are being shaped to fit certain agendas, certain narratives. Rewriting history as it occurs. Actions like these never end in peace.

       Well I was getting pissed off at the judgemental attitude and assumptions. You can't up and criticize someone's momma, with no proof call her abusive. This woman is a saint. I was also called a child abuser. These things tend to piss off the average person. Then when I got mad,they won. I lost credibility and even played into their hand. However the point I'm making is true, there does seem to be manipulation. manipulation that distorts public opinion.

       To be fair, I just looked at your post history and you legitimately seem pretty off the wall. Like, maybe if multiple accounts attack you they aren't a secret reddit cabal targetting you, they're maybe just normal users reacting the way normal people do to an asshole.

       This is unbelievable to me. Why were the mods banned? Is it true that Reddit ADMINS are participating in this by
       <em>
        banning
       </em>
       users that decide to do things they don't personally like, or that don't sit with their views on what should constitute free speech and free thought? Please, please tell me that there is some other explanation, because I can't even begin to abide by that kind of garbage. We'll
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       find somewhere else to go, no fucking problem. Best believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this turns out to be true, I'm ditching this piece of shit site. And I will tell absolutely everyone else I know to do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't underestimate the power of a group of people spreading negative word of mouth. Once this places starts being seen as Digg it will quickly eat itself from the inside out. This kind of thing permanently ruins the longevity of a website.

       My old account was banned by a Reddit Admin for quoting an article posted by someone else and laughing about it. The mods of the forum let me know what happened and that they didn't understand why either. They let me know that I had been banned completely from that subreddit by the admin and shadow banned as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe reddit admins can be as childish and vindictive as any troll on the internet. I wouldn't doubt for one second that some were involved.

       lol, wut. let dumb bitches who constantly cry about first world problems just simply be given power because they can't stop crying? let's be clear what the deviation heads towards here. it's middle and upper class white women. white women are the most entitled and spoiled women in the entire world.

       Hilariously, you've provided textbook misogyny. Like, not trying to insult you, but the post you made uses negative prejudices against specific demographics, which when applied in this manner is called misogyny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you find it ironic that you're demonizing a demographic fighting misogyny by being misogynistic towards them?

       No, they're not being given power. They're taking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be frank: You're the "bitch" who is "crying". You're on a subreddit crying about losing power. They're the ones taking it. To be a fly on the wall when you realize they're the "masculine" element taking for themselves what they want, and you're the "feminine" element who is hiding and crying in the corner of a small subreddit, watching it get taken. Delicious, delicious irony.

      <p>
       Did they tell you that was why you were banned? The tolerance threshold for being automatically flagged for violating Reddit rules are pretty high, and when Admins target the users of a sub it seems like they just manually audit it to find violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably broke the rules and pissed off an admin enough to dig and uncover it. That isn't being trollish, it is taking a personal interest in upholding the rules.

       All your comment was was "haha"? I don't want to sound unreasonable, but I don't think it's crazy for a mod to at least give a warning for a comment so lacking in contribution. Obviously many people get away with shit comments, but not everybody does. Depending on the subreddit and how seriously they take discussion, I don't think it's preposterous to suggest you may even be banned for something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean dude, imagine posting "haha" somewhere like
       <a href="/r/debatereligion">
        /r/debatereligion
       </a>
       . If I was a mod on that subreddit and had to deal with all the kids trying to sneak in there, then I can see myself occasionally getting aggravated enough to ban someone making a comment like that in a subreddit like that. So, you could be right, but, you could just as easily be overthinking it IMO. I don't know. Just my impression.

       Because I was specifically banned from the sub I was posting in and a friend joined the conversation to ask the mods what was going on. The mods in the sub didn't even know why I was banned or what I had written to cause the ban. They explained it was not from them, but from a Reddit admin and had no other info.  I found out I was shadow banned later from another mod who notified me personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no big deal. I obviously still browse Reddit. I just feel like it's all bullshit behind the scenes now. Especially after posts like this. I wouldn't mind seeing Reddit implode. I'm ready for something new. So many reposts these days it's not even a great news source anymore.

       Admin bans are site wide, but any moderator of a sub you post in is able to see and individually approve your post. Just because the mods from there informed you does not mean that sub has any significance in regard to your ban.

       Actually that is almost the definition of trolling. I.e. attacking someone because of your personal feelings towards them. It would be like the police stalking you because you banged a cops sister and didn't call her back. It's a blatant abuse of power if it is not a random search.

       This is like my 5th shadowbanned account for slightly acidic political remarks on a politics board.

      <p>
       Just the practice of shadowbans talks volumes about what the administration thinks of the users.

       Edit: further down I read what a shadow ban is. That's really messed up. I'd rather be banned than start to feel like everything I say is being ignored by the world. Screw those who shadow ban.

       Shadowbanned accounts seem normal to the user, it's just that other people never, ever see your comments or posts.

       The actual reason for shadowbanning is so that bots will continue to post after being banned, it wastes the bots time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, when mods shadowban users for the sake of it being annoying to them, it is a corrupt and terrible thing.

       About 4 years total, first account was shadowbanned in 8 months. I was a regular poster of OC with that account, but some mod didn't like something i wrote, somewhere, so off to the shadowbanned heap i was thrown, i didn't know what shadowbans were at the time so i continued posting for about 2 weeks. I got wind of it when i posted a really good joke and i didn't get any upvotes or even replies at all, then i was curious, then i searched around and found out about shadowbans, then i got angry, then i realised i was on another man's site where he decides what's being written, projecting sheep mentality in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i decided reddit was another silly place for laughs and cats, at least on 4chan when they ban you, you know it (even though that place is also going downhill with corrupt mods and removal of threads).

       For example, "Troll" accounts or novelty accounts, people get attention through them even though they don't really serve a purpose other than recognition and "points"

       After following Gamergate for a while it was obvious that there was a group or cabal pushing or "running" the SJW "movement." They help each other with getting jobs, publicity, admin positions, etc. They took over Something Awful years ago then Something Awful took over or started SRS. They entrench themselves then bring in their friends.

       I've never seen a more obvious attempt by corporate media to shape public opinion than Gamergate (unless you want to go back to 50s McCarthyism). Every single MSM piece on the subject pushed the SJW agenda; then you would read the comment section and 99% of people were basically telling the author to fuck right off.

       Gamergate was nasty from every angle. It's a case where you can't even pick the lesser of two evils. The pro-GG and anti-GG people fucked themselves into a corner with their despicable rhetoric.

       The 'pro' gamer gate perspective is something like this: It looks fairly obvious that this particular girl got a lot of positive coverage for things not related to the quality of her game. In fact she seems to have slept with half a dozen people who then went on to speak favourably of her game. The game itself is low budget, low ambition, short, and the whole theme of "What it's like to live with depression" is not convincing to people who have lived with depression. The girl is not important; merely another fraud (And some people also shame her for cheating on her boyfriend after tweeting things like "if you cheat on your SO and then hide it you are raping them by lying to them about the circumstances under which you have sex"). What is important is that the 'journalists' in questions not only had sex with someone they then praised, they also rallied immediately to protect each other when the story came out, and they attacked everyone who criticized them and called them sexist and slut shamers. Gamer Gaters want to take down journalists who do things like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti perspective is something like this: It is sexist to discuss the game developer's personal life or her relationships with the people who write about her. Gamers have unrealistic expectations about game developers, and respond with anger when their status quo is threatened. Look at this poor girl. All discussions about ethics in game journalism is basically an extension of the same rage they directed at her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm obviously biased in favour of the former interpretation, but I don't know how else to explain the ant perspective. They want a status quo where game journalism is more about ideology and less about the details of games.

       I'm seeing similarities with Gamergate and this controversy. It's the same situation.

       Whether you are pro or anti Gamergate, or just laugh on the sidelines, the whole deal is just now starting to bleed into everything. Any sort of discourse that maybe abhorrent to the "wrong people" will be met with a crew of mouse jockeys eager to hit the blue arrow.

       They let it get too big, now they can't stop it. The sort of attack they'd have to do to get rid of ALL the mods that are in collusion would be seen as a direct attack by reddits admins against feminism itself.  They are in a damned if they do, damned if they don't position.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's required takes courage, which the reddit admins lack. These posts will be deleted and the censorship will get progressively worse as they take more.

       after just checking out 8chan. a great realization dawned on me and it is fucking sinister as shit. i have noticed in recent months that /b/ on 4chan have gay threads every day and at any given time that i go no there, there will be gay and sissy threads and no pedo threads. i thought they all just left due to fear of being vanned. turns out, they were all deleted and someone is being paid to post gay threads as a full time job. sometimes i would see someone make a post asking why there are so many gay threads now and nobody ever points out why. this is fucking crazy.

       no but my sauce is being on 4chan everyday. there is a clear divide between the old 4chan and the 4chan now. you can't even post a too young for those tits thread and those girls are like 14 and up. at first i thought they just left but now i know threads get deleted immediately when they begin. there used to be tons of threads like that all the time. if it wasn't for the fact that gay threads have flooded /b/, i wouldve just thought that people left instead of being censored. then i went to 8chan and it looks exactly like the old 4chan except without cp. what's hilarious about this sjw bullshit on 4chan is you still see tons of racist threads.

       I'm curious if there will be an exodus. I feel like most people who have been on the site for a few years are slowly getting fed up with the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much user content as there still is, I can't see another Digg 2.0 happening. But I could see a lot of veteran users switching to something like Voat and the userbase on Reddit switching entirely. In the last few years we've seen a huge increase of teens on the website and I wouldn't be surprised if the site just gets filled with memes or yahoo answer style questions for most content.

       i think reddit executives are in on it too. yishang's public statement was in favor of it. although, i'm not sure what else he could've said and not be labeled a misogynist and shamed by 1000s of people in social media. there are no public figure that has dared to speak against radical feminism.

       there is no proof that's why i said it's a "big" coincidence indicating that it may not be a coincidence after all. why would i jump to conclusions and say oh it's cia. the movement was already there. it didn't just come out of no where. maybe the cia did bring it to the forefront, who knows. last time i remember we also had a pressing political issue that got washed over by gay rights bullshit. i can't remember exactly what it was but it was big.

       is a good reference.  It tends to foster right-wing, capitalist, authoritarian groups.  I don't understand why it would be devoting its energies to a left-wing, anti-capitalist, anarchist movement.

      <p>
       In this case, the social subversion that comes before an overthrow/coup/civil war benefits from operating under the cover of being a "left-wing" movement. It is in reality no such thing, as partisanship ceases to have any relevance outside of the public sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Devoting energy to sowing distrust amongst the public is beneficial to a power structure working to keep the limelight off it's own malfeasance and graft. It also raises the index of distrust amongst the populace, making it easier to sow discord at a future date by playing this group and others against moderates until almost everyone is polarized about everything.

       I read somewhere that the government has people working to do EXACTLY what these SJW people are doing, but on a massive scale. I wouldn't be surprised if CIA or some other government funded group was doing this. Seeing the amount of people that are involved, it wouldn't be a crazy thought to think the CIA was in on this. Also, this works wonders in dividing people and not knowing whom to trust. Dividing people is what the main goal is, and it's working damn well.

       Not 100% sure, when I say I've moved its only a partial truth, ie I go there, not as much as I did with 4chan - not sure on 8ch status personally and whether or not people are just being cautious, 4chan is definitely being shilled though

       after all the discussion today i finally realized why there are so many gay threads on 4chan. someone is being paid to sit there all day posting gay thread after gay thread. i am not exaggerating when i say that at any given time when i go on /b/, there is a gay thread. now that i think back, it's so funny because once in a while, you'd get a thread where people question why thats happening and nobody knows why. they say after calling each other faggots for years, they really became faggots. lol. no it's just sjws taking over and trying to make guys sissies and shit. it's funny but also sinister as fuck.

       I agree, and with 4chan there's a lot of toeing the party-line in regards to it being the Internet's cesspool and a hellish place, yes some people post some strange stuff, especially /b/ but it is (was) one of the last few places where you can say whatever you want

       This isn't even an open secret. It's pretty hardline fact. During the Zoe fiasco, Moot started taking down all Zoe related posts, which sort of triggered this whole thing. It was suspected that someone, somewhere, was calling in a favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then mod chat logs started leaking where they talked about specifically deleted Zoe posts as directed by moot. Then a few days later, a TON of new mods came on board, who started censoring discussions that they deemed misogynist, racist, or homophobic. Moot was basically trying to tone it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent mod logs also show this. Where the mods would look for justifications to ban users or delete posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole reason why 8chan blew up was because of the mass censorship going on at 4chan.

       I know. I was there. All the gamergate bullshit was filling up every fucking thread on /v/ and I'm glad it was removed. Literally every thread was filled with shit about it and it made it impossible to have any other sort of conversations. I think the gamergate movement is
       <em>
        correct
       </em>
       but overall I don't give a shit about politics and I don't want it in my videogames. Moot made the correct choice.

       And as far as I know there isn't any proof about anything you just said; just chatlogs that are easily fabricated by those with an agenda.

       SA bred 4chan too, btw. SA used to be cool, before the SJWs took it over and ruined it.

      <p>
       What happened was SA found a cabal of SJWs, made fun of them, and as a response the SJWs joined SA and slowly took it over. Now SA is such a shit-heap its founder has nothing more to do with it.

       The same thing has happened to this subreddit, just FYI guys. At least 3 moderators are involved, and they (or the people participating in this) have an army of brand new alt accounts to manipulate content here, distract from real/meaningful discussion, dilute discussion, deceive people and discredit this whole online community, and prevent any meaningful issues from gaining traction here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm on a new account specifically for being banned for pointing this out and making a thread about the attack happening on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and the manipulation of free online social media websites. The same thing is happening here, this post is allowed because you haven't pointed to the same thing happening here. I'll probably be banned for mentioning this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a team of people who have infiltrated the moderator list of this subreddit(as well as many others) and who bring the whole community down, discredit everyone, distract people from meaningful issues, dilute all meaningful discussion here with bullshit - with mod support - all on "reddit army"(one of the accounts is actually named that phonetically) alt accounts that spent their time bringing meaningless/useless content and conflict here to this subreddit, and spending their time doing things like connecting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to holocaust denial, neo-naziism, and being nazi apologists.
       <strong>
        The thing is, these alt accounts don't actually legitimately believe in what they are posting or saying, which is why they will go to any length to avoid being drawn into rational discussion or dialogue about their own posts - they will simply try to practice those very tacts - diluting the discussion, distracting from the real issue, deceiving people with their tactics, and destroying credibility
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing I don't know or can't tell is whether they are just petty "social justice warriors" and people from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       trying to link
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to racism and stuff to make a point with some "online operation" against this community and it's members (to make themselves feel good about themselves and reinforce their false beliefs in the way the world really is, to make themselves feel intelligent by attacking and trying to discredit a community of people who would otherwise make them feel stupid, by infiltrating the moderator list and posting ridiculous shit while never realizing
       <em>
        believing
       </em>
       the shit they post themselves or trying to talk about it or defend it in the comments of their threads) -- or whether it's an actual COINTELPRO type operation to link online communities with alternative information to shit that would simply cause 99% of people to dismiss everything that comes from it out of contempt, dilute it with bullshit and petty meaningless stuff, and distract people from the most meaningful issues by deceptively posting nonsense that gets attention and constantly manipulating content so their BS is on the front page(and the mods periodically sticky it to help them and ban anyone pointing out the attack on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that is currently going on).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's happening here, just so you guys know. It's either people doing it for petty personal reasons to massage their own egos via the internet, or a part of the government/intelligence agencies effort to control and manipulate public opinion and prevent any major leaks or meaningful criticism from gaining traction and spreading on social media websites that impact millions of people like Reddit.com does. Either way, it's clear to anyone with a brain that this subreddit is under attack and has been infiltrated by people meaning to dilute it's content with meaningless bullshit that has no productive effect except to discredit everyone and everything posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - watch this post get responded to by a handful of accounts that attack me on a personal level without responding to any points I actually made, or call me a jew, or pretend I'm talking about "supporting jews" (to dilute this very discussion and distract people from the real points and to deceive you with fake racism and bullshit distractions from the real points I made), just watch. If they see this, that's what will happen.

       It is not just here, I was looking through another conspiracy forum somewhere else, and more than half the posts were people spamming vile things about jews, muslims, black people, etc. Lots of posts about Neo-nazi's  and all that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is though, none of it was real, you could tell none of the posters believed in any of this crap, it was just all half assed nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with millions of random topic threads, to push down the legitimate ones. Stuff like: 'ok new topic: post pictures of horses' and there would be hundreds of follow ups.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's becoming the same everywhere, these forums are being snuffed out one by one.   By persistent shit posting, inciting racial hatred, or constant distraction/drama posts. Soon there will be nowhere left.

       I'm not having a go at you here, I've suspected this shit happening in some places i've been in too: racist nonsense, nothing but back &amp; forth link wars, less &amp; less productive discussion.  It's very frustrating, but since i've always had nothing but my gut feelings to inform me, as a rational person i generally stop myself there.
You have something more than gut feelings?

       Having spent plenty of time on /pol/ on 4chan and 8chan, I can tell you that there are definitely some people who come to this sub that honestly believe in the Jewish conspiracy/ZOG. I would hardly be surprised if there were false-flaggers, but sorry, Swarmfront is a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to jump ship, you can head over to 4chan's /x/ board, or 8chan's /fringe/ board. They cover the conspiracy theory stuff. Unlike /pol/, the cut down on the racism in favor of more occult stuff.

       At first I was annoyed by all of the go to voat comments, because I really like this sub and didn't want to see it fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think that as much as I love this sub, reddit needs to die.  Hopefully this sub can be rebuilt there.

       I miss the days when this sub was around 60k users anyway.

       It's a good alternative. The guy who runs voat seems to be really hard working (and probably quite young), and has found a good balance between leaving subs alone and stepping in when names are taken over by their 'enemies' from reddit. So far the only banned subverse I know of is /v/niggers. Which... Seems reasonable.

       but why ban it? the whole point is to let anything legal happen. if you don't like it, just block the sub and don't go there. do you have any idea how hypocritical you sound when you complain about rad fems taking over then say lets ban /v/niggers?

      <blockquote>

        First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

       <p>
        Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

       No I know the quote, I just don't feel like it's a fair comparison. There is no good reason to be racist, but socialism and trade unions both have good points as well as potential flaws. Jewishness here is really just genetics. Racism... doesn't really have any merit that couldn't be  achieved by other means.

       True, but shouldn't they similarly be free to express their ignorance in their own sub, as well? And frankly, wouldn't containing it (to some extent) in a place like that be better for the entire community?

       He is saying that people are persecuting racists. Do you see racists being rounded up or having to wear insignia? Really? No one is legally persecuting racists. And I'm not for that. I defend anyone's right to say whatever the hell they want.

       The ton of new users thing has happened already. Sure, if 10% of reddit suddenly moved that might be a problem, but he's handled the site doubling in popularity suddenly quite well. My guess is a DDoS of shill army would be quite problematic, but the site is still small enough he shouldn't be much of a target. For what it's worth he's already acquired some help, so he's not alone anymore, and i the site grows enough to become a target he should already have more staff by then. Loo, it's not perfect, but it's looking a lot more promising than reddit.

       I never liked this sub. It's over moderated and the users hold a toxic attitude. This sub is G rated conspiracy lite at best. None of the crazy out there conspiracys are even represented here. And if someone does post one they are mocked. Only approved conspiracys are allowed here and only 1 side of them is ever represented. Every time something big happens in the news this subreddit leans 1 way and all dissenting opinion is silenced. People are clearly pulling strings and have full control of where the discussions are heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will never change because it is reddit, it's how people think on reddit. They bring their biases and superiority complex with them. There are literally conspiracy theorists devaluing other conspiracy theorists' conspiracys. That is rediculuous. It's self censorship, and nothing will ever get accomplished through that. I was a member of this sub for about 2-3 months, I never posted, I just read. And I've read enough to realize that I don't want to be a sockpuppet in this shitty community.

       this sub used to be way different like 3 years ago. it has gotten progressively worse over time, just like any forum that eventually gets too big for its own good. back then there were actually cool and interesting "conspiracies" that got talked about (ancient civilizations, alternate dimensions/realities, etc) and not just populist circle-jerks and blogspam.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly i wouldn't even classify this sub as "conspiracy" any more. none of the stuff posted here is really even controversial. it's mostly just obvious fact to anyone who has bothered to put in even a little time to research it. not saying that this is bad, just that this place has changed a lot over the years as "conspiracies" have gone more and more mainstream.

       It's really a shame, but the reddit admins and said cancer can do what ever the fuck they want to push their agenda. There is no 1st amendment on a private website, and even less so on a website that's run by a publicly traded company. What we see as a conspiracy by a small group of people with an unpopular agenda is more likely a corporate decision based upon the discresion of a huge bank of lawyers and PR people. I guarantee there's a reason these people are mods of 100+ subs, and it has nothing to do with their lack of personal life.  Seriously, look at the handful of people in the request page linked in OP's text wall:

       At the end of the day we can pretty well assume that the majority of these people are full time employees of
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       with a vested interest in the control of the flow of information on reddit. If Conde Naste weren't knowingly involved, there's no way one person would be given power over almost 500 subreddits. That's just bad form and bad business. As a for-profit company, you simply do not allow any outside player that kind of control.

       *edit: Removed someone. Also, from the responses you can see below, I'm starting to think there may be more "shitty internet no-lifer nerd" going on here than "paid shill," but that's just my opinion. And I'm not sure which is worse to be honest.

       Why the F is my name on that list? I just learned about this "cabal" less than a week ago same as you guys. The 2 subs I mod belong to a Castle Clash mobile game... hardly anything controversial. Please correct your sources.

       They claim racism at every time you say "black" instead of "African-American" and yet they're the most racist of any person by classifying them into a totally separate group that needs protecting.
       <em>

       are the ones who care to much and as a result it seems that they see others as lesser than them.

       Who? All of them? Anyone who believes this world is horribly unjust and that needs to change, they're not Really fighting for equality. They just think silly things like talking about and trying to change deep historical oppression are good for some reason... Or what? I guess you would just tell me that that oppression doesn't exist. That's the only way I can imagine you justifying saying something like this (if indeed it is a sincere opinion, and not, as I suspect is also possible, a conscious attempt to confound any attempt to change this world order we have which I am sure must be treating you well).

       I get it from redditors, Tumblr, and hanging around UT in Austin,  TX.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, they should go with it ... and they do go with it. These people arent going to turn down privilege but theyll point to others with more and call foul. 
Once i met a feminist in ATX. She was from a very affluent area near Houston. Her parents paid for school, apartment, and expenses. I told her how my life was becoming so amazing and promising thanks to engineering school. She asked how my lifes passion would help the oppressed. She looked dumbfounded when i told her that my efforts may or may not directly or indirectly help people, but in career, i wont consider the oppressed: its not my job, id be poor at it and can better serve the world through becoming the best engineer i can be. Then she tells me the only reason i can do what im doing is because im a privileged white male. (This coming from her, a rich white girl who grew up in a tiny community, unexposed to various types of people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i shut her up by saying "so what? Ive got a leg up being white and male in America, so why not just go with it and maximize my potential? "
      </p>
      <p>
       Being privileged doesnt mean one becomes an asshole.

       No, but getting mad, spreading lies and hate, and acting against free speech while demanding it for themselves makes one worthy of the title. Plenty of feminists are perfectly normal, awesome people: the ignorant, childish few loud ones on the internet give it all a bad name. Dont assume i dont know the difference between a genuinely good person and an asshole: shit comes out of one of them.

       But you made a broad, generalizing statement about "social justice warriors," a phrase which itself seems to scoff at the need for social justice.

       Our use of SJW most certainly does not imply anything about society or justice let alone social justice. Its a derogative term (now) to be used for those who fit the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that we scoff at social justice is putting words in my mouth. Your trying to smear my ideas by implying i dont care about the prosperity of society. I do. But SJWs are a cancer that needs treatment. They don't change the world. They just repost others' ideas and fail at debating.

       Yes i generalize. Ill always allow for outliers: but generalizing can be beneficial.

       Read OPs post: that explains the cancer. The treatment would be exposing their shortcomings, nefarious deeds, and conspiring to limit freedom of speech and then fight back with debate and unceasing action to bring light to the best, most right information (for everybody), the last part being why i embraced reddit to begin with years ago: the democratic way in which all the best ideas (generally) rose to the top.

       Up there with the kid that posted about the dangers of mass surveillance and having been through a revolution while living in an Arab spring country. That I think is still my favorite comment AND poster of all time. He got shadow banned for trying to spread awareness by editing his most popular comments to include his new message...he was a good dude, I hope he still posts discreetly from a different username. We need people like him.

       I replied with the following, but never heard back:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I think that's an unfair reading of what I wrote. By saying that the starvation strategy played a forseeable causal role in Holocaust murders, I'm not saying that it was acceptable for the Nazis to commit those murders.
For instance, ethnic violence was a forseeable consequence of the US invasion of Iraq, but to note that is not usually taken as an apology for the murders ISIS has committed.
I'd be grateful if you'd rescind the ban. Leave the comment deleted if you like, I don't really care. I won't cause such disturbance again, and it was not my intention to do so.

       That won't solve the problem though.
      </p>
      <p>
       the core of the problem is that it's centralized. you can not have free expression and a truly open discussion without completely removing all control mechanisms, what we need is the digital, interactive, equivalent of a library.

       Except... I think one thing about reddit that enables the behavior everyone here is pissed off about could be addressed on a new platform . That is: absolute admin power v. The total lack of accountability they have. The SLC daycare bullshit case in point.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be some sort of admin power check. That would be a huge step to even consider try to salvage anything out of reddit.

       but look at it from a political standpoint. so you're an executive at reddit. these admins are supposedly doing "good" things by stomping out misogyny. what are you going to do to stop them? you'll be labeled a misogynist in real life and get harassed and shit. your real life would become hell. i think this is how the site got taken over.

       You may get harassed on reddit, sure, but I consider reddit far from my real life. But if you mean you'd be "stalked" and then brigaded on reddit, then I agree, that's a legit concern. But what to do then? I don't have a perfect answer for that, but what I can say is I don't personally care how many down votes i get as long as I'm speaking my mind faithfully.

       no man, i'm not talking about harassed on reddit. i'm talking about harassed in real life. they'll call your house, your parents, your spouse, your friends, and your work place. it doesn't matter if those people know if it's true or not. they'll get irritated. your work place doesn't want to be liable for anything and may fire you too just to get rid of the nuisance. if you're in that kind of office, you'll get hated by everyone. they'll spread rumors and shit about you. if you didn't have a very staunch stance on the issue to begin with, even you will feel shameful of what you did because everyone is acting like you are a bad person. the psychological factor is very hard to overcome.

       no but in the metaredditcancer sub, they mentioned a few people who got doxxxed. the person threaten to do all those things to a mod and so he closed down some anti srs sub. also, in the gamergate situation, that zoe woman did that to someone and completely ruined his gaming initiative for women and ruined his reputation. the zoe situation was extremely complex and involved so i can't really retell that story now. the gist of it is, the guy was creating a program where female game designers can tell the group their idea and get to direct a game development. zoe joined it and began disparaging it for misogyny or some bullshit and ruined its reputation. basically she didn't want any other women to get a chance to make a game so she can be the special snowflake female game designer and sell her shitty "barely a game" game to people. that was what spark the entire gamergate movement now. it was the final straw and it made many people angry.

       I would just like to point out that a lot of female oriented discussion is also censored and derailed, any comment that has to do with the biological reality of being a woman will have the user labelled as a "transphobic" "TERF" and usually censored or banned, along with threats and dehumanizing labels.
      </p>

       The sad part is this is why so many people have the belief that this is what feminism has come to and understandably want nothing to do with it, as it has become popular as a form of identity politic, and ironically, an excuse to tear down and shame women who do not adhere to a narrow and often arbitrary set of politically correct standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social justice on the internet and university clubs/cliques seems to allow for a lot of toxicity. Professional social justice advocates are so far removed from what you accurately describe as political cults.

       LOL the discussion of feminism these days isn't even controlled by women it's controlled by men who want to be women. Having the discourse controlled by men (even "former" men) doesn't sound very feminist to me.

        Social justice on the internet and university clubs/cliques seems to allow for a lot of toxicity. Professional social justice advocates are so far removed from what you accurately describe as political cults.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Professional social justice advocates do not merely advocate around questions of social justice. Like cultists, they preach a doctrine, seek converts, and condemn nonbelievers.

       While discussing the SLC fiasco inside of this thread, I came to a realization that would explain why the SRS Brigade and the like are given carte blanche to run roughshod over Reddit and why there may be nothing we can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advance Publications (reddit's majority shareholder and parent company of former sole owner Condé Nast, bastion of such weighty, free thinking publications as Vogue, Details, Glamour, Vanity Fair, and W, whose president sits on reddit's board) has a social agenda to push. The admins are under orders to "encourage" the hivemind of the SJW/SRS subs by the majority shareholder, represented by one person on the board. Hell, they may not even need to be encouraged to do so. They may know the agenda by heart and support it wholly.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, the users and mods of those subs are installed into certain subs (that would otherwise encourage a breaking of the hivemind) as moderators whenever possible, unencumbered by any sense of fairness and drunk off of the power that they long to have over people in their real lives. They don't have to be in on the agenda because they have internalized it already and anything that goes against it will be met with ridicule, mockery, deletion, and shadowbans.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true, and let's be honest it explains why the admins turn a "blind" eye to all of this pointed out here, and why all of this that OP talks about happened, then RIP in Peace Reddit. Unless someone in here can change the agenda of Conde Nast, then Reddit as a forum for free thinking and free wheeling hijinks is dead.

       myth: Condé Nast owns reddit.
reality: reddit is not owned by Condé Nast. reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast’s parent company. Then in 2012, reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. The best characterization might be to say that reddit is a “part-sibling-once-removed” of Condé Nast.

       I'm gonna put the TL;DR up top:
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR They've spent years indoctrinating malleable minds subtly through print publications. Now that print is dying, the internet presents their opportunity to continue to subtly shape the social agenda. Using an internet forum such as reddit allows them wide range access to people. Shaping the forum to their ideas ensures that other people will either be indoctrinated or leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conde Nast as a publisher of print magazines (and it's parent company by extension), has long held the power to shape malleable minds (both men and women). Through the direct slant they put on editorials, the choices of who/what to profile, and their choices of what to highlight in fashion, those malleable minds are informed of how they should feel, think, and look to be a real woman or man.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are aware of how to recognize slant in media publications, just go to your local bookstore (if you have one) and flip through some of their stuff: you'll see the slant immediately. And then come back to reddit. You'll find the same type of views in the "cancer" group highlighted in the original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conde Nast knows that print media is dying and they don't want to see their influence come to a silent halt. Their captive audience they had in the 80s/90s/into the 2000s is no more. Back then, if, for instance, a woman wanted to know what was fashionable, or was going to be, she had few choices but to pick up an issue of Vogue or other fashion mags. Same for men with GQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they were there for the clothes, watches, or whatever, they would probably wander to the articles at some point, where they would find the subliminal spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Conde Nast needs to find a new way to gain this influence. The internet presents them a boondoggle: They can run their stuff online and keep that influence alive, but there are many that would just show up for the fashion and ignore their articles. So what is a publisher to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Buy up a massive internet forum and encourage power to be given to people that have already internalized the agenda through years of the subtle indoctrination. They will take care of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as the bias of the mods online go, so goes the website. Anything not meeting their specific world view gets shut down, either by mods themselves or through the use of brigading, ridicule and mockery. Anyone espousing a different view from them is bullied into either leaving the site or changing their views.

       Yeah, that's the shitty thing about a reddit exodus that I see happening. When digg shat the bed, EVERYONE left because it wasn't just an ideological agenda it was a really bad UI change that everyone hated across the board. This time, what is going to happen or has the potential of happening is the dissenting voices are going to leave but the vast majority are going to stay further insulating the echo effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as for my question of
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       SJW stuff would be on the agenda for Conde Nast, and then pushed down to the mods, beyond the fact that it has been their agenda in the past through print media, I still don't fully understand other than it being understood as feminism being used as yet another tool of the elites to cause infighting amongst the plebs.

       Oh you were asking why it's their agenda. My bad...
      </p>
      <p>
       The people running the media today grew up during the 60s. They deeply internalized the revolutionary aims and identity politics of the counter-culture movement(s) and it has shaped their viewpoints for the rest of their lives. And they truly believe that their way of seeing the world should be everybody's way to view the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether or not they have internalized the "race war" that will topple "white Amerikkka" (a key feature of some counter culture movements) or that they need to divide us to subjugate us is questionable. It may be that they just want their ideology to outlive them in the hopes that one day it will be the only ideology, that the next generation of SJWs can bring the revolution that they could not. It depends on how deep you think the conspiracy goes.

       SRS'ers are fucking cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, though, OP, they are ruthless, brutal, and effective.  The CIA could learn a thing or two about cyber espionage from them.  Some probably have a great number of usernames. They have been known to doxx people, brigade threads, and completely get away with it.  I've seen this kind of behaviour documented on
       <a href="/r/SRSsucks">
        /r/SRSsucks
       </a>
       for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen reddit users and moderators get shadowbanned for something then see an SRSer doing the same thing but far worse.  They have frequently gotten control of an entire subreddits then toxify them with their ideology from the inside.
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       is a perfect example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch yourself.  Make sure your username has absolutely no tie to you personally.  People have lost their jobs because of rad fems.  They're like PETA but instead of hating factory farming and fur.... they hate white men.

       It's actually very likely that the rift between SJW's and anti-SJW's is a government formulated diversion, either side is probably loaded with plants to cause false outrage and to get those interested in social and political change fighting amongst themselves.

       This issue is a distraction to keep us from attacking the elite, the true enemies of justice and equality.

       I wouldn't have believed this before, but I got banned from advice animals for saying "You said that like women actually care about our feelings" in the context of talking to a guy about bad treatment by an exgirlfriend (that had long ago dumped him). I think we can all agree that ex's regardless of gender don't tend to care. I was called a misogynist and banned by some thundercunt despite getting gold for the post, despite the fact that I'm not a dude! And I've seen that kind of crap happen repeatedly to other people, I don't have a problem with feminism I have a problem with group-think and censorship. It's a fucking subreddit based on being humorous, yet the mods ban you for joking around? Fuck the SJW movement, their censorship obsession is a plague on the future of free speech.

       I agree that there are users who take reddit way to seriously.  Looking at the website as a whole, though, it is massively important.  It's like asking what the importance is of every major newspaper in the country becoming SJW.  For us individual users who can put down reddit and walk away it's no big deal; but from a corporate standpoint, and internet culture as a whole, it matters.

       Here's the years ago stuff you may remember:

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/search?q=laurelai&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">

       The SRS/SRD goons took over
       <a href="/r/OccupyWallStreet">
        /r/OccupyWallStreet
       </a>
       at some point way back. They decided to mod the Nolibs Crew to censor pro-liberty/anti-authoritarian (aka "Paultard") sentiment there. It didn't go well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the "BipolarBear0" connection:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/search?q=bipolarbear*&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/search?q=bipolarbear*&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all

      <p>
       This creep, an SRD golden boy who used to run
       <a href="/r/dickgirls">
        /r/dickgirls
       </a>
       and runs
       <a href="/r/Drama">
        /r/Drama
       </a>
       , was (is?) their ally in attacking this sub by libeling us as "holocaust deniers".
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods of SRD were keen on the macabre Rachel Corrie "jokes" that the Nolibs Crew love so much. They are vote-brigading allies at the very least.

       There's quite a bit about the whole SJW movement that doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was like 15 or 16, I had this idea that I could pretend to be offended by everything in order to cast some light on how politically correct everything was getting and maybe help people see how ridiculous it was. I abandoned this idea when I saw that people were already doing it and they weren't pretending. And not everyone thought that those people were ridiculous.

       That part I don't get. There's a history up on a wiki somewhere...either there or in SRD. I've already browsed here and TiA this morning, so I'm done raging at the internet for the day. Someone else will undoubtedly be on shift if you're in need of a link, though.

       Its a way of enforcing group-think. People who have no individuality but need to align themselves to some "cause" will pick names that show their loyalty to the cause. Whoever is controlling these sheeple encourages the behavior because it is one more tool to break down independent thinking and guarantee that every archangelle* will do whatever he wants them to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is normal in any cult for the followers to change their names to something that downplays their own existence and highlights their allegiance to the cult.

       The worst dream ever is being at a dinner table with one of these people and my mom.  Since my mom is a trendy appeaser she is judging me harshly the entire night as the chronically offended person appears to be offended and disgusted at everything that I say.  So I have to deal with this constant ridicule and then I get it once again from my vapid sellout mother for making someone upset.  Since she doesn't have real taste of her own she only knows that a person was offended and to her there must be something to that.

       I think they use the logic of "we shouldn't be upvoting this shit, so let's downvote it instead". Plus, it's confusing.

       There's a history wiki (I think it's on SRD) that explains some of this. I'm on mobile, else I'd link it for ya.

       The dude can still run the subreddit even if shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question I have is why give a fuck? Let them waste their lives like that, just avoid SRD, /jerktalkdiamond, /circlebroke, /offmychest and hide all their users. They only really run a small corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, having been a mod of /jerktalkdiamond, I can say firsthand that the level of autism in their circlejerk sessions is overwhelming at times. Also, fuck them for demodding me twice. Fuckers.

       Same garbage was happening in the "What do you expect to become irrelevant in the near future" thread. It was almost like a bot was posting "Men, we will be able to have test tube babies soon." type of posts over and over again.

      <p>
       I have LGBTQ friends, but when you are essentially promoting an entire sex of a species as irrelevant, you have engendered my ire.

       Force feed your agendas over the internet, and you will soon have other's agendas foisted upon you in real life. By this, I mean by the barrel or the butt of a gun your opinion will be dictated.

       The the whole
       <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">

       thing was orchestrated by well-known troll
       <a href="/u/KamensGhost">
        /u/KamensGhost
       </a>
       (who is ironically enough guilty of the same crimes he complains about... him and his cronies infiltrated tons of subreddits including
       <a href="/r/xkcd">
        /r/xkcd
       </a>
       to push a political agenda relating to the Holocaust). KG targeted anyone who called him out for his racism and antisemitism with doxxing and death threats, so I'd say he's using this whole "top secret shadow cabal of reddit power mods" narrative to get moderates easily susceptible to propaganda on his side.
      </p>

       Ironically, the real conspiracy is who is actually pushing the claims of a conspiracy here.

        /u/KrustyKoonKrackers
       </a>
       is a mod on this subreddit, and also on a number of subs he calls the "chimpire" that are wildly and intolerably racist, not to mention
       <a href="/r/rapingwomen">
        /r/rapingwomen

       and

       I only take issue with the fact that you call The Chimpire "intolerably racist". The racism is perfectly tolerable, and is preferable to the liberal brainwashing you appear to have endured.

       These things pop up all the time. I've been saying the same about the fact that the same moderators mod almost all Europe related subreddits. There's one group of european mods who mod them all except for
       <a href="/r/european">
        /r/european
       </a>
       which we started because of this very reason.
      </p>

       Unfortunately people really suck at taking steps to leave this place. We've tried many other options. We've tried to get people to move over to our own board at 8chan or sub in voat but with almost no effect.

       You're not. For all the bitching about brigading and censorship, the stuff SRS highlights is still routinely voted to the top of threads and subs. I guess some people are upset that racial slurs were barred from AskReddit, like the n-word or other epithets are really necessary for "open dialog".

       SRS was successfully gamed by Digg exiles who blamed reddit for the crash of Digg (after they destroyed it). The feminist SRSers are tools who are too stupid to see how they are being gamed.

       Does nobody on this website understand what 'free spech' is? Free spech is the protection you are granted by the Constitution from the US Government. Not on the internet. Not on a private website. You are not protected from down votes. You are not protected from people disagreeing with you. You are not protected from public backlash to saying stupid shit.

       This is a plastic website, manufactured to perfect specs. There is nothing organic about this site except what the foundations and framework was based off - as if you realized that ascorbic acid can be synthesized into a pill and sold as Vitamin C. It's lost the spectrum of natural and organic compounds that are healthy and have replaced them with synthetic chemicals approved by some higher up organization.

       I would try to get him removed. Although I know you won't be able to. He is only here to record the modmail, and maintain control of a bunch of subs of interest. Like
       <a href="/r/4chan">
        /r/4chan

       , and
       <a href="/r/Funny">

       The sooner you have him removed, the sooner you can start reclaiming this sub, and ridding yourself of SJW scum.

       I have been taking a break from the sub because I feel it has become stale and predictable. It's become a bland vanilla shell where about 1 to 2% of the submissions are worth even bothering with. The good self posts are still there and can still be pretty good, but they are such a rarity now.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading this I feel it has just confirmed what a lot of us in here already knew, reddit is on the decline and it's useful life-cycle is coming to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the bots, shills, vote manipulation, topic suppression and other bullshit going on here is simply wearing thin for me, reddit did not used to have all this bullshit, I am tired of it.

       I am going to check out Voat and see what develops there, it seems like a place I can get behind and support the best I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, I can probably get my old name back there, the one that got banned for bullshit reasons here a couple years back. The one that got the ban hammer for saying bad things about facebook. Shit that turned out to be true of course.;-)

       AAAnd This is why I have been spending way less time on reddit in the past years...
      </p>
      <p>
       And also why i delete and create new accounts monthy.  cant trust those trannies not to try to dox you and try to ruin your life.

       This place is getting worse then 4chan.

       That's right, I said it.  SRS has made this place

        worse

       than the 'internet hate machine'.

       In an era where office jobs are downsizing, Reddit's in-house staff growth makes me wonder if they're running persona software like liveworld does? I have no idea which would be cheaper- but if they used software like that, it would suggest they function like an in-house liveworld for Reddit's owners.

       Why do people even care? I will never understand this about reddit. What difference does it make.  Its an online community. I don't know about you guys, but reddit in no way affects my real life.

       People are fighting to control what content you are exposed to on reddit. What discussions are allowed, what you associate certain ideas with, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is as stupid as saying "who cares that mainstream media no longer resembles journalism in anyway, it doesn't affect me lol" you have the right to remain ignorant and be told what to think, but to many of us it's a bigger issue.

       because reddit is suppose to be this big place we can all talk 'american style', with freedom, voting, etc.  so the idea that behind the scenes a group is controlling an agenda, manipulating, etc, is bad. mmmmk.

       SRS has had admins/friends of admins for years, but they have no leadership experience, and are quite simply not made with the blood for leadership, that they have made fumble after fumble trying to actually lock down the website.  This site is awful enough that they'll get their way sooner or later, though

       How does one who has the technical ability to create a reddit upgrade/clone (say, hypothetically, me) - how does that site:

      <ol>
       <li>
        Get traction
       </li>
       <li>
        Establish itself such that this isn't possible and
       </li>
       <li>
        Solve any other extant problems with reddit?

       I've mentioned this before, but I'll say it again.  Reddit needs a way to let users determine who gets to "filter and hide" content.  Right now the moderator positions are just to powerful and corruption is happening.  If moderators can only hide content, but you can determine which "moderators" get to hide or filter content, then they really have no power other than hiding content from users who request that they hide content (e.g. filter).

       Finally, well kind of. I feel like I've waited years for this sub to pay off with a real conspiracy. Though I know more than this has spawned under this sub, but this still feels much bigger and much more of a hit at home. Sorry for spelling and grammar, I'm on mobile.

       It's sometimes struck me, when exploring the wackiest parts of the tumblrverse, that the whole thing smells of the ultimate in divide-and-conquer.  Maybe 'SJW Jacobinism' is the backup excuse for endless war warming up in the bullpen behind the neocons.

       Remember, tumblrinas - the Death Machine doesn't really give a shit what color you are or what's between your legs - Susan &amp; Condi Rice are excellent proof of that - it just wants to keep rolling.

       in the process, its a grey area so far, the fact they are based on us soil and a public forum, thier rules were not broke, if admins dont respond to the report then there might be something there. I will post it when I know for sure, I think its almost comical the people here wanting to silence people and for writing their beliefs and opinions need their own tv show. this is america, where freedom of speech is gaurenteed, if you have the money,

       Censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a site that many people read. When you read things, your thoughts reflect what you've read, regardless of whether or not you're aware of it. These people control narratives across numerous subs through censorship and shadowbanning, ultimately leading to people having a skewed view of what others think and say on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a BIG DEAL. I honestly would have passed this up as being kind of out there had it not been for the subreddit ban and mod change, but that really gives this some solid credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people (possibly controlled by corporate/govt interests, possibly paid) who literally keep people from being able to post openly on this website, and this ultimately affects how users think and act both on and offline.

       Personally, if this is true and reddit's moderators and, by implication, admins are starting to pay more attention to the casual racist, sexist, etc comments that give this site such a bad name everywhere else on the internet, to the point where it's embarrassing to even mention in some circles that I enjoy using it, then that's the healthiest cancer I've ever heard of. Cracking down on pointless, hurtful insults is not the same thing as stifling free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit.
       <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/545959/Online-ASBOs-Twitter-Facebook-users">
        This is what actual censorship looks like
       </a>
       . The key thing is
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       is doing the policing. Unless you think this "cabal" are all government agents, reddit cleaning up its act is not the same thing at all.

       Just out of curiousity if someone tells someone to kill themselves in america is that deemed cyberbullying and if so what's the punishment?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Australia encouraging someone to kill themselves is punishable by max 5 years in prison I believe.

       ahh. See it goes both ways. If a person is willing to represent your goal.. you can use them . People like you have painstakingly profiled are indeed archetypal of corruptible and useful fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       For everything else you let robots do the work. The plebs who still read the message board actually believe they are seeing real discussion. What they are seeing is actually where the robots and useful fools intersect. It is self perpetuating. And it is strange that it seems they have now set up a proxy-army of people who believe they know whats going on in the world and how bad it is.

       But that is all they are reaching them with. It I'd another matter of control.

       Reddit is a government propaganda site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been censored for posting historical events directly as they are stated in academically approved history books.
      </p>
      <p>
       The co-founder of Reddit killed himself do a government censorship and harassment. His father says the government killed him. this is how the government got Reddit to censor people.

      <p>
       Former mods have exposed Reddit for forcing them to censor dissent.

       I clicked this thinking it would be super interesting, because I expected the "cabal" to be more outright political in nature. For instance, pushing the agendas of big government powers, or something of that nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. Instead it's just another shitstorm about the "evils" of social justice.
      </p>

       Look, I'll spell this out as simply as I can. This. Does. Not. Matter.

       Who in their right mind gives a flying fuck about what SJWs are doing?

       Want to know why your little subreddit was banned? Because it was promoting witch hunting, which is plainly against reddit's rules, and has been since the sites inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very real issues in the world today facing the entire human race. Issues that this subreddit could do well fighting against. Remember that video of the two children speaking out against a pedophile ring? Remember the atrocities our (and many other) governments commit every day?
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <em>
        THIS
       </em>
       is what gets stickied? Sjw witch hunting? Fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the simplest trick on the books. Divide and conquer. If we're too busy jerking each other off about Tumblr feminists, and "fighting the good fight" against people who get offended too easily, then I'd say the masses are placated successfully.
      </p>

       Fuck this subreddit, fuck the gamer gate circle jerk, fuck the meaningless distractions.

       It just feels like this is such an obvious distraction from the things that really matter. ISIL is burning Iranians, Isreal is bulldozing Pakistanis, Switzerland says indefinite detention is cool, and we're sitting here bickering with feminists.

       If I was the people in power I'd be thrilled! The people are moderating themselves with all the in fighting.

       You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn’t it? A man may know that nobody has insulted him, but that he has invented the insult for himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill–he knows that himself, yet he will be the first to take offense, and will revel in his resentment till he feels great pleasure in it.

       Does it influence thought, though?  Or do people that already think that way latch on to it?

       Not once in my life, although I make it a point to try not to use fad words.  For example, as much as I hate "SJWs", I try to never actually use the term "SJW" and instead pick apart the actual ideals that the specific person in that instance supposedly stands for.

       Although I'm pro LGBT and pro equality I think every opinion has it right to be voiced (although being listened to has to be earned).

      <p>
       Subreddit rules may be enforced by their moderators as much as they want eben if it's 'no bad words against a specific group'. It should be communicated what is done and why though. The users can then agree and stay or disagree and leave. But revoking moderators and shadowbanning people is not a solution.

       I agree that this is a problem, but if it wasn't for this group, it'd be another group. Like the shaming-obsessed elitists who look down on everyone and each other for whatever they can. So it could be worse.

       Given the fact that the guy had over 12 alt accounts, it's possible that he was using those bots to upvote himself. The way the upvotes started flying in on his AskReddit post also seemed quite fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a possibility he's an alt of
       <a href="/u/KamensGhost">
        /u/KamensGhost
       </a>
       , who, ironically, is guilty of the same types of crimes he claims to be against (KG infiltrated dozens of nonpolitical subreddits like
       <a href="/r/xkcd">
        /r/xkcd
       </a>
       and used his mod position to shill his own political agenda relating to the Holocaust, banned any users that disagreed with him, and more). The writing style appears consistent, right down to his use of key words and his choice of redditors to call out. I'm surprised this is getting so heavily downvoted when this is such an obvious false-flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one of KG's alt accounts was
       <a href="/u/red321red321">
        /u/red321red321
       </a>
       , who created a subreddit called
       <a href="/r/redditinsider">
        /r/redditinsider
       </a>
       , using the same "generate drama in an AskReddit thread and get them all to subscribe" approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we wait for the facts to come in before jumping to wild, unsubstantiated conclusions.

       Leftist scum have been in control of reddit for quite some time. The left does not tolerate dissent. The same goes for other social media websites. Actually the same goes for most establishment media outlets. google 'journolist ' and 'gamergate' for more info on how tptb are in total control.

       It's a website which many people base their real-world views on. Saying it's 'just about karma' is misleading; it's about controlling conversation and narrative between people on a website that advertises itself as a place where anybody can post. Does it matter if you can post if your views are removed for differing from the narrative?

       do you so harshly judge a person who says radical feminist. They exist, theyre rotten, and they spit vile thoughtless arguments all over this website and others. Its disgusting because boys and girls believe it thinking that its right, because helping people is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these bitches dont help people: theyre only agenda is to stop people, limit others freedoms, and hate on men while doing nothing to bring value to the world.

       sorry, but sometimes in a line of argument, no matter how rational-seeming or enticing to my worldview or potentially insightful, there is a phrase or two that gives away the icky, emasculated, paranoid populist underside.

       'the government is in the clutches of an elite media and corporations. they have no real interest in bettering the lives of people but only serving their own disgusting self-interest and the interests of those that line their pockets

       Low Gay Theists tend not to go in for all the school dick stuff though the way His Protuberance the Ponyfucks Maximus' people do so what else would anyone use but High Gay Theists?.

      <p>
       Oh and high and gay and theist are not new words but part of a sentence you, not having gotten it from your employer, havent read before and so want to ban and discourage now too? What about..."Who the hell cares whats cool?"   Should it be discouraged too?

        What on earth are people doing with uncut junk to have this occur?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See, there's the problem. You seem to think that only uncut people can get dirty. Well here's the trick: it happens to everyone who doesn't shower. In other words, cut or not, it doesn't matter, your dick will still get dirty over time if you don't clean it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to the corollary: people who say that uncuts are dirtier most probably can't be bothered to clean their dicks once in a while because they're the embodiment of the foul bachelor toad.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the loss of sensation, if it isn't a bad thing, why does no one on earth anesthesize their dick before having sex? I mean, with medical grade stuff, so you don't feel a thing. It should be a viable strategy to let the woman achieve multiple orgasms, right?

       Yeah, that's the shitty thing about a reddit exodus that I see happening. When digg shat the bed, EVERYONE left because it wasn't just an ideological agenda it was a really bad UI change that everyone hated across the board. This time, what is going to happen or has the potential of happening is the dissenting voices are going to leave but the vast majority are going to stay further insulating the echo effect.

       But as for my question of
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       SJW stuff would be on the agenda for Conde Nast, and then pushed down to the mods, beyond the fact that it has been their agenda in the past through print media, I still don't fully understand other than it being understood as feminism being used as yet another tool of the elites to cause infighting amongst the plebs.

       Just google it.... the foreskin isnt the sentative part, its the skin underneat that the foreskin protects. You remove the protective foreskin and the area beneath dries out and loses sensation. Seriously just google it, there is no point in arguing this.

       I drove past it Monday after work and it was the same as always. Looked devoid of any activity.

       I mentioned this thread to coworkers that day and everybody knew which building I was talking about. It really stands out as being weird.
