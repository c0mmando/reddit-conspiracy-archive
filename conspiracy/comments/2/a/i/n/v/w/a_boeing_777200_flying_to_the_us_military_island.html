        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a very strange story indeed, and it is a little complicated so please bear with me. <a href="http://www.kitv.com/news/united-flight-from-honolulu-to-guam-diverted-to-midway/26915762#!bdrtJy">http://www.kitv.com/news/united-flight-from-honolulu-to-guam-diverted-to-midway/26915762#!bdrtJy</a></p>

<p>Passenger image of <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/HT_united_midway_island_1_sk_140711_16x9_608.jpg">two 777-200s side by side on the Midway airstrip.</a> What are we really looking at here?</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s look at the official story in more detail, starting with the official flight paths of the planes concerned.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flight <strong>UA 201 from Honolulu to Guam</strong> (diverted to Midway) <a href="http://uk.flightaware.com/live/flig%20ht/UAL201/history/20140711/0015Z/PHNL/PMDY">Flight tracker</a> EDIT: Link dead (I wonder why) Here&#39;s a screenshot. <a href="http://imgur.com/U8QL6tl">http://imgur.com/U8QL6tl</a></p></li>
<li><p>A rescue plane to collect the passengers was sent - <strong>UA 2068 from Honolulu to Midway</strong>. <a href="http://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL2068">Flight tracker</a></p></li>
<li><p>This rescue plane supposedly returned to base - <strong>UA 2104 from Midway to Honolulu</strong>. <a href="http://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL2104">Flight tracker</a><br/>
<strong>EDIT: THE DATA ON THIS FLIGHTPATH LINK HAS BEEN CHANGED! THE ORIGINAL SCREENSHOT WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS UA2104 TRAVELLED 2,458 MILES IS HERE: (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/feacNjO.png?2">http://i.imgur.com/feacNjO.png?2</a>)</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you compare the two itineraries of the &quot;rescue plane&quot; (assuming it was the same plane) Honolulu-Midway and Midway-Honolulu, it is clear the flight distances (according the flight tracker links above) <strong>DO NOT TALLY</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>If you note the final flight (UA 2104) was supposed to fly the 1,310 miles from Midway to Honolulu, but the Flight tracker link confirms it actually flew 2,458 miles - about the same distance as the original flight UA 201 which supposedly got half-way to Guam before turning back. Something doesn&#39;t add up here.</strong></p>

<p>So if UA 2104 didn&#39;t come from Midway, where could it have taken off from? Looking on Google Earth, there is a US military base called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island">Wake Island</a> directly in between Hawaii and Guam, some 2,300 miles from Honolulu. It has a landing strip which according to Wikipedia can be used in an emergency by transpacific airliners. Was MH370 being hidden here?</p>

<p>It could suggest that when Malaysian Airlines MH370 disappeared, it didn&#39;t turn and and fly West to Diego Garcia, but carried on straight towards the US Pacific Military installation of Guam instead. This would mean that the Malaysian Boeing 777-200 has actually been in Guam (or refuelled and moved out of sight to Wake Island) all this time, and this United Airlines musical planes charade is a way of getting the plane off the island. </p>

<p>Hypothesis 1: The supposed switch on Midway did not happen, and the 777-200 sitting on the tarmac at the tiny Midway airstrip is MH370, but the world now thinks its UA 201. A classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cups_and_balls">cups-and-balls shell game</a>. This presupposes that the passengers were in on it, although they were probably all either US military personnel or relatives. The news report states that the passengers were given $500 for <del>shutting up</del> their trouble.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2: The Midway switch did occur, but the replacement plane which took the passengers back to Honolulu was MH370 which had been flown there from Guam, re-liveried and numbered as UA 2104.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 3: The switch occurred (and MH370 is now in Honolulu as UA 2104) but the transfer was not on Midway, but on Wake Island. The passengers wouldn&#39;t necessarily be able to tell the difference, and their photos are inconclusive, seeing as it was dark. If anyone can provide an image of the inside of the hangar at Midway or Wake were passengers took images, this would rule out this option.</p>

<p>Over to you folks. There&#39;s Interesting discussion from pilot forum about the events, <a href="http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/6123143/#menu52">here</a> if you want more info.</p>

<p>Edit: typos</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The official story is that a United Airlines Boeing 777 flying from Honolulu to Guam had technical issues and was re-routed to Midway (another island in the Pacific owned by the US). Another Boeing 777 was dispatched to Midway (from Honolulu) to &quot;rescue&quot; the passengers. This plane then took them back to Honolulu, leaving the original plane in Midway.</p>

<p>However, the actual distance travelled by the final flight is far greater than the distance from Midway to Honolulu, suggesting it flew into Honolulu from somewhere else entirely. The Flight Path links showing the distances have been deleted/amended since I made this post, which is suspicious in itself. Fortunately I made screenshots, which are posted next to the original links.</p>

<p>TLDRTLDR: A confusing series Boeing 777 plane switches between several US owned pacific islands could have been a deliberate ploy to move a re-liveried, and renumbered MH370 in plain sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two events may be completely unconnected, but that&#39;s why I use the word &quot;hypothesis&quot;. </p>

<p>But since the official story given by United Airlines doesn&#39;t add up (because the flight distances are completely out of whack) you need to do better than just &quot;deny&quot; the hypothesis - you actually need to provide some sort of rebuttal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The distances are not all that out of whack planes dont fly in straight lines, you cant just measure on a flat map and say thats the distance they should have traveled.

    <div class="md"><p>No, you actually need too provide evidence for your &quot;Hypotheses&quot; as you are the one making them and asking for opinions. If you don&#39;t like the opinions then provide evidence that makes them more than opinions or learn to deal with disappointment. Correlation is not causation and your attitude of  &quot;that is why I used the word hypothesis&quot; does little to hide the fact that you absolutely believe these things to be real with no supporting evidence. Yes you did use that word, so maybe you need to be reminded of that reality. This is conspiracy theory, as opposed to conspiracy fact. Stop trying to fill holes in official stories with theories. Fill them with facts or shut the fuck up. I truly believe that flight MH370 is involved in some kind of underhanded business, some kind of conspiracy, but I have no evidence, so I accept that, and don&#39;t douche my around reddit with unproven notions and demands that people prove ME wrong. That is not how theory works. Grow up!.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world needs people to look out and try to join dots. 
I save these threads to look back on them later, like many others, take screen grabs etc. </p>

<p>A possible reason for the discrepancy could be the tracking site. Is it actual live satellite data or planned/reported flight data? If free sites like this are so accurate how did mh370 go missing in the first place (actual question, I don&#39;t know) all this bullshit name calling is counter productive. </p>

<p>If someone thinks this sub in tin foil crack pots, don&#39;t join the discussion.</p>

<p>Edit: stopped being lazy and looked it up. The tracking information is provided via official sources and doesn&#39;t appear to be actual live tracking information but may be compiled using flight plans as well as an ads-b transponder tracking network, which there wouldn&#39;t be any of in the area. They do use &quot;live&quot; data, but do not control it. It doesn&#39;t discount what your saying. This could be a small piece of a large plan. 
Keep posting what you find and if anything does transpire, we have a head start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With MH17 now going down and MH370 never found, perhaps this was simply a way to increase low altitude civilian air traffic with plausibility. Perhaps MH370 and MH17 are the same plane. It would be easier to amend records of serial numbers than repaint a plane without evidence. MH370 went missing and this supposedly allowed powerful people to control some patents outright. Then the plane is put back into service and flown over Ukraine to be shot down down.
This allows the international community to label the &#39;Separatist&#39;s&#39; as &#39;terrorists&#39;. Crimea was pretty open and shut and I don&#39;t think Ukraine or EU want Russia to gain any more land. I cannot fathom a reason why Russia/pro Russians would shoot down a plane. </p>

<p>The only response is that the international community join in. However from what I understand the UK has not met its quota for UN forces and this gives a good reason to throw some out there. It also justifies the building of a second aircraft carrier equipped with the latest F35 fighter to combat Russian forces. 
I believe this level of equipment is simply not required when facing the Taliban or Isis but Russia starts an arms race. Arms races cost money, but more importantly, they justify the spend.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m definitely not ruling this out. It&#39;s not clear how the switch would have been done, because what we have is a giant puzzle with most of the pieces of missing, and some extra pieces which have been thrown in to make it even harder to solve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot fathom a reason why Russia/pro Russians would shoot down a plane. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. Although the Ukrainian&#39;s governments claim that MH17 was accidentally shot down by rebels is a bit too convenient, at the same time it has not been disproven. It&#39;s a possibility. The rebels have taken down Ukrainian military planes, so they have the capacity.</p>

<p>Clearly, the Ukrainian government and its patron, the US have the most to gain from this &quot;event&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>can someone explain to me why anyone would do this? forgive me for my ignorance, because i have not taken any real interest in these MH370 theories. i haven&#39;t read any of the conspiracy theories, and have not even read much of the official story. what i&#39;m wondering about is the motive. why would someone want to make a plane disappear? any ideas as to who did it, and why?</p>

<p>edit: also, any evidence to suggest that the official story is false to begin with? i don&#39;t really see how this post counts as evidence. sounds like speculation to me, but like i said i&#39;m not very familiar with the topic so don&#39;t quote me on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am supposing that only two planes were involved. </p>

<p>The official story is that two United Airlines 777-200s left Honolulu and landed on Midway. My supposition is that the second plane was not from Honolulu, but a re-liveried MH370 out of Guam which returned to Honolulu as UA 2104.</p>
