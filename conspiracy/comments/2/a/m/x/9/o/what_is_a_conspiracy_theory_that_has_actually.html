       First of all the term conspiracy theorist was coined in the 1960's.  The CIA worked very hard to give it a negative connotation.  IF you just need one conspiracy that they have admitted to try the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

       i stopped watching at "according to a source, close to the case..."
i went on to look at the channel's other videos, with one detailing what orbs are but give no evidence whatsoever,

        this trash

      </p>
      <p>
       as well as that, there is another video that strings together what random people claim but give no evidence that Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the plot to kill JFK,

       it is as if that channel can't decide what it wants to be. a ghost/demon place, an alien hangout, or a conspiritard get-together

       Dude. That is an FBI agent

        on tape

       admitting that they played a role in the bombing lol. Ad hominem is a weak argument.

       You didn't even listen long enough to get to the real tape did you? They play the actual phone conversation between the FBI agent and one of the bombers.

       after your comment, i decided to watch. why did Reuters not make a big deal out of it? and, why is the newspaper article not shown to confirm its existence. And WBAI? my search for it shows it is a listener supported radio station, and this

        video
       </a>
       about an arcade game that caused insomnia, nightmares, memory loss, and even suicide. i didn't really pay attention to it, as soon afterwords i forgot about it. but, after seeing a bit of the game-play, that night i did have really bad nightmares. when i woke up, i realized it could have been this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       the night after seeing the video, i had very bad insomnia, and experienced terrible paranoia for no reason. but the night after, thankfully, it stopped

       I heard about it from someone who lived during the time and got sick, though it was probably something minor. They sprayed something and used the hospital visits as their demographic data set.

       Did you know that the BBC reported that the Solomon Brothers Building (WTC 7) had collapsed 20 minutes! before it actually fell. How did they know it was going to fall? This is a reporter standing in front of WTC 7 while it's
       <em>
        still standing
       </em>
       and she says it's collapsed:

       maybe the times got mixed up, maybe they wanted to make the story more interesting and didn't know it would actually happen.

      <p>
       also, if this was an american plot, made by the government, why would a BBC reporter be informed of the plot?

       The "times got mixed up"? What does that mean? There was a terrorist attack and the BBC reported 3 towers went down when only 2 had. How did they know the third one was going to fall?

       Ahh gotcha. In the middle of the biggest terror attack of all time, the BBC decides to make up a lie to "make it more exciting". 20 minutes later that "lie" comes true. That makes sense. I guess that's what happened.

       Maybe that plane that went down in Pennsylvania was supposed to hit WTC 7. The releases were prepared beforehand and things didn't follow the script exactly.

       the WTC7 went down seven hours after twin towers, according to this BBC
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7485331.stm">
        source
       </a>
       and also in it is the way it went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       according to this CNN
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/07/22/911.flight.93/">
        article
       </a>
       the plane went down at 10:02
      </p>
      <p>
       and this CNN
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/11/chronology.attack/">
        article
       </a>
       gives the timeline of events. so, flight 93 goes down way before the WTC 7 collapses. without a plane, they would not have blown any apparent 'bombs', and why do it 7 hours later?

       I actually figured it out circumstantially -- I was over near Ukraine when the coup went down and saw how western corporate news reported it as Russian aggression, an obvious lie. My brain started clicking, and it quickly became obvious 9/11 was a false flag.

       Russian aggression? absolutely no one saw it as that. i have never even heard the words Russian and September 11th in the same sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the Loose change film, it gives parallels to the pearl harbor situation, how FDR knew of the coming attack, and used the incident to go to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, from what i remember of Loose change, it claimed that 9/11 was/is used to convince people to take away rights, but what rights were taken away? sure the NSA spying is whacked out, but barely anybody supports them. other than the NSA, what else is there?

       No, no, no... The annexation of Crimea was portrayed by corporate media as Russian aggression. Anybody watching independent news knew it was anything but. Seeing corporate media lie so blatantly to paint Russia in a bad light forced me to reconsider their portrayal of previous events, 9/11 being one example. JFK is another. Sandy Hook. Aurora. I'm not buying their bullshit anymore and neither should you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure you know this, but 9/11 was used to justify invading and destroying 2 sovereign nations and killing at least 500,000 civilians.

       has a great series on the whole ukraine situation. that is what i have watched. and to me it does seem to me that the annexation of crimea was an injustice, but that is another topic altogether.

       what would be the reasoning behind using the 9/11 attacks, when you are claiming the government did it? if they could pull such a thing off, surely they can convince the nation to go to the middle east without such an attack. i think the real reason to go to Iraq was to topple Saddam Hussein, and open the oil to the west. according to this

       Vice is shill media masquerading as an edgy liberal rag. They're pretty subtle, but they slip in key talking points. Vice's series on Ukraine was pure propaganda, subtly making the argument that Russia was invading rather than EU was staging a coup of Ukraine.

       The rest.. nah, you've gotta be a troll. Nobody is that dense.

       the ukraine series gives no comment. they just report what is happening.

       I wouldn't normally counteract by calling someone else a troll, but i suspect you are the troll. you are a troll because you did answer my question about how they destroyed 2 nations. so please, enlighten me.

        fair enough. i am trolling. but i am also trying to enlighten. But it partially offends my reality tunnel when you refer to pope bob as some guy with a mouth, this coming from a point of ignorance, and the naivety of a post on r/conspiracy asking for True conspiracies.

       P2 happened in every sense of western recorded history (we can debate whether most of that is real) but don't commit the genetic fallacy in regards to wikipedia.
