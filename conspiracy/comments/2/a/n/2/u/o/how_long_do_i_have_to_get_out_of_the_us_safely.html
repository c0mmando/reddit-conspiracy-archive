        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I (First I apologize for any grammatical errors.) So as I sit here typing this on my phone I cant help but think of how long do I have in the U.S. We all know its going to shit(if not then its already shit.) as is the rest of the world. Throughout history one of the first things that happens to countries like this is transportation gets cut off, and no one can leave so I&#39;m curious how long do you think we have before that happens. My life is very open as I&#39;m 14 so I have 3 years of high school then I can leave, no doubt living conditions will be bad for a long time and of course there&#39;s college. So my questions really how long before you think it becomes an unsafe zone/ leaving is no longer an option it could change at any point and that is a terrifying thought to me.  it would also be great if I wasn&#39;t talked down to because of my age, true I don&#39;t know everything but no one does so don&#39;t act like you do. Otherwise I appreciate any comments.
Edit. This was linked to r/conspirated where I thought it was funny that they assume I don&#39;t study, or worry about petty crap like who I will take to prom. Just thought you might enjoy that.  Also thanks for most of the comments, and I have traveled the world I&#39;ve been very fortunate to see a good portion of eastern Europe. My mom used to be a French teacher and she would take her high school students to France and I would come along. I also got selected for a people to people trip. My mother and I went camping a couple of times in different areas like Switzerland. I&#39;m also aware the U.S is not the worst place to live in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t keep reading this conspiracy shit. Go out and experience life, learn about the world, visit different cultures and countries then make up your own mind. If you keep going down this path it will eat you up. I was hardcore into conspiracies when I was your age and even ran a reasonably well-known website. Over the years of running that site and reading about all the alarming developments, I also feared an imminent disaster. NWO &quot;commentators&quot; and radio hosts continuously kept the threat of martial law looming, of some hostile foreign takeover or economic crash. It didn&#39;t matter that the narratives or theories were changing, what was important was that the threat remained. There were people who would publish photographs of freight train cars on sites and describe them as prison carts to take civilians away, photos of army of private boot camps, describing them as &quot;FEMA internment camps&quot; or photographs of military PR stunts and training exercises that were considered attempts at &quot;brainwashing&quot; the public and children to accept military presence -- in towns with military bases! The examples are seemingly endless. Despite the vigor these tales were told with, they were all anecdotal, with unsubstantiated sources or contained misunderstood information. None of them really had any authority to them. As martial law came no closer and the stories kept changing, I luckily drifted away from this world and now gauge with it on a much more critical level. NWO fear-mongering is big business in the States, particularly in Texas. It keeps radio shows and all associated merchandising, books and products on sale. Not to mention alternative lifestyle and health products. Obviously this world is also deeply connected to America&#39;s world of gun freaks, whose multi-billion dollar a year habits are more frightening to me than any coming martial law (hell will freeze over first).  </p>

<p>But kiddo, don&#39;t take it from me. That&#39;s just my experience. I hope you continue to do a bit of growing, keep learning and reading and come to your own conclusions. The NWO/martial law/economic crash shit might sounds alarming news to you now, but dig a little deeper and you&#39;ll see that nuts have been waving this flag for almost twice as many years as you&#39;ve been around. No, I do not trust the government or official stories for a lot of historical events. But do yourself credit and learn about what&#39;s out there, where this information comes from and the reasons why people fervently believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, it&#39;s only &quot;the conspiracy crowd&quot; who talk about dwindling social mobility in your country? I&#39;m sorry but that is the truth of what is happening in the US, and just because some people can get a job doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a problem!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crux of your argument seems to be on minimizing just who can get a job in the US, as if they are a minority. The US has the largest and most diverse economy in the world. If you have desirable skills, it&#39;s almost guaranteed that you will get a nice job. Getting desirable skills is pretty much free these days. It&#39;s a matter of dedication to that goal. Even if you&#39;re working 2 minimum wage jobs just to get by, you can still achieve these things. It&#39;ll just take longer since you have a lot less free time to spend on learning.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s a problem with wealth inequality, healthcare, and other factors that hinder social mobility(such as being born poor to begin with). Nothing will fall into your lap anywhere, and there will always be hardships and roadblocks. But please don&#39;t pretend the US is similar to some developing country where it&#39;s practically impossible to improve your conditions. In addition to the massive economy, there&#39;s also lots of programs(government-sponsored or otherwise) oriented at getting people skills and networking. If you&#39;re having a tough time finding a decent job that isn&#39;t retail or self-service, the issue is most likely that you aren&#39;t exploiting all of these tools available to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that wasn&#39;t my argument at all. I actually made no argument any way similar to what you said. What you are doing is minimizing the problems your country actually has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I also didn&#39;t say it was &#39;totally fine&#39;, but I can see how one would interpret your argument(supporting the OPs) as saying the US is becoming a third world country. I know there are issues here, as with everywhere. But even with those issues, it&#39;s still a hell of a lot better here than in most countries. Even the poorest of the poor here have more available to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the US gets better by people leaving? I know you&#39;re young, but you have to see yourself as having the ability to change your environment. That&#39;s not to say that people can&#39;t move away if they&#39;d be truly happier, but it might be a good idea to get a bit older and let yourself evolve the way humans do in their teens into adulthood before making that decision.</p>

<p>As much as I am against trying to adhere to a system in order to change it, the apathy of the younger generations in the US is delaying change as much as the rigidness of the older people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This likely has more to do with your outlook on life than it does any objective fact about the US or the world.  Most people live their lives in happiness and enjoyment without obsessing over the next big threat looming around the corner because doing so only causes stress and discomfort, and it takes a lot of stretching to mold a paranoid narrative around day to day life.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really concerned that the world is going down, then buy some supplies, keep them in your basement and forget about it.  If it is true, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it anyway, so try and enjoy the time you have to be free and worry about the end when the time comes.  </p>

<p>As the poster above me noted, if you continue down this path, you&#39;ll regret it.  You don&#39;t want to be the nut who alienates people, takes Alex Jones&#39; word, spends his life in constant fear, and gets constantly manipulated by people with a conspiracy product to sell.</p>

<p>You might want to consider bouncing some of these ideas off a mental heath professional; chances are you have some <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/0002153">cognitive distortions</a> that are leading you into this dark rabbit hole. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey kid. The first thing you need to do is to stop reading conspiracy sites. They are in the business of selling fear and they make a  killing off of it. We are currently living in the greatest time in human history. Enjoy it, don&#39;t let people give you their delusions because all they want from you is someone to validate their fears.</p>

<p>Get out and enjoy the world. Most importantly right now, think of your education and career path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from, but I&#39;m talking about traveling to places where the populace can&#39;t afford to come here, much less travel.  Of course those that can afford to travel here are well off.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the majority of the world that is poor, like Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Mexico etc. it&#39;s funny; I&#39;ve been to all those places and the more restrictive the regime is, the nicer I find the general people to be. Strange.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is get out and see the world with your own eyes. It&#39;s important to live like others to appreciate what you do have in a new way. One time I traveled through Thailand for two months. The thing that struck me when I walked into my apartment when I got home was how rich I was compared to much of the world. And by rich I mean the simple things, like being able to drink out of your tap, to sit on a toilet seat and have a nice bed.</p>

<p>The thing I like about travel is it resets your thinking about your own life and widens your perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody can predict the question you&#39;re asking. It depends on a lot of factors. It depends on who we have in congress and power, what they are doing, what bills are being passed, and what every day citizens like you and me and the other people of reddit and around the world are doing to change things. In three years time we&#39;ll have a new president and we&#39;ll have voted on our congressman. We can and do make a difference when we unite and stand up with each other. If there were a set date that things were going to turn to shit we would shout it from the rooftops. We would plaster it on every billboard. You wouldn&#39;t be able to turn on the news or radio and not hear about the date.  I&#39;m not quite convinced that leaving is much better. Head on over to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> for a while and check on what&#39;s going on in the world. </p>

<p>If or when you do leave you give us one less voice to fight with and one less leader of a younger generation. You are young, you are informed, and you are curious. Never underestimate the power that being informed and being young can give you. Get your friends involved. Ask your parents for ways in which you can get involved. Have your parents take you to a protest. Learn about the world and be curious and informed about what&#39;s going on around you. Teach your friends and teach your classmates what you&#39;ve learned. Become passionate and help be a voice that gets us out of this mess rather than being part of the problem that leaves us to sit and deal with it. The younger generation have more power than they think especially when they are creative and use their voice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I agree with a lot of what people are saying here. But, how in the world can you say that we live in a calm moment in history? The world is on fire right now, more so than it has been in a very long time. The winds of revolution are sweeping across almost every nation. Regimes are being torn down, leaders being killed, radicalism spreading through the lands. The world is in sky rocketing debt, the IMF is telling the FED to &quot;pop the bubble&quot;. Food prices are going up, the money in the middle class is drying up, gas prices are slowly rising because of the shit ISIS is pulling over in the middle east (plus other factors). </p>

<p>All it would take for us to collapse, and it could happen over night, is for gas prices to shoot up to $130+ a barrel. The entire economy would come crashing down. Ukraine is fighting a civil war right on Russia&#39;s doorstep, because the west wants that precious pipelines. Syria is/has been in a civil war for the last 2 years, that our president was hell bent on getting involved with, but was faced with public opposition. Because that would draw in major players into a war and the public is tired of being at war. Russia and China are in the process of dumping the dollar along with the other BRIC nations. If they are successful and bring in other nations in an agreement to drop the petro dollar, then we collapse. Not to mention all the shit happening inside our own country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world always has terrible stuff happening. Look at 20-30 years ago after the USSR fell. Huge instability in europe and tons of wars. Chechnya Yugoslavia etc.  same time period and a bit later you had Somalia and Uganda/Rwanda. Look back 50-60 years you have a literal world war.  Before that you have WW1 and imperialism in Africa and Asia and many small and big wars breaking out. 1800s Europe is on fire the US goes into a Civil War more imperialism. And keep going and you see the same things. </p>

<p>Compared to a lot of this Ukraine isnt that big a deal.  Syria is big but nothing unheard of by any means. Israel has always been fighting in the middle east (7 days war etc) Hamas attacks arent new. South america and India/China are going through growing pains. Iraq and Afghanistan are big conflicts but not even close to the scale of previous wars. </p>

<p>Yes there is violence and instability but doesnt seem anywhere near levels even 30 years ago. We are just more aware since it is now and we are constantly hearing about it. </p>
