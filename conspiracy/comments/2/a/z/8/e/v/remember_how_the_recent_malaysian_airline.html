       Remember how the recent Malaysian Airline COMPLETELY disappeared in very suspicious circumstances and people openly speculated it was a setup for a future disinformation campaign where they might need to double an airline?
      </p>
      <p>
       People even said one of the most likely areas for a disinformation campaign was Ukraine where they were trying to justify gas and oil sanctions against Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well here we have a Malaysian airline plane going down right where they said it would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       exact same type of plane too.

       Here is what you are proposing.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "The West" disappears a Malaysian airlines plane allegedly full of people creating an international media event.
       </li>
       <li>
        The take that same plane and use it as a prop to fake a "shoot down" by the Russians.
       </li>
       <li>
        Malaysian airlines is in on the ruse because they themselves are claiming to have lost a plane over Ukraine.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So if the Malaysians are on board and "pretending" that the shot down plane is theirs...why did we need to disappear the first plane? Why is the dummy needed?

       Who says the Malaysians are in on it? They dont need to know whats going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just funny the way this situation is turning out. MH370 disappears, some evidence that MH370 is in Tel Aviv. Many people also said that it landed at Diego Garcia (U.S. military base in the Indian ocean)
      </p>
      <p>
       This event happened in the middle of a major military offensive between Russia and the Ukraine. The plane story took the conflict out of the news pretty effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Israel and Gaza and duking it out and a flight from the same airlines and the same plane model is shot down over Ukraine. This happens when the Israel/Hammas cease fire breaks, effectively takes it out of the news.

       Its just fishey to me.

      <p>
       The Malaysians
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be in on it. They know all the planes of theirs that are in the air. If a dummy plane is used then they'll obviously think "hey that's not one of ours, they are all accounted for" - then they either play dumb (are complicit) or state that it isn't them - which casts doubt on the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative is that the Malaysians are fully in on it and have concocted a fake flight (with the dummy plane) which was subsequently crashed. Of course that raises
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       problems because people at the port of departure will wonder where that plane was (or why it was empty).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day use of a dummy plane makes basically 0 sense (especially if you consider that they have already dispatched of one plane load of passengers).

       Sure, but the story being presented doesn't just defy evidence - it defies logic. The people running this operation would have to be morons to have gone this route because its vastly more complicated with 0 benefit.

       Yes but EVERYONE knows that Israel is laying down ground troops. It's the second highest billed news story on all the British msm that I've watched this evening (BBC, C4), in terms of airtime both issues were given pretty equal coverage.

       I don't know if the term for what is going on in Gaza w Israel is "duking it out." That implies a fight between near equals. Perhaps David vs. Goliath is a better analogy, one of the world's most powerful militaries killing kids throwing rocks. Or maybe

       Malaysian Airlines are claiming they have lost two planes this year (MH370, MH17). In your scenario they have only lost one, twice.

       Either Malaysian Airlines are in on it or they really lost two.

       Why would they do that? Steal a plane (pretty incredible thing to pull off), get rid of all the passengers, have a big media outlash about the disappearing plane, then fly it to netherlands, pose said plane as another plane, have people boarding it, have pilots willing to sacrifice themselfs, make sure it's direction is over ukraine, then shoot it down..... Why would they do that? When they could just shoot down any commercial airplane.

       at least that was the plan in operation northwoods.

      <p>
       of course if you don't care about the civilians you shoot down a full one .

       or you fill it with dead bodies which aren't hard to get so you have bodiess on the ground.

       So where are the civillians of the missing flight? And where are the civillians that were on the flight that got shot down ealier? Or are you saying that all the relatives and friends of the missing and dead people are in on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you conspiracy theorists even think before making a connection between the two flights? It's sad really. "Oh there is something remotely connected, i'm going to make a post about it!"

       Whats wrong with posting things that are remotely connected? Yeah maybe it is nothing, but maybe it's something. What harm does it do by posting and sharing ideas or thoughts? If it bothers you then don't look at post in conspiracy threads. Not all conspiracies are true but sometimes they are, and if people don't discuss them then they will never be uncovered.

       You are right, i shouldn't have visited this subreddit but it's too funny to read here. However, if i was a conspiracy theorist it would bother me even more that there are so many nutjobs coming up with the most insane "theories" because it makes the whole community look bad. It's like a few terrorists make muslims look bad or a few loud, angry and stupid feminists devalue the whole feminism movement.

       There is absolutely nothing wrong with questioning something.  In fact, you want things to be questioned.  So the OP had a few theories in his head and it may have not been thought out thoroughly.

      <p>
       Its not a big fucking deal, calm the fuck down.
      </p>

       So the theory gets discussed, and more info comes from it, and can get backed up or dismissed.  Why are you so bothered by it?  And if it bothers you so, why even come in here???

       Because you guys never get to the "or dismissed" part. You guys come up with an idea of what really happened, without doing any research. Then you start your research and dismiss any evidence that goes against your preconceived idea.

       Dude, they are theories!!! Not matters of fact.  That's what a lot of communities are for.  To discuss topics, ideas, theories.  Are you new to the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, its important to have these discussions and be able to outright clear them, or have even more questions raised.  As you well know, there have be theories that have been proven correct.  If it bothers you so much that you have to troll a conspiracy theory, move on to somewhere else.  I for one welcome opposing ideas and those with better and insightful information, but if you're going to do it the way you do it, its just antagonistic and trollish.   There's no need to be an asshole about it.

       Not trolling, it was a conspiracy theory when it was going on. Some guy tracked the tail number to an airport in Israel where it was being stored.

       It would be nice to see a "called it" reference. and, I assumed there was more substance to the claim beyond reddit dialogue. Given there are two citations in the op, I would have liked to see a citation for what "people said". Who are these people, when and where did they say it? I didn't really think it was too much to ask for, but apparently wanting to have validity to the claim is too much for r/conspiracy.

       There was lots of conjecture, especially early on, that MHL370 had been hijacked to Diego Garcia or somewhere to be used in a future plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's irrelevant to this incidence since the plane shot down (or crashed) left Amsterdam and didn't just magically appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone hijacked a 777, they aren't going to blow it up in the air and crash it in a field, even if the result is stronger sanctions against Russia. It's much easier to just shoot a real one down, as likely happened.

       America would not team up w/Ukraine and send troops or even the airforce. Of course they'll (the current people occupying the seats of power in government) will invest in the war and manipulate things however they can. Naturally people will die in war, which works perfectly as an ingrown distraction to the whole thing.

        It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.
An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.
Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will begin transmitting on the international distress frequency a "MAY DAY" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio[14] stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the United States what has happened to the aircraft instead of the United States trying to "sell" the incident.

       You know what's funny? I never, ever come to this subreddit but immediately said out loud that this could have been an elaborate distraction by Israel. I'm also not even anti Israel. I typically don't get into the whole conspiracy shuffle but this just might have done it for me. What the fuck is going on?

       I just thought he might appreciate it, I enjoyed it when I read it a few months ago. If it has watered down the discussion and somehow single handedly stopped the truth from coming out, then the whole world has my apologies and may I be reincarnated as a worm.

       sorry, but like I said, linking threads by fuckheads clearly meant to poison the well and continue the drivel intentionally just doesn't add to the thread imo.  But to each his own,...continue...it was just my 2 cents.
