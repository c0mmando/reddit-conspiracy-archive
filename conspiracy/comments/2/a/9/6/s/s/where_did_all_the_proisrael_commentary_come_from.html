       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       would of course comment on anything to do with the conflict, and usually got told to fuck off. All of a sudden everyone is supporting Israel and saying that Hamas is evil for putting kids on the roofs (And downvoting anyone who asks why the fuck Israel blew said kids away)?
      </p>

       Did I miss something or has everyone turned anti-Palestine?

       I agree the mood has changed massively over the last 7 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly enough I think that (in general) quieter subs are much more moderate than the defaults that get targeted by (?).
      </p>
      <p>
       F'rinstance I actually lurk
       <a href="/r/israel">
        /r/israel

       lots (
       <a href="/r/palestine">
        /r/palestine
       </a>
       too) and in general - although things are obviously a bit tense now - zachof..., yamil... and rosinth.. etc. go down pretty badly there, moderates think they are dickheads too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vote manipulation on the big news subs does not correlate to anything except co-ordinated action, or an army of mindless redditors who really don't know fuck all but will click where the trends trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know one way or the other but both prospects are kind of depressing.

       *In the most serious single incident, seven Palestinians including two children were killed and about 25 wounded in an attack on a house in the Khan Younis area in south Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residents said the house belonged to the family of a Hamas member and the casualties occurred when the property came under attack for the second time.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the first strike people had gathered on the roof of the house as "human shields", hoping their presence would deter a second strike, the residents said. The Israeli military made no immediate comment about the incident.*

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Hamas sticking people on roofs, or are they standing in the way of fire to prevent further bombardment? And whether these "human shields" are defending their homes of their own accord, or by force, to dissuade the war crime of double-tapping a target, why is Israel striking their homes?

       How is double-tapping a target a war crime? This would seem like common practice. Attempt to obliterate target. Satellite shows building still standing so you hit it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying anything currently going on is right or wrong, but curious about how this would be a war crime.

       I don't make the rules, homie. The UN has described 'double-tap' strikes as war crimes. You're hitting family, first responders and non-combatants.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even described as a terrorist tactic by the FBI.

       Weird. Maybe within a particular timeframe. I know in WWII we bombed the same places over and over. Vietnam as well. But makes sense to not target first responders.

       You do realize that Israel's enemies use this tactic quite often right? Fire a bunch of shit from a civilian area and act all surprised and outraged when Israel retaliates screaming "Oh israel is so evil, look what they did!"

       It was kind of lame man, there are far better arguments than looking at a picture of Tel Aviv and a picture of shittiest Detroit and saying Murica funded this!

       Israel obviously has it's own industry, and economy.

       I know it is quite dangerous to openly criticize Israel. Last time I did, out loud, these people went after me and digged up dirt about me. That was very very bad and cost me a lot of money and caused a major meltdown in my personal life.

       mind control is the answer. there's a reason wilhelm reich's books were burned by the ton by US gov, he was right, 98% of humanity are psychologically diseased biological robots and war is one symptom. Young people are now acclimated to war, and a large amount of them fall for the same old fallacy of consensus. they still have not learned from nazi germany the real lesson which is that consensus of the ignorant is meaningless

       Please stop saying this. You take away all credibility from yourself (and this sub) when you claim something that is overwhelmingly supported by hard, scientific data is just a large conspiracy. About 99% of scientists agree on the topic, so unless you're claiming that 99% of a very well-educated and critically thinking population are all wrong, you're clearly mistaken.

       money and career paths motivate these people just like it does the wage slave factory workers.

       What you said does apply to some people but "scientists" as a whole don't make a ton of money. Outside of doctors (and only certain specialties at that), dentists, etc. their average salaries aren't what you're thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we exclude the healthcare professions you're envisioning, a vast vast majority of non-medical doctors agree with my stance. I don't have a statistic that excludes "people who make a lot of money" but I'm pretty confident that most educated scientists agree with the current theory of climate change solely because that's where the evidence has led us.

       Bullshit. Have you forgotten how suicidal oppressed people can be? Women and children regularly volunteer for suicide bombing missions. In fact, women are many times more likely to use a suicide bombing as an assassination attempt than men, who blow themselves up less strategically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Israel isn't suicide bombing Palestine is that they have way more options available to them, thanks to Western funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human shields argument doesn't hold up when Israel appears happy to shoot and bomb human shields.
