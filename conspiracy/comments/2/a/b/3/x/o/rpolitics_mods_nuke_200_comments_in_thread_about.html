       censorship is alive and well on Reddit. I'm not even sure if most of the top mods on the main default subs are the original creators of the accounts anymore. There have been posts in the past about people offering money to buy accounts, i wouldn't be surprised if some of those mods got bought out.

        What's this in your inbox? A screenshot of literally the entire moderation log of the entire subreddit, showing zero actions whatsoever -- aside from the time I global-banned a troll account? Amazing!

       You are one of the most controversial power users on Reddit you put yourself in that position no one else did.  If you can't handle that than stop for a while you seem very worked up over things kids, trolls, and assholes said about you on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point more eyes have been on you than some of the most controversial famous people in real life. You think they really care what someone says behind their back on the internet? you think they go on internet forums and refute every bad thing anyone has ever said about them? that's how people go off the deep end sometimes you just have to let shit go. Get yourself some help, take things a little less seriously and who gives a fuck what people think about you. Don't let them affect you that's all they wanted to do in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. This is coming from someone who downvoted a controversial comment you made on his 4 year old account and got shadowbanned for vote brigading even though i have never participated in one or have ever followed a link and voted.

       You need to go see a psychiatrist, you cant seem to handle what people say about your username not your real life name not your first middle and last name but your internet handle. you have to develop thick skin you aren't just born with it. No one here is doxxing you and your freaking out, you need to talk to a third party to gain some perspective on what your freaking out about.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's real life celebrities out there that get death threats all the time and the person making the threat has their full name address and even schedules and they can handle it none of them go through forums to see what some dickhead says about their latest movie and refute them all line by line because it makes for an unstable person. You've written a wall of text to refute what some dicks posted about you on the internet just let that shit go no ones coming after you or anything as much as they want you to think so.

       We've been over this, I used the place as a qualifier that there have been offers to "purchase accounts", the subreddits existence should be enough to bolster that point. It really doesn't matter if the place has been used.

       Hold on now, I don't think this classifies as hatred, do you not moderate the subreddit? Does it not exist? If you view anyone talking about you as hatred, I recommend you don't get caught in these situations.

       We're a subreddit of nearly 300k users. You moderate quite a few popular and "just shill things" like subreddits. You're bound to have people talking shit about you bro. But nobody is dehumanizing you, that's a bit much.

       That is a mystery. Not exactly "thousands upon thousands of comments in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       dehumanizing him" but he's more than a little bit the drama queen.

      <p>
       Seems he's totally derailed, actually. I love how factual statements you said about him modding a sub are considered by him to be hate-speech and lies demonizing him somehow. Such the victim. How dare you objectively calmly state something true about him.

        censorship is alive and well on Reddit. I'm not even sure if most of the top mods on the main default subs are the original creators of the accounts anymore.
        <em>
         There have been posts in the past about people offering money to buy accounts, i wouldn't be surprised if some of those mods got bought out.

       I made no extra claims other than that the place exists, and that I find it suspicious. I didn't even implicate you until another user pointed out you mod it.

       If you don't want people pointing out the things you do that are obviously shady as fuck, then don't do them. And if my words were truly worthless, would you be here, contesting to their worth?

       You mean you're not right there on the moderator list? You mean the list of mod actions you showed me wasn't of your, let alone the only involvement in the sub? Never thought about it that way.

       Hypocrite with a victim complex. You mention he mods a weird subreddit and you're "spewing pure hatred." He lashes out at people calling them fucking retards, "fuck you prick," etc, it's not worth mentioning. He does no wrong and certainly his actual behavior couldn't be the root cause of why he's widely disliked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's hope this mod seeks out the mental help he so obviously needs, stops lying, and stops lashing out at others for noticing his antisocial behavior and daring to shed light on it.
