    <div class="md"><p>Super angry liberal-type obsessively fixated on guns to the point of possible derangement is what I see. Seems too frothingly angry to be paid. Shills seem to resort to ad hominems quicker, too. I probably look like that to some people when I comment about seratonin-syndrome-induced homicides (without the liberal/conservative part, because as far as I&#39;m concerned, they can all go jump).</p>

<p>Edit: Wait, looked at the more recent comments from a few minutes ago - that commenter has gone full loonytunes. I take back the ad hominem stuff, you&#39;re right, a textbook frother (to be fair, I have IRL friends who are textbook frothers and not technically shills, they are not straight paid but do work for media which is heavily subsidized by groups like our favorite Gates Foundation). Quick, ask it about vaccines and GMOs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter what I believe.  That is what the FBI, Homeland Defense and pretty much anyone who has studied the problem has concluded.  All I am doing is posting the studies and point out the reality.  </p>

<p>Today we had another near attack.  A right wing terrorist wanted to bomb a police department to &quot;provoke a general uprising against the government&quot;.  We just had another attack in Canada a few weeks ago with another gun advocate going through the streets of Moncton killing police officers.  The other week was a gun advocate shooting up a court house.  </p>

<p>Gun advocates are the same as Islamic Extremists from where I am sitting.  Both are far right movements, both have strong religious elements. Both are intollerant of ideological impurity and both have elements that use violence to forward their goals.  Not all Islamic Extremists are involved in Jihad any more than all gun advocates are members of militias.  That doesn&#39;t mean either aren&#39;t supporters of terrorists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Studied what problem exactly? There is no problem. There is no violent right wing uprising. In fact most mass shootings are done by liberals if you want to play the left/right game.</p>

<p>Your average gun advocate merely wants their constitutional right to bear arms to not be taken away. The U.S. government has gone absolutely nuts with power so it makes more sense now than ever to resist the government attempting to strip your rights.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it it&#39;s a simple case of slander. There&#39;s a very obvious agenda from the left, and the U.S. government, to enforce gun control. Their solution is to demonize gun owners and paint them as terrorists. If you can&#39;t see this by now you&#39;re either willfully ignorant or are indeed a shill as OP suggests.</p>

<p>sorry, but nope.  </p>

<p>There is West Point&#39;s view on the matter.  Page 142 I believe shows the numbers of attacks.  There are a lot of them.  </p>

<p><a href="http://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf">http://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf</a>  </p>

<p>There is the department of homeland defense.  </p>

<p>Salon article talking about the problem with numbers of deaths and attack in the last 15 years:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/06/11/why_cnn_is_so_afraid_of_admitting_that_americas_terror_attacks_are_right_wing_partner/">http://www.salon.com/2014/06/11/why_cnn_is_so_afraid_of_admitting_that_americas_terror_attacks_are_right_wing_partner/</a>  </p>

<p>Right wing terrorism has grown massively.  If you look on page 94 of the West point report you will see that when gun control is enacted, acts of right wing terrorism increase.  </p>

<p>Those are the facts, but then again... Reality has a well known liberal bias.  You really need to take the tin foil off for a bit.   </p>

<p><a href="http://zapatopi.net/afdb/">http://zapatopi.net/afdb/</a> </p>

<p>Looks like you can use one of these.  West Point is one of the most highly respected military colleges in the US.  You can&#39;t get much better sources than West Point and the Department of Homeland Defense.  Interesting how you nutters think the government is out to get you.  You will find that is one of the identifiers listed in both the West Point and Homeland Defense reports for likely terrorists.  So, in reality, you are probably right.  They ARE out to get you.  Better run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the reliability of the source none of your links have provided any useful information. None mention the amount of mass shootings by liberals vs conservatives. One of them is talking primarily about far right wing extremist groups such as the KKK. Comparing gun advocates to the KKK or similar groups is just flat out misinformation and to be honest it&#39;s borderline retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh dude.  seriously.  He went off on like 20 posts accusing me of being everything from CIA to NSA to the FBI.  It was really humorous.  </p>

<p>There are lots of different things in my post history.  Days I am happy, days I am sad.  Days where I feel like trolling and days when I feel like taking and issue and advocating for it.  There are FAR more &quot;angry&quot; posts days in there if you look closely enough.  Pretty consistent if you really want to know.  Pro-immigration, anti police limited immunity, believer in legalization and pro gun control.  This really isn&#39;t a surprise to anyone but you people.  I am also well known as an EVE player who likes to troll people at times.  </p>

<p>Again, none of this is going to surprise anyone or somehow &quot;expose&quot; me.  My post history is public and I don&#39;t delete comments (with the exception of miss posts).  I am what you see in front of you.  Check out Reddit Investigator if you wish to know more.  Here, I will even give you a link:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.redditinvestigator.com/">http://www.redditinvestigator.com/</a>  </p>

<p>Today just happened to be a day when I was in a bad mood, wanted to advocate and ended up getting into a fight with some mods so went to prove my point.  Such is the way of Reddit.  </p>

<p>Having this dude post this has gone a long way towards making my bad mood go away however.  Such tears are a rare vintage only equaled by death threats over blown up imaginary internet spaceships (yes, this does happen).  Generally angry nutters will get into a flame thread with you, but they don&#39;t go to such lengths to express their impotent rage as this guy.  It is very heartening to see.  I am serious, he made my day.</p>
