        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The letter in full:</p>

<p>A note from Roger - July 11, 2014 July 11, 2014 at 5:47am &quot;Enough is enough&quot;. In January this year I wrote a private letter to Neil Young, it was sent via his manager Elliot Roberts&#39; email, I never received a reply of any kind.</p>

<p>More recently I spoke openly about The Rolling Stones performing in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>In light of the appalling recent events in Israel and Gaza and my dismay at the the lack of any response from our governments and in a final appeal to Neil&#39;s possible attachment to the rights of all human beings, not just the disenfranchised natives of North America, but all human beings all over the world, I am publishing that letter now. Here it Is.</p>

<p>Dear Neil Young.</p>

<p>There are rumors flying about that you are considering doing shows in Tel Aviv this year.</p>

<p>The picket lines have been crossed in this last year by one or two lightweights from our community but no one of your stature. Woody Guthrie would turn in his grave. Neil Young! You are one of my biggest heroes, you are one of a very short list, you, John Lennon, Woody Guthrie, Huddy Ledbetter, Harry Belafonte, Sam Cooke, Billie Holiday and, like some others, but not many, your songs have always been redolent of love and humanity and compassion for your fellow man and woman. I find it hard to believe that you would turn your back on the indigenous people of Palestine. That you would lend support to, and encourage and legitimize, with your presence, a colonial apartheid regime, largely settled from Europe, that seeks to confine the native people of the land, either in exile or in second class status in reservations and ghettos.</p>

<p>Please, brother, tell me it ain&#39;t so.</p>

<p>As I recall, back in the day, along with the rest of us (Stevie van Zandt, Bruce, Led Zep etc etc etc etc) you would not &quot;Play In Sun City&quot; I am asking you to stand on the same moral ground now. The late, great, Nelson Mandela lives on in us, we cannot let him down. He was explicit in his position and I quote, &quot; We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians&quot;. It is time for &quot;Rock Against Racism&quot; to show some of it&#39;s muscle by refusing to lend our names to the whitewashing of the illegal colonization of Palestinian land and the systematic oppression of its indigenous people. Unfortunately the opposition lobby has a lot of muscle too. They spend millions on their &quot;Hasbara&quot;(If like me you have no Hebrew)”Explaining” or to you and me &quot;Propaganda&quot;. The propaganda machine is well oiled and ruthless. We, on the other hand, have only our commitment to non-violent resistance to lie down in front of the IDF caterpillar tractors that would raze the native people from the land of Palestine. We stand with those people, and with all the brave people of Israel and Palestine, Jewish and Arab alike who oppose The Israeli Governments brutal policies. We stand with Rachel Corrie, the young American woman who gave her life under the caterpillar&#39;s tracks. Please join me and countless other artists all over the world in solidarity with the oppressed and the disenfranchised. It is time to heed the peoples call. People like The Bedouin, the nomadic people of the Negev in the arid south of Israel, please research their plight, one village, Al-Araqib has been destroyed 63 times by IDF Bulldozers. If you are in doubt about any of this, I will go with you to Palestine, and Israel, if they’ll let me in, you will see what I have seen, and then let us figure out the right thing to do.</p>

<p>By the way I watched your Bridge School concert on YouTube last year, it was very moving, you were, of course magnificent. You had asked me to perform, and as I explained to your management, I would have gladly done so had I not already been committed to The Wall Tour in Europe and Stand Up For Heroes in New York. This year I will be pleased and proud to come and support you if you call.</p>

<p>With respect, and love.</p>

<p>Roger Waters.</p>

<p>PS. Fyi. Nice Christmas present.</p>

<p>Bedouin Village Demolished For 63rd Time Thursday December 26, 2013 18:18 by Chris Carlson - 1 of International Middle East Media Center Editorial Group</p>

<p>For the 63rd time, Israeli forces have demolished the Bedouin village of al-Araqib, in the Negev, Thursday morning.</p>

<p>A Ma’an reporter in Beersheba said that bulldozers, escorted by 25 police patrols, raided the village at 9 a.m. and demolished all of its steel houses.</p>

<p>“Forces of demolition and destruction raided our village in the morning and demolished our houses, for the 63rd time. This is a barbarian assault, as they left residents homeless during wintry weather,” local resident Aziz Sayyah al-Touri told Ma’an. He highlighted that the assault has come following the Israeli annoncement to abandon the Prawer Plan in displacing Negev Bedouins. Bedouins claim the are as their ancestral lands, while Israel considers al-Araqib and all Bedouin villages in the Negev illegal. There are about 260,000 Bedouin in Israel, mostly living in and around the Negev, in the arid south. More than half live in unrecognized villages without utilities, with many living in extreme poverty.</p>

<p>PPS Google “Prawer plan” and follow a few links, you may catch a glimpse of the tip of an extremely large and terrifying iceburg.</p>

<p>Neil, we’re talking about the occupation, subjugation, dispossession, eviction, ghettoization and possible eventual eradication of a nation.</p>

<p>You, more than most should find this, taboo, story, more than a little disquieting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also remember in the debate over Israel and Palestine that we are ultimately talking about peoples lives. People like us and people like you. People who worry about family members and jobs and food. The media has lost its ability to be empathic in its quest to be objective.<br/>
Neil believes in love and humanity. He understands the actions of government don&#39;t necessarily reflect that of its citizens (imagine if they did!)  Let&#39;s all try to remember that we are all the same in the end, separated by circumstance, divided by mutual fear but capable of loving one another. Neil sees that. I don&#39;t agree with his decision to play there, but i respect it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roger Waters explained Israel&#39;s criminal behavior better than I ever could have!</p>

<p>But then again, we ARE speaking of the chap who wrote The Final Cut...one of the most magnificent compositions ever put to vinyl. Nothing captures England and the populace&#39;s frustration over the Thatcher policies better. It&#39;s a glorious, monumental, moving, and sad musical snapshot of nearly a whole generation...hell, an entire nation.</p>

<p>Cheers Roger. Keep fighting the good fight against terrorism, brutal mass killings, and basically finally making what was <em>said</em> the Nazis did come to their terrible light.</p>

<p>The world, Jews like myself and Gentiles alike, are finally seeing the truth of Israel&#39;s brutal decades-long actions. About time, eh?</p>

He was also embroiled in a long dispute with his record company around that period, and the album that this is from may be a reflection of that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re mistaken I&#39;m afraid. You yourself use the term &quot;legendary&quot; which makes me think that you&#39;re basing your opinion on a number of other factors surrounding the music scene at the height of Neil Youngs career. If you care to read his official biography or his autobiography you would know that although he admits to having uses drugs in the past, he never really enjoyed their use and he fell out of using them long ago. His nickname &quot;Shakey&quot; comes from epileptic like seizures he would have on stage and while using narcotics, another reason he did not over indulge their use.<br/>
You never provided your source for his rampant drug use, did you ever find it or did you misinterpret the connection between Neil Young and the sixties to mean that everybody was out of their mind on drugs at the time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get it, The Jews occupied that land thousands of years ago, were enslaved and moved out only to fight their way back in, that land has been switching hands between the jews and their neighbors for centuries. What makes any of you think the palestinians have any more right to it then the jews? Let them fight it out, what business is it of ours to intervene? Speaking for the U.S we have enough problems here to worry about and deal with, you want something to protest? how about our own fucking government? Congress? NSA?  I can keep going..how about our starving kids? our poverty stricken? how about that Drought situation we have been facing in the southwest? people and whole towns are running out of water and have run out of water..and all you people want to do is get on reddit and bitch about fucking NEIL YOUNG? seriously? </p>

They have almost no history there besides around one or two generations. While on the other hand, the Jews have been worshipping, trading and settling there for thousands of years. It seems you have been influenced by what&#39;s called Pallywood. That is the systematic lying of these terrorists through electronic media which, unfortunately, molds the opinions of many a people worldwide. A good example is how ISIS is curently proving their expertise in this regard. What government continues to provide electricity to their foe while on a campaign to end their indiscriminate bombing of civilians? What other Government in history calls the homes that are occupied by terrorists and their familes, being used to shoot rockets, and WARN them to leave before bombing the house? All the while the Palestinian gov&#39;t is telling them to stay in their homes after being warned to leave, in order &quot;to protect their weapons cache&quot; while really seeking casualties to flaunt to the media. C&#39;mon learn something, like Neil apparently has, and get your information from sources other than Reddit. Keep in mind, Israel is mentioned in the Torah hundreds of times as the land of the Jews, in contrast, it is not mentioned once in the Koran. It should be noted, a little bit before the time that the Brits handed over the country to Israel in 1947, before the end of WW2, the leader of the Palestinians invited Hitler there, praised him for what he was doing and said that after he eradicates the Jews of Europe, that he will then help to do it in the Mideast. Some would argue that such a leader, chosen by his like minded followers, deserves to be taken down and driven out of his land -- although that&#39;s not what happened. Fact is, Palestinians simply did not want to live alongside their new European Jewish neighbors and just left. It&#39;s true that the Israelis weren&#39;t exactly friendly but they were never forced out of their homes. It&#39;s very annoying for an educated American Jew like myself to see just how many of his countrymen are ill-informed about the conflict.

<p>Think of the tone, pacing, lack of formatting, reliance on emotional manipulation and historical myopia; he thinks the Tanakh is the Torah and considers it as a secular and unbiased document of history. All of these things make me believe this is either a youngster who believes the bull he&#39;s been peddled or a paid shill who&#39;s being paid to type what he&#39;s told to type. In either case it&#39;s hard to take seriously anything he says other than isolated words like &#39;the&#39; and &#39;to.&#39;</p>

<p>That is a gross underestimation of the time line. Even going back to the Balfour Declaration is at least 3 generations. Then you have the fact that Palestine is one of the oldest human settlements, and being &quot;Palestinian&quot; means being of the land called &quot;Palestine&quot;, so they&#39;ve been there for quite some time. And to call somebody to tell them you are going to bomb them is  tactic used by many countries and terrorist groups. It doesn&#39;t justify the killing of human beings. I could&#39;ve sworn there was something in the Torah that mentioned killing...can you refresh my memory?</p>

<p>Please give a quote to the above bullshit. AFAIK Hitler died in a bunker in WWII in 1945. Prior to that he was in a war and before the war he was yet to be a villain. So can I have a source. </p>

<p>No. Israel are not European as much as they try to be and try to force their way in. Palestinians have been living with Jews for thousands of years, even when the christian crusades came and slaughtered muslims &amp; jews. </p>

<p>As for Husseini, i can absolutely understand why he aligned himself with Hitler.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, deny that the relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons,[125] on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs,&#39;the enemy of your enemy is your friend&#39;.</p>

<p>The leaders of your motherland are murderers, and you can voice their support as much as you want or as little as you want. It won&#39;t change the fact you are defending thieves and murderers who will not hestitate to do the same to you and your family if you cross them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is a Zionist state.
The UK used to have control over Palestine (probably as a Common Wealth country).
The Oligarchs told the UK that they will send in the US to join WWII if the UK guaranteed Palestinian land to the Zionists, and they did.</p>

<p>Do you honestly expect the Palestinians to roll over and die or just leave the land that was rightfully theirs? Israel steels Palestinian land, demolishes their homes, burn their olive trees, kill and imprison their family and friends, destroys their critical faculties, starves them, dehumanizes them, laughs at them, and drops bombs on them often.
Yet Palestines are considered &quot;terrorists&quot; because they fired a sub-par rocket back and all most never kills anyone, then Israel retaliates like a child to collectively bomb Palestinian society (most are innocent civilians) for the crimes of a few (a war crime).</p>

<p>How would Israel have more of a right to Palestinian land than Palestinians do? Don&#39;t give me some superstitious dogma reason either.</p>

<p>Would it be OK for British people of Anglo-Saxon descent (ethnic Brits) to go and violently reclaim Germany?</p>

<p>Also, Zionism has only been around for about a century and is a racist and genocidal ideology. </p>

<p>Palestine has no army, no navy, no air force, and no military. The &quot;war&quot; between Israel and Palestine is hardly a war at all, it&#39;s murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Difficult to say…Neil was very pro-Reagan at the time, and supposedly, he was in one of his “quit smoking weed” phases, which seem to come and go. He was also embroiled in a long dispute with his record company around that period, and the album that this is from may be a reflection of that...</p>
