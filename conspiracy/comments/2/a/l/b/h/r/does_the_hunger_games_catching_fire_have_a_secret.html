       I recently went to see the new planet of the apes movie and there was a preview that was too random and out of place to just be there coincidentally. It was an add for the hunger games apparently but after it was over it had the entire theater saying "what the fuck was that?". It was of the main character (dude) standing next to an old white man, the man exclaims something like "be prepared for a new world order, but know if you go against the system you will suffer" or somethig along those lines. It just made me and my friends literally say wtf. What are your thoughts

       media messages have become not so secret. I'll try to pull a screencap, but during the preview for season 7 of True Blood there is a shot of chalk on the ground that reads "FEMA save us" for a split second. They want it in our subconscious that fema will actually protect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: found it. Says "fema help us" not save us. same thing. check it

       Maybe paid placement to counteract their bad PR, especially after Katrina - plenty of "Thanks for nothing, FEMA" signs to go 'round back then.

       Was joking, actually...although this isn't uncommon in Hollywood - remember when every sitcom had a jibe about universal health insurance? And that season where a slew of primetime shows had people on kidney dialysis in 2007 or so? And then all the Ambien-making-people-crazy storylines last year? I've stopped watching primetime TV, but every season, there's some ideas getting pay-for-play and not just by Nokia; people accused me of reading too much into things until, et voila, we finally get some actual reporting on the phenomenon:
       <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/valerie-jarrett-hollywood-get-obamacare-movie-tv-scripts_786176.html">
        http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/valerie-jarrett-hollywood-get-obamacare-movie-tv-scripts_786176.html
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, during Katrina, there were loads of those signs around - first "FEMA help us!" then "FEMA, thanks for nothing" or long diatribes spraypainted on cardboard about how FEMA screwed people. Probably some after Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters, too, but I don't have experience with those. Hollywood can attempt put it in our minds that FEMA will protect us, but there have been so many natural disasters and so many people have dealt with the inept bureaucracy and corruption firsthand that my money's on the subliminal stuff getting handily drowned by real-life experience.

       It's not Catching Fire, it's the third one (Mockingjay, I think). And the series is very much anti-NWO; the heroes are the people fighting against the oppressive regime. The old man saying that stuff is the 'villain' in the series.

       No, it's Catching Fire, they split it into two movies. Also, the government in the story isn't a new world order. The rebels in District 13 are.

       How is it Catching Fire? CF (the movie) ended right when CF (the book) did. This next movie is clearly Mockingjay.

       My bad, I was stoned. They're separating the third movie. And do you not remember how the D13 used Katniss to help bring themselves into power? And you never explained how my comparisons were wrong, you just made a list of not completely true things.

       I think you should re-read the books. It's not the "NWO" if it's a group of rebels overthrowing the oppressive government. Yes, Katniss feared that Coin would take advantage and try to become a harsh ruler too -- so she killer her. That's as anti-new world order as it gets.

       how are the rebels representing the NWO. I remember reading in the book that they planned on a democracy like that before the nation of Panem was made. for those of you who don't know, panem is set in North america(Pan-Am? get it?) they want an american democracy.

       And the book mockingjay is being split into 2 to money gouge audiences. I honestly think you are just a troll, but there are those out there that would believe you.

       It's just a comparison, people need to quit taking this so seriously. It's my damn opinion. Well they are the only ones left in the world essentially, and the rebels are taking the old world as a New World Order.

       Yow, sounds like they've moved far past "secret" messages. The first movie was pretty overt. I hate going to the movies now, because the messages are everywhere. Like, even that Simon Pegg movie about the middle-aged pub crawl, which would have otherwise been enjoyable if you could get past the total NWO bullshit (I tried, but unfortunately, I couldn't). Depressing!

       And I'm still gobsmacked by the books and movies we're feeding kids to consume. I remember when I was a teen and had to read Shirley Jackson and Steven King in secret, now Hunger Games is being pushed hard on the young'uns and moronic rape porn pap like 50 Shades of Gray is foisted on the adults and late teens.

       Maybe that's part of the plot of the book...
You guy's read way to far into things. It was an advertisement before a movie. Like the countless others. Did you have a problem with the preview for the one with the black guy who adopts a girl to further is campaign? How is that not a message of rising black power and abuse of media for political stance??

       No it is not. But is that the same as the hunger games? No it is not. There are a lot of claims to back up how it could be relative to a NWO

       If anything, Hunger Games is anti-NWO.  It's better explained in the books.  Panem already
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a new world order, a totalitarian society which grew up in North America after a destructive revolution.  Now it is facing another revolution, and yes, the revolutionaries do suffer for going up against it.  The "old white man" is the evil sick fuck who is the totalitarian leader.

       It is if you think about it. It's anti-government, and pro-NWO. District 1 = Government/Bad guys. District 13 = Rebels/NWO. Now some would say that they're simply rebels, but they're highly organized, have members at the highest level of government, are very secretive, and they take over when the government fails.

       I was simply making comparisons, and it goes a bit deeper than with the other stories you named. It's just a theory, nothing more than to keep myself amused. Quit taking things so seriously.

       The trailer for the
       <em>
        Catching Fire
       </em>
       movie has the world dictator sitting in a white chair, all dressed in white clothes, against a white background ... and he's a white man, with a white beard! Hmmmm, do you think there might be a social message "hidden" somewhere in there? The evil dictator who is suppressing all that is good and beautiful in the world is white, white, white, white, white, white .... naw, there couldn't be any social message there, could there now?

       Hollywood and TV are programming. They are programming the viewer. It is no secret though. Possible cultural intentions/suggestions are broadcast and the public has a choice to accept it or challenge it. Usually we accept it, because the vehicle of TV encourages a passive, stupid mindstate.
