It was an add for the hunger games apparently but after it was over it had the entire theater saying &quot;what the fuck was that?&quot;. It was of the main character (dude) standing next to an old white man, the man exclaims something like &quot;be prepared for a new world order, but know if you go against the system you will suffer&quot; or somethig along those lines. It just made me and my friends literally say wtf. What are your thoughts </p>

I&#39;ll try to pull a screencap, but during the preview for season 7 of True Blood there is a shot of chalk on the ground that reads &quot;FEMA save us&quot; for a split second.

    <div class="md"><p>Was joking, actually...although this isn&#39;t uncommon in Hollywood - remember when every sitcom had a jibe about universal health insurance? And that season where a slew of primetime shows had people on kidney dialysis in 2007 or so? And then all the Ambien-making-people-crazy storylines last year? I&#39;ve stopped watching primetime TV, but every season, there&#39;s some ideas getting pay-for-play and not just by Nokia; people accused me of reading too much into things until, et voila, we finally get some actual reporting on the phenomenon: <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/valerie-jarrett-hollywood-get-obamacare-movie-tv-scripts_786176.html">http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/valerie-jarrett-hollywood-get-obamacare-movie-tv-scripts_786176.html</a>.</p>

<p>But anyway, during Katrina, there were loads of those signs around - first &quot;FEMA help us!&quot; then &quot;FEMA, thanks for nothing&quot; or long diatribes spraypainted on cardboard about how FEMA screwed people. Probably some after Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters, too, but I don&#39;t have experience with those. Hollywood can attempt put it in our minds that FEMA will protect us, but there have been so many natural disasters and so many people have dealt with the inept bureaucracy and corruption firsthand that my money&#39;s on the subliminal stuff getting handily drowned by real-life experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yow, sounds like they&#39;ve moved far past &quot;secret&quot; messages. The first movie was pretty overt. I hate going to the movies now, because the messages are everywhere. Like, even that Simon Pegg movie about the middle-aged pub crawl, which would have otherwise been enjoyable if you could get past the total NWO bullshit (I tried, but unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t). Depressing! </p>

<p>And I&#39;m still gobsmacked by the books and movies we&#39;re feeding kids to consume. I remember when I was a teen and had to read Shirley Jackson and Steven King in secret, now Hunger Games is being pushed hard on the young&#39;uns and moronic rape porn pap like 50 Shades of Gray is foisted on the adults and late teens.</p>

You guy&#39;s read way to far into things. It was an advertisement before a movie. Like the countless others. Did you have a problem with the preview for the one with the black guy who adopts a girl to further is campaign? How is that not a message of rising black power and abuse of media for political stance??</p>
