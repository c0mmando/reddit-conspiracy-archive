        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>SCREENSHOT THIS BEFORE THE ADMINS DELETE IT</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="/r/Worldnews">/r/Worldnews</a> mods are <a href="http://rn.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/">destroying all user submitted posts about Israel</a> and openly only allowing &#39;balanced&#39; aka pro-Zionist posts to make it onto the front page. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Worldnews">/r/Worldnews</a> has six million subscribers and MORE TRAFFIC than CNN so this is a BIG FUCKING DEAL. Like Glenn Greenwald said it&#39;s censorship plain and simple.</p>

<p>So why isn&#39;t r/conspiracy discussing this? Earlier today there were TWO posts about this on the front page. Now there are NONE. Why isn&#39;t <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> covering censorship of this scale? Maybe because ONE OF THE WORLDNEWS MODS IS ALSO A MOD HERE</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna say who because the last user to point out the conflict of interest WAS BANNED FROM REDDIT but just look at the <a href="http://rn.reddit.com/r/worldnews/about/moderators">modlist</a> for <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/moderators">modlist</a> for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and you&#39;ll see who it is.</p>

<p>I fully expect to be banned for this post but it&#39;s important to get the truth out. This website gets more traffic than CNN so it&#39;s important that we discuss the blatant pro-Zionist censorship taking place here. It&#39;s disturbing that a censoring mod is also a mod here. This place is doomed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d very much like to find out more about what the OP is suggesting here, as I&#39;ve reviewed the modlog twice now and nothing has been removed surrounding the sticky topic; in fact at worldnews <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/ciwmrs6">we were actively encouraging feedback on the experiment as we wanted to figure out what users thought of it</a>...</p>

<p>My thoughts on the sticky are that it does counter some of the briagding that people were reporting to the modmail, but it also doesn&#39;t really allow stories to get coverage in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>That said I am pretty apathetic as to whether it should continue or not. if you have any feedback on the sticky idea by all means share it here and I can forward it along to the other mods at worldnews or you&#39;re welcome to message the worldnews modmail. </p>

<p>It&#39;s from this I take it OP is likely referring to <a href="/u/Jagula_Sector">/u/Jagula_Sector</a>.</p>

<p>He might have been referring to that I suppose, but that user was only shadowbanned for using alts to briagde that comment. Which, if I may say so, was an absolutely false string of accusations designed to do nothing but stir up drama in some strange attempt to teach me that the conspiracy userbase can be easily riled up by falsehoods against mods. There does seem to be some sort of conspiracy going on in that regard; and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if certain snoonet channels were behind it. </p>

<p>I understand that he&#39;s trying to implicate me, but he is either misinformed or being intentionally dishonest; as no submissions on the worldnews sticky have been removed and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/exk6BEU.png">there was even one sitting at number 23 on the front page when he made his submission</a>... </p>

<p>Precisely.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nor would I, since we&#39;ve seen the things that are shared on those IRCs it stands to reason that it&#39;s feasible. I just wonder if the Admins have looked into it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>either misinformed or being intentionally dishonest [...] there was even one sitting at number 23 on the front page when he made his submission</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why I&#39;m inclined to assume the latter,* as harsh as that may seem, I just can&#39;t believe they&#39;d miss it.</p>

<p>If they shared some insight in these comments I&#39;d have less reason for suspicion. But the account is <em>at least</em> a month old.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Wait a minute if the admins confirmed jagula was from an IRC that means it&#39;s pretty much <em>guaranteed</em> the &#39;r/edping crew&#39; followed him from the same place...</p>

<p>They have indeed and that&#39;s what earned jagula his shadowban from that first comment.</p>

<p>The issue here is that there is a group intent on using <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s &quot;paranoia&quot; (their words) to smear people they don&#39;t like. And that group is absolutely using irc to make posts just like this one in an attempt to discredit people who oppose them. </p>
