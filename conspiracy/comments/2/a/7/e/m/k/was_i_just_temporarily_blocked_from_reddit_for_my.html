       I asked one question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a professional broadcast engineer, one thing I have always wondered is how the first moon landing was televised live. What equipment did you use to transmit the video and audio back to earth? What power source was used to facilitate the TV transmission?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I also replied to a couple of comments with a link to Buzz punching Bart Sibrel in the face, as well as an assertion that it might not actually be Buzz Aldrin doing the AMA. A minute or so later, I was suddenly unable to connect to reddit with my web browser. I was still able to ping reddit.com, my wife was able to access reddit with my account from a different IP, and I was able to connect just fine using a proxy service.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 20 minutes later, I was suddenly able to get back on reddit. The strange thing is that I was able to ping reddit.com the entire time that I was receiving denial of service on my web browser. To me this says the web servers were specifically denying http service to my IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has never happened to me in all of my time using reddit, and it just happened to be while I was in the midst of speaking my mind in this high profile AMA session.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence or censorship?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: After receiving a link to wikipedia, I looked into what it had to say about the subject of the lunar TV transmission. While they provided plenty of technical specifications such as the radio band and modulation techniques, I have seen nothing to address where the ELECTRICAL POWER came from to push out this transmission. Has anybody else found and information on this subject?

       Looks like it was a 500 Khz signal which shouldnt eat too much power.

       A 500 khz signal uses however much power you need to achieve the desired decibel level, or db. In radio transmission, there is this thing called the noise floor. This is how much "noise" or interference the antenna is receiving on the frequency you are receiving on. In both digital and analog (would have been analog in the 1960's) you need to overcome this noise floor by a certain amount in order for the information carried in the transmission to be decipherable on the receiving end. You could generate a 500 khz signal with a 9 volt battery as the power source if you so desired, but it wouldn't give you a very strong db output. In this case the signal would probably be indecipherable after a very short distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satellite uplinks require significant electrical power in order to be received properly by the satellite. This is a much shorter distance than the distance from the moon to the earth. Another thing I have not seen any information on is what type of radio antenna was used to transmit this signal.

       What you will be pinging is probably the load balancer, not a Web server. Even then if you can ping it just means the computer is on the network. It doesn't mean the Web server is running.

       May have been connecting to a different server, weird shit like this can happen when hundreds of servers are trying to serve the same website, generally they would shadow ban you rather than doing something obvious.

       It could be you were "censored", at application level (Ie via some mod interface). I doubt it as banning by IP is very inneficient, as you probably noticed. I would assume bans are applied on usernames, whatever IP they are from.

       The webservers sits in back of load balancers, these would be up and responding to your pings while a web request would still be denied at the web server level.

       Well, with my understanding of video transmission technology, I don't believe that it would be possible to initiate a wireless video transmission without access to a power grid or some other substantial power source. The claims that the lunar module had strictly battery power as the available power source says to me that they would have had to use all of their available electrical resources just to facilitate this transmission, if that would even be enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the electrical requirements, with 1960's technology I believe they would have needed an engineer dedicated to the video transmission in order to pull this off. Who acted as this broadcast engineer? The fact that the press was only allowed to capture the video from a projection screen instead of being given a genuine video feed is another indication that this was a large scale act of trickery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the live broadcast of this event may be the Achilles heel of the moon landing story, and possibly why I was temporarily cut off after asking the question. People just don't understand how video transmission technology works, which is why this question has not been asked before.

       Not only the video tapes but all of the other data containing biometrics, telemetry; All of it was erased in the 70s. But don't mention any of this on reddit, you'd get a more favorable reaction from kicking a puppy.

       The link claims that slow-scan television was used on the moon. Indeed, that doesn't necessarily make it so.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a few more minutes of research into slow-scan television shows that it existed at the time of the moon landing and that the power/bandwidth requirements are similar to those of normal voice radio channels. None of this is according to the government but from numerous third-party sources.

       I was always of the opinion they had prerecorded moon landing video in case something went wrong. The US was definitely going to be "the first nation to the moon," no matter what. They most likely used some of that material, though. The prerecorded material made it out to the general public.
      </p>

       That theory explains both sides of the story.

       You make a great point in your criticism, don't expect the people here to even acknowledge it though. They have been brainwashed since birth to believe the moon landing at face value and even some of the people in this subreddit who really "get it" still cannot seem to grasp the fact that the moon landing is so full of holes it is insane NOT to question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as your original post, you were definitely being censored. Don't let the naive fools tell you it was a coincidence. That AMA was sketchy as hell, most of the answers looked like they were pre-written by a team of writers and I would not be surprised if many of the "askers" were fake accounts created to lob those questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space is big business and anyone who questions it gets mobbed by the unwashed idiots who (even when they can imagine conspiracies) cannot seem to take the next step and realize that a conspiracy on THAT level could be just as true.

       Why would NASA conspire to fake a landing on the moon? To what end? A plot to start a war in the middle east by convincing a nation they are under attack i can get behind but this NASA conspiracy I'm admittedly skeptical of. In my opinion if you are going to conspire to fool people there should be a reason besides uplifting the morale of a nation during the cold war era. Any thoughts on what reason anyone would have to fake the moon landing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For the sake of argument lets say it was entirely staged. What negative result came about because of it to make it even matter?

       Censorship.  I was reading through the questions and answers and when someone would ask a serious question *Conspiracy * he wouldn't even give a reasonable answer. All he did was describe how the moon looked and so on.  I can make up feelings and memories too. And the fact that he punched Bart was Cleary a defense mechanism.  Anyway keep doing what your doing buddy. Some people care about the truth.

       some people get very upset when you tell them the moon landing was a hoax. its like you are insulting them personally, because they are wrapped up in being "american" and feeling like part of a big tribe. when you tell them the truth they feel personally insulted, because you are insulting the tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       beyond that, there is reluctance to admit that you could be fooled so utterly and completely. its like when you figured out santa claus wasn't real, except you haven't crossed that bridge yet with the moon landing hoax.

       That's why the media was only allowed to put their cameras on to a projection screen to do the live broadcast. If it were really live they could have been given a direct feed, instead they had to broadcast this movie because that's exactly what it was; a movie.

       i never used to think much about vaccination until i noticed the rabid (no pun intended) reaction of the pro-vaxx shills. if i wasn't skeptical of the science before, i am certainly skeptical of the industry because of their shady marketing tactics.
