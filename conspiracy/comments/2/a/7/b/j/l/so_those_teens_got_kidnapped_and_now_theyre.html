    <div class="md"><p>A brief timeline of recent events, taking us from the abductions to Israel&#39;s Operation Protective Edge.</p>

<p><em>&quot;What will you do if in a week three 14-year-old girls will be kidnapped from one of the settlements?&quot;</em> asks Mossad Chief, Tamir Pardo, on the 5th of June.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, 3 Israeli teens are allegedly kidnapped in Area C of the West Bank - an area under IDF control. Israel locks down Palestine, preventing citizens from entering Jordan, Beit Guvrin and Israel, restricting the movement of 600,000. Over the next 2 weeks the Israeli army arrests 470+ Palestinians and kills 6 (with many more after), including children, during Operation Brother&#39;s Keeper, as well as injuring numerous (~120) others with gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>On Saturday 14th June rocket fire is exchanged. No injuries.</p>

<p>Sunday 15th June, Israel arrests almost 100 Palestinians in their search..</p>

<p>On Saturday June 21st IDF raided RT Arabic and Palmedia in the West Bank, breaking down doors, destroying equipment and confiscating records.</p>

<p>On June 24th, 4 rockets fired from Gaza saw heavy bombing from Israeli F16s in response, allegedly injuring 2 policemen. 1 of the Palestinian rockets was blamed for the death of a child in Palestine and the injuring of 4 family members.</p>

<p>Friday June 27th Israeli drone strikes killed 2 Palestinians - Muhammad al-Fasih and Usama al-Hassumi - and injured 3 others. In addition, the Israeli army fired 4 artillery shells into homes and 2 mosques in the eastern areas of Khan Younis injuring 7, including 2 children and a pregnant woman. Palestinians allegedly detonated a device near a military vehicle close to the border fence. Israeli tanks located near Gaza City also shelled some residential buildings without injury.</p>

<p>Saturday 28th, 2 Palestinians were injured by Israeli fire after 2 rockets from Gaza landed in the Western Negev area, causing no damage or injuries.</p>

<p>On Sunday June 29th the IAF conducted air strikes from dawn. An Israeli missile killed 1 Palestinian and injured 2 bystanders, and tanks fired 3 shells at residents breaking their fast without injury. al-Qassam Brigades fired 6-14 homemade shells in response that landed in open areas.</p>

<p>June 30th, the 3 Israeli teenager&#39;s bodies are discovered. Hamas claims it wasn&#39;t them. Israel accuses them without proof and uses explosives to demolish the homes of the suspects. Palestine fires 20 rockets and mortars. Zero casualties. Israel performs 14 airstrikes, hitting 34 targets and killing 8 Palestinians. Another Palestinian, Yousouf Ibrahim Abu Zagha, is killed by IDF.</p>

<p>Wednesday July 2nd saw some 11 rocket and mortars fired from Gaza and IAF airstrikes, none of which caused injury. Palestinian Abu Khdeir is kidnapped by Israelis, forced to drink petrol, then burned alive. 10 more Palestinians are wounded by army gunfire near Hebron.</p>

<p>July 3rd the Israeli army shoots at a group of Palestinians catching 1 in the chest. Israeli troops also fired tank mortar shells into eastern Rafah, but no injuries, in response to 6 homemade shells fired from Gaza that caused no injuries. 1 rocket fired from Gaza left a home without electricity for a few hours. 15 Israeli airstrikes in response injured 10 Palestinians, including 3 girls and an elderly woman. 2 more rockets were fired from Gaza to Sderot in response without injury. An American 15 year old, Tariq Abu Khdeir, is kidnapped by Israelis and beaten almost to death.</p>

<p>Friday July 4th saw Israeli airstrikes targeting Rafah, Khan Younis and the al-Fakhary area without injuries. Gaza responded with rockets fired into the Negev without injury.</p>

<p>Saturday July 5th Israeli soldiers kidnap 3 Palestinians.</p>

<p>On Sunday July 6th the Israeli police kidnapped overnight 110 Palestinians; around half of them children. They also struck 10 targets with F16s, injuring 1. Rockets fired from Gaza injure 1 Israeli soldier.</p>

<p>On Monday July 7th, the Israeli army kidnapped 4 Palestinian children and 1 man, Mohammad Hilmy Shousha. 9 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes during the night.</p>

<p>Tuesday 8th of July saw 16 Palestinians killed, including a father and his child, when Israel fired missiles into a residential area in the Shejaeyya neighborhood, east of Gaza City. Around 100 more were wounded, including women and children. This was as a result of Israel striking 50 sites by air and sea. Hamad Ehmedan Salhab, age 22, was abducted by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>July 9th - Israeli kills a further 22 Palestinians in Gaza and injures 90 more with strikes from the air and sea while an alleged 140 rockets are fired back from Gaza with no result.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t included in the above any of the clashes between Palestinian protestors and Jewish settlers, which have resulted in even more injuries, arrests and abductions. Nor the Israeli army raids on homes that have resulted in theft, violent abuse, property damage and some 640 arrests in a few weeks. Then there are the bulldozers preparing Palestinian land for more Israeli settlers amidst all of this.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR That video of the cop pounding that woman&#39;s face by the highway the other day? That dickhead&#39;s Israel and the woman&#39;s flailing arms are Palestine&#39;s &#39;relentless rocket attacks&#39;.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great recap of events, I am saving this one. I randomly turned on AM radio today and came upon some Christian news channel and they were talking about the Israel situation. Saying that Israel is bound by god to own the land, and though the Palestinians should live in peace they have no claim to the land and Israel is &quot;relentlessly pounded by rocket attacks and have no choice but to retaliate.&quot; They never talk about how Israel has completely raped the Palestinians over 3 teenagers killed. And say it&#39;s ok for them to capture hundreds of women and children who had nothing to do with the kidnappings. </p>

<p>This part of the world is ridiculous. The US needs to stop all support and let them figure it out. Without Western support Israel would just be a memory, or they can fight it out, but i&#39;m so sick of this &quot;my bible is better than yours&quot; bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree. They are dangerous, don&#39;t listen to anyone claiming they have the right to do what they want or be &quot;eradicated&quot;, even though we allow them to have nukes and try to stop Iran from having a peaceful nuclear ENERGY program.

<p>That is understandable. But it is never going to happen. First because Israel, dangerous though they are, are not stupid - not by a long shot. Israel wants to conquer, not destroy. Second because we human&#39;s are not alone in the Universe - fortunately for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I don&#39;t see Israel as a state letting a nuke go, but if Hamas keeps pressing, and this grows out of proportion, and if Hamas or Al Quds or shit Israel launches a false flag with a chemical weapon, I could see them doing something. I know how they love ISIS or IS now, tearing through killing Shia, and they hope eventually Iran, they could attack them as well or try to take all the Palestinians down. 99% it won&#39;t happen, but I feel like they are unpredictable, even with the US and Western powers telling them not to do something. IDK I digress but  they scare me more than ISIS attacking us or any other Islamic radical group. Shit, we created them and still fund them. I don&#39;t see ISIS biting the hands that feed. Al Baghdadi is a lot smarter than any AQ leader, look at what he&#39;s done, he wants a state, not revenge.</p>

<p>So those teens got kidnapped and now they&#39;re mobilizing 40,000 troops - What happened?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Your timeline starts on June 12. Roll the clock back a bit further to find out what is really going on:</p>

<p><strong>REUTERS</strong>, June 2, 2014:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/abbas-hamas-create-consensus-palestinian-government-n120281">Abbas, Hamas Create Consensus Palestinian Government</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>RAMALLAH West Bank — President Mahmoud Abbas swore in a <strong>Palestinian unity government</strong> on Monday in a reconciliation deal with Hamas Islamists that <strong>set Israel on a collision course with Washington over U.S. pledges to work with the new administration while Israel shunned it.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Israel has worked long and hard to try to keep the Palestinians divided and squabbling amongst themselves - the <em>last</em> thing they wanted was to see them reunited in opposition to Israeli oppression and occupation.</p>

<p>Worse still, the &quot;West&quot;, <strong>including the US</strong>, applauded the unification move, leaving Israel FURIOUS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. State Department, however, said it would work with the new government and cautiously pledged to continue to disburse aid to the Palestinians while monitoring its policies, drawing Israeli anger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Israel is deeply disappointed with the State Department&#39;s comments today on the Palestinian unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization responsible for the murder of many hundreds of Israelis, fired thousands of rockets at Israeli cities, and which remains committed to Israel&#39;s destruction,&quot; said Ambassador Ron Dermer in a statement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em>what happened</em> had little to do with the 3 Israeli teens, and MUCH to do with Palestinian reunification <em>and</em> the US support thereof.</p>

<p>International acceptance of the deal left Israel standing in the cold, holding its limp dick - and they were <em>itching to rain hell on the Palestinians</em> for having the NERVE to reunite. </p>

<p>If the &quot;kidnappings&quot; hadn&#39;t happened, it would have been some other excuse, whether real or manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My timeline starts on the 5th, and there have been many threads on here discussing motives for the possible false flag event. Perhaps I should have worded it &#39;what happened <em>since</em>&#39; (or in between), as the aim was to fill in the holes left by the mainstream timeline of kidnappings -&gt; Palestinian terrorists fire rockets -&gt; Israeli Operation Protective Edge.</p>

<p>I do agree that that deal was probably the most significant catalyst for the recent developments (before the abductions on one side and the other), but of course the timeline could be rolled back indefinitely:</p>
