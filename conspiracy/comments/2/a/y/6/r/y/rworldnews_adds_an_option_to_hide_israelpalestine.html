       Really weird. Go into any article about Israel killing children and the comments are just packed with discussion about how
       <em>
        terrible

       <strong>
        Hamas
       </strong>
       is. Half of the comments are simple repetitions of "Hamas uses children as human shield (which evidently forces Israel to blow them up, even when they aren't being used as human shields and are just playing on the beach), like this is new information or something.

       My comments also involved the last ten days or so, disregarding my historical comment. The problem is, your comments imply that Hamas are the agitators / aggressors in this conflict which is entirely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the aggressor and the Palestinians are defending themselves. The problem is that most media is dominated by Jewish interests and Israel has their internet propaganda machine known as the JDIF, so the message of Israel defending themselves dominates while the Palestinians have no voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not support Israel and their actions, then it seems that you've been caught up in their propaganda.

       How was I misleading? In my mind this whole thing began with the murder of the Israeli teenagers. All of the the rockets and missiles seemed to come out of this event, at least as far as I have been able to tell by media reports.

       So you don't think Hamas fired rockets first or you think that they are justified in shooting unguided rockets into Israel? Either choice isn't that appealing.

       You could have talked about who shot first and you could have mentioned how Israel agreed to a ceasefire, but they were met with 30 rockets being shot into their country.

       They are justified because they are defending themselves. Sometimes the truth isn't 'appealing'.

        You could have talked about who shot first and you could have mentioned how Israel agreed to a ceasefire, but they were met with 30 rockets being shot into their country.

      <p>
       I can agree that Hamas fired rockets after a ceasefire, but I also think its justified because they are being systematically destroyed by Israel. Also it could very be an ad hominem if the basis of what you claimed compromised my integrity was irrelevant, which is still up for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know what I really think? I think Hamas is the best friend of Israel. They send in these ineffective, unguided missiles that bring nearly no detriment to Israel but they give Israel an excuse to unleash their modern weaponry on what remains of the Palestinians.

       I think, ultimately, this whole conflict is a big farce and someone is playing both sides. It has always been a typical strategy of big players in the world:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbO0f9uaWZE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbO0f9uaWZE
       </a>
       .
It would make a lot of sense for Israel to create Hamas and equip them with just enough weaponry to create ruckus, but never actually impact the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I still want to side with the Palestinians because they are the oppressed peoples, not the Zionists. The Palestinians were occupied and Israel is the aggressor, and now Israel has created and equipped Hamas to continue the creation of one state.

       You know Hamas are the guys really to blame for this shit right? Yeah Israel and Palestine both make mistakes, but the whole reason for the fighting flaring up is because of Hamas's useless rocket attacks. It's not a coincidence that every time the sensible people in Israel and Palestine start peace talks Hamas starts another rocket attack. Then the old warhawks in Israel take over and start bombing everything they can find (and since Hamas won't stop shooting the old assholes will never stop returning fire). Either Hamas has to stop shooting for long enough for sensible people to start talking, the Iron Dome has to be perfected (because once it's 100% no one in Israel will be able to support bombing Gaza), or the most realistic option is everyone has to wait until the old warhawks die and younger more sensible people can take over Israel. The younger smarter politicians can make a real deal with Palestine (not sure how they deal with Hamas's attacks, maybe popular support in Palestine turns against them eventually and Palestine works together with Israel to take them down).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like in the US, we're never going to have peace while all the old fucks who don't understand the people they "represent" are in power. We need a president / congress that understands the horrors of war and won't send young men to their deaths so easily.

       No, they won't. They took that land a long time ago, Hamas had nothing to do with it. They took it as a buffer zone between them and Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Don't try and rewrite history to fit your bias

       The sad part is that they don't even need JIDF anymore, since so many dumbasses now eat their shit up and spew it out all over this website. They all point the finger at Hamas and blame them for everything. It's almost as if they feel Israel can't be blamed for the deaths for thousands of civilians because Hamas launched some rockets that get shot down by their Iron Dome

       You don't have to hate Jews, all communities have their bad seeds. I'm a Muslim. I KNOW. We see Jews as Ahl-ul-Kitaab (people of the book). But Zionism is an ideology that is racist and we should despise it. We should work towards the eradication of Zionism. Not only Palestinians but Jews and other people have paid the price for standing up against Zionists. Have a looksie.

       You got to stop watching mainstream news man, that shit is the worst possible thing you can do. It reinforces every negative stereotype in the book.

When someone speaks up against what they are doing many Israel supporters instanly start pointing fingers and calling people antisemitic and it's ridiculous.   It is totally ok for people to disagee with what Israel is doing and not be anti semetic.  This is just like what happened in Iraq anyone that said anything against the Iraq war was "unamerican".  That is exactly how you stop people from having a serious conversation about real issues.

       Can any Palestinian supporter explain the double standard? Why is it okay for Palestinians to blindly shoot over 1200 missiles at the civilians of Israel but one misfire from Israel's end causes an outrage? Israel takes the utmost precautions when attacking Hamas hideouts (which happen to be in schools, mosques, and other locations where they can leverage Israel's humanitarian ideals by using innocent civilians as shields) to assure the citizens know to evacuate the area. It's not even a comparison, the second the Palestinians lay down their weapons Israel will as well, the same cannot be said in the reversed scenario.

       That is a false comparison, let's compare number of rockets and missiles fired. Over the last month Hamas have fired approximately 2000 rockets toward Israeli civilian centers with warheads ranging from 70kg to 200kg filled with ball bearings and nails while the IDF have conducted aprox 1500 precision strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last decades Israel not only developed and deployed the only missile shield in the world but also required every new home and building under construction to be built with steel reinforced concrete room to act as a shelter. Hamas, OTOH, have commandeered all the concrete and steel to build bunkers for its rocket arsenal, bunkers for its political and military leadership and to add insulte to injury, have stashed launch pads, rockets, C3 equipment and other military equipment INSIDE civilian houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm terribly sorry that you and your like find it reprehensible that Israel have spent the time and effort to defend its citizens and so the death toll in Israel is so low. While Hamas use civilians as human shields in order to protect its military assets and court as many civilian deaths just to make israel look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for this specific inccident, every death is a tragedy, and the death of a child is the biggest tragedy of them all. Unlike Hamas (who in case of dead children will rejoice and hand out candies on the streets) the IDF is conducting a throughout investigation in order to understand what went wrong, and that's for two main reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The most important one is that Israel fear for its soldiers souls as much as it fears for their lives, your average IDF soldier is a conscript who at 18 have to give 3 years to protect his home, Israel have no intention to turn out generation after generation of brutalized soldiers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As this very thread show, it doesn't look good. Forget for a moment the fact the the Israeli public will find it hard to stomach wholesale killing of civilians, I know most of you don't give a crap about this since in your eyes every Israeli start the morning with a glass of a freshly dead Palestinain kid, in the international court of public opinion the Palestinians are the masters of using incidents like this to blacken Israel face.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So over the last 15 years, the IDF have develop new weapons, methods and C3 procedures specificly targeted to avoid civilian casualties in places like Gaza (where more often than not, there is a Palestinian familiy living right above a launch pad or rocket storage) and the results speak for themselves, out of ~1500 strikes in Gaza there are only ~200 deaths (and let's forget the fact that about 100 of those are armed terrorist) no other military force in the world have done something like that, no western force let alone an Arab one (just take a look at Syria and Iraq).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Gaza being an open prison, that is simply cause and effect. I won't go into wether Gaza truly is an open prison, that an issue for an entire other debat, what I will say is this: up until around 2006 between 40%-60% of gazan worked inside of Israel, in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and the like once Hamas have taken possession of Gaza by a coup from the, Israel have not allowed gazan to enter its territory for fear of suicide bombers. This inability to smuggle suicide bombers to strike vital military targets such as cafés, bus stops, and schools to name a few lead to the current rocket threat and ended us where we are today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quickest way for civilians in Gaza to be same again is for Hamas to stop its attacks on Israel, but considering Hamas charter this isn't going to happen.

       It's a false comparison because it's lopsided. Maybe Israel Zionists should stop killing and then that number wouldn't look so gruesome.

       Regardless, let's talk about number of rockets fired, not casualties, because the real numbers are in rockets.

       No, the US would give a no-bid contract to the most well-connected government contractor. Said contractor would then take years and millions to billions of dollars over-budget. When the project was finally completed, the final product would function like shit, being ineffective and taxpayer would be fucked over fully. Instead, the US just pays for Israel's drone's with taxpayer money, oh no wait, that's "aid". And the US also gives aid to the other side. Everything is a pawn for the elite to play with - to keep leaders in power.

       What holocaust? The Palestinian population has grown 30% in the last decade, quite the opposite. As you said, Israel is in the stronger position, pretty sure they could have wiped out Gaza if that was their goal. No country that is constantly under attack is going to sit back and do nothing, that's a ridiculous expectation.

       The destruction of the Palestinian attacks? Israel built a state of the art missile defense system to protect it citizens (that is why you are not seeing any destruction), the Palestinians use their citizens to protect their missiles, that's the route of the issue. The argument isn't where there are more casualties, that is not an apples to apples comparison. When one culture values death as much as the other values life it is hard to find a solution. It is difficult for reasonable person to understand the mindset of an extremist, that is not the way most of the world thinks. Many outsiders sympathize with the Palestinians, because they appear to be the "underdog", if the world truly understood what their true intentions were and the amount of  propaganda that goes into their campaign sympathizers would have a much different view (also doesn't help that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world to spread the propaganda)

       Israel not having casualties is a very new thing. Without the Iron dome the people on the Israeli side would be getting killed too (and the Israeli response would be much harsher). Since neither side will ever agree to work together (unless Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad all come down and tell everyone to stop being assholes to their fellow man) I think the best hope for peace, at least short term, is the iron dome. Perfect that and Israel will have no justification for shooting back.

       They aren't missile's btw, That would be what Israel uses. Missile's are guided into the target, rockets are aimed towards the general direction of a target. Missile's are much more deadly weaponry.

       Neither side has any interest in laying down arms and I weep at your naivete in thinking so. BOTH sides are fucking evil and will gleefully kill infants if they happen to be from the "enemy" side.

      <p>
       As I've said before, give the Palestinians nukes (because Israel already has them) and let them nuke the fuck out of each other already. Turn the entire fucking region to glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither side has any logical objective reason to commit the violent atrocities they both have committed. Fuck them all. Furthermore, this entire stupid, worthless pathetic conflict is nothing but a carrot to be used in political campaigns in the US.

       What's so wrong about this? The Israel Palestine articles are making up the majority of the content on the sub and there are tons of people that would rather read new news than the same things that have been happening for the last ~60 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the people going into the comments to just to post angry hate fueled rants aren't helping either. Seems it's usually anti-Israeli people are the ones posting all the angry raciest shit that most people don't want to have to look at (any Jewish person has to avoid the comments like the plague to avoid all the blatant racism people post there). If people would actually just post facts and have adult conversations without going "ISRAEL IS THE DEVIL THEY ARE COMMITTING A HOLOCAUST" or "Fuck the zionist cunts who murder children!!" or "All arabs must die". Although I've actually never seen any anti arab hate, it's always people using Israel's shitty foreign policy to justify their extreme anti-jewish racism (and going on Bipolarbears little "experiment" I'm guessing a lot of the sensless racism and hate is coming from the people here).

       There is a significant difference between "senseless racist hate" and "entirely justifiable disgust".
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is committing war crimes and calling it self defense, right now, as we speak. Censoring the promotion of awareness is not far off from complicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're wondering why most of the comments are anti-israel, maybe take a few minutes and use the internet to explore the majority of the worlds opinion on the issue. After that you may want to check on who is actually supporting israel, that doesn't have a vested military interest in the region... that last one is a short list.

       How is it censorship? It's a choice to censor yourself. But default all the Israel Palestine articles show up. The only reason they added it is because people have been complaining about the sheer number of articles on it (especially when none of them say anything different than what's been happening for years) and people complained about the sticky, so this way everyone wins. How can you seriously complain about this?

       How many of those threads are in Worldnews vs how many Israel-Palestine threads? It's only maybe one GMO thread in a week (very high estimate) vs dozens of Israel articles every day. It's not about the beliefs its about volume.

       I've been a reddit user for years and there have frequently been multiple posts of the same news event on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and /r/ Worldnews in spite of reddit rules asking people not to do that.  Other than that rule you just had to put up with it.  There was no option to hide any posts.

       Volume. This is a constant thing thats going to go on for weeks. Its not like one insane event that gets extra coverage, its a circle of war that repeats itself every two years or so. Most people over 20 have seen this same thing half a dozen times already and don't feel the need to see a bunch of low effort articles blocking out all other news

       This is a constant thing and a very important one.  Lots of people think what's happening in Gaza is terrible and unjust and would like to follow what's happening as it occurs.  It could be the reason for the option to hide "Israel/Palestine"content is to sweep it under the rug.  If so it's a weak tactic hastily created to try to prevent people from seeing reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who decides what's a low effort article if not Reddit users who upvote or downvote a post? This is how Reddit more or less works with some unwanted exceptions that skew numbers.  It should be the same on
       <a href="/r/Worldnews">
        /r/Worldnews
       </a>
       when you see huge numbers of posts about what's happening to the people in Gaza.  You can downvote them.

       Neither of your posts should have received a single upvote or a single person's interest! The first is just plainly false. I'd love to hear your opinion on this. The second...is empty. It says nothing. It doesn't provoke discussion. It isn't an intelligent addition to anything ever.

       Probably a coincidence. The mods were probably writing the hide button once they realized their "experiments" were failing, or at the very least temporary. This silences those that don't want to see it (These are the ones that would ignore the links anyway people, so no loss here). I'm fairly certain their button has nothing to do with the acts of some assholes who want to blow up children.

       Hamas fired rockets before Israel started this bombing campaign. Hamas sorta is the agitator.

       Your original comment, which was misleading. Your subsequent comments did not. I was just correcting your misleading nature. For being someone in

       you'd think you'd have more integrity or maybe it's the exact opposite.

       I've been a reddit user for years and there have frequently been multiple posts of the same news event on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and /r/ Worldnews in spite of reddit rules asking people not to do that.  Other than that rule you just had to put up with it.  There was no option to hide any posts.
