<p>A 777 in the fleet of Malaysia Airlines, MH370, went missing in March (was stolen???)</p>

<p>A 777 in the fleet of Malaysia Airlines (MH370???) was shot down over the Ukraine in July</p>

<p>My best guess is that INTERPOL bought the missing jet on the Black Market from the nefarious Chinese business men who set up the mid-air airliner heist. INTERPOL subsequently flew the 777 over Ukraine and shot it down with an IGLA S2A missile to ignite a new European war.My prediction:</p>

<p>Germany invades Russian in December</p>

<p>Germany can provide 4-10k soldiers with the latest tec at a time, but only if the US gives air support and supply. Germany couldn&#39;t even properly invade Belgium.</p>

<p>Germany does quite well trading and I guess, has no incentive trying to adopt 50 million poor russians.</p>

<p>No way, man. Germany&#39;s Merkel and Russia&#39;s Putin are starting business deals because they can equal the resources, both raw and manufacturing, of the USA.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, here is a valid attempt at an honest rebuttal:</p>

<p>MH370 was never thought (conspiracy wise) to be hijacked by Chinese businessmen. It was thought to be in Diego Garcia. But do you honestly think that Russian satellites wouldn&#39;t have seen it? Do you think Russia would hesitate to call us out on it?</p>

<p>MH17 really MH370 = do you think all the Europeans flying to KL are all fake? It&#39;s a codeshare flight with KLM, do you think that a dutch airline is in on it? Their are dead bodies on the ground, do you think that none of them will be identified?</p>

<p>INTERPOL bought MH370 on the black market = good grief... did they use bitcoin and buy it on some tor website???</p>

<p>Germany to invade Russia = not gonna happen. Outgunned, outmanned, and hopefully they learned a lesson last time they tried and failed. Not to mention, Germany is completely dependent on Russia for natural gas. Otherwise, they all freeze when it comes winter time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend jokingly suggested this. I&#39;m not ruling it out but there are eye witness accounts (with photos) showing the wreckage with dead passengers.</p>

<p>Are these passengers the original MH370 passengers? If so, they would be easy to identify. However, there&#39;s a good chance those people were all killed and thrown into a mass grave somewhere else.</p>

<p>Again, not ruling it out but what would be the motive? Maybe to get rid of the plane? But what about the actual plane that left the airport today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The passengers are irrelevant. My personal belief is that they were shot by the Chinese mafia that stole the the plane in the first place, but that really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the motive, I&#39;ve already posted my theory on this in a related thread.</p>

<p>However, I think it could easily backfire. Russia could say that it was the Kiev military who shot down the plan, mistaking it for self-defense or Russian aircraft.</p>

<p>That would give Russia even more a reason to take military action on Ukraine. Now what that would cause... we all know.</p>
