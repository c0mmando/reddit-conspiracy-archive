    <div class="md"><p>Snapped off at the point of impact and obliterated and a fair amount of it would be carried through the impact hole and the surrounding windows by the inertia. This is basic physics. The wings are just more lightweight metal and composites attached to the fuselage. They&#39;re not some kind of armored knife blades.</p>

<p>Look, I know physics isn&#39;t an easy subject to understand. Especially the physics of an airplane crash into a hardened structure, because it isn&#39;t the kind of thing there are a ton of examples of. But the wings, if they didn&#39;t carry enough mass to penetrate the wall, would still have had kinetic energy to spare. That gets reversed and applied to the wings themselves and thus fragments them.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all fairly irrelevant when you get to the <em>real</em> meat of this discussion. I mean, here&#39;s the thing. We <em>saw</em> two planes hit the World Trade Center buildings. From multiple angles. I mean, even if you want to play pretend scientist and try to figure out how they could fake the Pentagon attacks, only fools can attempt to deny that airplanes hit those buildings. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t talk shit about foreign diplomats without some fucktard Army private giving over the classified documents to some journalist. The NSA can&#39;t even look at stolen nudes without some guy leaking it to the world. But you&#39;re telling me that you believe that the government could orchestrate this kind of absolutely epic false flag operation, with <em>tens of thousands of people</em> complicit in it, and thirteen years later, <em>nobody</em> has come forward to blab?  Come on kiddo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I replied to someone else but I thought I would show you this site for future reference.

<p>You are correct. The pentagon is DESIGNED to take an impact in such a way that if it is hit, only the section hit is affected and the whole building isn&#39;t taken out. The Pentagon was hit by a plane. Here&#39;s a video that may help your argument in future. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911_pentagon_eyewitnesses.html">This</a> is an awesome site which goes through the step by step reenactment. Basically proving there was a plane but that it couldn&#39;t have been flown by commercial pilots and needed fighter-jet precision to hit the building in such a way that it could compact as perfectly as it did.</p>

<p>The best theory is that the plane was remotely flown into the pentagon.</p>

<p>This dude never, ever made a point. I would like him to make a point so I can use it to reach a more informed conclusion. He didn&#39;t provide a source, then criticized me for not looking at the source. I&#39;m on my phone, I&#39;m not going to look that shit up myself. </p>

<p>Know what they do though? The shills will try to engage you in a back and forth like I just got trapped in. A bunch of children comments get posted. They will all very low scores. The relevant comment gets dragged down with the ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official story says that the plane nose dived from a very high altitude at a zillion miles an hour, that&#39;s what caused it to disappear. Here are the quotes from the people that saw flight 93 crash.</p>

<p>Tim Thornsberg, working in a nearby strip mine: “It came in <strong>low over the trees</strong> and started wobbling. Then it just rolled over and was flying upside down for a few seconds… and then it <strong>kind of stalled</strong> and did a nose dive over the trees.” [WPXI 11 (PITTSBURGH), 9/13/2001]</p>

<p>Terry Butler, at Stoystown: He sees the plane come out of the clouds, low to the ground. “It was moving like you wouldn’t believe. Next thing I knew it makes a heck of a sharp, right-hand turn.” It banks to the right and <strong>appears to be trying to climb to clear one of the ridges</strong>, but it continues to turn to the right and then veers behind a ridge. About a second later it crashes. [ST. PETERSBURG TIMES, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Charles Sturtz, a half-mile from the crash site: The plane is heading southeast and has its engines running. No smoke can be seen. “It was really roaring, you know. Like it was trying to go someplace, I guess.” [WPXI 11 (PITTSBURGH), 9/13/2001]</p>

<p>Rob Kimmel, several miles from the crash site: He sees it fly overhead, banking hard to the right. It is <strong>200 feet or less off the ground as it crests a hill</strong> to the southeast. “I saw the top of the plane, not the bottom.” [LONGMAN, 2002, PP. 210-211]</p>

<p>Eric Peterson of Lambertsville: He sees a plane <strong>flying overhead unusually low</strong>. The plane seemed to be turning end-over-end as it dropped out of sight behind a tree line. [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Bob Blair of Stoystown: He sees the plane spiraling and flying upside down, <strong>not much higher than the treetops</strong>, before crashing. [DAILY AMERICAN, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>An unnamed witness says he hears two loud bangs before watching the plane take a downward turn of nearly 90 degrees. [NEWS CHANNEL 5 (CLEVELAND), 9/11/2001]</p>

<p>Terry Butler, a few miles north of Lambertsville: “It dropped out of the clouds.” <strong>The plane rose slightly, trying to gain altitude</strong>, then “it just went flip to the right and then straight down.” [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]</p>

<p>Lee Purbaugh, 300 yards away: “There was an incredibly loud rumbling sound and there it was, right there, <strong>right above my head—maybe 50 feet up</strong>.… I saw it rock from side to side then, suddenly, it dipped and dived, nose first, with a huge explosion, into the ground. I knew immediately that no one could possibly have survived.” [INDEPENDENT, 8/13/2002]</p>

<p>You decide if it nose dived straight down from a high altitude and buried itself in the ground:</p>

Maybe 3, because Charles Sturtz says what I could say about any plane in the sky, and doesn&#39;t even mention the crash.

    <div class="md"><p>A missile doesn&#39;t blow a plane up into confetti? Are you serious right now or just delusional be chase you&#39;re in this sub? Any SAM is designed to bring a plane down and highly depends on where the missile hit the plane. Worst case is it blows a huge chunk off comprising it&#39;s integrity at 12 miles in the sky. At this point the plane ceases to fly and takes a nose dive 12 miles likely hitting terminal velocity if the wings were gone. If not, it partially coasted down losing pieces as it gets closer to the earth as it&#39;s violently depressurized. Not that hard of a concept. Plus considering how far it had to fall, pieces are likely spread tens - hundreds of miles. </p>

<p>Tl;dr. You don&#39;t shoot something in the sky and it immediately drops straight down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t explode into a million pieces. A SAM missile would likely result in one portion of the plane coming off (part of a wing or the tail/nose), possibly a few if it hit right between wings on the hull. Yes there would be a few thousand small (Likely basketball size and smaller) pieces right from the missile hit, but the plane wouldn&#39;t just turn into confetti.</p>

<p>No I can&#39;t source anything, but a decent understanding of how SAM missiles work, physics, and intelligence leads that to being a logical assumption.</p>

<p>Also comparing the pentagon plane and this one isn&#39;t like the two murders you described. It&#39;s like comparing Jeffrey Dahmer to Michael Jordan. The only thing similar is that they are both humans, and both crashes were by airplanes. One was shot down at cruising altitude, the other was trying to be flown into a building on the ground. THERE IS NOTHING COMPARABLE ABOUT THE CRASHES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could easily explode into many pieces. Medium-Range AA missiles can have decent warheads (I believe i&#39;ve seen 70kg for the BUK missile system the current rumors indicate it could have been.) My understanding is that they can be proximity (Radar based, detonated the warhead towards the plane when it gets within a certain range to shred the plane with shrapnel) or contact fused where it detonates on impact. Seeing as it&#39;s a radar guided system it&#39;s not unusual to see it coming from a side or rear trajectory (I believe AA gunners generally avoid head on targeting when possible as the missile is more easily avoided when it&#39;s coming in with the combined closing speed of the target and missile).</p>

<p>I could easily see the missile hitting somewhere in the center of the plane which is where a lot of the fuel tanks are, as well as in the wings, causing a sizable explosion and sending parts of the plane everywhere. This obviously wouldn&#39;t blow it into little golf ball sized pieces (As we&#39;ve seen, there are some sizable chunks of fuselage) but that combined with the fact that the plane was probably flying at a pretty great cruise speed could lead to the plane being broken up into a lot of pretty small parts, in relation to the original plane.</p>

<p>All evidence suggests that flight 93, which crashed over at Shanksville, broke up before impact, there were <a href="http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h79/willuk7/flight93crash.gif">debris fields</a> miles and miles apart to support this conclusion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah ok, that seems logical.</p>

<p>So what you are saying is debris from the plane, in multiple other crash sites, went from 560 mph, to zero, then had enough energy to bounce back from the earth, the same earth that was some how soft enough to swallow up a plane in the first place, then travel over 8 miles away.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t pass science in school did you, this is just pure creationist logic.</p>

<p>Airliners are not &quot;hollow&quot; (not sure why you used the word &quot;theoretically&quot;). Every airliner has a structural spine that runs the length of the fuselage between the passenger cabin and the cargo storage area. It&#39;s the very reason why the plane that hit the Pentagon damaged only the bottom third of the area of a fuselage cross section. The &quot;empty space&quot; didn&#39;t puncture the wall but the structurally reinforced section did. Because science. Because engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but a plane hit by a missile is going to leave very different traces of debris than a plane that is hurtling down towards earth, at its max speed. That latter kind of collision would not leave many recognizable pieces, as the impact would rip apart almost anything in the airplane.</p>

<p>A plane hit by a missile would begin breaking up immediately, and would lose power. So it would fall to earth powered by gravity, not gravity plus a few jet engines. </p>

<p>Totally different levels of impact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get where the 3 mile debris field is coming from. The best imagine i&#39;ve found of the crash site overhead is <a href="http://2012patriot.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/shanksville_mine_1994.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=327">this</a>. It certainly doesn&#39;t look to be 3 miles. That said, a debris field from what i understand generally covers the distance where they start finding debris to the point where they stop. It could also just be the area they are searching in for debris. But, judging from that photo, it doesn&#39;t seem unlikely that a plane flying low and at high speed could suddenly have nosed into the ground.</p>

<p>As for the Vietnam vet, that doesn&#39;t really prove anything. That&#39;s just someone saying what they think they heard.</p>

<p>If you have any links though, that would be cool. I&#39;m going off of my basic searching.</p>

<p>Just think about how much energy it takes to displace hundreds of cubic feet of solid earth. There was enough energy released to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#mediaviewer/File:Flight93Engine.jpg">bury one of the engines</a> several feet into the ground.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t a huge visible wreckage field because Flight 93 crashed in an incredibly violent manner and released a huge amount of energy all at once. Wreckage ended up obliterated, incinerated, or buried in the ground.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not the only such violent crash. There was the hijacking and crash of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1771">Pacific Southwest 1771</a> in the late 1980s, for example. That crash was violent enough that they never recovered identifiable remains for most of the people onboard, and that involved an aircraft roughly a third the size of a fully loaded Boeing 757.</p>

<p>Logically there is no reason to dispute it until you can actually prove with evidence that soil displacement and compression should have been different given what occurred.</p>

<p>The reality is that soil isn&#39;t very compressible and it&#39;s hard to move via large kinetic impacts. There&#39;s a reason why earthen walls were so popular in WWI for trenches, because just a few feet of soil could stop large artillery rounds and halt bullets in their tracks. </p>

<p>Patently untrue. From the article about Pacific Southwest 1771 I linked above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plane was estimated to have crashed slightly faster than the speed of sound, at around 770 mph (1,240 km/h), disintegrating instantly. It is estimated that the aircraft hit the ground at five thousand times the force of gravity, and was traveling at an approximately 70-degree angle toward the south. The plane struck a rocky hillside, leaving a crater less than 2 feet deep and 4 feet across, presumably where the landing gear struck the ground. The high-speed impact compressed the soil, which almost immediately rebounded, throwing fragments and paper (including the note by Burke) back into the air, before flames consumed them. No one survived the crash; the force of impact meant that human remains were very small, the largest being feet in shoes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1771">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1771</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Call comes in to the San Luis Obispo County, California Sherrif&#39;s Office citing a small plane crash in the mountains of southern California. Detective Bill Wammock is the first to arrive on the scene. He recalls “nothing that resembled an airliner... we went on for hours, before we heard the news reports of a missing airliner, believing that we were dealing with a small airplane full of newspapers that had crashed. We saw no pieces of the aircraft that were larger than, maybe, a human hand. It did not look like a passenger aircraft.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, wow I&#39;ve seen some lingual gymnastics here today.</p>

<p>To bring this thread back on point:</p>

<p>It is easy to suppose that a plane that gets blown up in the sky with a rocket, would leave smaller pieces scattered around more. </p>

<p>While a plane crashing in the ground would leave more debris, in one place. </p>

<p>Is there yes or no some scientific reason why this wouldn&#39;t be the case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by the gymnastics you mean the flip flopping and being all over the place with ideas or thoughts, then you are very right. I have no clue what happened or what debris fields would look like. But because I don&#39;t know what happened, I want to pose questions that make people think, those responses make me think. I really respect being told that I&#39;m wrong and having people present their view of truth, as long as they are thinking through it. I&#39;m happy to be on the other side of correctness as long as thought is involved. The only thing that really is disheartening is when people attack a thought without having their own thought to fall back on, and instead just using a cutting remark or blanket statement to prove someone wrong. I think some people get off on telling other people they are wrong. I mean, who hasn&#39;t done the things I&#39;m complaining about? I know I have, but am trying harder not to. 
I think people just love being invested emotionally in their &quot;side&quot;. And it is with everything. We argue on here about the event of 911, SandyHook, Boston bombing, mh370, mh17, Israel, Palestine, etc like we are rooting for a sports team. We are all so fucking invested in being right and being the one to win and prove someone else wrong, that we are robbing ourselves of really great debate and conversation. </p>

<p>That plane just skidded along the ground and the resulting fire was enough to disintigrate 75% of the airplane.  In a <a href="http://911review.com/reviews/physics911/missing_wings/docs/afc_747fire1.jpg">different crash</a> well over 80% of the airplane burned up.</p>

<p>I mean, I even literally said that those planes only skidded on the ground, they didn&#39;t crash straight into it.  It&#39;s why the non-burnt bits are still intact instead of shredded into a million pieces.  My point is just that it&#39;s totally feasible for that much aluminum to go up in smoke.</p>

<p>Read my first post.  I cited CNN showing a three mild debris field and the mayor of the town citing a Vietnam vet that says he heard a missile fired before the plane came down.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the three mile debris field is accepted fact.  How does that fit in with your theory that the plane hit the ground intact?  It doesn&#39;t; what you are saying is silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If by the gymnastics you mean the flip flopping and being all over the place with ideas or thoughts, then you are very right. I have no clue what happened or what debris fields would look like. But because I don&#39;t know what happened, I want to pose questions that make people think, those responses make me think. I really respect being told that I&#39;m wrong and having people present their view of truth, as long as they are thinking through it. I&#39;m happy to be on the other side of correctness as long as thought is involved. The only thing that really is disheartening is when people attack a thought without having their own thought to fall back on, and instead just using a cutting remark or blanket statement to prove someone wrong. I think some people get off on telling other people they are wrong. I mean, who hasn&#39;t done the things I&#39;m complaining about? I know I have, but am trying harder not to. 
I think people just love being invested emotionally in their &quot;side&quot;. And it is with everything. We argue on here about the event of 911, SandyHook, Boston bombing, mh370, mh17, Israel, Palestine, etc like we are rooting for a sports team. We are all so fucking invested in being right and being the one to win and prove someone else wrong, that we are robbing ourselves of really great debate and conversation. </p>
