<p>&quot;Soon above Ruin(I guess some derogatory name for Ukraine - &quot;Ukraina&quot; is Russian for Ukraine and &quot;Ruina&quot; is Russian for a ruin) an airliner stuffed full of euro-tourists will be shot down. This will be the reason for official NATO invitation. That&#39;s the way I see it&quot;</p>

<p>My Russian isn&#39;t that good but I think I got the translation about right there (feel free to correct).</p>

<p>This thread is about a tweet of how <strong>NATO</strong> was going to use a downed commercial jet to invade Ukraine. As an excuse to go to war. </p>

<p>The next person says &quot;Not saying it&#39;s impossible, but I&#39;ll believe it when we declare war.&quot;</p>

<p>In that context it is abundantly clear that we was meaning NATO. </p>

<p><strong>You</strong>, and nobody else, then changed it to the United States, to spew your garbage that fits your agenda and ignored reality. </p>

<p>Nobody except <strong>you</strong> said US. We was clearly referring to Nato. </p>

MH17 hadn&#39;t flown in that area in a number of days. I made no reference to other flights. This may not be evidence of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; but it is a piece of the puzzle as to why this tragedy happened. The plane wouldn&#39;t have been in range of a BUK in that area if the flight had taken a route similar to one in the days prior. </p>

<p>9:23am: A Qantas spokeswoman told our reporter Eryk Bagshaw its Dubai to London route flies 740 kilometers south of the flight path that MH17 was shot down in.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman said the Dubai-London flight used to fly over the same route as MH17, but Qantas made a precautionary decision some months ago to no longer fly over the area.
The spokeswoman was unable to comment on whether other One-World flight partners have continued to use the route.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the above is a little bit off.  your using flightaware and not observations from aircraft control/etc</p>

<p>MH17 flew this flight path for one reason - it was CHEAPER for cash strapped malaysian airlines than taking the US/British based route to the south.</p>

<p>they thought they were safe though - &quot;An industry source told The Telegraph: “The belief was that a plane could not be shot down at that altitude, which is why aircraft continue to fly over zones that have wars going on.”</p>

<p>with people assuming that the 33k was well above the missile range. guess we proved that one wrong.</p>

<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKFF/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sevastopol%27&amp;amp;req_state=&amp;amp;req_statename=Ukraine">http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKFF/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sevastopol%27&amp;amp;req_state=&amp;amp;req_statename=Ukraine</a></p>

<p>From about an hour before the shoot down there were thunderstorms in the area which continued for several hours. It&#39;s quite clear that the plane went further North to avoid the thunderstorm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will only mention the most important information he´s said,and in order, i took in account the time they were sent and stated it if i though it was important, it was done very quickly im sorry if i make some grammar errors:</p>

<p>The planes crashes (sent 8 hours ago)</p>

<p>Kiev authorities are trying to make it look like it was done by rebels.</p>

<p>It might have been taken down (sent 8 hours ago)</p>

<p>He mentions military personnel from Kiev got to the control tower and there´s foreign people with them.</p>

<p>He says two fighter jets escorted the plane until three minutes before it disappearead.</p>

<p>As soon as the plane disappeared the military personnel informed the people on the control tower that it was taken down, then he says it took hem seven minutes after it disappeared.</p>

<p>It was recorded on the radars that it was taken down by Kiev, they know it and the miitary personnel know it.</p>

<p>The military personnel are saying it was done by someone in the army they dont know whom, but certainly it wasnt pro-russian.</p>

<p>The minister of interior knew what the jets were doing there but the defense minister didnt.</p>

<p>The military personnel (MP from here on) confirm it was shot down by ukraine,but dont know where the order came from.</p>

<p>He says he mentioned in previous tweets that some MP are against the actual ukranian president.</p>

<p>Militar control officially confirms it was shot down (sent 3 hours ago).</p>

<p>He says the official reports doesnt mention where the missile came from but it wasnt from autodefense on rebel areas.</p>

<p>The high commanders are saying it came from the army but dont know where the order came from.</p>

<p>The MP at the orders of the minister of interior knew everything that was going on at any time.</p>

<p>The MP confirm it was taken down by ukraine.</p>

<p>Some MPs knew everything about what was going on, some didnt.</p>

<p>The way the MPs took control of the command tower minutes after it happened and them knowing all the detais made us think it was them.</p>

<p>The &quot;what have you done?&quot; face of the MPs that arrived later didnt leave any doubt.</p>

<p>The MPs that are accompanied by foreign people are asking the people in the control tower  to tell their version.</p>

<p>Our response was this radars dont pick up on missil signals, but military do, there isnt any doubt left.</p>

<p>The military report states where the missile came from, which is false.</p>

<p>If theres something new i will translate it.
I know some thing dont make sense because of the chronology but i just  translated what he said</p>

<p>Edit 1 : Some formatting.
Edit 2: More formatting, corrected some gramatical errors and changed interior minister to minister of interior.</p>

<p>Edit 3: apparently i cant see his tweets now or follow him, does someone have access?</p>

<p>“I can say that Putin’s plane and the Malaysian Boeing intersected at the same point and the same echelon. That was close to Warsaw on 330-m echelon at the height of 10,100 meters. The presidential jet was there at 16:21 Moscow time and the Malaysian aircraft - 15:44 Moscow time,” a source told the news agency on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>&quot;The contours of the aircrafts are similar, linear dimensions are also very similar, as for the coloring, at a quite remote distance they are almost identical&quot;, the source added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Looking at the flight paths of the plane in the last week don&#39;t seem that odd, they follow the same path KL to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to KL. </p>

<p>But while flying near Black Sea or Ukraine, all past flight paths divert course purposefully in this area. Their not completely the same not too off course.</p>

<p>Flight path a week before shot down - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmQwZd7.png">07/11/2014 06:36PM MYT</a></p>

<p>Friday (path and location shot down) - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SoFAT4c.png">07/17/2014 06:30PM MYT</a></p>

<p>Edit: looking at the last photo the path looks diverted way further to the original previous flight paths. It was intentional and perfectly steady cruising.</p>

So as this is the farthest north I think you could still chalk it up to slight deviations in flight pattern that could result from other air traffic and weather. </p>

<p>Conspiracy Theories are pure speculation, it&#39;s what this entire subreddit is about. We aren&#39;t the fucking news. We just read it and analyze it.</p>

<p>It ultimately doesn&#39;t mean anything and most of us do it simply because we enjoy piecing things together and seeing what unfolds. </p>

<p>Now, onto the main points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fairly sure separatists claimed responsibility</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you fucking serious? You accuse us of speculating and spreading misinformation when there hasn&#39;t been a single article that claims that the Pro-Russian Ukrainians took credit for the missile!?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then immediately retracted after they realized it was a commercial plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, the US and the International media would be ALL THE FUCK OVER THAT. They aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>No one knows who fired the missile. Regardless of what the data reveals, Russia and Kiev will point fingers at each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll call this like I see it. If the news shifts to the Gaza conflict and everyone gets quiet about Ukraine, you will know for a fact that Kiev fired that fucking missile, to try and take a shot at Putin. Can&#39;t blame them for wanting him out of the picture but, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they goofed. </p>

<p>Puppet governments are VERY bad at dealing with shit because they&#39;re too concerned about lining their own pockets. Mass executions and labor camps, they can do...Anything with finesse requires competence and a competent puppet government is an oxymoron.</p>

<p>Look at Iraq! You can give a government ALL the fucking tools to get the job done but, if you throw a bunch of corrupt &quot;Yes-Men&quot; in charge, you will always get the same results.</p>

<p>An utter clusterfuck.</p>

<p>I always see this excuse. Wouldn&#39;t it be fair, to propose that if what was told as the official story turned out to be a lie, that such a situation is <em>more</em> offensive to the victims? That actually doing your own investigation is indeed the farthest thing from being disrespectful to those victims?</p>

<p>How do you know to a certainty the flight wasn&#39;t cancelled? All you need to do is prove the Flight tracker has been tempered with.</p>

<p>The loss of life can still be a factor, if the flight was cancelled <em>with the passengers on board,</em> and they are still missing, there is very real potential for <em>some</em> kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>More likely than &quot;someone changing it to fuck with nut jobs&quot;, as that would likely result in a loss of their job, it could be that &quot;cancelled&quot; is a better term than &quot;shot down over a war zone.&quot; But even that seems unlikely.

What would Ukraine gain by shooting down Putin&#39;s plane? Surely Russia would see the assassination of their leader as an act of war (and rightfully so).

However, all the different nations were held together by one man only, Josip Broz Tito. When he died Yugoslavia was dismantled politically, then their member states plunged into war with eachother.
It was a silent coup by the west, and even Chomsky wrote about Yugoslavia being one successful socialist model in the world.</p>

<p>Putin has been in office for 16 years now in Russia, I shudder to think what would happen if he were killed somehow and the oligarchs get hold of its governing process. It would be WW3 no doubt about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a pretty ignorant statement, considering the US is a failing empire that feeds on war and plundering resources.</p>

<p>It needs another cold war to excuse increasing surveillance and eroding of freedoms daily. The US citizens need to wake up to the reality that their rouge government is causing mayhem all over the world and stop them, or be stopped.</p>

<p>Looking at your comments now I see you&#39;re very hardline on your stance, maybe even paid for it. Feigning ignorance is common among shills everywhere, be it deliberate or unintentional, it is stil ignorance.</p>

<p>who gives a shit how the aircraft look? At 12 miles it is at the edge, if not beyond human visual range. hell the closest the plane could pass would be 6 miles...its 200 feet long...you will never see the colors. it would be smaller than the dot that is this period.</p>

<p>Also WTF. the planes were near each other in poland (wait whats that, they were in the same grid about an HOUR apart...so in reality no where near eachother). who gives a shit? at 550 mph the closest they came was about a rhode island (long ways) apart</p>

<p>This was posted on militia leader Igor Girkin Russian&#39;s &#39;Russian Facebook&#39; page (Cam Strelkov) by people who run his page. </p>

<p>As they state on the their page <a href="https://vk.com/strelkov_info">HERE</a> this was not information from Strelkov himself - as his posts are marked/highlighted with banners indicating when it is him posting. Similar to when Obama or whoever signs his tweets with his initials.</p>

<p>However this has not stopped Western media reporting that a militia leader claimed he took out the plane then deleted the post.</p>

<p>Ukrainian Interior Ministry official Anton Gerashchenko said on Facebook: &quot;Just now, over Torez, terrorists using a Buk anti-aircraft system kindly given to them by Putin have shot down a civilian airliner flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.&quot;</p>

<p>So the &quot;rebels not having buks&quot; idea seems bunk now, they clearly do, there are videos of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How convenient that these videos are posted today and in English calling the rebels Russian terrorists. Seriously? Check the sources. There is absolutely no way to verify this footage but as it fits your narrative you are quite happy to accept. Anything to bash the Russians right? You realise Ukraine forces reportedly moved BUK missiles to the region on Wednesday?</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t. Locals on social media saw the crashed plane, filmed it and said a Ukraine cargo plane was downed then posted in a forum that rebels had downed a Ukraine plane. </p>

<p>This was posted on militia leader Igor Girkin Russian&#39;s &#39;Russian Facebook&#39; page (Cam Strelkov) by people who run his page.</p>

<p>As they state on the their page <a href="https://vk.com/strelkov_info">HERE</a> this was not information from Strelkov himself - as his posts are marked/highlighted with banners indicating when it is him posting. Similar to when Obama or whoever signs his tweets with his initials.</p>

<p>However this has not stopped Western media reporting that a militia leader claimed he took out the plane then deleted the post. Just because something is &#39;all over the internet&#39; and repeated over and over by Western media does not make it true.</p>

You have to remember that private corporations are the ones innovating whatever advanced technology might be in question, not the government in and of itself.

<p>Btw, if MAS is in financial trouble, that makes you.. corruptable. Fly there and there then and then with these and these people, we&#39;ll give you xx million dollarz. </p>

<p>For what value of XX would MAS say yes?</p>

<p>Because the guy who inherited the patent that was invented by the people on MH370 certainly has enough dollars for whatever number MAS could , or apparantly has, come up with. </p>

<p>1:22 - &quot;Now I&#39;m going to test your numerology skills by asking you to think about the magic seven&quot;</p>

<p>1:34 - &quot;Most of you will know that seven is quite a number</p>

<p>2:24 - &quot;2014, you drop the zero, fourteen, two times, seven&quot;</p>

<p>4:08 - &quot;It will mark the 70th anniversary, 70th anniversary, drop the zero, seven, of the Bretton Woods Conference that actually gave birth to the IMF&quot; (7 + 0 = 7)</p>

<p>4:22 - &quot;And it will be the 25th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall, 25th..&quot; (2 + 5 = 7)</p>

<p>4:38 - &quot;It will also mark the 7th anniversary of the financial market jitters&quot;</p>

<p>5:08 - &quot;After those seven miserable years, weak and fragile&quot;</p>

<p>5:14 - &quot;We have seven strong years&quot;</p>

<p>5:43 - &quot;Now I don&#39;t know if the G7 will have anything to do with it&quot; (G is also the 7th letter of the alphabet)</p>

<p>Exactly - numerology, esoteric symbolism, etc.</p>

<p>There is no question that many of the most powerful people on earth (and through history) are totally obsessed with this stuff - the evidence is everywhere, from art to architecture to writings that go back millennia. </p>

<p>Do I believe in it? Do you?</p>

<p>Irrelevant.</p>

<p>Point is that many very powerful people believe, and they are the ones that can make shit happen.</p>

<p>The only reason why I am ANY bit convinced about the significance of numbers/numerology this year/this month/within these current circumstances is because the fucking HEAD OF THE IMF gave a long speech discussing numerology and the &quot;magic number 7&quot; (!!!). The head of the IMF is a pretty fucking serious position. Don&#39;t you find it kind of strange that somebody in such a high position of power would go out of her way to entertain batshit crazy OCD/schitzo conspiratards if there wasn&#39;t SOME significance to it?

    <div class="md"><p>the above is how a good conspiracy theory gets started.  do a little internet searching.  .get some out of context information. . .and then run with it (only MH17 went through this space)</p>

<p>In the days leading up the MH17 a LOT of planes went through that space</p>

<p>US, Europe,and British avoided the space but a lot of planes based in other countries (like Russia) flew over that space.  just look online. . .easy to get a list.  Why was MH17 flying over a war zone</p>

<p>because its cheaper</p>

<p>if anyone is to blame, its malaysian airlines </p>

<p>and stupid people shooting rockets at jets they don&#39;t know what they are</p>

<p>Maybe it was pilot error that led the plane over this dangerous region, which in turn made the separatists think it was an Antonov military plane, as normally there wouldn&#39;t be any passenger jets there.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t carry a pathogen on a passenger plane.  It&#39;s illegal.</p>

<p>You could always try to smuggle it, but that&#39;s a bad idea.  Luggage is x-rayed.  That would kill or extremely damage your samples.</p>

<p>Not to mention HIV is a fragile virus that cannot surive long in the enviroment, let alone an explosion followed by crashing into the earth.  Not to mention a lot of wreckage is still smoldering and fire is a very good way to kill a virus.</p>

<p>If it magically makes it to the ground....now what?  Someone would have to get large amounts of the virus in an open wound.  The timetable for this is pretty shot.  Even the hardiest viruses can&#39;t survive forever outside of a host and HIV won&#39;t last an hour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28299334"><strong>14 July</strong> - Ukraine military plane shot down as fighting rages</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Ukrainian military transport aircraft has been shot down in the east, amid fighting with pro-Russian separatist rebels, Ukrainian officials say.</p>

<p>They say the An-26 plane was hit at an altitude of 6,500m (21,325ft).</p>

<p>The plane was targeted with &quot;a more powerful missile&quot; than a shoulder-carried missile, &quot;probably fired&quot; from Russia. The crew survived, reports say.</p>

<p>Someone told them to do it, possibly to distract the world from Gaza, or for some other reason we could speculate about. Someone also must have instructed the pilot to fly through that area rather than taking the ordinary route for that flight over the sea.

    <div class="md"><p>2) Even wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector</a> is saying somthing about it. But those organizations are just the tip of the iceberg. You cannot have so many right wing or openly neo-nazi organizations without social institutions being (education, culture, etc) subverted to produce people inclined to join such organizations or at least follow their line of thought. But who made those changes to those social institutions? </p>

<p>Here we are coming to the core of Ukrainian civil war (we shall not deny this &#39;conflict&#39; its proper name). There is one ethnicity, but there  are two cultural identities, &#39;Russian&#39; and &#39;Galician&#39;, the first not needing much introduction and the latter stemming from that is now western-Ukraine and that previously was part of  Austrian empire. After fall of soviet union &#39;Galicians&#39; extremists with some help from West gained power and started to subvert above mentioned social institutions with the goal of cultural assimilation of &#39;Russians&#39;. While this process was relatively slow it was more or less painless, and people didn&#39;t mind it, but the later process stopped at 50%/50% ratio. Deadlocks started to happen. The first deadlock was solved with &#39;forced recalculation of votes&#39; by &#39;Galicians&#39; in 2008. The second deadlock of 2013-2014 was resolved with much more violence, not only in Kiev, but in other places as well. This violence went unnoticed by majority of Ukrainian officials <strong>because at this point most of officials already were sharing  view of  &#39;Russians&#39; being sub-humans.</strong> Later their actions in regard to language laws and their actions in eastern territory dispersed even latest bit of doubt. (For example people who burned alive &#39;Russians&#39; in Odessa got away with it). Almost forgot good old prohibition of communistic party with killing of some prominent figures from it. </p>

<p>To summarize: many of the things happening in Ukraine now could only happen if and only if majority of officials and politicians were supporting neo-nazies in one way or another sharing their outlook.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I agree with anyone thinking that, but come on. Soviet occupation starving millions of people (and for what a noble cause!)

<p>This contradicts even wikipedia version of history. Please, could you educate yourself first, even a little bit? This is not even biased view, it is some grotesque version of propaganda.</p>

<p>Considering famine episode in worth noticing the leader back then was Georgian and most of mid-level functionaries were Jews. Russians and other ethnicities suffered as much as other back then. There numerous issues with this &quot;Holodomor&quot; thing, but nowadays anything anti-Russian will do. One don&#39;t need to check the fact or now a thing. If something bad happened it was  either terrorists or Russians. </p>

<p>Third, has you read bout difference being cultural one? The communists were as much different as those two archetypes I&#39;ve described. Many Russian people were against communism and fought in civil war against it. Yet you are equating Russians with Communists.</p>

<p>Also, look at this episode with plane. Governments has all kinds of satellite info, yet for some reason withholding it, while press is raging &quot;Russians did it&quot;. The whole situation could be made clear quickly, yet it isn&#39;t and Russians blamed for it. The same with history, but with even less factual information and more propaganda. Keep it in mind. </p>

5- missile exploded as expected. . .killing everyone before they ht the ground (within 30 seconds)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the real kicker here. The U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have both done accidental shoot downs before. And they weren&#39;t even combatants in a war at the time. From a PR perspective, the best thing to do would be to get out in front of this thing. Admit you made a mistake, but explain the circumstances. Its war, and these things happen.</p>

<p>Of course, to do that, the rebels would have to admit they got a BuK SA-11, amongst other equipment, from Russia. While everyone &quot;knows&quot; that, Russia doesn&#39;t want anyone to be able to &quot;prove&quot; it.</p>

<p>So instead, we get lies, accusations, and a bunch of innocent people rotting in a field. Very sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 - posted above, and elsewhere. . US satellite captured both the BUK launching and the BUK moving back to Russia with one less missile.  This leads me to believe and understand why Russia is covering up, hiding, etc.  They want to &quot;pretend&quot; that they are not in Ukraine.  </p>

<p>2- No evidence that a commercial airliner was targeted. Intercepted communications (by Ukraine) fits with what it looks like. BUK was firing missiles without primary radar. The Buk can&#39;t tell the difference between commercial and war planes.  Chances are the people made a assumption that if its in the air, it must be war. . .even though 70 planes flew over the same area within the last 2 days before this. . with other planes going minutes before and after . . .</p>

<p>bottom line, it was a mistake of war.  The coverup is Russia and NOT because they shot down a commercial plane (thats no big deal, US has done it before and admitted). . .the big deal is that - i&#39;m guessing - Russians pulled the trigger and not Ukraine separatists. .. </p>

You say stupid #@! like &quot;hey thats a clean passport&quot; and other insane and idiotic observations.

TR is saying it was another jet fighter (already partially disproven due to the fragment pattern on the jet). . and the area was under (widespread knowledge) separatists control. . .so why would the Ukraine . .

    <div class="md"><p>if you don&#39;t think that america has a dog in this race then you&#39;re not paying attention.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard for you to imagine this but there are people in russia, china, heck even north korea who believe America is basically just a phony democracy where deluded and brainwashed people idly vote for politician A or politician B despite the fact no matter who they vote for the same things happens - change you can believe in? change to what? a new front in the eternal war?! people from the rest of the world have media which doesn&#39;t sensor things like the war in iraq, when you see embedded journalists talking to shills and crowds cheering as the american flag is draped over saddams face and the statue pulled down everyone else is hearing the vile american invaders staged a PR stunt for the cameras while all across iraq mass anti-american protests raged.  They&#39;re also seeing blown up homes, pictures of bloody bodies, crying children and all sorts of things that american tv simple does not show.  </p>

<p>The world perception of america is as a vile warmonger, i mean you think what Israel is doing to Palestine is wrong? America literally carpet bombed north vietnam with chemical weapons and fire! they use white phosphorous in iraq and set up zones where they kill everyone inside no matter who they are - this is the sort of thing the rest of the world hears about america.  </p>

<p>and when america says &#39;hey putin probably was behind that false flag terrror attack on that school&#39; everyone in the rest of the world says &#39;yeah exactly as likely as bush is to have been behind the twin towers lol.&#39; -are they both nonsense? both true? it&#39;s impossible to know, simply saying &#39;i&#39;m american and i don&#39;t believe america would do such things but the russians would&#39; is not a valid argument, it&#39;s mindless jingoism -exactly the thing you&#39;re laughing at other nations for!  </p>

<p>how many times have you seen CNN spend a week obsessing over schools being bombed by american forces? exactly never. how many times have they obsessed over an airliner crash? every time it happens, well unless it&#39;s iranian and america did it....  </p>

<p>The world has a different perspective on america and the actions of america nationally - likewise people inside russia often have a very biased view of russia, russian patriots and conformists would say &#39;of course russia wouldn&#39;t do such things, russia is protecting itself from nato - russia is not invading countries around the world and imposing it&#39;s will with an iron fist, it is hard working mother country producing oil in the cold and trying to survive against american attacks like aways...&#39;  </p>

<p>american media is HUGELY controlled, this is very obvious when you actually look for it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0fjdU3Jp8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0fjdU3Jp8</a> is a great documentary made by a war correspondent [started in vietnam] about how biased the media can be in it&#39;s coverage, especially with embedded reporters and the like.  </p>

<p>imagine if you will a russian chap call igor polvinski, igor wants to learn about america so he goes to school and asks what america is like &#39;it&#39;s a terrible place where the media is biased and the politicians are evil&#39; and then he turns on the television and the film is about corruption in american politics or about how crazy nutters in america might destroy russia simply because they&#39;re bonkers and powermad -fiilms like Dr Strangelove for example or Spies Like Us.. </p>

<p>This person then starts to develop an image of america so they look at american media where there are two choices presented to them translated FOX news and RT translating interviews with Alex Jones and others of the same type - obviously fox makes him think &#39;wow these fucking nutters are fucking nutters, they&#39;re barely human they&#39;re so blood thirsty and ravenous!&#39; then Alex Jones says &#39;omg fema camps, poison the water supply, they want to take over the world, iraq was an illigal war!&#39; and they&#39;re like, wow yeah the sane people in america have it really hard, poor alex living in such a mad world...  </p>

<p>then someone says &#39;no you&#39;ve got it all wrong, they&#39;re not like that,,,; and the person says &#39;no fuck you american sympathiser you&#39;re wrong because look at this report from china about american human rights! look at this essay by chompsky on how the press in america is totally owned by a small cartel of economic elite that tied directly to the military industrial complex, look at this report endorsed by everywhere not complicit that says iraq was without a doubt a war of aggression and bush and blare should be tried in the hague for war crimes....  </p>

<p>i mean that&#39;s where it&#39;s at - blare and bush literally did the same crime the nazi&#39;s swung for, starting a war of aggression - there was no link between the towers being bombed and Iraq, it was an oil grab. when people in russia, china and anywhere outside the very narrow western mindset see&#39;s that they consider america to be just as dodgey as russia.    </p>

<p>so no, america does not get a magic pass where we accept whatever it says just because it says it - it either proves it or it shuts the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)&quot; russia, china, heck even north korea who believe America is basically just a phony democracy where deluded and brainwashed people idly vote for politician A&quot;</p>

<p>The opinions of persons within states that excessive full control over their media isn&#39;t a reliable source. in fact. Plus i&#39;m in marketing, perceptions are not reality - 1st truth.  Just because people believe something doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>

<p>2) i&#39;m not aware of Putin false flag attacks nor any source information on it. So I can&#39;t comment. 9/11 was solved quickly (Saudi terrorists/Osama) and Russia isn&#39;t involved</p>

<p>3) Media isn&#39;t &quot;controlled&quot;.  You have to do more than show some video. . .control equals some evidence of a connection and stories being manipulated.  Your nativity on the media process not withstanding the only control is WHAT MAKES MONEY.  We have a #@! media sure. . .but its not one of control.  People don&#39;t want to watch certain crap - and so the media doesn&#39;t always show it.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t make some crazy accusation that goes against the very constitution (Freedom of press) without evidence.  Cherry picking news stories you think they should covered is meaningless.  If media is controlled WHY DO WE ALLOW YOUTUBE?  come on.  On one hand you tell me about control, the second you show me a VIDEO from the f&#39;n website within the US that is how most people consumer their MEDIA. Now that is IRONIC</p>

<p>4)Alex Jones - if you put him in an argument, that guy discredits you. he is like a rotten apple. Such a media hungry/money hungry idiot that he will say any conspiracy to get more ratings.  Just as CNN caters to mom and dads. . .alex jones caters to crazies. And get this - HE IS ALLOWED TO EXIST. So is he part of the big plot? if media is controlled why IS HE HERE</p>

<p>5) Your lack of knowledge on WWII is something.  Nazi&#39;s went to death for 6 million jews, slave labor, and yes - a aggressive war.   Maybe you could accuse blair/bush on aggressive war. . but if you win the war, you don&#39;t get punished for that.</p>

<p>America doesn&#39;t get a &quot;magic pass&quot; - but it is a credible source of information and unless you have a source/statement from the state department that is proven to be a lie (and not early/misinformed) . . .not sure how you can sit there and type/argue different. </p>

<p>No magic pass needed, if you got a pretty damn good track record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i already have, watch the documentary i posted it has reporters and government officials explaining how the lie was passed off.   </p>

<p>or here&#39;s one of the people responsible for inventing the lie;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/man-whose-wmd-lies-led-to-100000-deaths-confesses-all-7606236.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/man-whose-wmd-lies-led-to-100000-deaths-confesses-all-7606236.html</a>  </p>

<p>here&#39;s someone writing about some more lies;  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-schwarz/colin-powell-wmd-iraq-war_b_2624620.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-schwarz/colin-powell-wmd-iraq-war_b_2624620.html</a>  </p>

<p>such classic deceptions as &#39;Powell played an intercept of a conversation between Iraqi army officers about the UN inspections. However, when he translated what they were saying, he knowingly embellished it, turning it from evidence Iraq was complying with U.N. resolutions to evidence Iraq was violating them.&#39;  </p>

<p>here&#39;s another talking about how the security services were totally aware this is a lie...  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/panorama-iraq-fresh-wmd-claims</a>  </p>

<p>there are hundreds of similar stories for reputable sources, it&#39;s quite clear the US and British governments knew they wanted to go into Iraq so they could gain gain control of the oil reserves and pipelines - this led to them cooking up absurd stories and fake intelligence so they could lie to the people and convince them to accept the mass murder of millions in their name. it&#39;s all absolutely vile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The analyst/defector lied - that is admitted it seems.  . .but</p>

<p>I no doubt understand and believe that the administration wanted to believe in IRAQ WMD and the reason to go to war.  As an administration they listened to people who lied to them (such as your 1st point).  I&#39;m sure that people who had concerns were afraid to voice them. . .because the administration KNEW there weapons of mass destruction. . .they KNEW it, don&#39;t you dare challenge the president on this.</p>

<p>they ignored evidence (no doubt in my mind) that conflicted with their view.  They were stupid, and incompetent.  .that is no doubt. They exaggerated evidence that they did have. ..</p>

<p>I think this silo vision and ignoring of the evidence that conflicted with their world view DID allow 9/11 to happen (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html?_r=0</a>)</p>

<p>but its not proof of a lie. . .its proof of what happens in an organisation when boss wants to go with plan A and all the people working for him are pussies. I&#39;ve seen it at my work too. . .it happens.</p>

<p>its not lying</p>

<p>its being stupid</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heh you can excuse anything using that kind of argument, we might as well let all criminals out of jail because they probably just accidentally brought cocaine instead of sugar and that gun? they probably got told it was a horse and didn&#39;t want to upset anyone by disagreeing...  </p>

<p>it get&#39;s to the point where either they were guilty of purposefully doing these things or extreme guilty of criminal negligence.  </p>

<p>if it&#39;s possible they can be so criminally negligent once it takes us to exactly the same point as before, anyone that can fuck up enough to kill millions of innocent people in a war which turns out to be illegitimate has forfeited and right to be trusted at any point in the foreseeable future - therefore to go back to our original point, there is absolutely no reason to trust their word on what intelligence they have, maybe the subordinates are again too scared to contradict the president? if that&#39;s how they got into iraq then it might be how they fuck up the situation in the Crimea too...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no you&#39;re not being a sceptic you&#39;re being a believer, it&#39;s pretty simply burden of proof; </p>

<p>claim made - america has pictures which prove Russia&#39;s guilt.  </p>

<p>evidence required - the pictures.  </p>

<p>asking for evidence of claims and not believing statements until they&#39;re proven is scepticism, i&#39;m being sceptical of americas claim to posses pictures which implicate russia.  </p>

<p>you&#39;re disregarding the need for proof and in fact arguing that they shouldn&#39;t provide proof because according to you whatever they release won&#39;t be good enough, which of course is another assumption based on nothing but your personal emotions and faulty reasoning.  </p>

<p>What should happen is if America believe they have evidence which implicates russia in the form of areal photography they release an annotated version of it expounding their case to the international community and global population - this then put&#39;s you in a position where you can say &#39;yes, here is the evidence&#39; and if i say &#39;ahh but maybe it&#39;s drawn by disney...&#39; you can say &#39;oh you people will say anything!&#39; but i probably wouldn&#39;t say that unless it was very poor lineart...  </p>

<p>1) separatist territory
2) separatist shot down jets before and after MH17 (do you disagree that the separatist were targeting and shooting down jets, including 2 fighters AFTER mh17)
3) pictures from crash show clear damage from a externally detonated missile
4) US analysts confirm evidence of a missile launch/BUK system ( THOUGH US HAS SAID THAT THEY CAN&#39;T SAY FOR SURE 100% who fired the missile).</p>

<p>skeptic says - okay all evidence points toward Russian separatist. . so where is evidence to the contrary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no you&#39;re muddying the water now, most of that is nothing to do with what we&#39;re talking about and they have no place is this discussion.  </p>

<p>We are talking about the photos america claims to have which prove the BUK systems were in place at the time, this is a fairly simply thing - there is exactly one important thing, do the photos exist? and exactly one way of answering that - yes, here are the photos.  </p>

<p>any other answer of &#39;yes they exist but i forgot them, the dog ate them, i was in Chicago at the time...&#39; just won&#39;t wash, it equates to no.  </p>

<p>no one is asking them to prove things they haven&#39;t asserted, if they say they have a picture showing there was a russian BUK in the region that is all they need to do, show the picture and we have a solid point to work from - we know both parties definitely had BUKs in the area.  </p>

<p>as it stands we have Russian images clearly demonstrating Ukrainian BUK movements in the close vicinity, no images clearly demonstrating rebel or Russian BUKs. </p>

<p>it&#39;s not a case of &#39;is the sky blue&#39; because we all look at the sky every day. you don&#39;t look at BUK movements everyday.  It&#39;s like living in a cave and someone coming down and saying &#39;comrade the sky is red like mother russia&#39; but then someone else comes down and says &#39;i have seen the sky and it is blue like the tears of our enemies!&#39; then they argue and the american says he has a picture of the blue sky so the yank says &#39;comrades i also have a picture of the sky and it is a red sky&#39; and he pulls out the picture and waves it around for everyone to see, it&#39;s an artistic image with shepherds delighting in the foreground. So everyone in the room is like &#39;well, where is this picture &#39;merica?!&#39; and america is like &#39;uh.... annalists have it, national security, TOP SECRET.&#39; and everyone else is like, &#39;pffffft whatever&#39; and side with russia and glorious communist revolution happens...  </p>

<p>1) you&#39;re saying maybe the pictures they have don&#39;t actually prove what they suggest and were they to show people they&#39;d say &#39;don&#39;t be fucking ridiculous, this is even worse intel then the fucking WMD bullshit you pulled last time!&#39;  </p>

<p>having rubbish evidence is not the same as having conclusive evidence.  </p>

<p>The Russian satellite images show something that is either a BUK or a replica BUK and there&#39;s no doubting that, they also match the topography and other images of the area they claim to be very clearly.  Why Ukraine could theoreticallybe moving around replica BUKs is a question not even a question worth asking, it looks like a BUK it is a BUK;  </p>

<p>If america can produce pictures which look like reasonably a BUK then i will likewise assume that it&#39;s an actual BUK...  </p>

<p>2) if their images are too high res then lower the res to just above google quality, so what?  </p>

<p>if they don&#39;t have images but used some other technology then the answer is still &#39;no they do not have an image, yes they lied.&#39; </p>

<p>if they had sophisticated technology recording it then they should say &#39;we had sophisticated technology detect it, we can&#39;t tell you about it sorry...&#39; that&#39;s a different thing entirely, what they said is they have a picture that clearly shows BUK movements, either they do or they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Now, in other countries? VERY different. I don&#39;t know what their radar setups are like, but I do know there are ENORMOUS gaps in quite a few areas. A la MH370 and the Air France flight from a few years ago. </p>

 russia has exactly just as much to gain. 
If the international media spins it into it being Ukraine&#39;s fault then russia gets to take a lovely stroll all the way through ukraine without nato lifting a finger or the EU getting involved. they no longer have to deal with any sanctions, and putib gets to be one step closer to his dream of the soviet bloc nations being dependent on, and part of, mother russia. it is just as possible , and has just as many advantages for Russia as it does for Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, Us intelligence says your wrong. I believe them.</p>

<p>it was a Russian SAM and these Separatists (backed by Russia) were shooting down 3-4 planes within the week.  So likely they were shooting down another plane, and the idiots didn&#39;t know it was a commercial flight.</p>

<p>The reality is, if they knew, they WOULDN&#39;T of done it. I don&#39;t think Russian or their backed boys in Ukraine ever wanted this to happen. 100% chance they are working to misdirect right now and clean up so we can never prove -100% - who shot it down.  they even moved the launcher that did the deed back into russian territory.

<p>Did you believed them when they claimed there were WMD&#39;s in Iraq? We now know this was a lie. </p>

<p>Did you also believed them when they claimed they had evidence that Assad used poison gas on civilians in Syria? We now know, thanks to the UN investigation that it was the rebels backed by the USA who did it.  </p>

<p>Almost every single excuse the USA has used to justify further occupation and war in the middle-east has been shown to be a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another theory you guys can consider..</p>

<p>Governments are tying to create frictions against the allies between Malaysia and Russia. </p>

<p>In January 2013 - Malaysia is the first country to step out to public stating they pledge to stand with Palestine. Malaysia also a strong communist country. Soviet Union has always been strong support to Malaysia.</p>

<p>In Late 2013 - Israel was found to bought Boeing 777 from Malaysia airline and was kept in Tel Aviv, just being parked there.</p>

<p>In March 2014 - Mh 370 mysteriously went missing. With unknown cargo. Until today, the Malaysia government didnt answer, why the weight of cargo given and the things in the cargo didn&#39;t not match up. </p>

<p>In July 2017 - Before MH17 incident, Malaysia government publicly announce they will stand with Palestine. with Strong message &quot;<a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/ge/newsgeneral.php?id=1054045">http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/ge/newsgeneral.php?id=1054045</a>&quot; </p>

<p>Also Israel has start ground attacks, Malaysia attention has been diverted to MH17. </p>

<p>The video that caught the explosion of MH17, was exploded on ground. If it were shot down, wont there be trail of smoke from the skies and to the ground??</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rightthisminute.com/video/malaysia-airlines-boing777-allegedly-shot-down-over-ukraine">http://www.rightthisminute.com/video/malaysia-airlines-boing777-allegedly-shot-down-over-ukraine</a></p>

<p>All of these does not match up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not rule out the chance this was a provocative act by the west. Not a false flag, but still intentionally motivated. Malaysian airlines loses all communication with MH17 after crossing the Western border of Ukraine, is supposedly guided from its original southern flight path by two fighter jets directly over the no fly zone...The plane was intentionally sent flying over Donetsk, while guided by two fighter air craft, making it appear as a military plane....Separatists shoot it down and the west finally has a credible reason to gain international support for its campaign against Russia</p>

<p>Basically what I am saying right here:</p>

this is what I think it has to do with.
Big Pharma would fall to pieces, who knows if any of the people on that plan had a cure, needing funding for trials for a cure etc. it does not surprise  me one bit theories circulating around the US supplying or somehow supporting this and covering it up as Russias fault</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://youtu.be/6vYaRtY27iY">Proof of NATO involvement in false flag attack on MH17?</a></p>

<p>Turns out there was a live drill last month which involved NATO fighters shadowing commercial airliners, jamming their transponders and broadcasting a military transponder signal in its place. This would explain the reports of Ukrainian SU-25s shadowing MH17 - electronic warfare to make the 777 appear like a hostile military plane to the missile crews.</p>

EDIT: The Su-27 (I forgot to mention) is an air superiority fighter...The SU-25 (Best plane in the world IMO) is a CAS aircraft, but does have R-60 air to air missile capable of shooting down hostile helicopters and low flying jets. It is also equipped with a 30 mm cannon that can rip tanks to pieces :)</p>

It&#39;s easy, if shit is going to hit the fan gold goes up, it it&#39;s not, gold goes down.  Gold initially went up on the news of the crash, now it&#39;s creeping back down because Washington has told the money men not to worry, they&#39;ll just use it to encourage the EU to cut gas purchases from Russia.  Hence, not a false flag - it&#39;s a real incident but it won&#39;t result in WW3 so we can all get back to Bieber.</p>

A lot of news media outlets don&#39;t even bother with reporting the situation there and the American government don&#39;t even seem to be taking it serious. Both wars are pretty much identical in terms of the situation (land grabbing) so since the Ukrainian-Russian situation has gone quiet it became an opportunity for the bigger powers to relocate their focus on Russia (an important power in our world) again using the Ukrainian government to shoot MH17 down. </p>

<p>Anyone remember that shit back in the day called the webbot? Anyone remember how shortly before it went offline and what have you, it mentioned scientists and other prominent people going missing?</p>

<p>I think if I had unlimited resources, this is how I would kidnap those I want to utilize whether for my nefarious plot to conquer the world, or the cliche of we are pulling the best,and brightest for our breakaway civilization.</p>

<p>I know, crazy.. But I do believe it is really easy to A: swap a plane midair for another, or B: switch planes before takeoff. Either way, I think planes are easily disguiseable as a different plane </p>

The imperial-piratical system in place in the U.S. post-Cold War cannot, nor does it seek, to outperform in kind the stabilist mercantile forms at which Germany and Japan excel (neither, of course, does it have the demographic reserves of a vigorously industrialized China), rather, it pursues through the force of unequaled military might (legacy of its unscathed position after WWII) to create and determine the very terms of order and even of existence on this Earth, but—and this is key—not through the imposition/maintenance of a stable and expansive Pax Americana, but rather through the supposedly controlled disruptive yet creative potential of perpetual war throughout the unconcluded project of history.</p>

<p>Regardless of the last 20 years of insanity in this country, America and Americans have improved the world immeasurably.</p>

<p>War has been perpetual throughout history, that&#39;s not America&#39;a fault.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve fed billions of people, spent hundreds of trillions on global wellfare, and sacrificed our lives for the health and safety of the people on this planet. Yet &#39;America&#39; is the bad guy?</p>

It contained twitter screenshots, translations and a link to a spanish RT video. As far as i know he received death threats and was deported (to spain) and wants to stay anonymous (but i think is first name is Joseph if i remember correctly).</p>

<p>I wanted to show that site to a friend who is also intrested in hearing all the sides on this and the article simply doesnt exist anymore. Does anyone have a good source that is still online, other than imgur screenshots and reddit threads?</p>

<p>One crashed into an open field. So it hit the ground. And you can clearly see the wreckage from the plane from all angles.</p>

<p>The other crashed <em>into a building</em>. So it didn&#39;t just hit the ground. Again, it crashed <em>into a building</em>. So the wreckage from the plane will be less visible. It will be mixed with the wreckage from the building, and not visible from all angles and harder to spot. <a href="http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm">But it&#39;s still there.</a></p>

<p>The flight that got shot down deviated from it&#39;s original path slightly. They might have planned to have it collide with Putin&#39;s plane &quot;by accident&quot;. Putin&#39;s intelligence knew and shot it down.</p>

<p>The first Malaysian plane surved the purpose of showing the world that this series of planes from Malaysia Airlines has a faulty navigation that makes them deviate from their path. So the first one got lost, and the second one crashed into another plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Made a throw away because I usually just lurk here.</p>

<p>First let me say, this is a tragedy, if it is as we&#39;re being told, a case of trigger happy pro Russian rebels with access to sophisticated weaponry getting carried away or mistaken and shooting MH17 down. </p>

<p>However, because I love a good conspiracy, and because this just feels like way too much of a coincidence, this theory popped into my head. Feel free to pull it apart completely as it has pretty much no basis other than conjecture. I could be joining dots where there are none and I have my tin foil hat on for this, so I&#39;m ready to get torn down.</p>

<p>My first assumption is that this is not what it seems. I always start by asking the question when extraordinary events happen, &quot;who stands to benefit&quot;? There is nothing to suggest anything out of the ordinary with this yet, but bear with me. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that MH370 (the other one) was taken by a rogue element of a nation state (we&#39;ll call them Blue) that had reason to believe its political and economic interests in another country were under threat of attack. Blue, had intelligence that a plan was underway by another nation state, let&#39;s call them Red, to regain their former power and influence. However for political reasons both domestically and internationally, this Blue is completely unable to step in militarily to halt the perceived threat. They needed a smoking gun, something like 911 or WMDs in order to justify military intervention to protect their interests under the guise of playing world police. With their previous experience of successful fabrication of plane crashes, Blue decides to engineer a solution to the smoking gun problem.</p>

<p>Based on the further assumption that if you can make a 777 disappear, you could also make it reappear, you then have an interesting possibility. 2 months of intense logistics and a mysterious disappearing plane later, Blue is ready to fire the gun and start stoking the fire for a build up to war. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s step into the shoes of Blue for a moment and understand their world view. A war in Europe would help destabilize an entire region and further your interests there by threatening a faltering economy and currency still reeling from the economic meltdown you engineered. It would serve to re establish your home country both militarily, politically and economically, opening important new markets for weapons, reconstruction and the like. Further, it would help distract attention away from impending political meltdown at home and serve to line the pockets of those who helped your &quot;element&quot; achieve the power and influence it has come to wield. </p>

<p>I do not think the U.S. &amp; Russia want to fully exterminate races in Ukraine nor do I think you are saying such, but while on the topic even when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanian"><strong>genocide</strong></a> [as I define it] seemingly happens in my mind, it is not easily widely acknowledged, as it then is usually debated because every death was not from war or simply ignored &amp; forgotten due to pain &amp; guilt.  </p>

<p>The pulpit players overall intentions are often <em>while slaughtering</em> is presented alike a cheerily dreary made up <em>fictional puppet show</em> performed for the home masses to appease them from getting angry. I am glad I do not <em>play</em> their game nor <em>pay for tickets</em>.</p>

By some accounts, eyewitnesses were intentionally discredited/barred from testifying to perpetuate this version of events. I find it interesting that so much energy is being put into the missile theory in this case, simply of because how fast and certain the response is comparatively.

    <div class="md"><p>So early in June NATO forces were <a href="http://www.eur.army.mil/RapidTrident/">doing drills with Ukraine&#39;s air force</a>. The drill was to fly behind a civilian aircraft 3-5 kilometers. (this way the airliner wouldn&#39;t be able to physically see the fighter jets nor have any detectors on board to detect military craft.) They would then duck down bomb their targets and fly behind the civilian aircraft. This operation was called Rapid Trident II. </p>

<p>Since Early July civilian aircraft have been banned from flying over that region. So why was MH17 flying over it? was it pilot error or were they instructed by Ukraine air traffic control?  The black box might tell the tale. Since the Russian Separatist are in control of the scene Right now <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28439862">the media is selling it as a bunch of drunks trying to pry it open with a screw driver and a cigarette in their mouths.</a> </p>

<p>further more, I heard this analysis from the no agenda show from july 20th that, <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2014/07/07/eurofighter-lear-jet-collision-did-nato-endanger-the-lives-of-thoudands-of-passengers-in-civilian-airliners/">civilian aircraft radar in europe</a> went out a wide scale at the same time NATO/Ukraine were doing drills regarding radar jamming. And then they totally denied it was them. </p>

<p>Here is another thing to think about, the BUK missile is very advance. It can detect a military aircraft signal vs a civilian aircraft signal. You have to be able to confirm the thing you are killing before you launch a missile at it from 20 miles away. </p>

<p>So this is the theory: <a href="http://www.infowars.com/claim-mh17-was-being-escorted-by-ukrainian-fighter-jets/">Ukraine&#39;s air force is flying behind this MH17</a> without them knowing. To tell the truth, sounds like using human shields similar to Hamas. They blip out the civillian aircraft radar so it becomes invisable, then they crank up their MIL signal and goat the russians into firing a missile up at them. With MH17 in front of them. The Russian separatist see a confirmed MIL signal and fire a missile at Ukrainian Aircraft. they duck out and the missile takes out a civilian aircraft. Russia is like, what the fuck happened?? Our signal said military. </p>

<p>Pretty fucked up tactic to force the world to start war with russia. <a href="http://rt.com/news/us-uk-ukraine-crimea-069/">http://rt.com/news/us-uk-ukraine-crimea-069/</a> I bet they sold this as an escort mission.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile this happened yesterday and no one is mentioning it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/europe/Malaysia-Airlines-jet-ukraine.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/europe/Malaysia-Airlines-jet-ukraine.html</a></p>

<p>So all in all, it looks like the Russian separatist probably did shoot it down, but maybe under false (spoofed) pretenses. This would all sound far fetched, but they drilled for this just last month. </p>

<p>Lastly everyone all now know, whenever you want to pull off a false flag, make sure to have the military do a drill regarding that exact scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick MH370 thought.... It was reported that MH370 turned off all of it&#39;s identifying hardware and flew as high as 40,000ft... Could this have been evasive maneuvers by a pilot that knew what he was doing when trying to evade a rocket attack?  You spot a rocket, first thing is to turn off all communications and radar devices, next, fly as fast and as high as you can, then fly downwards as fast as possible to gain as much speed.  You&#39;re trying to keep as much distance from the rocket as you can so it runs out of fuel before it reaches you.  You turn off all comms because missiles can use these as locks.  Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t go a clue.  However, the chances of a 777 going missing is millions to one against, as too are the chances of one being shot out of the sky.  However, the odds of both being the same airline are almost immeasurable.  I find it odd that the MH370 pilot does what any good pilot would do when under rocket attack - go as dark as fast as possible (turn off everything electrical and anything that can identify you) and go as high as the airframe can withstand then take a very fast downwards motion to get as much speed as possible.  This looks like evasive maneuvers to me.  Logic would dictate that because of the odds involved it is most likely not a coincidence.  Who shot the plane down over Ukraine?  So far everyone is saying &quot;it wasn&#39;t us&quot; - how do we know they&#39;re not telling the truth?  It might not have been either side.  Who&#39;s got beef with Malaysia?  I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the plane didn&#39;t land and explode, it blew apart mid air. People went in all directions, fire went in all directions. I&#39;m sure the landing killed most of those poor people. Plus as the other guy said, the fuel was held in the wings and passengers sit in the middle of the plane. Imagine going 500 miles an hour, 40,000 feet in the air then then a seat ejector being pushed. You fly out. Hit ground. Die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think that either Putin set this up or at the very least purposely supplied them and not that the rebels stole the soviet BUK from Ukraine. Probably to force other countries to co-operate with him and fix relations because he just showed them &quot;how horrible&quot; the situation is. </p>

<p>If you noticed, The UK, The netherlands now agree that the relations need to be stronger.</p>

<p>TL;DR: It was reported online yesterday that 23 Americans were onboard this flight. MSM is apparently investigating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there was the social media post by the separatists (later removed) claiming responsibility for shooting down a plane. There is also released audio on YouTube of the separatists admitting they shot it down thinking it was a military vessel. However, the credibility of this evidence is debatable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video you mention of the separatists admission allegedly was created a day before the plane was shot down.  There&#39;s another video floating around in this thread where someone had gone into the metadata of the video and found this information.  One could argue time differences could account for it, and they do to some extent--putting the video creation 8 hours before the wreck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not meaning to suggest one way or the other, and such is the problem with the internet.  Anytime you think you&#39;ve found &quot;proof,&quot; there&#39;s generally always &quot;proof&quot; pointing in the other direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t feel like searching through 800+ comments to see if someone said this already but here&#39;s my theory: The Ukrainian military basically enticed the pro-Russian rebels to shoot down MH17 by sending two fighter jets to make it look like military operation.  Russia has obviously been supplying the rebels with artillery so once they realized the rebels mistake, they conspired with them to point fingers and muck up the investigation as much as possible.  Ukraine stands to gain the most should the rest of West have further enmity with Russia because right now apart from the &quot;sanctions&quot; that Putin just shrugs off, all they&#39;ve received are a few disappointed head shakes.  So Ukraine set the bait, a commercial flight full of international passengers, and the rebels took it and BOOM! The rest of the world is mad at Russia (again). </p>

<p>Edit: Apparently there was no Spanish air traffic controller! </p>

<p>A military jet flew behind the plane in order to get them to accidentally lock onto what they thought was a military aircraft. They were running similar exercises a few days before.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Xr7pUKl">http://imgur.com/Xr7pUKl</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert but, it says on July 17th(Crash Date) that the flight was canceled. Only to land on July 18th at 6AM at KUL early. 
Then on the 19th, it left at 4:15pm, 4 hours late only to land in at 10:02 AM when it was supposed to land at 6:10am. So from July 17th-19th is was completely off schedule? It still says it&#39;s in operation. </p>

<p>Could someone explain? </p>

<p>TEN QUESTIONS FOR THE UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Immediately after the tragedy, the Ukrainian authorities, naturally, blamed it on the self-defense forces. What are these accusations based on?</p></li>
<li><p>Can Kiev explain in detail how it uses Buk missile launchers in the conflict zone? And why were these systems deployed there in the first place, seeing as the self-defense forces don’t have any planes?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are the Ukrainian authorities not doing anything to set up an international commission? When will such a commission begin its work?</p></li>
<li><p>Would the Ukrainian Armed Forces be willing to let international investigators see the inventory of their air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, including those used in SAM launchers?</p></li>
<li><p>Will the international commission have access to tracking data from reliable sources regarding the movements of Ukrainian warplanes on the day of the tragedy?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did Ukrainian air traffic controllers allow the plane to deviate from the regular route to the north, towards “the anti-terrorist operation zone”?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was airspace over the warzone not closed for civilian flights, especially since the area was not entirely covered by radar navigation systems?</p></li>
<li><p>How can official Kiev comment on reports in the social media, allegedly by a Spanish air traffic controller who works in Ukraine, that there were two Ukrainian military planes flying alongside the Boeing 777 over Ukrainian territory?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did Ukraine’s Security Service start working with the recordings of communications between Ukrainian air traffic controllers and the Boeing crew and with the data storage systems from Ukrainian radars without waiting for international investigators?</p></li>
<li><p>What lessons has Ukraine learned from a similar incident in 2001, when a Russian Tu-154 crashed into the Black Sea? Back then, the Ukrainian authorities denied any involvement on the part of Ukraine’s Armed Forces until irrefutable evidence proved official Kiev to be guilty.</p></li>

<p>Asiana Airlines Flight 214 (Boeing 777-200ER)</p>

<p>Japan Airlines (Boeing 777) - Japan Airlines Flight to San Francisco returned to Tokyo after crew hears of Flight 214 on the same day and mechanical failure warning is given. Mechanics on ground find hydraulic leak in their flaps.</p>

<p>Edit:
These also all occurred in the past year, and all with Asian countries that are &quot;close allies&quot; with the US.</p>

However, the Boeing 777 &quot; ranks as one of Boeing&#39;s best-selling models&quot; and &quot;has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner&quot; [wikipedia: /wiki/Boeing_777]. </p>

<p>Also, &quot;the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of commercial service.&quot;</p>

<p>Since July 2013, there were three major incidents and one averted incident. The major incidents involved Boeing 777s, and Asian based carriers, and all carriers are operated in countries that are &#39;closely allied&#39; with the US with airplanes built in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you might want to zoom in on detail of object that jut out from the main body of the wreckage, the hatposts for example, then color invert and see the misaligned palette as the photoshop tried to merge the overlay and the background, but did not merge the palettes correctly.</p>

<p>an original image would have uniform darkness for similar cavities, a photoshopped image will have oddness of color, different areas that appear the same, but they have different palette values due to the mis-match between foreground palette and background palette.</p>

<p>the circumference edges have an aura around them, that is smudging, a real object cannot affect the surrounding free air space with a halo, not in the real world.</p>

<p>this is a common mark of composite pictures where objects are complex and mixing is problematic. some photoshoppers use darkening of edges, others smudge.</p>

I generally read most things on here with a rather healthy pinch of salt as I do my own research and have one or two friends who have access to information that most would not be able to glean from any source other than personal testomony.
That plane was blown up by a bomb on board planted by a CIA operative, to stir up the hornets nest that is Ukraine and russia - the US is waiting to to complete the circle of countries that border russia or are near neighbors; afghanistan,iraq,iran,israel,eastern europe (why do you think all those countries are now in the EEC/)THEN the story will change and russia and the uS will buddy up (the russians will be even more part of the corpocracy with the huge number of millionaires/billionaires who want to live the &#39;western&#39; life style) so moving forward China will be the target which up until now is too big, BUT with two superpowers plus europe in tow the end game begins and the NWO starts. It&#39;s that simple - there will be a major event this summer that will dwarf 9/11 and guess who will get the blame????</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question? How is that a plane, a 777 flying at 30,000 plus feet with 300 passengers, gets shot down by a missle, explodes in midair, yet there is wreckage seen all over the place and bodies sprawled out all over the landscape to see (that is sad to see btw), yet on 9-11 a 757 somehow dives into the ground in PA (official version) and literally disintegrates! No plane parts, no bodies, no passports/ids, not a single shred of evidence. Makes no sense what so ever! So once again, here is definitive proof (AGAIN!) that something on 9-11 was a lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end with feel deeply saddened for all the families who lost loved ones on that flight, innocent victims. Sad day for those families involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember watching a show about air disasters and I&#39;m really sorry but I can&#39;t remember the flight name but some guy got into the cockpit and flew the plane straight down into the ground at full speed, iirc there were no bodies recovered, very few pieces of wreckage, and the only things they found were papers and other very light things that got blown away in the initial impact before fire could burn it up. It&#39;s possible. Very sad. Hopefully the people in this wreck were unconscious before they hit the ground. Hopefully when the missile hit the lack of pressure knocked everyone out. I&#39;ve seen the pictures of the bodies, horrendous injuries, I couldn&#39;t imagine enduring them. The people in the example I gave were all awake the whole time the plane was plummeting towards the ground iirc, except for the people the guy shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone asked the same and I&#39;ll give the same answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there is footage of impact of the missile but my guess is that when it hit, it must of broken up in the air while still being airborne for a few minutes. Meaning that while crashing downwards, it was moving forward. While moving forward broken pieces of the plan were scattered around until it finally hit the ground.</p>

<p>For 9-11 the impact happened in one place which would be why it wouldn&#39;t scatter across New York, for the rest of the questions I couldn&#39;t answer. However with what has happened to MH17 you shouldn&#39;t expect find the same evidence as 9/11 as the cause of damage was two different sources.</p>

<p>Question?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: High School physics:</p>

<p>Plane debris falling at terminal velocity is pretty slow: ~100+/- miles per hour depending on size and shape. That&#39;s quite a bit different from a whole plane hitting concrete or land at many hundreds of miles per our.</p>

<p>Kinetic energy is the square of velocity (Ke=0.5mv<sup>2).</sup> The energy impact of plane parts with the ground versus a whole plane differs by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>&quot;I said that I stopped being a coroner after about 20 minutes because it was perfectly clear what the cause and manner of death was gonna be. It was a plane crash but yet it was a homicide because the terrorists hijacked the plane and killed the people, and the terrorists committed suicide. So from that point, yes it was a misquote, because the point that I was trying to make was, after that it more or less became a large funeral service.&quot;</p>

<p>He also was able to ID all the passengers based on the 1500 samples of remains found on the site. They believe around 95% of the plane was recovered, hell even a 2000lb piece of engine was found in addition to the dumpster full of debris found by the over 300 volunteers who combed the area after the FBI&#39;s investigation.</p>

<p>Here is from my other comment:</p>

<p>Why would they do that? Steal a plane (pretty incredible thing to pull off), get rid of all the passengers, have a big media outlash about the disappearing plane, then fly it to netherlands, repaint and pose said plane as another plane, have people boarding it, have pilots willing to sacrifice themselfs, make sure it&#39;s direction is over ukraine, then shoot it down..... Why would they do that? When they could just shoot down any commercial airplane. And where are the passengers of flight MH17 and 370?</p>

<p>You jump to conclusions just because both planes are boeings. Which is bullshit absolutely.</p>

Somebody could show you flight plans, but they could be forged; witnesses could say it happened, but they could be actors; passenger lists could be shown, but those are probably forged; CCTV footage of people boarding the planes could be shown, but that might be forged; GPS off of passengers phones could show them entering the airport, but they are probably actors/dead bodies/falsified... etc, etc, etc...</p>

<ol>
<li>Unfortunately i&#39;d need some violent pictures of the aftermath. I need to see dead bodies in the wreckage and not just plane parts. </li>
</ol>

<p>Was on <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> yesterday, pictures seem to have been removed, and rightfully so.</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;d need to see convincing evidence that family of MH17 are actually in mourning right now (not justa few crises actors)</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, people in mourning would be evidence of mourning, but if they&#39;re all actors then... I don&#39;t see what &#39;convincing&#39; evidence would be. Want them to take a polygraph? Ah, but that might be forged as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it might have been the other way around. A plan to <em>get</em> U.S. involvement over there. I posted this outside of the discussion thread as to my own thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a theory that occurred to me in a weird dream that awoke me and questioned it&#39;s possibility:
What if the recent tragic event of a missile that took down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was orchestrated by unknown groups (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s to be theories as to who) to get U.S. involvement into the area for support in the Ukraine and further the detested involvement of Russia in the matter. Given the conflict between Crimea and Russia, the U.S. had enacted an Executive Order by the President H.R.4152 to &quot;Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine&quot; which would provide loan guarantees up to U.S. $1 Billion. And we all know how great much of a failure the U.S. is with their &quot;loans&quot; and their terms. There was also the Bill S.2124 to also &quot;Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine&quot;. Both bills also coincide with H.R.4278.
So, with the enactment of the legislation, what if a group, agency, Government was involved in taking down Flight MH17? Perhaps it was a planned way to actively get support and money from the Happy to Spend U.S. as a means to get the support needed to reduce the conflict.
Additionally, the countries of the passengers and even the alleged National Officials possibly on board, might further play into the firing of the missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(In response to the deleted comment)</p>

<p>I used to think like you, thinking that numerology was all bullshit and whatnot.</p>

<p>Here is why I started to believe in it:</p>

<p>I came to the realization that there exists a small group of people who control the world as we know it. These people do not want to relinquish control and actually quite enjoy the power they have.</p>

<p>These same people seem to enjoy the occult and numerology themselves. Maybe they view it as a game or a fun way to hide things in plain sight, I&#39;m not sure. However, <em>they</em> control when events happen, how they happen, and what happens afterwards.</p>

<p>Of course since they plan these events, they don&#39;t just throw a dart at a calendar to determine it, they have a system. Often times it seems they use a number system or some kind of algorithm to determine dates. There is a significance to the date, it is not strictly arbitrary.</p>

<p>So numerology is not about reading into the world pulse or predicting things that are otherwise unpredictable. It is about decoding the shadow cabal scheme to figure out when the next one may occur (or unmasking an event for what it really is). Think of it similar to what the Allies were doing to decipher the Enigma code in WWII.</p>

<p>The key thing is that <em>people</em> ultimately control these tragedies and far from random.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s much easier to see a pattern <em>after</em> the events. For every one time we are right it is overshadowed or called &quot;lucky&quot; or &quot;coincidence&quot;. After all, a broken clock is still right twice a day. That is because it is hard to verify we were right because of our algorithm or just plain luck.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say I said the number 2 and asked you the guess the next number. You might say 3, wrong. I say the next number is 4 and ask you again. This time you say 6 and I say wrong, it&#39;s 8. In hindsight it&#39;s easy to see I was going with the power of two and not even numbers. This is just a simple example, imagine as it gets more complex.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s conduct an experiment. I&#39;m going with the lucky 7 theory for now, mostly out of entertainment but hey.. let&#39;s see how far this rabbit hole goes. The next date would be July 20th 2014, something &quot;big&quot; or &quot;notable&quot; should happen. (7th month, 7/20/2014 compresses to 7).</p>

<p>So let&#39;s see what happens on that date. However, in the event that something does happen will you be curious or scoff and call it pure luck/coincidence?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s much easier to fit a pattern to known events. If you give me 30 pairs of random numbers, I can, without fail, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial">find a pattern</a> that will perfectly connect all of those random pairs together. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not, you could be going by powers of 2, or by <a href="https://oeis.org/A004148">generalized Catalan numbers</a> or by the <a href="https://oeis.org/A198414">Decimal expansion of x&gt;0 satisfying x<sup>2</sup> =2*sin(x)</a>, or any of these <a href="https://oeis.org/search?q=2%2C4%2C8&amp;amp;language=english&amp;amp;go=Search">other patterns</a>.

<p>However, in the event that something does happen will you be curious or scoff and call it pure luck/coincidence?</p>

<p>In the event that what happens? Something bad? Something good? Anything at all? Something happens everyday. Important things happen everyday. This numerology hogwash hasn&#39;t given you any more insight than the most basic of inductive reasoning. </p>

<p>This is pure speculation - good for what? Pathetic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conspiracy Theories are pure speculation, it&#39;s what this entire subreddit is about. We aren&#39;t the fucking news. We just read it and analyze it.</p>

<p>It ultimately doesn&#39;t mean anything and most of us do it simply because we enjoy piecing things together and seeing what unfolds. </p>

<p>Now, onto the main points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fairly sure separatists claimed responsibility</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you fucking serious? You accuse us of speculating and spreading misinformation when there hasn&#39;t been a single article that claims that the Pro-Russian Ukrainians took credit for the missile!?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then immediately retracted after they realized it was a commercial plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, the US and the International media would be ALL THE FUCK OVER THAT. They aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>No one knows who fired the missile. Regardless of what the data reveals, Russia and Kiev will point fingers at each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll call this like I see it. If the news shifts to the Gaza conflict and everyone gets quiet about Ukraine, you will know for a fact that Kiev fired that fucking missile, to try and take a shot at Putin. Can&#39;t blame them for wanting him out of the picture but, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they goofed. </p>

<p>Puppet governments are VERY bad at dealing with shit because they&#39;re too concerned about lining their own pockets. Mass executions and labor camps, they can do...Anything with finesse requires competence and a competent puppet government is an oxymoron.</p>

<p>Look at Iraq! You can give a government ALL the fucking tools to get the job done but, if you throw a bunch of corrupt &quot;Yes-Men&quot; in charge, you will always get the same results.</p>

<p>An utter clusterfuck.</p>

I&#39;d need a few things that I very possibly could see in the next few days but have not seen yet. 1. Hard evidence a flight MH17 actually was ever in Amsterdam Airport. I&#39;ve seen some light evidence but nothing definite. 2. Unfortunately i&#39;d need some violent pictures of the aftermath. I need to see dead bodies in the wreckage and not just plane parts. 3. I&#39;d need to see convincing evidence that family of MH17 are actually in mourning right now (not justa few crises actors).Without  that, there&#39;s no reason to believe tht this isnt just them using the stolen flight 370 (intercepted and safely landed by remote control/hacking, which russia on record did to a US drone flying over ukraine and shows thatthere is at least reason to beleive airplanes can be remotely hijacked) I&#39;m assuming the people on board 370 where all killed already (or frozen and put on this flight M17)</p>

<p>I always see this excuse. Wouldn&#39;t it be fair, to propose that if what was told as the official story turned out to be a lie, that such a situation is <em>more</em> offensive to the victims? That actually doing your own investigation is indeed the farthest thing from being disrespectful to those victims?</p>

<p>Imagine if it turned out a Government entity actually was the guilty party in an event. Would you say it&#39;s disrespectful to the victims that they lied about it? I sure would.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more likely: some punk edited the status to watch nuts like you freak out.</p>

<p>Disregarding the offensive nature of this comment, but the burden of proof is now on you to prove this assertion. Is it even possible to &quot;edit the status&quot;? I can&#39;t seem to find anywhere on the site where I could do such a thing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I love how argumentative cowards always delete their comments out of embarrassment.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember the young troll-accounts name but he had nothing positive to add and was being overtly hostile as well as willfully ignorant of the topic at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; Specific charges included the murder of over 6 million Jews, pursuing an aggressive war, the brutality of the concentration camps and the use of slave labor. &quot; - look up WW2 Sentencing . .aggressive war was only one item. . .</p>

<p>&quot;there are hundreds of them, iraq having weapons of mass destruction for example&quot;
- never blame on malice, what is better explained on incompetence.  A lie would require the administration to KNOW there was not a weapon of mass destruction, and next told us different.    Bush administration didn&#39;t lie. . .but they were wrong.  they were stupid. They ignored evidence they shouldn&#39;t have and cherry picked evidence they should of</p>

<p>but that is being an idiotic, being incompetent, not malice.</p>
