       I seem to notice a unhealthy obsession with Jews on conspiracy forums and I can't help but to think that most of those individuals are either ignorant or part of stormfront or some racial supremacist group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in conspiracies and I believe some Jews are involved as well as whites blacks and Asians but that doesn't mean all Jews work together to put down the non Jews .
      </p>
      <p>
       I've talked to people in chats or peers who think merely because I am a jew that somehow I'm in another social caste and that I'm responsible for the wars and the economy in this country. It seems like no matter how much we try to prove our loyalty somehow the hatred of Jews comes out that its a handicap that makes us unfit to be american citizens .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone's running campaigns how Germans or Irish run the country or complaining they over represent the jobs in this country. From the sounds of it, some of the nutcases won't be happy until we all lose our jobs, are deported and wiped away from existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't control any banks, I don't own a company, I'm not rich, I've never visited Israel, I vote libertarian, I support my country and the constitution and am proud of my heritage yet somehow this makes me an enemy of the country how? I would love to know.

       Unfortunately, the wealthy and powerful within your faith (the public face of Judaism) have behaved in such a way as to polarize many non-Jews against them.  But Israel's constant whining and meddling in the American political process have also gotten on a lot of people's last nerve.

       I know exactly what Zionism is and means.  Your attempting to sound "cool" and "intelligent" by being short and cryptic does nothing but make you sound like someone who simply doesn't know what they're talking about.

       Again, you haven't explained shit.  Funny cuz there was no "tantrum" (not even close) yet you still took that as an opportunity nonetheless to divert from responding directly to what I said.

       I didn't think you would actually illustrate the point I made in the link as directly as you just did.  Pretty sad, but thank you still. lol

       It's weird how you insist you know what the word means, yet ignored the part about self determination and still didn't provide a definition. You should be able to explain it simply enough, right?

       The onus of definition and explanation is on you, not me, as I was the one that initially told you to define it - which (not very surprisingly) you continue to do what the cowardly and ignorant do, which is attempt to divert focus away from the question and balk at facing it directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, the point is that Zionism - and Zionists - need to be eradicated from the planet.

       If you're a Zionist and support Zionism, then yes.  I personally would

       Reading this sentence, I see now that you actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       support Israel and its apartheid regime.  As such, it is safe to say that you and your kind - and what Zionism is doing to the Palestinians (among others) - are a great, great detriment to the planet and to pretty much everything that is good in humanity.  It is
       <em>
        you

       Listen here you piece of shit, I am a Zionist and a proud one at that, my heritage is to the Levant and my name and people originate from the Yehudim, I come from the tribe of Levi and your damn right I support Israel. You deny history and evidence, we have a word for you, the only Jew you love is the kind in striped pajamas in a concentration camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly ignored every bit of evidence I posted
      </p>
      <p>
       You support the fact that Palestinians stole Jewish land and fabricated their entire identity, this was land LEGALLY PURCHASED by the JNF and Jews who wanted to return to their land! You also support the ethnic cleansing that Jordan removed every single Jew from the west bank, you support the very fact that the Middle East kicked out the Jews from their own homeland yet you critisize Zionism and Israel because why? Because the Palestinian Arabs refused Israeli citizenship and tried to destroy Israel? Go fuck your self.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Israel wasn't such a politically correct state, they would have mirrored and done exactly as the other Arab states had done, you know what? I support a equal policy, if the middle east won't allow us in their countries and grant us "Dhimmi status" as second class citizens, then the so called Arabs living in Israel should be treated the same, however Israel is much more tolerant than that, you don't know apartheid until you've tried living as a Christian or a Jew in Syria or Saudi Arabia, Yemen or Algeria where Jews were murdered trying to leave on buses and forced out of their land, but a typical hypocrite piece of shit like you wouldn't know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what, there won't be another holocaust because Israel exists, and now we are armed to the fucking teeth, myself included, we have a saying "Never Again!" because you won't have the opportunity to take away our land, kill our people and humiliate us ever again,
      </p>
      <p>
       don't you dare speak to me about our Holy Book, the Torah or Tanakh, you don't know a damn thing about it other than your revisionist history and twisting what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come and try to eradicate us you piece of shit, your threats are idol like a typical internet warrior.

       Well Jews have been the scapegoat of choice for centuries already. From ghettos, illegal businesses (prostitution, contraband), and loansharks (dat usury on gentiles), prohibition on holding land (Zion!), Jewish perception in Europe was never "friendly" !
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Jewish reformation in late 1700-1800, a slow but drastic shift came to most western-Jewish communities. New ideals espoused by Jewish (and of course non-Jewish) thinkers such as equality, fraternity, and liberty spread throughout Europe and America. The aristocracy heavily feared this, but many were already indebted to Jewish bankers (Rothschilds more particularly). The spread of anti-Jewish propaganda was many times even fomented by the aristocracy, whose fear probably peaked during the anarchists socialist movements of early 1900 and the demise of the European aristocracy (when the infamous "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" appeared).
      </p>
      <p>
       Today anti-Semitism, while still pervasive, and somewhat maintained by old stereotypes (greed, cronyism), it has become basically a Zionist propaganda tool. All anti-Israel (anti-Zionist) opinion is quickly corrupted into antisemitism and hate-speak, readily invoking the Holocaust, by Zionist themselves. Noam Chomsky is probably the best example, an avid anti-Zionist figure, despite of enormous success in academic circles, is still painted as anti-semite because of his opinion, despite being a Jew himself !!

       A big distinction that needs to be made here is that people of the internet often don't see (or know) the difference between Judaism and Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many have spoke out against the Zionist agenda in recent years. Just do some research on JIDF and their shilling, propaganda, and general forum sliding. I myself am not racist by any means. I see people of the Jewish faith no different than I see Christians or Muslims. With that being said, I find Israel and the Zionists quite harmful to society and the middle east.

       Thanks, you have nothing to apologize about , I was just curious why people believe that is the solution. Its put me off to a lot of conspiracy forums , and I hoped that I could share my insight on the Jewish community why so few Jews think about that stuff or how divided we really are. I have a lot of these issues with my own family. I also have a lot of knowledge that I can share and plenty I would love to learn as well. I am experienced with computer forensics and read a lot about network security and I knew how peoples information would be exploited just from the overall architecture so it was a topic I wanted to discuss and how to properly secure ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Jews are interested in the topic but they are very under the covers about it and are not public by any means, there's significant agreement that things in this country are falling apart and investing in gold or silver, firearms and agriculture and also seeing how the constitution is being torn apart, unfortunately in the Jewish community you get many moderates who consistently stick to the mainstream parties and there's a lot of division politically between the reform, conservative, orthodox and karaite communities. This creates a lot of difficulty getting proper answers one would want to hear. The younger generation is a lot more progressive and tends to turn a blind ear to the issues today similar to most of the american younger generation which tunes out and follows the popularity crowd.

       I completely understand where your coming from. I myself have recently struggled with certain feelings based on research I've been doing and have found I have nothing against the average Jew any more then I have anything against anyone else of a particular race or religion. However, I have found strong evidence to make me believe that the wealthy Jewish elite effectively spearhead the NWO (and therefore the idea of zion) through the use of central banking.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, the Rothschilds and branches of that particular family. The Rothschilds along with their branches effectively own the federal reserve and probably the majority of wealth on our planet. Through this wealth they control economic policy in even the control the laws of the United States at the very least through political influence they maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, one could argue, that if money is the root of all evil then the poverty and misfortune experienced by the majority of NATO nations and in general the world is the result of a few obscenely wealthly Jewish and obviously zionist families.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that being said. I think it's stupid for anyone to generalize an entire race of people based on a handful of their number.

       How is that a cause of hatred ? Those are Satmar who completely oppose the state of Israel. If someone were holding up a sign in the united states saying the US is a illegitimate country and it all belongs to mexico, the vast majority of people would oppose them. You can't just completely oppose a recognized country and say it doesn't exist, Its one thing to critisize policies but to flat out claim Israel doesn't exist and all the land belongs to Palestine is in opposition to treaties and Un recognition.

       Zionism is a conspiracy to give the holy land back to the Jews.  A simple fact is that if we created the state of Israel in the middle of the desert in the US.  Not only would the middle east be more stable, but it would be cheaper for the US to build a pipeline to carry water to oasis Israel, Nevada.  Than it has been for us to support Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews would be safer, the Palestinians could have taken the path of India and china and won independence from the UK, and the US wouldn't be neck deep in bullshit in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there is always the possibility that the Mormons would surround Israel, Nevada and start shooting rockets at them.

       That doesn't give a few nuts the right to claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, you seem to be obsessed with the idea that israel as a country shouldn't exist and jews should be relocated, what right do you have to deny an entire people a right to their historical homeland ? Should we break up the United States because most Americans are from immigrants who took the land from the native Americans? I mean obviously America is involved in many wars throughout the world, would we be at peace if America didn't exist? You seem to think israel is the cause of all the war in the Middle East, if you knew anything about middle eastern history, it's always been a conflict zone from when the Mongols sacked Baghdad, to the crusades, to the Roman Empire occupying the land, and the khaybar war where Mohammad slaughtered the jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US also didn't create israel not did Britain, Britain merely occupied the land and partitioned it, if you look up the Jewish national fund, jews had constantly been immigrating to the Ottoman Empire and others who were born there before it was made the British mandate of palestine, there were historical Jewish towns wiped out by Arabs too that were purchased from the Ottoman Empire, Gush Etzion is a perfect example, it was purchased from the Ottoman Empire and jews created the community and the Jordanians attempted to wipe it out, the UN today considers it a illegal settlement despite the fact that it was legally purchased land before the partition, you can read about it here,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also as stated, the historical Palestinians were originally jews, during the period of the Roman Empire the land around Jerusalem was known as the roman province of judea, during the sacking of Jerusalem many of the jews were kicked out in diaspora while others lived around the Mediterranean, and some remained in israel but weren't allowed into Jerusalem by the Romans, this is documented history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is you assume that the palestinian people today are the same Palestinians, and that's not the case, if you look up when the Arab palestinian identity was created, it came about after the 1967 war, the West Bank and gaza were occupied by Jordan and Egypt and those areas had large demographic changes, Jordanians increased in numbers in Jerusalem and after israel took over the West Bank, jordan stripped those individuals of their Jordanian citizenship causing a inflow of original peoples living in the West Bank as well as immigrants from Jordan, the Palestinian identity assumes anyone in the West Bank of Arab descent is a palestinian including immigrants yet a Jew cannot be considered a palestinian, if you've noticed how many jews live in gaza today? Yet 20 percent of the Arab population are israeli citizens and even serve in the Knesset because they didn't assume a palestinian identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if you looked at Hamas plan that they assume all of israel belongs to them you would start to understand more, how would you feel if you purchased a home and then were told it was being taken away from you with no compensation because it supposedly sits on a holy indian burial spot?

       This is the exact hypocrisy that I speak of, you want your homeland, your identity, your heritage and culture yet you don't want the jews to have there's, you break us down into a religion, you deny Israel a right to exist, your not even debating settlements or peace treaties or a 2 state solution but the complete deconstruction of israel as a recognized state and relocating of the jews.

       What right do the Jews have to deny Palestinians their homeland? The Jews lost their homeland fair and square when they started a civil war between the tribes and Rome was sent in the quell the uprising.  Now they want it back thousands of years later?  What?  They have no damn right to those lands.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah as I said, Zionism is the cause for all this hatred. You can do cartwheels through the history books if you want but the Jews lost their lands there in 70AD and they have no right to reclaim it now.  And why did they lose their lands in 70AD? Not because Rome sacked it.  Rome was letting them rule themselves as Rome often did as long as they paid taxes.  They started a civil war.  Jews fighting with Jews just like you just accused these "other Jews" of being traitors because they don't believe Zionist have a right to claim these lands.

       Well you certainly know how to be a hypocrite, you said the jews deserved to lose their land because the Romans conquered that, by your theory then, the Palestinians have no right to the land because Israel conquered it, you can't pick and choose what suits your agenda.

       Furthermore, who in their right mind would support almost 6 million jews immigrating to the United States to setup a homeland, jews seem to be more favored in israel than the United States where they are focused on as the source of conspiracy theories, I'm sure at one time jews felt at home in Germany too until hitler took over.

       Judea was a part of Rome.  Rome was allowing the Jews to rule themselves as long as they paid tribute to Rome.  The Jews started a civil war amongst themselves and quit paying tribute.  The Jews destroyed their own temple, their genealogical records and their city.  Rome then dispatched troops to quell the uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       They destroyed themselves, the world moved on without them.  Now they want to claim lands that have belonged to various groups for thousands of years.

       I've appropriately responded to every post you have made I think the one with selective reading issues is you since you cherry pick and skip the rest of my post. Typical tactic by Israel haters like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again by your logic your revising history that would be like saying Americans killed their own people when the immigrants from Europe killed the native Americans . Titus destroyed the temple and he wasn't a Jew, the romans integrated north Africa and the east Mediterranean but that doesn't make them all the same people. You have a problem understanding ethnic groups. The entire middle east isn't Arab, there exists druze, Persians, turks and turkic people, Assyrians , Greek and Armenian who are just as indigenous if not more than Arabs. You seem to show me maps of so called depopulation of Palestine and assume every single bit of that land belonged to Arabs yet you disregarded my article on Jewish settlements being depopulated in the 1929 Arab riots and the partitions the ottoman empire set up at that time and demographics/census reports at that time. You can't just put a green spot on a map and say that's historic Arab land, how about all the so called Palestinians who fled to south america when the ottoman empire was persecuting people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what your really trying to say is you want a Arab Palestinian state only that's free of Jews completely erased just like how their history was almost erased in north Africa and the rest of the middle east (except Iran)

       We don't like Zionist because they start wars over greed. They steal people's land based upon their imaginary "birthright" and anyone who speaks out against them, including non-zionist Jews are labeled as israel-haters.

       Also Titus tried to save the temple, the Jews were so disgusted that an army of gentiles were inside of the inner sanctum that they attacked his men and the temple continued to burn.

       Oh please you are a history revisionist with no evidence the Jews destroyed the temple what a pathetic response. Titus destroyed the temple  and Hadrian razed Jerusalem after the bar kokhba revolt and renamed Jerusalem aelia capitolina. This is documented history even by the romans. The region was renamed Syria palestina however the name Palestine wasn't used in terms or a region until the ottoman empire ceded it from ottoman Syria, you can even see this on ancient maps of the ottoman empire. Furthermore no one had any documentation of a unique Palestinian people before the  1920s except the fact that only Jews were called Palestinians .

       Like I said, you support a Arab Palestinian state free of Jews, you even said you believe all Jews should be sent to the US and you deny our heritage. You even claimed it was our fault the temple was destroyed which goes beyond anti Zionism z let me guess, its our fault the holocaust happened too or do you believe that was a hoax as well ?

       Oh right it doesn't exist!  Likewise Israel didn't exist even in biblical times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not a question of who existed first.  Its a fact of Israel expanding its borders every chance it gets and then rationalizing it with birthright nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palestine existed when Israel was created out of thin air, after two world wars and a long running Zionist agenda.  Now that we have Israel we can see the instability caused by its existence and all attempts to reign in Israel are ignored by Israel.

       Once again you evade my questions and answers , Palestine was later carved out of ottoman Syria and wasn't a independent country but a region and it only considered Jews as Palestinians .
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel existed as Judea and the kingdom of Israel , Assyria documented this as did the Egyptians and the Jordanians . we have a history. Where do you think Hebrew came from? It was a Canaanite dialect and the Canaanites mixed with Hebrews hence Davids mother a moabite .

       The name Israel is mentioned in Egypt in the merneptah steel plate from 1200 BC
The princes are prostrate, saying: "Mercy!"
Not one raises his head among the Nine Bows.
Desolation is for Tehenu; Hatti is pacified;
Plundered is Canaan with every evil;
Carried off is Ashkelon; seized upon is Gezer;
Yanoam is made as that which does not exist;
Israel is laid waste, his seed is not;
Hurru has become a widow for Egypt!
All lands together, they are pacified;
Everyone, who was restless, he has been bound.
      </p>
      <p>
       An Assyrian inscription (the Kurkh stele) 350 years later (ca.853 BCE) refers to King Ahab of "sir-il-la-a-a"
      </p>
      <p>
       The black obilisk from the Assyrians mentions king Jehu the son of omri
      </p>
      <p>
       840 BC the moabites wrote a inscription also recognizing thebisrarlis king jehu and omri
      </p>
      <p>
       Sargon II wrote of conquering Samaria and omri exists no more
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel was the northern kingdom and ceased to exist after Assyrian and Babylon wars on the north however Judea continued to exist, once again you are a anti truthet because you oppose the truth and even contradict yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You show you have no compromise, at least I acknowledge some Palestinians are really Jews who converted to Islam, I haven't even said anything against the Palestinians but justified the existence if Israel as a Jewish state and that palestine was simply a region just like we refer to new England in the us as the northeast.
      </p>
      <p>
       You on the other hand deny complete history of the Jews in the land and you also think Palestine should be rid of Jews and Israel erased. Go figure , you really are a revisionist Nazi.

       These aren't bible stories, this is archaeological evidence that even Israels enemies acknowledge. The Assyrians were historic enemies of Israel and still recognize them as having existed, its written in documents by the romans, Assyrians, Jordanians , moabites and Egyptians. Even the Greeks acknowledge this as well. Long after Israel and Judea existed, the Israelite identity lived on, Samaritans still claim Israelite ancestry and speak the most ancient form of paleohebrew and never left the land. If you had seen the videos I posted even some towns of Palestinians claim to be Israelites and want to be Israelis , they still follow Jewish traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one who called for Jews to be sent to Nevada and that Israel was the enemy, we fought a war against the axis in world war 2 who actually committed genocide yet we didn't call for the deportation and destruction of Germany or Japan. Land is still occupied by many nations and you don't hear about it. Romania and Hungary is a perfect example over the dispute of Transylvania, or transistria in modolva occupied by Russians. The Russian Ukrainian war, Kosovo and Serbia, China and Tibet, or how about the colonization of the Levant and north Africa by Arabs? No one ever brings these issues up. Arabs have equal rights in Israel yet no Jew has equal rights in a middle Eastern nation. I find it amazing that Europe wanted us out what better place than the historic homeland and its the same situation in the middle east today

       "Quoted " Zionism is a conspiracy to give the holy land back to the Jews. A simple fact is that if we created the state of Israel in the middle of the desert in the US. Not only would the middle east be more stable, but it would be cheaper for the US to build a pipeline to carry water to oasis Israel, Nevada. Than it has been for us to support Israel.
The Jews would be safer, the Palestinians could have taken the path of India and china and won independence from the UK, and the US wouldn't be neck deep in bullshit in the middle east.
Of course there is always the possibility that the Mormons would surround Israel, Nevada and start shooting rockets at them."
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much to twist, you pretty much stated Israel is the cause of issues and you feel as a fact we would be better off if the Jews were sent to Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had bothered to read my posts, no where did I mention settlements, I mentioned Israels right to exist. The only time I mentioned settlements was the fact the UN considers Israeli settlements in the west bank as illegal yet many of these settlements like Gush Etzion which the land had been purchased in 1925 by Zikhron David, a private Jewish land holding company. Yet international law declares gush etzion as a illegal settlement because its in the west bank despite the fact the land was legally purchased and before the establishment of partitions yet Arab settlements in Israel were allowed to stay, why is it that acre a Arab majority town isn't a illegal settlement or the bedouin camps in the Negev? You can call me a Zionist but you are absolutely nuts and a hypocrite if you think legally purchased land is illegal and all Jews living in the west bank and gaza are illegal yet Arabs have a right to Israel, last time i checked when israel annexed east jerusalem the arab, armenian and greek quarters still exist, when jordan occupied it illegally the jews were kicked out, the synagogues destroyed and was made judenrein, I believe we call that reverse discrimination.

       I take it you are probably a child set in his own ways since yout debating skills are lacking and you've turned your focus from the thread. You also have a problem with hypocrisy, you can call me a Zionist in a negative connotion yet you get upset if I call you a Nazi. Obviously I have struck a nerve and you want to focus outside of the debate instead of focusing on the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Jew can be a anti Zionist but why bother living in Israel or moving there if you don't support it? That's like a Mexican coming to america and cursing it every chance he has saying america doesn't have a right to exist and that its Mexico's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are Jews who support a 2 state solution but still believe Israel should exist. Anti Zionist Jews believe Israel should be dismantled and the majority of Jews deported, they even say this on their own website. Please explain to me where those Jews are supposed to go and why land legally purchased should be forcefully or voluntarily given up.

       By the way here is evidence that Palestinians are a recent invention, some so called Palestinians are really jews who were forced to accept the palestinian identity as publicly identifying themselves as jews is dangerous, you can see that the Palestinians attempted to destroy any evidence of jews being in the land by desecrating symbols and modifying graves,

      <p>
       Hate groups always strive to blur the distinction between the two. Sadly, so does Zionism. The former because they want to hate ALL JEWS. The Latter because they don't want to be held accountable for their hate crimes against Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So It's win-win for Zionists and Stormfront people. They hate each other but they both want the same thing.

       I think that there is some general confusion with the term zionism and even Jews, it appears many of these conspiracies are based off the concept of zionism or what people associate zionism with and financing for Israel from the united states. Zionism is simply the support of Jews to be able to have a homeland. There are different forms of Zionism and they didn't start with Theodore Herzl, Jews have been making aliyah to Israel throughout periods through the 1300 and 1400s. At the time of Herzl's Zionism European Jews started settling in the late 1800s to the ottoman empire to ottoman Syria and ottoman Palestine however Jews were also called Palestinians historically, Immanuel Kant in the 18th century referred to Jews as Palestinians amongst us in Europe and referred to Jews as orientals, Jews were also registered as a ethnic group , my family came from romania and settled there during the ottoman empire and they were called Hebrews or evrei in romanian. Only in the US did Jews cease being an ethnic group , it became a religion. There are even Palestinians who are secretly Jews and they perform tefillin in secret and follow the Torah but are legally Muslim to prevent issues, not all Palestinians are Jews but some were absorbed and continue to practice in secret . there was a documentary about it and when Jordan annexed the west bank they destroyed Jewish synagogues, Jewish symbols and there is still evidence of some of the star of David's that remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have different forms of zionism there is religious Zionism and secular Zionism. Some Jews believe that current Israel is a secular creation and will be replaced by the kingdom of Judea and Israel when the mosiach comes. Others believe that Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy but Jews are abandoning GD and others support a 2 state solution. There are groups who completely oppose Israel altogether like the Satmar and neuterai karta however the Satmar oppose it for other reasons, many of the negative aspects of Jews in the US are from the Satmar such as criminal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a Zionist but I am a religious Zionist, the same reason Assyrians strive to have their homeland back or Copts in egypt want their homeland and native Americans want the treaties in the us respected for their land. Its not anti semitic to critisize israels policies no more than it is to critisize Americas but some people believe Israel doesn't have a right to exist and Israel is central to Jewish identity, its no different than someone having pride of their German or Irish heritage, that is what we identify ourselves as having descendants from the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes it is possible to identify someone as Jewish based on their name or at least Jewish heritage, why do you think Nazi Germany was able to do so? In the us there are websites dedicated to identifying people of Jewish descent be it Jewish celebrities or criminal activity. Jewwatch seems to be popular. Do you really think the last name kohen doesn't give away what I am? That would be like assuming the last name Sanchez comes from Asia.

       Interesting, perhaps I am guilty of some level of ignorance. I was under the impression the term zionism litterally meant like...a world for Jews...like the concept of NWO for Jews....sort of like what I see happening with the FED...although again. I blame that on just a few particular families, not an entire race.

       Yeah but it gets to a point of obsession and actually ends up putting my in uncomfortable positions. Literally if someone were to kill me or have me fires from my job or deported it would be one less Jew and it wouldn't fix the issues in this country. I find myself constantly on a defensive and people know what I am based on my last name, I see people proud to be German or Irish and have the Irish flag on saint patty's day or talk about their heritage yet the word Jew seems to have been perverted to a point people believe and feel angry towards someone of Jewish heritage . I've seen this in other conspiracy circles asking if I'm a Zionist or questioning my loyalty to the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had people try to dictate to me how I should feel bad how they think Jews lie about the holocaust , the Israel Palestine war, or Jews controlling the banks as if its my problem and I'm ultimately responsible for every jews actions. I've had people say I'm articulate but say they don't trust me just because in a Jew even though they never met me, yet its ironic how I'm in the same boat complaining about the direction of the country. I own guns, and I want to preserve the second ammendment , I think fluoride is dangerous and aspartamine as well as genetically modified food, I try yo educate about the NSA and what's going on but I never make these things material fact without providing evidence. Obviously there's serious issues in this country but having my background thrown under a bus and questioning my loyalty or my religion or beliefs is not a compromise I will make, and to be bullied into it and thrown into the problem solution bin and I will fight back. Sometimes I wonder if the enemy does this simply to put a target on every Jew, I also get tired of the topic of the holocaust constantly questioned. If people don't believe it, then they have the choice to be ignorant but I personally believe it happened and don't know why its a obsession on conspiracy forums.

       Try to imagine what your life would be like if you didn't bother telling everybody you know that you're Jewish.  When I was young I was a Catholic but I didn't go around making a point of telling anyone about it because I didn't see the point of doing so.  Now that I'm an atheist for the past 50 years I only rarely bother to tell people that I am, because frankly, I don't see the point of telling anybody that I identify myself this way.  I don't think they care, and I don't think there's any reason they should know things about me that will let them put me in a box, neatly on their shelf.

       I don't go out with a cross on my neck.  And I don't think you are correct in assuming that your surname necessarily tells people you are Jewish.  If you are wearing a star of david on your neck then, yes, you do tell people you're Jewish.

       Meh, you could probably guess I'm Irish with my last name and therefore could probably assume I'm catholic which would be true if I followed the religion the same as the rest of my family. As a non Jew I can't really put myself in your shoes. However, I will say that there will always be ignorant fucks that like to throw stones. It's easier to hate a people if you generalize them. Lots of ignorant fucks are like this in the world. Sorry you've been encountering so many. I don't have to worry about it because no one really picks on the Irish anymore....they used to....then the world sort of moved on....not sure how or why...other then a lot of the population assimilated and that more then likely played a huge roll...

       Jews have never been scape-goated. Jews have been targeted because of what they have done. It's called karma, and all the fast-talking bulllshit and all the bribes and lies in the world won't turn it aside.

       Well you certainly know how to be a hypocrite, you said the jews deserved to lose their land because the Romans conquered that, by your theory then, the Palestinians have no right to the land because Israel conquered it, you can't pick and choose what suits your agenda.

       By the way, this is a list of Jewish villages eradicated by the Arabs in the 1948 war, villages that existed on legally purchase jewish land.

       Furthermore, who in their right mind would support almost 6 million jews immigrating to the United States to setup a homeland, jews seem to be more favored in israel than the United States where they are focused on as the source of conspiracy theories, I'm sure at one time jews felt at home in Germany too until hitler took over.

       I did not call for the Jews to be sent to Nevada...  I said it would have been a better choice than the holy land.

       You Zionist twist every word that is said to fit your imaginary world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Israel is innocent then why are "the new settlements" always on the news?  Why do they have nukes while fear mongering the world into war with Iran over nukes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep twisting peoples words as well as your own perception of what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment of a whole new state out of other people's lands was unprecedented before Zionism.  Its absurd.  I guess some people just enjoy an endless cycle of war.

       I take that as a threat that you are threatening and want me to be eradicated for the support of my people and heritage. Thank GD Israel has nukes and weapons to keep pissants like you away from us.
