       I'm assuming that you don't understand how an exchange server works in a large enterprise installation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It essentially breaks down to that it's cheaper for users to decide what they are going to archive and let them do it locally than to keep it forever on the exchange server.  Many organizations I've seen ( gov included) have a policy which requires users to set their outlook to delete the messages on the server.  Backups are provided using PST files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: iced worked in enterprise it on and off for the better part of the last decade.

       We work with finance and ours is 100% the opposite of this.
Mail is kept on exchange for 6 months, moved to online archive after that (same edb database format, just slower but cheaper storage)
We backup on entry via symantec cloud (legal backup), backup exchange edb's nightly to both DeDuped storage and LTO Tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       users can make PSTs and do whatever they like, but we dont help or require them to do this as we have it sorted from the back end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hard to believe a government department has less requirements for best practices than a financial office does. I cant imagine there is a company size where you decide that storage costs outweigh the punishment/cost of legal action against you.

       They very well may. Best practices and data, when mixed with users, typically equals horror.

       There's some pretty messed up shit going on, I'll agree with this sub on that, but I also ascribe to the belief that one should never attribute to malice what is more appropriately attributed to stupidity. Im willing to bet the farm on incompetence that makes for a wonderful distraction from the fact that the series of laws that made this even a discussion (those regarding PACs) are monumentally fucked up.

       That being said, as previous posters have said, anything deemed fit for the record should be printed and filed.  That's more worrisome to me than some busted hard drives.  They should exist somewhere, unless they weren't deemed fit for the record at all.

       ...except the IRS is required by law to backup all communications and does so on multiple drives.

      <p>
       Oh, and they also are required to print hard copies for the archives.

       So what the IRS is really telling us is multiple hard drives containing the same data failed

       there was a fire or something to get the paper copies.  Or something.  Don't bother with the details, because things don't add up when you pay attention.

       You are plain wrong. Federal regulations require back up of digital and print media. Numerous politicians but more importantly other non-elected officials from within the government have come forward and said this is bogus. It's bogus... And it's part of a larger tapestry of bogus shit to which the people have grown increasingly fed-up over. If the president used the IRS for political gain it's akin to what got Nixon impeached (see Watergate). Now I'd like to specifically address you. Honestly, I have to tell you, just get the fuck out of this subreddit. You're useless. You and so many like you here everyday spewing idiotic hypnobabble. The sad part is, you're probably just some regular old idiot, and really are fucking clueless.. But how do you even find yourself here in this sub then? How do you find yourself emboldened, as a collective, to share your myopic little view point day after day? I've spent plenty of time on other special interest subs -only conspiracy suffers with this to the degree it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, the last time I said this you sent me a personal message letting me know I had to respect other's view points or some shit. No I don't. Go watch the movie idiocracy. That's what's happening. I feel no kinship to these creatures. They're so far removed from me it's hard to be sympathetic. I'm tired of these blathering wastrels. I'm tired of them contributing nothing, lousing up the board. They make everything irritating to the point I can't come to this sub reddit anymore. I do not need to respect them. They need to GTFO.

       I specifically come for people like you...
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of people that find interest in this sub that aren't like you though, so I don't want to address them specifically.

       Humans are fantastic at seeing patterns. Some biologists posit that it was of the most important things that we evolved to do early in our history. Its not like we lost that, we still use it.

       The problem is, some people's pattern recognition is out of control...they are people like you, who see a microphone behind every tree and a Zionist under every rock. In addition, there are typically conflating neuroses, such as narcissism ( wake up sheeple ) and paranoia.

       I like to come and see you froth at the mouth from the comfort of your mom's basement, where you're probably just mad that your ramen is too hot and you decided to take it out on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the best part, by far, is the narcissism ....there's nothing better than some unwashed loony telling me that they are the epitome of intellect because they think the shape of lucky charms signifies Illuminati indoctrination and they're the only ones that could see that.

       Narcissists, and sociopaths in general, are actually disproportionately stratified in the upper echelons of society. I'll take it as a compliment.

       Truth be told I'm not frothing. I am clinical and objective, and there is a horde of evidence out there to substantiate these claims. As for your comment about my being a basement dweller, let me tell you, I'm one of the most successful people you'll ever come across. I have accomplished so much that things which might sustain a person's ego for a lifetime hardly phase me anymore. I've been awarded millions for my research, have altered the course of an entire field.. numerous times, and am so comfortably established in authority that when I speak even my opponents listen with keen intent. You, my faceless haranguer, I imagine, could never relate to me. Your words are baseless but amusing and as I stand here before you know that until you can demonstrate equal merit I must surely be inscrutable to you and your ilk.
