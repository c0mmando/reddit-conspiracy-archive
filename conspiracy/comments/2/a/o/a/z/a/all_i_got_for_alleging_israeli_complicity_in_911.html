      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Swan was convicted of fifteen counts of preparing false tax returns and amended returns for others, two counts of preparing false amended tax returns for himself and one count of corruptly impeding the administration of the federal tax laws. During the period in which the crimes were committed, Swan resided, and conducted a tax return preparation service in Auburn, New Hampshire.
       </p>
       <p>
        Swan was convicted after a six day trial in United States District Court in Concord presided over by United States District Chief Judge Paul J.  Barbadoro. The jury deliberated for approximately two hours before returning its verdict. Swan faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each of the eighteen counts.  Swan will be sentenced on May 19, 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence at trial established that during the period 1997 through 2002, Swan prepared hundreds of so-called “zero-income” tax returns for clients. On those returns, Swan reported that the clients did not have any income even though he knew that clients had received substantial wages, salaries, and other compensation. The evidence at trial further showed that in 1997, Swan filed two amended returns for himself falsely reporting that he had no income for tax years 1993 and 1994. Those amended returns sought refunds of taxes Swan had paid previously for those years. Finally, the evidence showed that after the Internal Revenue Service initiatedcollection efforts against him, Swan obstructed the administration of the tax laws through a continuing campaign to harass and intimidate the IRS, its employees and third parties lawfully complying with IRS collection requests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Swan testified in his own defense that he was a former disciple of notorious tax protestor, Irwin Schiff. He further testified that based upon Schiff’s teachings and his own research he sincerely believed that there was no law making anyone liable for the federal income tax. Swan also claimed that he believed the federal income tax was unconstitutional, a claim which the Court had already ruled did not constitute a defense to the crimes charged. The government’s evidence established that Swan was fully aware of his legal obligation to file accurate tax returns and pay the taxes that were due.
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence established that Swan prepared more than 200 tax returns for others, making false claims for refunds in excess of $1 million dollars. Swan promoted his tax return preparation business by holding seminars entitled, “How Anyone Can LEGALLY Stop Paying Income Taxes” at hotels in Manchester between 1997 and 2002. Swan advertised these seminars in numerous local and regional newspapers. The evidence further demonstrated that Swan encouraged others to file Forms W-4 falsely claiming exempt status to stop the withholding of income taxes. Finally, the evidence showed that Swan initiated numerous frivolous lawsuits and sought the baseless criminal prosecution of IRS collection employees and banks, title companies, and even a recorder of deeds for complying with lawful IRS liens and levies.

       You don't think that the government is going to admit that it targeted me for alleging that Israelis and dual loyalists to both Israel and the U.S. within our own government orchestrated 9-11 as a pretext to drag the U.S. into wars with all of Israel's enemies in the Middle East, do you?

       I'm pretty sure you were given the sentence for falsifying tax records, not for claiming 9/11 was an Israeli job. In fact, it seems that

       I got out in 2009. It was all right, but a colossal waste of time. I met some good men, though. Many white collar federal inmates are incarcerated because someone wanted them out of the way for one reason or another.

       I wasn't even charged with tax evasion. The point is, why was I targeted? Read what I posted and you be the judge.

       Funny thing about my case. I fought it pro se, but the magistrate judge thought that it would be funny to saddle me with a Jew standby attorney. You should have seen this guy--right out of the boonies of New Hampshire, chain-smoker, long hair, drove an old Volkswagen. I doubt if he had ever fought a federal criminal case before.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wanted off my case when he found out that I had implicated Israelis and other Jews in implicating 9-11. He thought I was anti-Semitic. I told him that I don't hate all Jews, just the ones who have hijacked the country and are screwing everybody! He was okay with me after that.
