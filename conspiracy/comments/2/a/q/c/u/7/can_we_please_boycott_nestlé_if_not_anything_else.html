    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult, but I think it&#39;s possible - maybe not just the Reddit community, I think you need Facebook users. </p>

<p>I look at every label anyway to avoid a bunch of other stuff like artificial coloring, corn syrup, etc etc, so it&#39;s just part of the mental checklist. You almost have to give up on bottled water, though - they&#39;ve been buying up other water companies, so you think you&#39;re picking up some local water and look closely and dang it, Nestle again. It&#39;s impossible to do when eating out or visiting others, but I&#39;ve been slowly converting friends and family. </p>

<p>And there are some things that are really tough - like, you want ice cream with few ingredients, real sugar, not much filler, can find at the store. Breyers fits the bill, isn&#39;t Nestle (Edy&#39;s, Dreyer&#39;s, Haagen Daazs). But is Unilever really any better? I dunno.</p>

<p>To be honest, we really don&#39;t need ice cream, it&#39;s just empty calories. And even real sugar isn&#39;t good for you, considering cancer loves to feed on it.</p>

<p>Those seem quite tasty! The &quot;Slow-Cooker Coconut Rice Pudding&quot; sounds delicious, and nutritious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got any nutrition info on them?  I&#39;d be curious if the pie beat out a comparable Iceream with nuts.</p>

<p>Being way too American, I know nothing of rice pudding.  I imagine if you used vitamin rich rice it could be a contender, but that may not be how you make it.</p>

<p>Back on point though, Icecream has protein, fat, calcium, and other vitamins in it.  And sorry, despite what the nineties told you, fat is a valuable nutrient.  It is not just empty sugar.  </p>

<p>Perhaps I was foolish using an -est on the internet, but as far as common conventional desserts it is high above the rest (brownies, popsicles, cookies, pies, cakes).  Yes, it appears if you attempt to make a &quot;healthy dessert&quot; you can do so.  Personally I would consider it diet food rather than actual indulgence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m American. Born and raised in the Midwest. We had rice pudding quite often. </p>

<p>The nineties never told me anything about fat. It&#39;s the saturated fat that&#39;s not healthy. Looking at <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-ice-creams-vanilla-i19095">http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-ice-creams-vanilla-i19095</a> it appears there&#39;s 4.9g (24%) of saturated fat in it. There&#39;s less fat, but more calories in rice pudding. However, it really depends on the ingredients one uses too. Note: The nutritional facts for ice cream are for 1/2 cup while the rice pudding facts are for 1 cup.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider &quot;healthy desert&quot; diet food at all. Nor would I consider any food that&#39;s &quot;healthy&quot; as a diet food. Everything we eat is a &quot;diet&quot;. Some people&#39;s &quot;diet&quot; consist of pizza, while other people&#39;s &quot;diet&quot; consist of no carbs. Too much of anything is bad. </p>

<p>This article also says nothing about ice cream. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m having this conversation with someone who thought saturated fat was the healthy fat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know who manufactures enteral foods? Nestlé. I have to be careful what I say next.. Because of that market, Nestle also manufacturers medical devices to deliver the food. So they&#39;re in the medical device business because they manufacture a food. I am part of a committee currently forming policy that the FDA will use to help &quot;decide&quot; relative risk for all future medical devices in the market. I&#39;m intentionally using vague colloquial language as I write this. OK so this committee I&#39;m on is kind of hidden in plain sight. It&#39;s really a small group doing something big...but my point is I was ...shocked... to learn how involved nestle is in this committee. You would have imagined we&#39;d have flown under the radar. I am really bound by contract to say little more, but I think you can read between the lines. I would not have imagined a company like that would be aware of what we were doing, and I&#39;d have never guessed, even if so, that they&#39;d have representation in the group. That representation has been very vocal and very dominant. </p>

<p>Realistically? No. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t try. I&#39;m just saying you shouldn&#39;t get your hopes up.</p>
