       It's difficult, but I think it's possible - maybe not just the Reddit community, I think you need Facebook users.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at every label anyway to avoid a bunch of other stuff like artificial coloring, corn syrup, etc etc, so it's just part of the mental checklist. You almost have to give up on bottled water, though - they've been buying up other water companies, so you think you're picking up some local water and look closely and dang it, Nestle again. It's impossible to do when eating out or visiting others, but I've been slowly converting friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are some things that are really tough - like, you want ice cream with few ingredients, real sugar, not much filler, can find at the store. Breyers fits the bill, isn't Nestle (Edy's, Dreyer's, Haagen Daazs). But is Unilever really any better? I dunno.

       To be honest, we really don't need ice cream, it's just empty calories. And even real sugar isn't good for you, considering cancer loves to feed on it.

       Real ice cream is not empty calories, and arguably the healthiest dessert around.  Not that there is a bunch of stiff competition.

       Got any nutrition info on them?  I'd be curious if the pie beat out a comparable Iceream with nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being way too American, I know nothing of rice pudding.  I imagine if you used vitamin rich rice it could be a contender, but that may not be how you make it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on point though, Icecream has protein, fat, calcium, and other vitamins in it.  And sorry, despite what the nineties told you, fat is a valuable nutrient.  It is not just empty sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I was foolish using an -est on the internet, but as far as common conventional desserts it is high above the rest (brownies, popsicles, cookies, pies, cakes).  Yes, it appears if you attempt to make a "healthy dessert" you can do so.  Personally I would consider it diet food rather than actual indulgence.

       I'm American. Born and raised in the Midwest. We had rice pudding quite often.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nineties never told me anything about fat. It's the saturated fat that's not healthy. Looking at
       <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-ice-creams-vanilla-i19095">
        http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-ice-creams-vanilla-i19095
       </a>
       it appears there's 4.9g (24%) of saturated fat in it. There's less fat, but more calories in rice pudding. However, it really depends on the ingredients one uses too. Note: The nutritional facts for ice cream are for 1/2 cup while the rice pudding facts are for 1 cup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't consider "healthy desert" diet food at all. Nor would I consider any food that's "healthy" as a diet food. Everything we eat is a "diet". Some people's "diet" consist of pizza, while other people's "diet" consist of no carbs. Too much of anything is bad.

       Saturated fat is the good kind, and it sounds like rice pudding is closer to the "empty calories" end of the spectrum.

       This article also says nothing about ice cream. I can't believe I'm having this conversation with someone who thought saturated fat was the healthy fat.

       There's more than one type of rice pudding too. Consider the ingredients used. Use google. It's your friend.

       I lack interest in becoming a rice pudding expert, sorry. I'd still say from what you e given me it certainly fits the "empty calories" bill better than ice cream, especially ones with fruits or nuts included (since you want to invoke specialty puddings).

       I'm no pudding expert either. I'm using Google to do some research for healthy alternatives to ice cream. I've never, ever heard anyone say ice cream is healthy. Fruit on rice pudding is a good idea.

       Do you know who manufactures enteral foods? Nestlé. I have to be careful what I say next.. Because of that market, Nestle also manufacturers medical devices to deliver the food. So they're in the medical device business because they manufacture a food. I am part of a committee currently forming policy that the FDA will use to help "decide" relative risk for all future medical devices in the market. I'm intentionally using vague colloquial language as I write this. OK so this committee I'm on is kind of hidden in plain sight. It's really a small group doing something big...but my point is I was ...shocked... to learn how involved nestle is in this committee. You would have imagined we'd have flown under the radar. I am really bound by contract to say little more, but I think you can read between the lines. I would not have imagined a company like that would be aware of what we were doing, and I'd have never guessed, even if so, that they'd have representation in the group. That representation has been very vocal and very dominant.

       If you are going to make a post to advocate for a boycott, maybe you shouldn't ask a question in the headline that indicates that you are not personally trying to avoid buying the products of the company you want to boycott.

        Also could the Reddit community have a large enough impact ?

       Realistically? No. I'm not saying you shouldn't try. I'm just saying you shouldn't get your hopes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I should explain further. If you keep your goals focused and realistic, you will be more effective in the long term. The more lofty your goals are, the easier it is to be discouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, if anything I've said here is enough to discourage you from trying, then you weren't going to accomplish anything anyways.

       Saturated fat is the good kind, and it sounds like rice pudding is closer to the "empty calories" end of the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, that's just going on your description, I still haven't seen the nutritional values.
