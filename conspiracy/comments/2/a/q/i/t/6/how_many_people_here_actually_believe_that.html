       say yes if you do, no if you do not. hopefully this will be a bit of survey. comments that don't give a definitive answer won't be included, if you are wondering. i know some might think i will let every comment be included and ruin the survey. so for everyone out there, the % i hope to come up with won't be misleading

       I don't think religion would figure into whether someone will be shipped off into camps. It will be based upon the individuals political views and their affinity towards "extremism". Kinda like the McCarthyism era, ya dig?

       Then my answer is "Most definitely" It appears that there will be Christians in a camp from July to August this year. Juniors and Early Teens included..

       I think it's very likely. The excuse won't be because they are Christians, it will be because they are (supposedly) disgruntled survivalists seeking to overthrow the government, who all own numerous guns (legally, but that won't be mentioned) and who live in compounds in the woods (otherwise known as "farms").

       Check out all of this guys history. Its always supporting our government and calling other anti-gov out on their statements/opinions. 'Debunking' words with more words...right. To me, OP looks like a government shill. But what do I know...

       Yes. There are many christian summer camps every year. Just look up vacstion bible school.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the fema camp type, nope. Not any time soon. Much needs to happen before they start throwing people into fema camps...

       Your survey will really only tell you what a percentage of the people who are willing to answer on a conspiracy forum believe. And the type of people who answer will also be slanted toward the more paranoid who would want to spread their paranoia.

       This is silly, I think its much more likely that there will be a lot less christians, and that practicing christians will be marginalized and mocked to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, this is coming from a godless anarchist that spends plenty of time laughing at your invisible friend jesus.

       That being said, christianity is one of the core beliefs that hold together the classic family structure, a structure that is fundamentally opposed to what the plutocrats want to achieve, i.e a global government populated by "individuals" that have allegiance to no organization other than the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local churches, other community organizations, and the family itself need to be removed for their plans to function.

       As much as I believe in womens rights and the right of people to fuck whoever they fucking want as long as its consensual, this is also why LGBT and womens rights are being promoted heavily from the powers that be, it also serves to undermine said structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people know how hard it will be to get us all to fall in line, they are trying to remove any obstacles.

       yall need to stop worrying about fucking camps and gulags however, think more brave new world and less 1984, that is my prognosis

       See this is where an honestly informative education would come in handy for everyday americans.
       <br/>
       Seemingly little known fact:  Germany was a Christian nation when Judea declared war upon them.  The European Jews got sent into the lavish pre-made camps (nicer than today's FEMA camps), some like
       <a href="http://youtu.be/LpwR_rnhetw">
        Auschwitz even had a swimming pool and a theater
       </a>
       where inmates could enjoy some arts and leisure/exercise.  The european jews were all safely tucked away and brainwashed with 'work makes you free' conditioning.  Meanwhile, the real death camps were built to contain POW.
Even NY times hinted at the plot in 1914, when they italicized a certain sentence of an article to highlight the coming "
