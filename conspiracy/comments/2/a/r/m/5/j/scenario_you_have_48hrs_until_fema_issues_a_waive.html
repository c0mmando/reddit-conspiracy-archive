       Haha not in a million years.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first question would be how on
       <em>
        earth
       </em>
       they prepared and tested this hypothetical vaccine quickly enough to justify a mass experiment on an unprecedented level.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this "potential" epidemic is still looming, that's not
       <em>
        nearly
       </em>
       enough time to properly prepare, mass produce and evaluate the safety and efficacy of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       vaccine.

       They lied to use about the histories of smallpox, polio and many other diseases. I don't expect the truth anytime soon.

       They get their money no matter who is giving the vaccines. FEMA don't have the abilities to manufacture vaccines themselves, so someone has to pay for it. Just like how massive piles of money were made during the swine flu "epidemic".

       First of all, it would be the CDC doing this, not FEMA. FEMA would just be a coordinator. In the event of a viral epidemic, the CDC has pretty much full control.

       No, wouldn't want to catch any autism...
      </p>
      <p>
       But on a serious note, vaccines take quite some time to develop. If a virus was going around and there's only 48 hours to decide, something is very fishy... I'm assuming this notion of 48 hours would be the first time the virus is 'revealed' to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the virus could have been going around for a longer time and they didn't inform us, but they did decide to make a vaccine? That doesn't add up in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there must be lies somewhere, either in the reporting of the activity of the virus, or the vaccine is just bullshit and the administration of it has some alternative motive hidden behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, fishy for me... Would not take it. Didn't take it with the swine flu either, luckily many people in my country were quite skeptical about it. But that's a different story.

       You want to know if I'm collecting data? No, absolutely not. Genuinely curious as to what event would lead to the majority of those who are anti-vaccine to decide, "hell with it, I'd rather get the vaccine than deal with the likelihood of contracting contagion-x".  I'm trying to understand how bad it'd have to be before you had everyone, including vax skeptics, lining up to be injected.

       I ask this because I really don't know what I would do and thinking about the decision is somewhat overwhelming. Is this a pros and cons situation for people, or just an unequivocal "yes"or "no"?

       Its more of a pros/cons than a clear yes/no to me. If there was a massive epidemic, there would be panic, chaos, quarentines, and riots. It is then, imo, better to run off to the woods with a bug out bag and some heat (preferably having a place and a plan already set up). Vaccines might help, but, they might hurt.

       In this case, i would dip out in a hear beat i wouldnt wait for the vaccines to run out while i am in line to receive one. Imagine the ferociousness of parents trying to protect their children when the vaccines run out... My god. The woods would be a much better place, i think...

       That would be exactly how this epidemic spreads, it's no secret they put live strains of any sort of virus in the vaccine shot "to aid you immune system to fight off the infection", which is bullshit. Way too many people get sick after the go around of vaccines. What i would do though, is get my shit together and GTFO.

       If there was an epidemic of an existing disease, what then? Is that why vaccines are stock piled? There wouldn't necessarily have to be an outbreak of something new for the CDC to decide a mass inoculation was needed.

       Vaccines are how they spread highly profitable autoimmune diseases so as they can sell more drugs, it's a way of increase the size of the pharmaceutical drug sales market.  The CDC will always come up with a random excuse for us to take their toxic industry-stimulating jabs, the most important thing is to remember what their game is.  So don't believe anything they say and avoid all vaccines

       That makes absolutely no sense given that the very same vaccines are administered in healthcare systems that fully or part publicly funded and payments are capped, no sane public health authority would administer something that massively increases its costs down the line and it would be impossible to hide the outcome from public health systems given the level of data collection that goes on within them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with the OPs proposal is one of testing and safety (and the fact that unlike in Hollywood movies, you can't create a vaccine rapidly with any sort of assurance that it'll actually work).

       That's kind of my underlying question, how bad would it have to get before people were willing to take the gamble that it may not work? If there was a mystery flu going around and it had an 80% fatality rate, and the cdc could tweak one of their existing stored flu vaccines in an attempt to combat the new strain, would people be voluntarily lining up to get the shot?

       At the top of the system it is private, these people make money based on how many sick people there are, the public part takes 'advice' from the private part and put there own people into it.  If there isn't enough money to fund all of the treatments then they request a budget increase, so the private companies eventually get their extra profits.

This is not even a question of whether vaccines cause or can result in autism, or whether they actually end up making you catch the illness they are trying to prevent.

       They would have to actually make vaccines safe and take them away from the evil corporations who produce them.  I wouldn't allow any product from Merck, Bayer, GSK and Co into my body.  These corporations are sick and twisted, they've been caught deliberately contaminating their products with HIV and Cancer viruses, accepting a vaccine is one of the most foolish things you can ever do
