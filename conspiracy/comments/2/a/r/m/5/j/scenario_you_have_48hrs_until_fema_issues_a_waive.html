    <div class="md"><p>Haha not in a million years.</p>

<p>My first question would be how on <em>earth</em> they prepared and tested this hypothetical vaccine quickly enough to justify a mass experiment on an unprecedented level.</p>

<p>If this &quot;potential&quot; epidemic is still looming, that&#39;s not <em>nearly</em> enough time to properly prepare, mass produce and evaluate the safety and efficacy of <em>any</em> vaccine.</p>

<p>They lied to use about the histories of smallpox, polio and many other diseases. I don&#39;t expect the truth anytime soon.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take my chances, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, wouldn&#39;t want to catch any autism...</p>

<p>But on a serious note, vaccines take quite some time to develop. If a virus was going around and there&#39;s only 48 hours to decide, something is very fishy... I&#39;m assuming this notion of 48 hours would be the first time the virus is &#39;revealed&#39; to us. </p>

<p>So the virus could have been going around for a longer time and they didn&#39;t inform us, but they did decide to make a vaccine? That doesn&#39;t add up in my mind.</p>

<p>So there must be lies somewhere, either in the reporting of the activity of the virus, or the vaccine is just bullshit and the administration of it has some alternative motive hidden behind it. </p>

<p>Either way, fishy for me... Would not take it. Didn&#39;t take it with the swine flu either, luckily many people in my country were quite skeptical about it. But that&#39;s a different story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its more of a pros/cons than a clear yes/no to me. If there was a massive epidemic, there would be panic, chaos, quarentines, and riots. It is then, imo, better to run off to the woods with a bug out bag and some heat (preferably having a place and a plan already set up). Vaccines might help, but, they might hurt. </p>

<p>In this case, i would dip out in a hear beat i wouldnt wait for the vaccines to run out while i am in line to receive one. Imagine the ferociousness of parents trying to protect their children when the vaccines run out... My god. The woods would be a much better place, i think...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the top of the system it is private, these people make money based on how many sick people there are, the public part takes &#39;advice&#39; from the private part and put there own people into it.  If there isn&#39;t enough money to fund all of the treatments then they request a budget increase, so the private companies eventually get their extra profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the fuck would I do that? I&#39;ve never gotten vaccinated and I&#39;ve never gotten sick. This is not even a question of whether vaccines cause or can result in autism, or whether they actually end up making you catch the illness they are trying to prevent. I literally just have no need for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would have to actually make vaccines safe and take them away from the evil corporations who produce them.  I wouldn&#39;t allow any product from Merck, Bayer, GSK and Co into my body.  These corporations are sick and twisted, they&#39;ve been caught deliberately contaminating their products with HIV and Cancer viruses, accepting a vaccine is one of the most foolish things you can ever do</p>
