<blockquote>
<p>The US has a bunch of underground cities they have been working on since the early 50&#39;s. these are fully equipped cities but miles underground. believe it or not, i believe they have been putting people down their for years to test the living conditions for a prolonged amount of time. My thoughts are the people from the plains of 9/11 were moved there against their will. I believe Israel also has been doing the same with shared technology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone has any idea what he is talking about? Looking for any information, and possibly a discussion on this.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

<p>There was also a television show that presented evidence that there is probably a DUMB base under Denver International Airport: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gROTdpI1wW4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gROTdpI1wW4</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s probable that this all started in the 80s with Rex 84 and the &quot;Continuity of Government&quot; plans which were exposed in Congressional hearings during the Iran Contra saga: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0IL7k3elQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0IL7k3elQ</a></p>

Everyting I&#39;ve found says that the Free Masons are king of like a club, like a cigar club (probably not the best thing to compare them too), but they don&#39;t sacrifice, they are just there.

    <div class="md"><p>He is not a fallen angel as said in the Bible, but of another being called jinn. That is probably where the word genie comes from. Jinn are like humans in that they were created by God, and have free will. We cannot see them, but they exist either among us or in another dimension. They will be judged, just like the rest of us. They are made from fire as we are made from clay. Some say you can communicate with them, but the Jinn who can communicate with humans are said to be extremely evil. Iblis did not want to bow down to Adam, as God ordered of all his creations, jinn and angels alike. That is when God damned him, and the rest is about the same (eating from the forbidden tree, etc.) </p>

<p>There is this former secret book called &quot;Morals and Dogma&quot; by Albert Pike, a former 33rd Degree FreeMason, which is AKA &quot;The Bible of FreeMasonry&quot; which was only read by FreeMasons in the 28/29/30-33rd degrees. You can find copies of Morals and Dogma on the internet. </p>

<p>In &quot;Morals and Dogma&quot;, Pike claims that &quot;Lucifer&quot; (as in, Satan) is the &quot;Light-Bearer&quot; (as in God).</p>

<p>The Skull &amp; Bones Society is also the biggest FreeMason branch in North America. Members of this branch include George W. Bush and Al Gore.</p>

<p>Most FreeMasons don&#39;t make it passed the 3rd degree, if I recall correctly. The low levels of the Masons are not informed of the greater truths that are reserved for those that make it to the 28/29/30th-33rd degree, which is often in contradiction to the knowledge spread upon the lower levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Dice is absolutely useless, I can&#39;t stand to listen to more than a few seconds of that guy. Here are all the words that come out of his mouth: &quot;[Insert celebrity name here] is a satanic [insert bad language here]&quot;</p>

<p>I graduated junior high school a long time ago, I have no desire to subject myself to that level of.... discourse... again.</p>

<p>Exactly what qualifications does he have? What objective evidence does he have for his claims? Why do you personally trust anything he says?</p>

<p>However, the Pike book is intriguing. That&#39;s likely something I need to read.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I have no faith in humanity anyway. As in, I have no faith in people like Mark Dice or a congressman actually wanting the world to be a better place. So if there really are satanic Illuminati masons out there, I find it interesting more than scary because we&#39;re all fucked anyway.</p>

Each of his books on TPTB and whatnot consist of 10% of sources at the back of the book.
What I find to be the most informative part of his book is the chapter titled &quot;Nonfiction Books&quot;. And as someone that has almost read all of his books on TPTB, I find them to be good.</p>

<p>I dont like most of his videos either, but using that to judge his credibility of his books is a logical fallacy.</p>

<p>The deepest mines in the world go down to a max depth of about 2- 2.5 miles. Even at 2 miles;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mine is so deep that temperatures in the mine can rise to life-threatening levels. Air conditioning equipment is used to cool the mine from 55 °C (131 °F) down to a more tolerable 28 °C (82 °F). The rock face temperature currently reaches 60 °C (140 °F).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the wiki link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TauTona_Mine">Tautona</a> mine in South Africa. You could build a super-deep underground city. But to go beyond a certain depth, you&#39;d be dependent on some sort of cooling technology to maintain livable conditions. What&#39;s more, the whole point of an underground city is survival and concealment. All the heat from your cooling equipment would have to go somewhere. The heat plume from a 2.5 mile deep underground city would be impossible to conceal from IR detectors.</p>

I mean, that 25 Million is 5/6 of the population of Beijing- if the PRC has adequate evacuation time, then the Communist party will be able to start after any nuclear war with the personnel and army to at least allow them to restore order in Northern China, and set them on a good path to controlling the rest of China in a decade.</p>
