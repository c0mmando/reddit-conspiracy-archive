    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, right now I&#39;m reading A Song of Ice and Fire and so much of &quot;the game of thrones&quot; played by the kings and lords and whisperers reminds me of how I&#39;ve seen international politics since I was 16. So many strings being pulled that the base level issues essentially mean nothing in the end game.</p>

<p>Of course, I can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; anything about this comparison, but I found it interesting and humorous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To each his own, I didn&#39;t think I would be able to get into fantasy but I haven&#39;t stopped reading them since I picked up the first. I actually found it more difficult to get into the show than into the books, but that might be because it&#39;s somewhat easier to make sense of all the characters and different happenings and lore when it&#39;s all in text.</p>

<p>I highly encourage reading at least the first book, if you enjoy reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Planning (and carrying out) your sister&#39;s surprise birthday is not a conspiracy unless you and at least one other person are somehow outside of the law with the plan.</p>

<p>Secrecy can often involve simply not broadcasting, not admitting, or even lying what you intend to do, or what you did.  Zionists achieve what they think is secrecy by denying what they&#39;re doing, or lying about it.  The Israeli attack on Gaza, taking place right now, is a conspiracy, a very big one, because according to International Law, collective punishment is a war crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a business issue, $8,000 owed to me on a previous debt by one of two business partners.  The other business partner, was not aware that the first business partner owed me the money for a previous debt, thought that he had paid for some new equipment.  Not getting the true story from his own business partner, decided to take up his lost money with his friend, the county sheriff, and instead of taking up his gripe in civil court, got his friend, the sheriff, to go to the grand jury and get an indictment for grand larceny of the amount paid to me.  When the judge heard that the district attorney was in on this he dismissed the charge and accused the DA of merely using the grand jury as a rubber stamp for the sheriff and his friends.  I successfully sued the sheriff and DA for false arrest and damage to my reputation.  That&#39;s about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See guys? This is why reddit censoring the front page is such a big deal. Guys like this are the ones we are trying to affect by posting these stories all the time and if they never hit the front page they will never be seen by the people who need to see them the most.</p>

<p>And Luke, some advice from me would be to read as much as you can and don&#39;t make your mind up about anything. You will find so much conflicting information about conspiracies that sometimes your head will spin. Just realize that you are better off being aware of and understanding all of the potential truths than you are sticking your head in the sand and pretending like they could never happen.
So even if you find yourself overwhelmed don&#39;t give up, fill yourself with as much knowledge as you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome :)  Here are a few tips:</p>

<p>Beware of the Conspiratard brigade. </p>

<p>Keep an open mind and do your own research.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t trust everything posted here.  <em>Conspiratards are known to post disinformation as well as blatant BS here in an attempt to discredit this sub.</em></p>

<p>Most importantly, take a deep breath, relax, and hold on tight.  Once you take the red pill there is no going back.  The rabbit hole is deep. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree with this enough. I&#39;ve probably spent hundreds of hours researching 9/11.

<p>Yea, thats pretty much how it is for a lot of us. Of course, there is a ton of diagreement even within our own community, but at least the majority are openminded <em>enough</em> to get ideas, sources, and information to start your own journey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember at the time of the initial Snowden leaks and even before and after how everybody on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was retarded for entertaining the notion that someone could be putting time and effort into swaying public opinion on Internet forums and such and how anyone who believed it was delusional and paranoid. The &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; community didn&#39;t really help its case by screaming &quot;jidf please go&quot; every time someone disagreed with them but that doesn&#39;t mean we should have dismissed the notion entirely. I was one of the people dismissing everyone who entertained the notion as paranoid and I feel damn foolish for falling for their propaganda techniques. Thankfully I&#39;m not one of those stubborn people who are just screaming back going: &quot;yeah well you got lucky this one time. You&#39;re still paranoid and you weren&#39;t even that right.&quot; That argument can only work so many times. If your broken clock is right more than 2 twice a day then you have to ask yourself if it is indeed entirely broken</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What many anti conspiracy theorists can&#39;t understand is people with a deeper acceptance of the influence may not be spending their time trying to convince people who choose ignorance. You can&#39;t phone a person on the frontline of a war and demand proof they are being fired on... and expect politeness and an intellectual debate. No one owes you anything. The threat is real and many are trying to save themselves after banging their heads against the wall. It&#39;s so much worse than what appears on the front page of reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome aboard,</p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist isn&#39;t about religiously believing in lizard people, or that sandy hook was a hoax, or that 9-11 was an inside job.  There is nothing wrong with believing those things either and I&#39;m sure there are people here that do.  My point is that you aren&#39;t required to believe every conspiracy theory, to be a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  And more importantly, being a conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t mean that you believe in lizard people, it doesn&#39;t mean that you believe every conspiracy theory every proposed.  It doesn&#39;t mean you agree with the racism some people push, it doesn&#39;t mean you are anti American and it doesn&#39;t mean you are a paranoid schizophrenic.</p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t really mean anything at all.  It only demonstrates that you&#39;re willing to think for yourself and not blindly believe the lies that people of influence and power will tell you to cover up their crimes.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a very patriotic person but I hate the government. Love of your country doesn&#39;t mean submitting to its authority, especially when your country was founded because its mother country was abusing its authority.  </p>

<p>Believe what your own mind tells you is probable and don&#39;t let anyone tell you what to believe, it doesn&#39;t matter if that person is me, some other conspiracy theorist or CNN.</p>

<p>Everyone lies, and even if they aren&#39;t lying they might have the wrong idea about something.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll have too many takers for this one, but you&#39;re absolutely right - a significant number of commenters are relentlessly &quot;denialist&quot; about conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, anybody who has genuine evidence or a convincing argument to rebut a conspiracy theory is an asset to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. However, most of the disbelievers or &quot;skeptics&quot; work on the basis that the official, media-driven story is true until proven false. I think it safer to presume nothing and subject the official narrative to strict scrutiny. If it doesn&#39;t hold together, then it&#39;s fair game for analysis. </p>

<p>In fact most of the theories on this subreddit arise from inconsistencies or implausibilities within the official story or the with behavior of key individuals in the story (before, during and after the event).</p>

<p>However, from what you have said, you have the absolutely right the attitude and you&#39;ll make a good contribution to the sub. My best practical advice is to download RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) if you don&#39;t use it already - after doing some due diligence of course! There&#39;s a thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23a9jl/i_would_strongly_advise_users_of_rconspiracy_to/">here</a> discussing it. </p>

<p>RES keeps an automatic tally of how you have rated other users&#39; comments (by counting your up and down votes). It also allows you to tag other users who make a comment you particularly agree or disagree with. It&#39;s a very useful tool, in my view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just realize that this is r/conspiracy. Every post here HAS to be a conspiracy (whether it is or isn&#39;t), because otherwise it&#39;s not suitable for this sub. So if everything is automatically a conspiracy, that means &quot;I need to push my ideology&quot; rather than &quot;I&#39;m looking for the truth&quot;.</p>

<p>For proof, just look at the bottom of most posts. You&#39;ll find users with rational rebuttals to the often unsourced claims of the original post. Those rebuttals are downvoted many, many times and a lot of as hominem attacks are hurled at the user (despite it being against the sub&#39;s rules). Any responses by the user that&#39;s under attack are censored if they use similar language and they&#39;re banned under the guise of &quot;attacking the subreddit or its users&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we definitely shouldn&#39;t judge others by their history. I always try to hear someone out and go by evidence. I think the rest of reddit is tied of all the doomsday talk here that never comes to pass, the false flags that are never proven, the anti-Semitism and the blatant vote-brigading. Plus the penchant of a lot of users here to scream &quot;WE WERE RIGHT!&quot; when, in reality, they had made unsubstantiated claims that were only tangentially related to what was shown to be true. </p>

<p>You used the word &quot;paranoid&quot; when you meant &quot;skeptical&quot;. Check out a dictionary and get back to me. No offense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, conspiracy theories are different ideas about a suspicious event.  I don&#39;t believe in a single theory, but will point out all the facts surrounding the event and question the official theory.  For instance, the Norway Spiral, I find it hard to believe the explenation that the spiral was a fail missile test.  The reason are as follows, doesn&#39;t look like a missile for how slow it was going, but more importantly Russian denied they were testing a missile for a couple of days right after it happened.  The biggest aspect for me to question it is the spiral happened the day before Obama was to receive his Nobel Prize in Norway.  Think about that, The POTUS is about to get an award and russian fires a missile test over that country the day before.  That&#39;s huge international news, but no cared, because it was an excuse after the fact.  </p>

<p>Now that I question an event, there are tons of theories abouy what it could have been.  It could of been HAARP, could have been a worm hole, a test of some weapon un-known at the moment, or maybe it was a failed missile test and I&#39;m completely wrong, who know? I certainly don&#39;t, and I not going to act as though I do, but the whole situation makes me question what happened.  </p>

<p>Same goes with Osama&#39;s death, 9/11, boston bombing, the stock market,  bilderberg, Bohimian grove, the fed, and so on.  </p>

<p>Edit: It ultimately boils down to keeping an open mind about the various out comes or reasons something happened.</p>

<p>911 was 100% false flag</p>

<p>boston bombing - staged, no doubt (you don&#39;t live very long with 2 blown off legs and a loose tourniquet)</p>

<p>Apollo - not sure about it all, I think there were embellishments at the very least</p>

<p>HAARP - as a by product it does alter the weather, thats fact not theory</p>

<p>Alex Jones and David Icke is what is called controlled opposition. AJ is the &#39;king of conspiracy theorist&#39;, which is why he is allowed on TV to shout and make a fool of not only himself, but other &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and the cause itself obviously. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvvPIaYrSo">Here is 5 hours of him being close to insane</a>. But if you discredit some conspiracies or all conspiracies all together because of David Icke and Alex Jones, sorry, but you&#39;ve fallen into their trap. The &quot;duality&quot; trap. </p>

<p>And if you think CNN and MSNBC is even close to credible sources, well, you&#39;re just hurting yourself. Forget the talking heads and the big 5 companies that own 90% of what you hear, read and see through the media. They are designed to keep people from thinking outside of the box, plain and simple. It&#39;s not about what they&#39;re reporting, it&#39;s about what they&#39;re not reporting! I.e CNN and the 730 airplane they milked for like 50 days. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwept9C509o">50 days with nothing but bullshit speculation and conspiracy theories on &#39;who dun it&#39;, including ailien theories.</a> AND YOU CALL THEM CREDIBLE!?</p>

<p>They don&#39;t report of actual conspiracies, making them nonexistent in million of peoples minds, but they jump on board with pure speculation on some tragedy with a missing plane that is going nowhere. And they won&#39;t let go for weeks, giving them plenty of bullshit to talk about instead of actual news on how multinational corporations are looting America. I wonder why that is...</p>

<p>It seems like you know there&#39;s a lot of people full of bullshit, but I&#39;m sorry to say you are only halfway there. Know yourself and then trust yourself, in that order. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get out of here with that shit. Infowars is as credible as any source, if you ask me. If you actually read an infowars article, you&#39;ll see there are links to every claim that is made. Get away from the Alex Jones hate. He&#39;s one guy with a huge team around him that are all working around the clock to get as much verifiable information out there as they possibly can. They&#39;re reaching millions of people every day. </p>

<p>Google these things, and come back with your findings:</p>

<p>Harvard Study Fluoride</p>

<p>Additives in vaccines</p>

<p>Monsanto lawsuits</p>

<p>Fast and Furious Eric Holder</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more, but that&#39;s a start. </p>
