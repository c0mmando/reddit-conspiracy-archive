        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don&#39;t understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government&#39;s claims are patently absurd.  I&#39;ll resolve that for you.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byxeOG_pZ1o">9/11/91</a> Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order.  Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world.  What could he be up to?</p>

<p>As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry.  We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc.  The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep.  Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton.  Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc.  You can educate yourself on those details.</p>

<p>This scandal goes mainstream around 1986.  In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.&#39;s treasury secretary.  Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type.</p>

<p>One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich.  Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time.  Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion.  He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda.  Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections.</p>

<p>Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich&#39;s personal money laundering machine.  This manifests ten years later.  If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don&#39;t have any real settlement issues.  There is one major exception however: Mogilevich&#39;s money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks.  The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it&#39;s balances without a record.  It&#39;s worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC.</p>

<p>So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from?  What were they used for?  This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse.  You&#39;ll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like <em>The Money Plane</em> in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets.  It&#39;s estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993.</p>

<p>In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene.  He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob.  Next thing you know 9/11 happens.  There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I&#39;d like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts.</p>

<p>On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera.  Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11.  This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes.  Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington.  In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying &quot;Angel is next,&quot; angel being code for the president that only insiders would have.  (* &quot;Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?&quot; Fleischer: &quot;Yes, I can. That&#39;s correct.&quot;(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter&#39;s onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge.  Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in).  Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site.  After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site.  You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian.  This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict).  So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt?  Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays.  </p>

<p>This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it.  But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia.  Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized.  Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks.  So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public.</p>

<p>With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror.  You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia.  It won&#39;t be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it&#39;s missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction.  Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year.  Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example.</p>

<p>So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government.  (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended)</p>

<p>So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it&#39;s easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example.  You don&#39;t even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without <em>something</em> being done to backstop the US dollar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think this strikes the right balance of hard, tangible fact that is accessible and undeniable to the average person yet still shocking?</p>

<p>Obviously there are more complicated questions of the collapse physics, more detail to be provided on various money trails, operational players, and even esoteric significance of the event - but I think a lot of people start drifting off when you get into those things as they become essays unto themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes to both paragraphs. You, however, &quot;followed the money&quot; in a way that explains the Russian connection. I/we have read much that ties in the relationship of 9/11 to the banks, the MIC, the ME and &quot;god&#39;s chosen,&quot; but very little about that angle and the BoNY.</p>
