    <div class="md"><p>Zionists have one goal: the preservation of Israel.  They do not care how they go about it whether through deceit, terrorism, subjugation, etc. Many Zionists are Israeli, many have dual citizenship in the US, many are American.  But they all share that same goal.  Zionists in the US have more-or-less permeated the United States govt to the point that the US govt works for Israel at the expense of the US.  Since Zionists are the controllers of world capital through the banking system, they essentially rule countries, including our own.  Zionists advocate stealing land from the Palestinians, disregarding them as humans.  They also anger every country in the Middle East through their disregard for human rights.  This is why the Middle East hates Israel.  It&#39;s also why they hate us--because we gave Israel all of its weapons, and we give them billions in aid each year so they can spend it to further disenfranchise the Palestinians.  Zionists have hijacked the US and are using it as their own tool to execute their twisted brand of foreign policy (look no further than Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran).  If Israel doesn&#39;t like someone, you can guarantee the president will be on TV talking about going to war with them.  Many people even think Israel had a role in nine-eleven (and with good reason).  The main reason people don&#39;t like Zionists is because they&#39;ve stuck their hands in the US as one would a puppet, and are using the US for their own gain at the expense of the US citizen.  Many would like all ties to be severed with the Zionists and Israel.</p>

They do a lot of shady shit (i.e. Palestinian genocide) with a lot of shady people (the CIA, US gov&#39;t at large) in shady ways (double standards, out-right lies).

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish money handlers and bankers introduced the concept of interest into loan repayment.  Charging interest has been outlawed as &#39;evil&#39; and &#39;enslaving&#39; by many cultures and societies.  The reason you pay 4 times for your house over 30 years what you agree to pay for your house is because of interest, a Jewish concept.  The whole point of interest is to ensure that people who have money don&#39;t have to work - they only have to charge interest.  It&#39;s neat for them because they can effectively enslave people - whole populations.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Established in 1961, Camp Judaea is a small, <strong>Jewish, Israel-centered summer camp for boys and girls ages 7-15</strong> nestled on 118 acres in beautiful Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Camp Judaea we offer a wide variety of exceptionally fun activities in a loving family atmosphere. Our activities include horseback riding, farming, basketball, softball, volleyball, flag football, ultimate frisbee, archery, visual arts, cooking, pottery, metalwork, singing, dancing, drama, campouts, field trips, swimming, boating, tennis, special teen trips to New York &amp; Washington, DC, backpacking and so much more. <strong>Our philosophy centers around five developmental “pillars”: Israel, Judaism</strong>, Nature, Community and Individual Growth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Camp Judaea’s “tsevet” (staff) is comprised of individuals who have years of experience in summer camping, both as campers and as staff, and a desire and ability to work with children. They are enthusiastic and motivated to work with children in our unique environment. They bring with them an understanding of young people, camping skills, <strong>and an outstanding Jewish and Zionist background.</strong> </p>

<p>So sure kids play, have fun, <strong>and learn about &quot;Zionist Heroes&quot; like the terrorist organization Irgun</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the Deir Yassin massacre, carried out together with Lehi on 9 April 1948.</p>

<p>The Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts.[3][4] In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain,[5] the 1946 Zionist Congress[6] and the Jewish Agency.[7] The Irgun believed that any means necessary to establish the Jewish State of Israel, including terrorism, was justifiable.[8]</p>

<p>The &quot;campers&quot; then take a trip to Israel where they are pressured to be &quot;Most Moral&quot; IDF conscripts ...where they get to beat handcuffed Arab children on a daily basis. </p>

<p>After the Second World War there was a sharp rise in Zionist terrorism in Palestine, which was still administered by Britain, in an attempt to put pressure on Clement Attlee&#39;s Labour government to create a Jewish state.  </p>

People can, and have, interpreted that in varying ways, but that&#39;s how it started off. Obviously nationalism can run extreme and have some nasty consequences, but I think as a whole this subreddit overestimates both the intent and the level of Jewish influence in world--and especially US--affairs. Also, to be clear, are you saying that Zionists caused the Syrian troubles? Because, kind of to reiterate a point of my argument, that place was a powder-keg created by a toxic mix of colonial and Cold War influence, and to ascribe the current chaos purely to Zionists is disingenuous at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some theories surrounding zionism. Plenty, actually. The most common ones are centered around money. <strong><em>Alledgedly</em></strong> the owners of some of the biggest banks (think the federal reserve, goldman sachs, etc.,) in the world are zionists. They are behind the federal reserve act, the federal reserve itself, and everything concerning banking, basically. If you control the economy, you control the people.</p>

<p>Some take it much further, sprouting from the above towards an idea about something along the lines that when the fed was created back around 1913 or so, the bankster bailed out americas economy. In return, they were offered the authority to print money for our government. Some take it further than that and say that during this period, the bankster and the then current politicians struck a deal that essentially turned america into a business or corporation rather than a self-sovereign nation. The great depression was basically economical arson, and through insider trading a very few individuals got sickenly wealthy.</p>

<p>Then, there are more theories that take it further, and explain how the zionists end goal is to take over the world, and that hitler saw how they were invading/infiltrating his country by taking many different political roles, and thus, the holocaust. (Thats a bit too far for my taste, just for the record)...</p>

<p>Some people will even theorize that one of the results of zionism has been and is the removal of palestinians from their land. And, through contracts/agreements/treaties/alliances, are the fundamental reason why america is such a war whore. They claim it is a direct result of the zionists who have infiltrated our country&#39;s government to help them succeed in their end goal...</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly plenty more theories surrounding zionism. The best thing for you to do is to educate yourself. It is a touchy topic for some, because they are too ignorant and refuse to educate thenselves on the differences between zionism and judaism. Youd want to make sure you understand the differences clearly, and then the theories surrounding zionism become more intelligible.</p>

<p>Btw, id look into the controversial nature of the antidefamation league as well. </p>

<p>Now, on a personal level, i dont necessarily believe these theories about zionism. I still have yet to find suitable evidence. But, what i will tell you is that if you do enough research, especially if you come across some websites written by jews who are against zionism and explain why, you will find that some things dont add up. There is certainly an agenda or ploy at foot with zionism, but to what end? No one can say for sure.</p>

<p>But, it truely is best to research this topic yourself, and to not let others, eslecially on this sub, ruin your integrity through hearsay, as many, many, many folks in this particular sub either dont understand what zionism actually is, and by extension, the very theories they say they subscribe too. It makes them look silly and/or racist and/or ignorant. </p>

<p>It should be fairly easy to read for several hours of info concerning this topic, so i will make a short list of things for you to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the federal reserve act, the fed, and the theoriez behind all that mess</p></li>
<li><p>the antidefamation league</p></li>
<li><p>theodor herzl, the father of the modern political movement called zionism</p></li>
<li><p>askenazi jews vs sephardic jews vs mizrahi jews</p></li>
<li><p>the faith/religion of judaism itself</p></li>
<li><p>what zionists actually say about zionism, and what jews say about judaism</p></li>
<li><p>the long history of zionism</p></li>
<li><p>how the bankers play a role</p></li>
<li><p>how all these things are interconnected and differ from one another. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Wikipedia is a great source to start from, but i would suggest that once you exhaust wikipedia, move on to other websites, pro- and anti- zionism websites, as well as jewish and non-jewish websites. Try to br as unbiased in your research as you can.</p>

<p>TL;DR Zionism certainly has its place in this subreddit, as it is in abundance of theories about conspiracies and stuff... We just have to remain cognizant of the many misunderstandings, intentional or not, that comez with the topic.</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me refer you to the line where i said, &quot;<strong><em>TO START</em></strong>&quot;. It is most definately a fantastic way to <strong><em>start</em></strong> your research. To start means to begin, fyi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no &quot;allegedly&quot; - there is &quot;definitely&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no concrete proof of alot of the theories involving zionism. Show me the concrete proof, and ill change the word &quot;alledgedly&quot; to &quot;definately&quot;. </p>

<p>These theories alledge certain claims. There is much controversy about this topic, as well as all the other topics for that matter. So again, show me the proof, and i mean concrete proof, and ill personally edit my previous post.</p>

<p>Its funny how in the same comment you pointed out how they are so good at hiding things from the public, yet on the other hand you &quot;definately&quot; know these things as a fact.</p>

<p>This is the difference between you and i, i prefer to compartmentalize my beliefs against my speculations. I heavily enjoy discussing and speculating about things such as the theories surrounding zionism. But, i wont,not for a second, claim that these theories are true. Even if i believe them to be true, ill say that this is what i believe. I wont pedantically tell people they are wrong and i am right because i believe this theory and they dont. That wouldnt be openminded, and is not considered to he fair discourse. </p>

<p>For the record, i would love to hear what you have to say about zionism. I mean that with respect and candor. This is one of my favorite topics, actually. </p>

<p>Just do me a favor, and dont pedantically tell me im wrong when you missed some important key phrases in your haste to &quot;correct&quot; me where you believe differently.</p>

<p>There is always the option of agreeing to disagree, too. </p>

<p>(Btw, im interested to hear what you have to say about wikipedia being tainted as well. Please elaborate for me :-) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism isn&#39;t about $$$ or Judaism. It&#39;s really about rituals, numerology, mythology, the history of civilization/power, a mass of symbolic events, etc. It&#39;s deep, old esoteric shit. When people get caught up in just American history, they aren&#39;t looking deep enough. The current &quot;elite&quot; are older than the Torah.

<p>Close but not quite. While you make a choice to ignore the fact that the protocols of the elders of zion were, in fact, a hoax, i am ignorant of the details contained within its pages. All the while some dude down the street might not even know it exists, and therefore is ignorant of the fact that it is a real article of propaganda. </p>

<p>The two words have the same roots in latin, yet, ignore is not the root of ignorance. There is a slight difference in the meanings. But, to get back on track ill avoid the etymology...</p>

<p>As for why i havent read it yet, its because i dont really wish to read something that the nazis used as propaganda. I know enough about it to know i dont care much for it, thats all. Maybe one day ill read it through. Maybe. I just dont feel the need. And whether i read it or not doesnt change the fact that it is a fraudulent piece. </p>

<p>Where do you get your facts from, dude? Almost universally support zionism? Thats like saying that because the majority of americans are white, america is almost universally white.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the whole obsession that Jews control america is out of control, first of all I&#39;m a jew and I don&#39;t control anything, I pay taxes, I work a regular job, I owe bills and I drive a KIA. I struggle to live paycheck to paycheck and Jewish people are not as united as you think. Many Jews have issues with their synagogues due to high rates, Jews won&#39;t hesitate to undermine each other if it benefits them as a individual just like nonjews will take advantage of other nonjews if it benefits them. Zionism is split between Jews, we have religious Zionists, progressive Zionists, and anti Zionist Jews. a Satmar won&#39;t have the same views as a secular Jew or a Sephardic Jew. </p>

<p>If you want to talk foreign aid, america also sends plenty of foreign aid to Colombia and Egypt as well as Saudi arabia, I am opposed to all foreign aid anywhere.</p>

<p>I find it disturbing how people obsess about Jews controlling the country, we were hates in Europe for being hobos and not being able to work or mere merchants now we are hated for creating jobs and promoting education? </p>

<p>It seems like the issue in this country is people think it&#39;s a Jewish problem instead of looking at their colleagues and peers who vote the bad guys in power.</p>

<p>Nicely said. There are many issues with this country today, and you hit one of the big ones right on the dradle (sorry if that was disrespectful... I honestly meant it in jest)</p>
