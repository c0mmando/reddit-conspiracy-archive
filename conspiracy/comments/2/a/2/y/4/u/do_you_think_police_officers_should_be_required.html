       This is important.  There has already been evidence of officers turning off or otherwise tampering with body cameras that could have been used as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to enact policies whereby the camera is as necessary as the officer to the functioning of the duties.  If the camera is not in working order, then the officer is not in uniform.  It would be the equivalent of driving around in a squad car without functioning emergency lights.  The police officer cannot properly do his job without them.  Therefore when they are not funtioning, the officer is not in uniform, and thus is not properly representing the service and should thus be held accountable for any and all actions and complaints.

       Better said than how I was thinking it, thanks. I fully agree, all other service workers are under scrutiny of how they represent their company. Police, firefighters, and the like need to represent their services and their company being the city/state. Plus it's a respect thing for your coworkers.

       We should downgrade an officer's account of events to the legal status of hearsay even when they would be offering first person accounts; the only admissible testimony should be that of them helping to interpret the content of videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should an officer's word be trusted when it is so cheap to provide a more reliable account of events?  We no longer have any compelling interest in valuing the word of the officer.

       <em>
        over 110 per day.

       Yeah sorry for the lack of clarity, that was my point exactly. There is no way there are that many situations that require a SWAT team if their claim is that SWAT is only deployed for "especially dangerous" situations.

       that the article says one estimate is 80,000 per year! The most frequently appearing guesstimate seems to be 50,000.
      </p>

       The claim that this is necessary is, in the simple meaning of the word, unbelievable.

       Good friend of mine is a police chief in a small town. He made cameras mandatory for his officers as soon as he took office and there have been no "malfunctions" to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it's been extremely useful is actually as part of an internal investigation of one of his employees who is, delicately put, a piece of shit. What the cameras are getting him is going to be used as evidence to fire this person in the near future... and hopefully save my friend from some local political backlash.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, anecdotal I know, but here's an example of body cams being used to get a bad cop fired. I support their use absolutely, though they're only part of the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really the military-like structure of police depts isn't too far removed from the same military-like structure I've encountered in training as a surgeon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surgery is "softening" in a lot of ways... and the cops have softened a bit, too, but really you can trace almost every shitty cop on the street back to shitty leadership and a culture where if you speak out or complain or try to change things you're either beaten into submission or fired for trumped-up reasons and never let back into "the Club."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hold the Chief of Police
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       accountable for his/her officers' fuck-ups. Add in things like body cameras and people on the street not scared to film the cops working. I really believe those things will lead to us having some more honest--or at least cowed into behaving honestly--cops in our towns.

       I support their use to prove what happened, period.  If a cop is being a dick and deserves to have it used against them, so be it, and vice versa for actual criminals.  If it frees up those resources to find actual criminals that are causing real harm to society, so be it.

       The real hard thing about police filming and recording audio treads very closely to violating the 4th Amendment.  You could argue that you were being recorded by the police even if they're just conducting normal business.  Say you consent to a search when you visit a public event, all the police have camcorders, if they record audio while searching your bag then they would be violating the 4th.  Recording audio is the distinction in legality -- I don't really think the cameras would be that helpful unless they can record audio.

       You're not wrong. But I would rather have the cops videotape my pot (of which I have none. We decided no marijuaba because having kids will require adoption or surrogate, and we don't need one more roadblock) than have the cop go batshit crazy without evidence.

       Cameras everywhere? Hell, no.

       But if a minimum wage worker has to work under a camera, so should the cops. If mr gas station clerk has his rights violates, so should the police. Accountability.

       I would rather have the camera looking into my bag to catch the pig sneaking something in.... or "planting." The video would only be used by the courtroom... they wouldn't post them all over the internet....especially if private matters are involved. Wouldn't you rather have the viewer actually SEE the objects found in the bag instead of just taking the officers word on what was found?

       The "ONLY" downside I can think of is cost and logistics...
      </p>
      <p>
       So is it a central database for each department? Or each prescient? How long should records be kept? Every officer, every second while on duty? Thats A LOT of video.. Computer storage is cheap but i mean it still cost money. Furthermore what happens if it is broken then what is the recourse? Shit DOES break even if .5% breaks thats still more than a few officers across the US. Sooner or later one of those officers will be involved in something and it will just happen to be "broke". THere are a lot of problems but it is clearly a net positive

       I already did a cost analysis for every officer in the country. It wasn't much money. (For every police department's budget, I mean)

       why is this even a question? they are supposedly servants of the public upholding the law, they should have nothing to hide and if they fuck up badly enough they go find another job, just like everyone else.

       ABSOLUTELY. All of the studies of before and after with police video cameras being worn show a dramatic drop in violent police action.

       When police are worried they might be held accountable (MIGHT), their God complex gets eroded.

       Wouldn't that be really expensive? The cameras would probably break quite easily, plus camcorders are fairly heavy.

       Use a modified go pro thats modified into a tac vest or something, since we know they prolly want to wear them all the time anyway, with a 2.5 ssd for storage and a battery to last a shift. not hard at all and cheap.

       I think suing the police for damages in a situation where a camera would prove appropriate police action might justify the expense.
