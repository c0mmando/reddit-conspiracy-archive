    <div class="md"><p>Ok I am black and from a mostly black city. I am from Richmond Va and was there during the Obama election where this was also a problem.</p>

<p>The thing is, it is not evenly enforced. Richmond is racist/segregated as fuck by both sides. Only the black communities saw as much pressure to have a load of paperwork. </p>

<p>It was not just the IDs, they required other random crap like bills to prove you <em>still do</em> live in the districts as presented on your ID. </p>

<p>A lot of my neighborhood were older black people, so they a) are strongly going to vote Obama/Democrat and b) are not able to keep up with all these <strong>new</strong> rules, they&#39;re old and just don&#39;t have the time so likely won&#39;t turn out. I know this because I went on foot door to door for like 3 weeks as a volunteer making sure people had their voting material.</p>

<p>A lot of the (black) youth also &quot;weren&#39;t feelin it&quot; because most of them don&#39;t even have jobs or proper paper work because the economy sucked in their side of the community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s racist because it was not evenly enforced. Look at how they&#39;re treating the Mexican border differently than the Canadian border. I have met plenty of illegals here in Portland OR, mostly Russian who have flat out jokingly told me they don&#39;t have ID and so on. People focus on the Hispanics but I notice no one ever brings up the hugely growing population of Asians on the west coast. Just because the government does things like this it is for a reason and not always applied fairly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok the voter ID thing is a different story.  The real difference between Canada and Mexico though is economic rather than racial.  </p>

<p>I think a better immigration policy is to do it like Singapore does, and just set quotas for whatever the economy needs. </p>

<p>1,000 doctors, 3,000 engineers, 5,000 nurses, and so on.  </p>

<p>Instead we&#39;re opening the door, so typically the most poor and desperate people come across.  </p>

<p>Now, you can argue that we should accept these people and help them.  That&#39;s a fair argument.  But saying it&#39;s only because of race discounts the fact that it&#39;s an influx of people who need economic assistance at a time when existing Americans are struggling.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the core of the issue, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comparison with Canada is rather disingenuous, since there are extremely few people attempting to illegally immigrate across the Canada-US border. Obviously money for border security is best spent on the border that actually has a problem with illegal immigration. This doesn&#39;t make it a racist policy, just an efficient one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said there is a huge community of Russians in the outskirts of Washington/Oregon. They often come from Alaska, through Canada. </p>

<p>As far as the south, it is racist because the rules are enforced more with one group than the other. It was well documented that discrimination was occurring during the majority of the electoral process mostly in the black communities.</p>

<p>I think this is all irrelevant anyway, as if something like race would really matter to the higher ups that have already decided in this world of electronic voting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here are the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2009.pdf">Department of Homeland Security statistics</a> on illegal immigration, which show that Mexico and Central America make up over 70% of illegal immigrants. I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that these illegal immigrants are not entering through the Canada-US border.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s hard to find statistics for illegal immigration through the Canada-US border simply because no one really considers it an issue. Canadian citizens are hardly flooding the borders, considering how our standard of living is virtually identical. Also, any potential illegal immigrants able to get a visa to visit Canada would likely also be able to enter the United States, since Canada&#39;s entry policies are relatively similar, so there would be little point to entering through Canada.</p>

<p>(Edited to add): I agree with you in general though that the voter ID requirements can have an disproportionate effect on minority communities, and discourage participation. I just thought your border comparison was a bit off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not racist. Voter IDs doesnt target any specific race. However, enforcement/implementation of new rules can always be seen as favorable for one side or anothef.</p>

<p>In the case of voter ids though, it is not at all racist, as racist is discrimination against a certain ethnic group... Voter ID laws can be seen as discriminatory against the poorer class, though, as some of the folks in the country who live in poverty cant afford a car and/or a license or other form of identification. Some of the folks living in poverty cant show proof of where they live because they dont have any bills because they cant afford to pay them. This effectively strips away their right to vote and otherwise be represented in their district.</p>

<p>That is why people are against voter ID laws. Not because its racist. But because it is class warfare, essentially. </p>

<p>When people claim it is racist, they are just misunderstanding their own argument, as well as the actual definition of the term &quot;racist.&quot;</p>

<p>As for our borders, there are far more illegal immigrants coming from the south when compared to thise coming down from the north. Securing iur borders is not racist. That is enforcing the laws already on the books. There may be a bit of selective enforcement, which could be seen as favoring illegals from the north, and as such, coukd be viewed as discriminatory to those of the south. But then again, its not the laws that are racist or discriminatory, it is the execution and implementation that resides in the grey area.</p>

<p>Ideally, all of our borders should be secured. I support that motion, and i can see how it would be more prudent to start with the border that sees the most problems.</p>

<p>Often times people use the term &quot;racist&quot; to discredit any opposing views. Then the common folk take up that argument with ignorance of the definition of the word &quot;racist&quot; and just repeat what they were told without thinking about what it means to say something is racist. These folks typically do this with fervor and illogical emotion based on an argument that they havent taken the time to understand themselves, let alone the opposing arguments.</p>

And yes, mail-in voting is a main source of fraud, but not the only way.</p>

<p>Unlike what a previous responder wrote, white voters are not the primary write-in voters. There are no statistics for this. </p>

<p>What people don&#39;t like with requiring IDs for voting and securing the border is generally from a Democratic Party, not the Republicans. And for the record I am an Independent. The Democrats are generally the working class politicians who base their policies and campaigns on what the big-bad Republicans are doing to the little people, what they&#39;re (the Republicans) not giving to them, and what they (the Democrats) could be doing better for them...generally giving the people more by providing more government assistance and government regulation that will supposedly help the people to prosper. But what the people don&#39;t see is that this is simply a ploy to keep those politicians in a position of power all the while milking the people for more of what they have while providing them bread crumbs along the path to the next election. </p>

<p>How does IDs and border control play into this? Well if you require IDs then you put a huge restriction on voter fraud and those (crooked) politicians who don&#39;t really care about the people and only care about the money they receive from their high-powered jobs that they won&#39;t be elected as easily. </p>

<p>The only conflict that occurs with requiring IDs for voting is the fact that, as a free nation, with free men and women living in a country (supposedly) for the people, by the people, we shouldn&#39;t have to be required to show ID for anything unless we&#39;ve been stopped/detained for a crime. And while I agree with that wholeheartedly these past 2 elections have changed my views on that for voting purposes only. I believe that, if there was voter fraud, ID verification would have stopped most of it. Because realistically, we&#39;re already registering to vote which is against our basic freedoms so at this point checking IDs is just one simple added step to complete the process. </p>

<p>Same goes for border control. Generally, and this is generally speaking, the more intelligent citizen sees through the Democratic way of politics and government so they usually choose the lesser of 2 evils, the Republicans or an Independent. The Republicans, while not any more honest, at least base their politics on principals of (generally) lesser intrusion of big government into people&#39;s lives, economic growth, and prosperity. With that, they (generally) want a secure border and honest voting. </p>

<p>Independents can be any of these things. </p>

<p>So...what did we learn here? All politicians are scum and the US needs to reform voting and elections by and large. The borders should be secured plain and simple. Look up illegal border crossing for any other country and see what the punishment is. You&#39;ll be shocked by what you find...and they follow through. Not like us. </p>

<p>And elections? LOL! Mexico requires ID for elections. MEXICO!!! Need I say more?</p>

<p>So the next time idiots on any social media throw a fit because you have principals of ID requirements and border control, just laugh at them and know that they scored under a 90 on their IQ test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something everyone needs to keep in the forefront of their minds -- the truth is <em>never</em> racist. It&#39;s simply the truth. There is nothing racist about observing that the integrity of the southern border is being wantonly violated with the full complicity of the Obama Administration.

    <div class="md"><p>Itsnot racist  - the idea that poor people cannot afford an ID is ludicrous. In fact, most places offer FREE ID&#39;s if it stated that it is for voting.</p>

<p>I would assume that these people are not able to prove their identity, for a multitude of reasons, but because at least one agenda for political party;s increase in voting is to allow <em>non-ID required</em> voting. </p>

<p>Race plays on the easy deferment: &quot;What, you don&#39;t what people to vote? You must be racist&quot;</p>
