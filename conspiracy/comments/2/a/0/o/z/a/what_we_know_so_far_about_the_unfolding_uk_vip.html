       Below is what we know so far about the breaking VIP pedophile (US spelling) ring story in the UK. 
This needs to be documented and put in one place, because taken all together, it tells a compelling story. 
This is all from mainstream sources or, in some cases, a direct voice recording from the horse's mouth. 
Please feel free to help me by adding more links in the comments. I'll keep this updated and repost from time to time as the list grows.

         Jimmy Savile (now dead) is proven to be a very prolific pedophile.
Savile was knighted by the Queen, knighted by the Vatican, was a top BBC figure (a household name), spent  time with Margaret Thatcher at Chequers on several occasions (Thatcher lobbied heavily to have him knighted by the queen), was close friends with Prince Charles (was even described as his "mentor" by Princess Diana), and spent time with him alone on at least one occasion.

Also, Harman suggested that a pornographic photo or film of a child should not be considered indecent unless it could be shown that the subject had suffered, and that prosecutors would have to prove harm rather than defendants having to justify themselves.

         Retired judge, Baroness Butler-Sloss, steps down as head of major inquiry into historic sex abuse allegations less than a week after she was appointed by Theresa May, the Home Secretary. Her brother Sir Michael Havers was Attorney General during the alleged cover-up of a previous pedophile scandal

         . However, there are two more reasons why there was so much pressure for her to stand down. One is that Michael Havers was seen at a pedophile party in the '80s by a seemingly credible witness

The abuse was allegedly covered up after the investigation turned up information that linked to a pedophile ring which involved a prominent Labour MP in Tony Blair's government.

       Carole Kasir, who ran the Elm Street Guest House during the 70s and 80s, claimed to have guest logs, names, and compromising photographs of important people with children at the guest house. She killed herself in 1990, but there has been speculation that she was suicided to cover up what she knew and the evidence she had.

       Fantastic effort,OP!  I was doing some research myself today and came across the Kincora Boys Home scandal info and was happy to see it included here. I think there were other scandals during that time period as well, but would have to go dig to see if I can find the info again.

       I've been expanding on this list day by day, and will repost it at some point in the future. I have to say though, that I am now under the impression that the UK establishment is a rat's nest of pedos and there is absolutely no chance of a fair inquiry at all. Also, I've noticed that all the discussion about this seems to be framed as "historical child abuse", as though it is no longer going on. This is a dangerous and, almost certainly, erroneous assumption that will simply allow the abuse to continue.

       It is. When the elite want to bury a huge story, they will often write a small article on it and place it on page 15 of the Friday newspaper. After that, they can say "it's been reported" and then ignore any further developments citing that "it's already been covered" or "it's not interesting enough to warrant more coverage". If despite that, a critical story is still garnering coverage, they will create a crisis to distract ie mass shooting, threats of war, etc.

       Here is an example next time you try point out how the news slips things in.  Durning the underwear bomber attempt, the passengers all said an indian looking guy helped the bomber get on the flight without a passport.  Any way, the msm &amp; authoritirs denied that happened, but eventually admitted they would look into a month later.  They announced this by slipping it into the last two paragraphs of an article about female suicide bombers from Yeman.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Federal agents also tell ABCNews.com they are attempting to identify a man who passengers said helped Abdulmutallab change planes for Detroit when he landed in Amsterdam from Lagos, Nigeria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorities had initially discounted the passenger accounts, but the agents say there is a growing belief the man have played a role to make sure Abdulmutallab "did not get cold feet."

       This argument comes up a lot. However we don't mistrust the mainstream media for the truth that it does tell, but more for the truth that it chooses to tell and the truth it chooses not to tell... the mainstream media's crime is that of omission. The mainstream media follows an agenda of supporting the status quo, and what they choose to report reflects that.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, When it comes to 911, it will tell certain truths (such as the buildings fell down, that the government claim that OBL was responsible etc.) but it will not publish any of the important information on 911 that would lead people to think that 911 was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when a story first breaks, there is often a short period of time when the mainstream media will actually print the truth - before the higher-ups get a chance to crack down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pedo stuff will be brushed under the carpet at some point; but right now we are getting good info from mainstream sources.

       This is as close to the heart of the conspiracy as we can get right now (without speculation at least).
      </p>
      <p>
       Always remember - the people who make our laws, who take us to war, who are watching us and reading our emails, the people who take our money under threat of jail and spend it on secret projects... these people are pedophiles, pedophile apologists and keepers of dark secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please do whatever you can to spread this information. The wall of silence is starting to crack, and if we keep up the pressure, perhaps we can bring it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sickness needs to be rooted out. The silence has gone on for too long.

       There are numerous other high profile Brits whose names should probably be on this list. A search for the following names in conjunction with the word "paedophile" will take you to some quite disturbing places.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Lord Brittan

        Sir Cliff Richard (aka "Kitty" at Elm Street Guest House)

       <li>
        Lord McAlpine (deceased, supposedly)
       </li>

       the "what" is pretty obvious .... what about the "why"? Why would pedophilia be so rampant in that small population of people?

       I'll refer you to the link number 6, where ex-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone says that Mi5 were attempting to entrap Northern Irish politicians into blackmail by using pedophilia.

       Once someone has pictures of you doing something illegal with a child, then they can blackmail you... which makes you a very useful tool.
