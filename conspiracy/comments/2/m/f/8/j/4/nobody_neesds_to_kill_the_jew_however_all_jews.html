       I still haven't been able to prove such quotations from the Talmud and suspect they are falsified. No proof has been provided as of yet:

       I suspect you, being a redditor for 2 days, and judging by your posting history, are someone who is trying to make those of us who point out the role of Zionist Jews in the NWO look bad.

       That still is not proof, and "Brother Nathanael" is a known shill. Give me a copy of the Talmud that actually has these quotes in them and then I'll believe it. Till then, I'm leaning toward the whole thing being a psyop.

       Just Google Brother Nathanael shill or phony and also realize that Christianity is a dead end as well, since it worships Jews, and you'll find the truth about Milton Kapner, whose name is not really Nathanael.

       Meanwhile, you should be aware that "Christian zionism" is not Christianity.  Source: personal experience.  I'm an old person, raised in the church.  Though I am aware that there are some sects that support the Godless "state of Israel", I've never attended a church where I worshipped Jews.

       Christianity is Jew worship. It's a Jewish invention to convert Pagans to worship of a Judaic deity, which is obviously why Israel has so much power today. Jew worship, nothing more, nothing less.

       Same "God", just another fairytale. Yahweh is the embodiment of the Jewish people. Christians worship evil which is why so much evil has been done in their name.

       The Old Testament makes it pretty clear what kind of "god" Yahweh is - an evil, psychopathic, murderous "god" who gorges on blood.

       The New Testament makes it pretty clear what kind of "god" his "son" is - a pacifist do-nothing weenie who welcomes the apocalypse of Jewish evil with open arms.

       There are real Christians in the world (not "Christian zionists" or Westboro Baptists) who have read and studied the Bible.  It appears you've gotten your understanding of the book from the Zeitgeist movie, or something similar.  Again, no offense intended, but you probably shouldn't comment on a book you've never read.  It makes you look, well, not very smart.

       Christians do nothing about evil because they follow the apocalyptic fairy tale of Revelation and think that that's how things SHOULD go. That's why evil is allowed in this world, because Christians are just fine with it. Like the Joker said,

       You are speaking in absolutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying that all Christians are a certain way.  That's just as bad as saying all jews are a certain way, or all muslims are a certain way, or all blacks or whites or whatever.  You are making wide generalizations.  A few years from now, you'll realize how incredibly silly that is.

       The implication is that this is true for MOST Christians which it is. Humans have two legs. Right? NO, not all of them. Some have fewer, some might even have more. In fact, I have a third leg. So you see, generalizations don't mean it applies to ALL. That's just another thing the retarded educational system gets wrong.

       (Non religious) Jew conspiracy theorist here who does not want to kill anyone.

      <p>
       There are two reasons why I would like you to stop referring to the "bad Jews" as just "Jews".
      </p>
      <p>
       First, even if some Jews believe in strange religious scripture, most don't. Most Jews in America are not particularly religious. It's like saying all Muslims must be put in camps because they all want to kill us. Actually only the daesh sort do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second reason is because it turns people away from good theories unneccessarily. Jews and non Jews alike. It makes you look nutty. And to be fair it is pretty nutty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you think of a new term for the elite Jews you want to theorise about, other than "Jews".

       No.

      <p>
       The Jews are the problem beause of the belief they hold, that "Even the best of the Goyim should all be killed", each Jew must hold this belief to even be a Jew, the steadfast holding of this belief makes every Jew a psychopath.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be a true Jew, the Jew MUST believe that "Even the best of the Goyim should all be killed". This is right out of the Talmud, the main religioius book ALL Jews must follow.

       He who calls himself a Jew but DOES NOT believe that "Even the best of the Goyim should all be killed", is not actually a Jew, since holding this belief is an absolute REQUIREMENT for being a Jew, and if they don't believe it, they are not a Jew at all.

       What evidence is there that all Jews must believe everything said in the Talmud, or that all Jews do believe it?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like saying all Christians must hate and kill witches, because the Bible said you should kill witches, and all Christians must believe and o everything in the Bible.

       I say we use their own weapons against them. Activist Jews imposed affirmative action and quotas on us, and seriously injured white society by doing so. OK, fine. Let's go with that. Let's apply affirmative action to the whites trying to get into Harvard University that can't because Jews already took their slots. Lets apply affirmative action to the media, where white journalists are trying to get jobs, but can't because the media is wholly dominated by Jews. Let's apply it to the Supreme Court, and have a 2% Jew rule, so that the members of the court match the percentage of Jews in society. Let's make sure that whites get the contracts and government jobs and perks, and Jews only get 2% of them. It would work for me.
