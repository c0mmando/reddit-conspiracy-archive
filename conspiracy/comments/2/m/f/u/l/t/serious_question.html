Or even reddit as a whole. This sub has a lot of subscribers and if y&#39;all are really sharing secret truths, it would surely be more damaging to them compared to any kind of profit they could gain with keeping the site up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not aware of the subtleties and complexities of information and counter-information.  Sometimes what attracts more attention is if you actually try to shut something down.  Often, if you do nothing, a possible source of truth will simply atrophy and die on its own.</p>

<p>Other times, the best way to undermine a source of truth isn&#39;t by shutting it down (which, again, attracts a LOT more attention than it very well might be worth) but, instead, to insert many infiltrators that sully the waters and undermine the truth content of the source.  That way you don&#39;t have to worry about shutting the source down because it is now so corrupted and polluted that all the falsehoods mixed with the truths completely confuse and soil everything and only the most critical of thinkers will be able to successfully sift the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>So you see?  Even if a source IS telling the truth and DOES have its finger on the pulse of what&#39;s going on (which this sub does occasionally), you don&#39;t have to shut it down if you want to undermine it.  Again, that often creates more attention and lets the originators of the site know that they were REALLY on to something and this will then subsequently make them and others work and try all the harder to start up another even better site.  Much easier to just infiltrate the truth with shills and trolls and work toward killing the site covertly from within as opposed to shutting it down overtly from without.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I haven&#39;t been on Reddit long enough to know if this particular sub was more truthful in the beginning, but just in the time that I myself have been here, I have indeed seen an increase in shilldom and shit posts.  That&#39;s for sure.  Part of the reason for that could, of course, be because many of the things being discussed here are beginning to really resonate and be noticed by a wider &quot;non critical thinker&quot; audience and some of the shit posts are put up by honest but completely ignorant normal people.</p>

<p>Another reason, however, is because - as more of the topics discussed in this sub have become more popular and the population at large is beginning to slightly wake up to the fact that we are being heavily and covertly manipulated by a hidden elite behind the shadows - more counter measures and a <em>lot</em> of cointelpro agents are being released into the sub (<em>by</em> that very covert elite and its agents) in order to, as I said above, really muddy the waters and sink the ship of truth that occasionally sails here without calling as much attention to the fact that that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing (attention that would <em>definitely</em> be called if they were to just shut it down directly).</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you read so many of the &quot;reddit is being gamed&quot; posts - posts that come up not only in this sub by people who <em>are</em> aware of and pay attention to such things, but also by people from outside this sub who in theory have &quot;no interest whatsoever&quot; in any type of covert manipulation subject matter at all.</p>
