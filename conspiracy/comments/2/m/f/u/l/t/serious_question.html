       It's simple, if you believe you are discovering and uncovering secrets that the government want to keep on the downlow, why wouldn't they just remove this subreddit? Or even reddit as a whole. This sub has a lot of subscribers and if y'all are really sharing secret truths, it would surely be more damaging to them compared to any kind of profit they could gain with keeping the site up.

       You're not aware of the subtleties and complexities of information and counter-information.  Sometimes what attracts more attention is if you actually try to shut something down.  Often, if you do nothing, a possible source of truth will simply atrophy and die on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times, the best way to undermine a source of truth isn't by shutting it down (which, again, attracts a LOT more attention than it very well might be worth) but, instead, to insert many infiltrators that sully the waters and undermine the truth content of the source.  That way you don't have to worry about shutting the source down because it is now so corrupted and polluted that all the falsehoods mixed with the truths completely confuse and soil everything and only the most critical of thinkers will be able to successfully sift the wheat from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see?  Even if a source IS telling the truth and DOES have its finger on the pulse of what's going on (which this sub does occasionally), you don't have to shut it down if you want to undermine it.  Again, that often creates more attention and lets the originators of the site know that they were REALLY on to something and this will then subsequently make them and others work and try all the harder to start up another even better site.  Much easier to just infiltrate the truth with shills and trolls and work toward killing the site covertly from within as opposed to shutting it down overtly from without.

       Well, I haven't been on Reddit long enough to know if this particular sub was more truthful in the beginning, but just in the time that I myself have been here, I have indeed seen an increase in shilldom and shit posts.  That's for sure.  Part of the reason for that could, of course, be because many of the things being discussed here are beginning to really resonate and be noticed by a wider "non critical thinker" audience and some of the shit posts are put up by honest but completely ignorant normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason, however, is because - as more of the topics discussed in this sub have become more popular and the population at large is beginning to slightly wake up to the fact that we are being heavily and covertly manipulated by a hidden elite behind the shadows - more counter measures and a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of cointelpro agents are being released into the sub (
       <em>
        by
       </em>
       that very covert elite and its agents) in order to, as I said above, really muddy the waters and sink the ship of truth that occasionally sails here without calling as much attention to the fact that that's what they're doing (attention that would
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       be called if they were to just shut it down directly).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you read so many of the "reddit is being gamed" posts - posts that come up not only in this sub by people who
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       aware of and pay attention to such things, but also by people from outside this sub who in theory have "no interest whatsoever" in any type of covert manipulation subject matter at all.

       I've come across various individuals that are anywhere from likely liars to absolutely BLATANT shills.  However, I almost never really pay all that much attention to usernames.  Hell, only right now this very moment did I notice that your own username was fucking
       <em>
        cringecock
       </em>
       (lol WTF?).  Pretty funny, but I'll probably forget about it by tomorrow - heck, by later tonight, likely - and if someone were to ask me what your username was, I might likely go "What?  Hell I don't remember."

       Internet (or more precisely packet commutation technology) is the unique technical solution to a mandatory requirement in their plan: to know what everyone thinks and does at all time in real time. It's hard to tell to what extent they anticipated their loss of control over information, but it doesn't really matter since the requirement is mandatory and the solution unique, they have to stick to it, so they will poor as much printed money as required to scare people into not using the internet's full palette of benefits.

       If the conspiracy subreddit was deleted, people would ask why. Why would the government delete the conspiracy subreddit? Maybe because its trying to cover up what the subreddit is revealing. Also, if they just allow it to run, people will think, well obviously its not true because if it was they would stop you posting it.

       Also I agree with what pupupow says.

       Yeah people would ask questions. But I'd assume only conspiracy theorists would ask?

       I love this subreddit, but I hate the name.  "Conspiracy theorist" is generally used to describe someone who is delusional.  I wonder if by doing most of our discussion here we are self-marginalizing.

       If people took things seriously they'd do something about the problems of the world. This sub help to wake people up to the lies all around us. Its not about sharing secret truths, its about uncovering the coverups and secret powers of the world.
