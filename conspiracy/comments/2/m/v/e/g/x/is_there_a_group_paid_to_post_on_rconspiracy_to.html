    <div class="md"><p>Here is the OP text since a mod deleted it all:</p>

<p>After careful consideration after judging the comments and actions of certain users, I would like to bring this topic forward to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community for discussion. </p>

<p>The long and the short of it is this: It seems there are people who post daily on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> that apparently belong to an organization that is designed to promote corporate interests, US government interests, and/or Israeli government interests. They may be JIDF, they may be US gov&#39;t contractors, they may be private sector contractors, or they could be something else. We can&#39;t know for certain because they&#39;re not exactly going to tell us or admit to it.</p>

<p>However, many of us do know something fishy is going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made a list of people that I think belong to this group. They may be related to the user <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">/u/BipolarBear0</a>. If you haven&#39;t heard of this, it is a very well-known username that has ties to Israeli government and to reddit censorship. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/28/why_reddit_moderators_are_censoring_glenn_greenwalds_latest_bombshell_partner/">Here is a news article about how this username blocked the visibility of a Snowden story from reddit, for instance.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve ranked them by approximately how sure I am that they belong to this group, based on their behavior.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the working list:</p>

<hr/>

<p>----- local <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> opinion-swaying group</p>

<p>u/fritzly </p>

<p>u/eberkneezer (will pretend to agree with you, pretty smart)</p>

<p>u/UncleSamuel (always harassing people, pretty dumb, always signs his posts)</p>

<p>u/cojoco (moderator of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and 200 other subreddits)</p>

<p>u/eightNote (moderates 120+ subreddits)</p>

<p>u/Meepster23 </p>

<p>u/ky1e  </p>

<p>u/Batty-Koda</p>

<p>u/emr1028 </p>

<p>u/NWOwon  </p>

<p>u/KingContext</p>

<p>u/TheRedditPope</p>

<p>u/pupupow</p>

<p>---- suspected:</p>

<p>u/shakypears</p>

<p>u/KrustyKritters</p>

<p>u/75000_Tokkul (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2me3xy/umagnora_here_with_a_48_hour_update_after_i_was/cm3dy3e">because of this ridiculously clumsy exchange of words</a>)</p>

<p>u/TwoInPinkOneInStink</p>

<p>u/CallingOutYourBS</p>

<hr/>

<p>You&#39;ll notice many of these people moderate over 100 subreddits. And many of those are dedicated to either corporate interests, censorship subreddits, subreddits that make fun of censorship subreddits (yes, they mod both sometimes, which is an obvious conflict of interest) and some of them even mod <a href="/r/bipolarbear0">/r/bipolarbear0</a> and the sarcastic subreddit <a href="/r/BlameBipolarBear0">/r/BlameBipolarBear0</a>. </p>

<p>Here is documentation of my past problems with these people, just look at the comments and the way they reacted to being called out: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/">Link</a></p>

<p>More documentation: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2mdn49/umagnora_here_with_a_48_hour_update_after_i_was/">Link</a></p>

<p>Some specific posts of people who also see the problem and are getting tired of it: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2m7ju8/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/cm1xau4">Post 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/cm1fr5s">Post 2</a></p>

<p>The users I have listed are obviously not a complete list. It only applies to subreddits like <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, <a href="/r/RedditCensorship">/r/RedditCensorship</a>, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and of course their corresponding trolling subreddits <a href="/r/Oppression">/r/Oppression</a>, <a href="/r/Conspiritard">/r/Conspiritard</a>, <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> and so on. (all of which are, of course, moderated by people on the list)</p>

<p>Outside of these subreddits, there are other groups of people who serve the same purpose. For instance I haven&#39;t even mentioned u/davidreiss666 (who moderates over 100 of the most common subreddits) and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many groups like that. Many different umbrellas across the different subreddits. </p>

<p>How do you spot a person like this? <strong>Here&#39;s the things that give them away:</strong></p>

<p>*They moderate a large numbers of subreddits (dozens to hundreds)</p>

<p>*Their bias is always the same about certain subjects (Israel = Good, US = Good, Corporations = Good, Reddit Censorship = Doesn&#39;t Exist)</p>

<p>*They love quoting reddit and subreddit rules, because it gives them power</p>

<p>*They back each other up almost always, both with votes and with their comments. They talk like they&#39;re buddies because it helps fill the comment thread with content that is on the same side as their bias, which changes the tone of the thread as a whole, which is their overall goal.</p>

<p>*They&#39;re almost always sarcastically making fun of anyone who tries to make a serious point they don&#39;t like. They&#39;re negative and sarcastic and condescending. It makes it hard to know if they&#39;re being serious or not sometimes, which muddies the waters of discussion on serious topics. They may appear to take your side on an issue, but then blow it way out of proportion to make both of you look foolish, which serves their purpose.</p>

<p>*They comment every single day on the same subreddits.</p>

<p>That describes their actions, but what about their words? </p>

<p><strong>Some of the topics they do not like talked about:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>That reddit might have censorship problems (They say &quot;that&#39;s just impossible, what are you, some kind of conspiracy nut? Or a troll who love to stir shit up for no reason? Stop being so paranoid&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>That there are people on reddit who are paid to change what content appears to visitors  (They reply &quot;No one gets paid to reddit, that&#39;s just retarded. If people got paid, why aren&#39;t I being paid? Where do I sign up? hyuck hyuck hyuck&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>That JIDF exists and is a real thing (I&#39;ve seen them say &quot;I bet OP belongs to JIDF. Actually we&#39;re all JIDF shills. Every single person on here is a JIDF shill. Dumbass.&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>That Israel probably shouldn&#39;t be killing Palestinians by the thousands. (&quot;Do you not want to allow Israelis to defend themselves? Why do you hate Israel? Is Israel just supposed to sit there and get hit by rockets? You&#39;re an evil person for even thinking that.&quot;)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear they don&#39;t want these things discussed because they generally have a strong relationship to them. Why else would they care so much? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than those 4, but those are the ones that I have personally experienced them freaking out about. </p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to learn more and explore, look at their user accounts and how many subreddits they moderate, and the names of those subreddits. Look at their recent post history. Look at where they post, and what they post about. That will tell you all you need to know.  </p>

<p>This is all very relevant, especially considering the recent news of 
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2mk4nv/the_admins_has_stepped_in_to_remove_the_top_mod/">Admins overpowering mods to control content</a> and the CEO resigning. </p>

<p>We all saw how the up/downvote counters that were there for 7 years were removed one day a few months ago.</p>

<p>We all saw how <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> went from awesome to shit in the span of a month.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all seen how much worse reddit as a whole has gotten over the last 2 years, but especially the last 3 to 6 months. It&#39;s no longer a viable source for news, except for certain subreddits. But even those are being slowly ruined.</p>

<p>Now the CEO of reddit has left to be replaced by a new one. Just a month ago when I asked if the gov&#39;t had any hand in removing the up/down vote counters <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tt9vPBt.png">the CEO sent me this message (the 3rd message, from yishan)</a></p>

<p>So the only logical conclusion in the face of all this evidence is that reddit is becoming more and more mainstream, which means that the content is more and more tightly controlled by the people running it, aka more corporatized. Digg had this same problem, which is why everyone left it. It&#39;s not a surprising or unexpected development. It&#39;s simply more profitable to let corporations and governmental agencies pay you to promote some things and censor other things. Reddit has always had problems with profitability, so it&#39;s no surprise they would go the same way as digg. They&#39;re bullies for profit and what&#39;s extra sad is some of them probably do it for free. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s the evidence. Look at their comments, look at those threads I posted, and draw your own conclusions. After all I&#39;ve seen, I think it&#39;s pretty clear what is going on. If you think I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;d be interested to hear your reasoning that explains their behavior. If you think I got certain details wrong, please correct me. I&#39;d like to know the complete picture, I&#39;m sure we all would. If you think I&#39;m right, then speak up and say so so that community knows to avoid these people and not listen to what they say. With the new CEO (who is known to work with censors) this may be our last real chance to speak up about this stuff on reddit. So let&#39;s talk, like a community should! Let&#39;s hear your take on all this, or if you&#39;ve had any experiences with these guys that give evidence one way or the other. </p>

<p>I would like to re-state that I am just asking questions and I&#39;m not saying, by any means, that these people are guaranteed 100% definitely paid posters. I just find their behavior to be leading me to certain conclusions and I want to see if the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community at large agrees with my hypothesis.</p>

This is presumably why your list was removed by the mods (in violation of rule 10). I suggest you tread carefully, because it is statistically very unlikely that all those you have accused are shills, and you are therefore straying into banning territory.</p>

<p>From my own perspective, there is only really one serious problem-child amongst those you have named in your list, and he is here proving your point on this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres the thing, I think...</p>

<p>People like to think of reddit as separate from the MSM.  Like its some alternative haven for free speech and shit...and maybe it was 7 years ago.</p>

<p>But nowadays?  Reddit reaches a <em>huge</em>, worldwide audience, many of them completely unreachable through traditional means (the typical &#39;MSM&#39;).  The reason you see a few extremely powerful users (and their equally powerful alts - lets be realistic here) is because reddit <strong>is</strong> the MSM and is controlled in the same way.  A few talking heads get to decide what the discussion is, and then the plebs are allowed to debate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any conspiracy beyond the ownership of this site by MSM interests, and the strategies they use to manipulate opinion.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you though that there are people paid to manipulate opinion on reddit and that there are things we&#39;re not allowed to talk about.  </p>

<p>They are always negative, they never have anything constructive or positive to say and they do this day in and day out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to claim they are being paid but it&#39;s obvious that they have a deep interest in seeing the stories on here be debunked. It doesn&#39;t matter how tame they are either, if it&#39;s posted here it&#39;s wrong and they&#39;re going to tell us.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can respect this opinion, I held it for quite a while. The thing that finally pushed me over the edge and made me think they&#39;re paid is the sheer amount of time they spend dedicated to doing this. They keep at it for months and years. I think a normal person would get bored of being negative about everything and move on to something else, but they persist. So what motivates them? Do they really just enjoy fucking with people <em>that much</em>?  Seems possible.</p>

<p>However, would they hold to their biases so consistently, and so consistently across the whole group of them as well, if their main goal was to fuck with people? Probably not. So they seem paid because of how coordinated as a group they are about their opinions, as well as because of how much time they put in to it. Again, I could be wrong, but that&#39;s how it looks from where I&#39;m sitting. Do you think that&#39;s reasonable? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s reasonable for sure. I also think there are a lot of people out there who latch onto a community or idea and get obsessed with it. conspiratard is a great example of this.

From what I&#39;ve seen they&#39;re usually pretty young and the type that appears to latch onto any community that will accept them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I removed the post for violating rule 10.</p>

<p>I looked into the context pretty deep before I removed the post, most of the users you&#39;ve listed are already banned from conspiracy for exactly the type of stuff you&#39;ve described.  A few of them I consider valuable  members here and its unfortunate they might receive some heavy flak from this post.</p>

<p>On the subject of manipulation of the discussion, wasn&#39;t your previous account shadow banned for vote manipulation?  I found some screen shots you took yourself that weighed in on the admins choice to ban your accounts, while investigating the context of this post and the claims you&#39;ve made here.</p>

I don&#39;t wish to give anyone flak who doesn&#39;t deserve it, but unfortunately I don&#39;t know everything about everyone so I need guidance on some of the people, which is a big part of why I made the original post. If you feel I got some of the names seriously wrong, you can tell me here or PM me and I&#39;d be interested to hear and learn and correct the incorrect information. If you don&#39;t wish to disclose them, I&#39;m fine with that too. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really just like guidance so we can discuss this openly as a community without things getting deleted. I think this is an important topic that deserves a front-page discussion. </p>

<p>I did get caught for vote manipulation, but that is no longer taking place. I learned my lesson after all my accounts got banned. I don&#39;t want that to happen ever again.</p>

<p>I never said what I did was okay, to be clear. I&#39;m not justifying it in any way. I vote manipulated and I got caught and my accounts got shadowbanned and I&#39;m sorry and I deserved it. Anyone who vote brigades should have the same thing happen to them. I&#39;ll never do it again.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let that be the reason this community can&#39;t openly discuss censorship, please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, clearly there&#39;s a double standard goign on in this sub.  Someone defends Israel they&#39;re automatically a JIDF shill, someone defends the Hamas and there are no baseless accusations flying about.  Stop being ignorant and open your eyes to the bias</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I wouldn&#39;t call JIDF shilling accusations baseless, Israel does indeed PAY people to push a pro-Israel pro-Zionist anti-truth stance. I don&#39;t think Palestinians pay anyone to defend them, they&#39;re too busy fighting for their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know how true that is.  It could be true. And if it were true, I doubt they&#39;d be perusing this conspiracy sub considering this is like the hearth of neo-nazis and anti-Israelites lol, basically it&#39;s already a lost cause.    And Hamas whole campaign is based off propaganda and inciting the public, they use human shields and place weaponry near highly populated ares to get Israel to kill a few so they can have a higher death count and receive more sympathy from everyone all the while demonizing Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignorant to the bias? Trying to say the world is bias against Israel is like saying that the rich kid with the BMW m3 in high school is being excluded from social groups for being to poor. There is no bias only outrage over Israeli crimes against humanity.</p>
