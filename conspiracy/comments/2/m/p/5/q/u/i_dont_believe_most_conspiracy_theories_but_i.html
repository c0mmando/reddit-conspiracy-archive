I want to have a rational discussion about why your conspiracy hypothesis (I only like to use theory in the scientific sense). I will not tell you outright that you are wrong.       </p>

<p>That being said I am going to attempt to use a mix of anecdotal and factual evidence to show why I do not believe these things and maybe why it may seem irrational that someone else would. I know most of these hypothesis include that we have had information hidden from us or that the public information has been altered to show that the hypothesis is false.        </p>

<p>So tell me what you think happened on 9/11, how F is bad for you and is in toothpaste and our water, how X event never happened or that Y was covered up by the government etc. I will not disrespect you or your ideas simply attempt to show my point of view on the topic and what has led me to believe this.       </p>

<p>One thing I won&#39;t deal with is saying &quot;You cannot prove it is not this way&quot;. Fantastic or meaningfully different claims have the burden of proof. I&#39;ll site Russel&#39;s Teapot argument, You cannot disprove that a teapot is currently orbiting between Jupiter and Mars in such a way that we can never see it. We can very easily assume this to be false because it goes against everything we know to be true about orbital mechanics, gravity and human progress.</p>

<p>You should start by giving any theory a legitimate chance and not deciding about it based on what you think the theory is. For example I don&#39;t know of anyone who says flouride in toothpaste is bad for you.</p>

<p>You might be able to find someone saying it, but every theory I&#39;ve read about fluoride says that topical application is fine, it&#39;s the ingestion that is not necessary.</p>

<p>Also, I think you&#39;ll find, if you give them a chance, that most conspiracy theorists who are not mentally ill will actually not &#39;believe&#39; things in the sense of the word you&#39;re trying to use. Most people think the truth lies somewhere in a grey area between the official story and the &quot;tin pot&quot; theory.</p>

<p>The Fluoride in water was simply listing off the common things I knew were conspiracies.       </p>

<p>I did not intend to imply that all conspiracy theorists are crazy. I am simply after a conversation with people that I don&#39;t frequently meet in real life. I love a good debate with people who&#39;ll not take offense and will accept the prospect of losing just as I intend to if someone here can show me compelling evidence. I completely believe that the world is full of grey truths and see the value in having conspiracies.</p>

<p>No worries, I didn&#39;t mean to imply you did. </p>

<p>You did use fluoride as an example but I think it&#39;s a good illustration of how disinformation colours people&#39;s opinions of many of the theories out there. Whether you believe in conspiracies or not one thing that is a legitimate, long time tactic used by governments is to put out disinformation to make it hard for anyone to follow any sort of trail. It also serves the purpose of making people who look into these things automatically labeled.</p>

<p>UFO research is a great example of this. UFOs are a real phenomenon, there are sightings of things we can&#39;t explain and they happen often enough that the government has officially looked into them more than once. Look up guys like Jacques Vallee who are legitimate scientists doing real work on this phenomenon. But go outside and ask the average person what a UFOlogist does and they&#39;ll probably laugh.</p>

<p>The sheer number of disinformation campaigns and hoaxes surrounding the subject has completely ruined it. So judging any theory by the surface-level explanation is setting yourself up for failure.</p>

<p>Something I&#39;ve learned in my time is that no matter how wacky a conspiracy theory sounds if you take the time to look into it and really take an objective look at the data you&#39;ll usually find two things. There&#39;s usually a grain of truth in every theory but usually the actual issue something a lot more mundane and all of the nutty stuff people associate with tin-foil is usually not being pushed by the serious, credible researchers. </p>

<p>I agree, but fluoride does seem to help teeth when used topically such as in toothpaste, and as long as you don&#39;t swallow it the dose you&#39;d get from brushing with it is tiny.</p>

<p>If we didn&#39;t have it in our water it would not be an issue at all that it was in the toothpaste.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree to this slightly - I would argue that the Official Version™ of some events are fantastic and I doubt some specific things. Would you be willing to meet half way and attempt to prove what <em>I deem is fantastic</em>, as long as I do the same? Seems fair to me. Reply to begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can meet you halfway, it is so often hard to identify what is fantastic when the truth of statements is in question. For example you&#39;ll probably never get me to admit it could be possible that after going 25 miles deep there is nothing but open air but I might admit that 20 miles down could be pockets of habitable space which could harbor multi-cellular life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe a large airplane hit it, I was watching the News for a solid hour or two when it happened, before my mom came to get me. I was in second grade and I remember watching the second plane hit WTC. I don&#39;t distinctly remember seeing footage live of the plane hitting the Pentagon but I believe I saw it, give me a few minutes see if I can find a link.      </p>

<p>edit: Alright so apparently there isn&#39;t any good footage but I did find this. by googling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVDdjLQkUV8">9/11 pentagon footage</a> footage[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVDdjLQkUV8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVDdjLQkUV8</a>]. I think we can explain the lack of a plane in the video image at the exhibit booth by analyzing speed across the field of view. because I will admit that still is less than convincing especially since the animation could be leading.      </p>

<p>Most cameras that I&#39;ve heard of work in 24 FPS and use motion blur to make up for the fact that our eyes work at around 30 FPS (anecdotal fact that I&#39;ve heard parroted alot on video game threads about performance) I can make little to no accurate guess as to the distance that the plane would have traveled so I will make guesses as to it&#39;s speed. at 24 fps we have obviously 1/24th of a second per frame for travel, these planes have a max cruising speed of about 800-900 Kph according to the Boeing site. 900 kph is 820 feet per second so in one frame of a 24 fps camera the plane could travel 34 feet. which would not be far enough to explain why it disappears. so let&#39;s go find what a security camera usually runs at because looking back that was no where near smooth.         </p>

<p>And of course everything I looked at varied from 30 fps to 5 frames per minute. I looked back at the footage used in the video and gave it a very conservative guess of 5 frames per second. My actual guess is that it is about 2 or 3 frames per second. At 5 fps the plane could have traveled at cruising speed (which is most likely exceeded in a descent meant to destroy part of a building) a distance of 164 feet which sounds like a decent ball park for the distance between where the video puts the plane and where it would be in the next frame.         </p>

<p>In conclusion I still think a plane hit the pentagon but not that I had seen a video of the incident because in my head the craft was traveling about 30 degrees from horizontal where here it was barely moving down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to be an Economics major so this one is especially interesting. Banks do set the rates for mortgages, loans and other things but these rates are very much determined by systems of equations. Equations which I am only just scratching the surface of in Intro to Macroeconomics. These equations however are based on assumptions and predictions which take qualified individuals to make. Despite being made by different people however the variables remain the same and even more so the predictions are usually pretty similar usually. these equations are usually solved for the most profit in a sustainable market. This would explain why a lot of banks have similar movement in their interest rates on loans.       </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit there could be some collaboration between the firms whether it be intentional or tacit is up for debate. It is in each Banks interest however to try and be more accurate as to the optimum interest rates than their competitors so as to maximize profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the official story this one is hard to come up with evidence to prove that there was not government involvement. However I can try to explain why I don&#39;t think that anything was planted before hand. I saw live on CNN the second plane impact the tower and I have seen videos of both impacts. All of the explosion appears to travel in the general direction of the planes travel at time of impact.      </p>

<p>That being said I can understand how people could see more in it. I don&#39;t personally understand much about aviation fuel and how it burns but I do know that it burns hot enough to at least soften steel and iron (on mobile but will grab numbers soon). If I had the time or money I could perform a test showing this but in this case I&#39;ll trust Wikipedia and my basic knowledge of chemistry.        </p>

<p>There certainly may have been something to gain for the government by inciting this war. This is the really difficult part because neither of us can definitely say the other is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to have an idea about who was involved to know that the official report is wrong. First and foremost, a fire with any amount of aviation fuel you could throw at it will not melt steel I-beams, let alone collapse an entire building at free fall speed. Let&#39;s ignore this for the moment.</p>

<p>The most glaringly obvious issue in the entire thing is the fact that <strong>three</strong> of the buildings collapsed straight down at nearly free fall speed. This is literally impossible. The rest of it pretty much falls out of this one, basic, undeniable fact of the matter. There are only two options: Demolition or divine intervention.</p>

<p>Edit: I take that back. There is only one option here, and that&#39;s demolition. Whether or not it was divinely inspired doesn&#39;t change how it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a pretty unique collapse I will admit that, Let&#39;s assume for a moment that aviation fuel can cause the beams to at the very least weaken. Steel becomes weaker on a molecular level at 702 degrees Celsius and Aviation fuel burns at 900+ degrees C. Assuming that to be enough to cause the support beams to we can play with the scenario and basically remove the beams from one floor for a thought experiment.        </p>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine a 200 foot by 200 foot skyscraper with 100 floors. It has 9 support beams on each floor arrayed in a square of 75 by 75 feet. This is by no means a model of the WTC but is an approximation that simplifies it so we can imagine it. Now we are going to simultaneously remove all 9 support beams from the building on the 80th floor as they are compromised and can no longer support the 19 floors above. What would happen if the support beams were indestructible?          </p>

<p>The 19 floors would fall onto the 79th floor and stop, they may shift a couple inches to a foot but anything beyond that would require intense forces to shift 19 floors of concrete and steel. Now let&#39;s ball park it and say each floor weighs 5 tons and is 10 feet tall. acceleration due to gravity is about 22 feet per second so according to the equation V<sup>2</sup> = V0<sup>2+2ad</sup> the final velocity of the 19 floors falling one floor down would be sqrt(2<em>22</em>10) which is almost 21 feet per second. this is about 15 miles per hour. I couldn&#39;t tell you the compression strength of steel but I think 95 tons of material moving at 15 mph could for sure sheer it and cause the material to fail. If we agree that this is possible then the domino effect observed in the falling of the tower is entirely conceivable because even if each floor manages to stop 90% of the energy from the first floor that is proportionally less energy for each collapsing floor eventually leading to near free fall speeds of collapse.</p>

<p>As for the beams I should think that compression failure would not lead to the beams just losing grip on the structure but rather the pressure crunching and tearing the beams apart much as we saw in the rubble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are two moments regarding 9/11 that are unforgettable.  </p>

<p>1.)  9/11/01
2.) The day you watch, listen and think about the building 7 video(s). </p>

<p>Thanks for reminding me of #2.  I remember that day and how it was a real wake up call to imagine #1 in a different light.  Then, Imagining #1 in a different light allowed me to imagine some of the other outrageous theories I had skoffed at for years. </p>

<p>Today, I have no fucking clue what is true, lies, conspiracy theory or actual conspiracy policy by the leaders of corporations, states, and nations.  I know that history demonstrates many empires that overgrow and do bullshit to keep power.  I kind of feel like that is true these days.  What the bullshit is and who is behind it is kind of just nonsense to figure it all out. I believe that almost everything is bullshit and propped up by cognitive dissonance.  Almost no one is telling the truth. Most because the wells of knowledge are poisoned and unquestioned, others maybe devious or nefarious. The people who tell the truth typically find little support until its usually too late for them, they are swiftly tossed in to the bureaucratic machine whose gears grind truth and lives into exile. </p>

<p>My, or your ability to asses the truth and allow others to asses the truth is a great lesson of being tolerant and open minded. So, research everything that interests you.  Determine your own damn truth.  At the end of the day, no one knows any other truth than their own perspective on the collective experience we call reality.  </p>

<p>While some agree on the reality, (science), many of those have been wrong, are currently wrong and will continue to be wrong. Remember  Galileo? (Did you know that Galileo was Unexcomminicated in 1965?, hundreds of years for the official line to budge).  The 1500 CE citizens who screamed heretic at any non-conformist thought are under the same spell of cognitive dissonance that pervades people who use conspiracy theorist as a way to call someone wrong today.  The ones who wait for the official story line for truth are going to be the last to know the truth. </p>

<p>Look at the way tower 7 falls and tell me thats not a controlled demolition. How did the fire jumo to that building and take it down in sections left to right?</p>

<p>I am not willing to say that definitively the us goverment did 9 11. I am a skeptic conspiracy theorist. I have seen nothing to prove that. However, everything thay ive seen points to the story being a little bigger then a few planes crashing into buildings, buildings designed to remain standing if such a thing or bad fire happened.

    <div class="md"><p>The official fairy tale says the buildings collapsed under their own weight at damn near free-fall acceleration after the planes weakened a handful of floors.  This is a blatant violation of Newton&#39;s first and third laws, and anyone who seriously believes it needs to retake high school physics.</p>

<p>The first law can be summarized as &quot;conservation of momentum&quot;.  Let&#39;s assume for simplicity&#39;s sake that the tower floors all had equal mass (in reality, there were 3 groups of floors, with the most massive group being at the bottom built to support more weight, making the the official narrative an even more blatant violation of basic physics)   Lets say the collapse starts 33 floors beneath the top of a tower.   When the instant those 33 floors hit a 34th floor below them, the 34th floor starts with 0 momentum, and the other floors must transfer ~3% (1/33) of their momentum to it to fall together.  When a 35th floor is added to the collapse, the same thing happens again - only slightly smaller percentage momentum transfer.   Even after another 15 floors, the falling floors would still lose 2% of their speed with each floor added.    So already anything close to free fall is literally impossible, *unless the interior and lower floors were actually collapsed first, as in a controlled demolition.     This is even with an assumption that the building was a house of cards with absolutely zero resistance to lower floors breaking and falling, and absolutely none of the momentum transferred into the earth to slow it down.  It&#39;s also ignoring any air resistance.  I remember in one of the AE911 videos they calculated the fall should have taken an absolute minimum of over 35 seconds.   Instead we see one tower collapse in 9-10 sec and the other collapse in 10-11 sec.</p>

<p>The third law is that for every force there is an equal and opposite force.   If the upper floors were to hit the lower floors hard enough to crumble them, the upper floors would get crumbled themselves just as quickly.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact that commercial airliners aren&#39;t capable of the maneuvers performed on 9/11.   And the fact that it still isn&#39;t possible to make a cell phone call from a flight at the claimed altitudes and/or speeds today, and was even more far fetched in 2001.    You could easily go on for hundreds if not thousands of pages for all the holes in the official fairy tale.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Do you believe in Santa Claus?   Because the physics behind the official narrative are about as sound as those of Santa making it down the chimney of every good child in a single night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a major cognitive fallacy that self-avowed &quot;conspiracy deniers&quot; such as yourself seem to suffer from, and that is that a conspiracy only exists when it has been acknowledged by officialdom. </p>

<p>This essentially means that no conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; can ever be true, because once the government admits it&#39;s true, it is instantly scrubbed from the list of theories and moved to &quot;historical fact&quot;.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to scoff, but there are many examples of this. Today, we all accept without question that tobacco is noxious to human health, but throughout most of the twentieth century, governments and the tobacco industry flatly denied this, and used tame scientists and the media to back their position. Would you have been one those countless millions who blindly believed the &quot;official&quot; position that tobacco was not harmful? I am afraid you probably would have been.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another &quot;conspiracy denial&quot; that you are probably not aware of. In the late 19th century, a huge wave of immigration from Italy and Sicily brought with it a new crime phenomenon to cities like Chicago and New York that we now call the Mafia. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia</a></p>

<p>The Mafia reached their heyday during prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s, and whilst the violence was visible to all, the US government and the FBI refused to acknowledge they were a sophisticated organised crime network. J. Edgar Hoover personally didn&#39;t fully acknowledge the existence of the Mafia until 1957, after the notorious Apalachin Mob meeting! </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apalachin_Meeting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apalachin_Meeting</a></p>

<p>The Mafia families operated for decades in plain sight with officials denying their very existence. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Stubbornly waiting for official confirmation of something that is staring you in the face is not a virtue. If you are as intelligent as you presume yourself to be, you may learn something from being here, but only if you are also capable of being open-minded.</p>

To TPTB, it was the perfect situation to eliminate doubt in the media from the average person&#39;s mind and invoke fear of assault weapons and the mentally unstable. I will post more links later but each of the points listed are easily searchable. I suggest the <a href="http://youtu.be/m1yfJDCMU64">Smallstorm</a> and <a href="http://www.sandyhookjustice.com/about-us.html">Halbig</a> analyses of SH if you want to see compilations of observations. I used abbreviations because shills will immediately bury any post about SH (a strange phenomenon on Reddit.) </p>

<p>So tell me what you think happened on 9/11,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saudi Arabia was running a terrorist network within the US. They were known and being tracked in an operation called Able Danger. The Able Danger program was cancelled in Jan 2001 without explanation. 8 months later, 911 happened and the Saudi network was allowed to exit the US on special flights when even Congressmen were grounded.</p>

<p>There are 28 pages of censored evidence that prove this. 3 of the Congressmen on the 911 Commission report quit when it was not allowed to go in the report cites below:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we&#39;re talking chem trails right? This would be so very hard to disprove or even she&#39;d doubt on. I have flown several times in my life and while I don&#39;t get to see much as a passenger on my own flight I have watched many a plane be fueled up, loaded and take off. The only thing you see go on the plane is people, luggage and fuel. So unless the fuel line serves a double purpose and fills two tanks I don&#39;t see this being likely. Forgive me if I&#39;m way off I am on mobile for the moment. </p>
