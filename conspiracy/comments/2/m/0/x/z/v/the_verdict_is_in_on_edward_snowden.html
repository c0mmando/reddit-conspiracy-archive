       First there was this interview with

        Brian Williams
       </a>

       Then there was this cover exclusive with

        Wired Magazine
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is a major motion picture biopic by none other than renowned propagandist
       <a href="http://rt.com/usa/204539-gordon-levitt-snowden-confirmed/">
        Oliver Stone.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The jig is up. Real whistle-blowers don't get exclusive interviews and movies written about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get thrown into a hole never to be seen or heard from again, while their public image is slandered to paint as a mentally unstable, gender confused narcissists.

       Fuck this shit !!
      </p>
      <p>
       Without Snowden all our talk about mass surveillance, internet shills, massive disinformation campaigns, would all still fall on deaf ears. Because of Snowden the fucking conspiracy community has been vindicated, naysayers forced to shut up, and finally attention has been garnered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage Snowden's leaks caused to American reputation (private and public) surmounts to billions of dollars, much more than an elaborate "limited hangout" would've justified. It gave fuel to anti-American rhetorics of Putin, Xi Jinping, Rousseff, completely undermining Obama's foreign policy campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limited Hangout ?! Unless Putin, the Xi Jinping and Obama are all in on it, then maybe you guys are right. Otherwise this theory doesn't hold up. And if
       <em>
        they are
       </em>
       all together than maybe you guys should stop concentrating on Snowden and find who is behind this massive shadow government.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the time being, it is more probable that OP is actually an undercover NSA agent to disseminate disinformation, because this is what Snowden's leaks leads us to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, have you fucking forgot about WTIC-12 ?? How America, UK, EU, Google all
       <em>
        saved
       </em>
       our internet liberties and freedoms from the jaws of the UN, China and Russia !! And 6 months after the collapse of the negotiations, Snowden suddenly appeared  completely justifying the latter's intentions ??
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden is no hero, but for the time being he is the best we got !!
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: OP you are wrong, Snowden is not the "only whistleblower to get interviewed" or even movie !! Serpico Ellsberg, Wigan, recently Deep Throat and the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI (COINTELPRO) all came out.

       Although I don't necessarily subscribe to it, the theory is that the U.S. wanted it's citizens to know about the NSA survalince in order to scare and control the populace. They charged Snowden with "leaking" the info and then pretended to be mad about it.

        Although we’ll never know his true intentions, it is highly probable that these leaks were allowed on-purpose so the U.S. government could indirectly reveal to the world the full extent of the NSA’s capabilities.  This possibility is worth considering since a press conference announcing these activities would not be a workable course of action.  With dissent on the rise and independent voices in the alternative media doing severe damage to the credibility of the U.S. government, these leaks may have been sanctioned as a way to discourage free speech and growing dissent against American imperialism.

       The best argument I have seen for him being "limited hangout" is that 'if he has the keys to the kingdom, the public then are told no need to look further, this is all there is to see'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I dont find this argument all that compelling, maybe that is how some peoples psychologies work but not most, I think a lot of people would become more curious about "well, if THIS is true, what OTHER 'crazy conspiracy theories' are true as well??"
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he is (spook), but my feelings err towards him not being although I'm open to anything as the games spooks play are always so multidimensional it can be really hard to suss out exactly wtf they are even trying to accomplish. I've recently been looking into their involvement in the psychedelic movement, Tim Leary, Gordon Wasson, Aldous Huxley etc., and I realized I really don't understand what the agenda is at all.

       These are all good points. I would add this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we (the public) have been privy to from Snowden's NSA cache has come to us through a gatekeeper called Glenn Greenwald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden apparently gave him everything he had, and Greenwald has only seen fit to release 3-5% of that information. It is Greenwald's behaviour and motivations that we should really be questioning - is he a US government intelligence agent, or has he been threatened or "compromised" to stop him from releasing this information?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my perspective, we don't actually know enough about Snowden's NSA information to determine if he is a limited hangout - maybe the best stuff has been deliberately held back by Greenwald?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I have said before, it is no accident that Greenwald's media site is called "The Intercept" because that is precisely what Glenn is, an interceptor - he has stopped Snowden's information from reaching a wider audience.

       Yes this is another point entirely. And actually Snowden gave access to Pointras, Greenwald, and a few other news agencies. Greenwald of course is working out of self-interest in this "slow drip" tactic, as he wants to remain in public spotlight for as long as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the "slow drip", if all the leaks were made accessible immediatly media fatigue would kick in, and considering public "short attention span", it wouldn't be long until it was all forgotten. Also Greenwald's (and other news agencies) editorializing of the leaks is important, Manning/Assange were heavily criticized for releasing their leaks crude, without paying attention to the risk they'd might put agents still in the field. Also because of the crude form which the Manning/Assange leaks were released almost no one read them (they were over 1000 pages long, most of which just office rambling), leading to the media to editorialize such material for wider public consumption. Today barely anyone remembers the content of the Manning/Assange leaks despite such pearls as Hillary Clinton claiming that the Saudis are "global terror financers" or the "Collateral Damage" footage of Reuter's reporter being gunned by an Apache.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for government censorship it is no secret that the Guardian stopped with the leaks after being threatened by the GCHQ, and WaPo receiving gag-orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greenwald has been (much like us here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ) "connecting the dots" of the surveillance state even before the leaks.
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/13/petraeus-surveillance-state-fbi">
        His blog posts on the Guardian were excellent
       </a>
       and even without much information corroborating his claims, he was right-on. We can make a lot of claims about the motives and justifications for both Snowden and Greenwald, but sadly this is the best we got today. And even (which I extremely doubt) they are all compliciting with TPTB, then maybe we should use the momemtum created to push onwards, turn their move against themselves.

       Greenwald isn't leaking it all at the request of Snowden whose only request was that Greenwald clear any leaks with the government to make sure no US personnel would be in immediate danger after a release. Greenwald gives them a timeline to come up with something before he publishes.

       You obviously didn't read my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still at least he succeeded in making mass surveillance public discourse. It's now common knowledge that the government spies on its people, and not anymore "tin foil hat" talk. And for any interpretation for his motivation, it is a success to the conspiracy community. It opened up people to the possibllity of a new reality, the rabbit hole is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did it change government policy, of course it didn't. Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, Deep Throat, Manning ... did their revelations changed anything ? Of course not. Why would Snowden's revelation amount to anything within the government (besides a few "angry" commissions). But nonteheless all these succeeded (even if for a brief moment) bring to public attention the true nature of our reality.

       And finally since your attention span is similar to the average public's, let me remind of you of the

       6 months later Snowden's leaks came to light. Explain this then under your Limited Hangout theory ? Putin now works for Obama, and Obama answers to the Reptilian Overloards !! Of course not !! So, stop with your nonsense.

       I gotta defend the common man tho. They just think they can trust the media at least 10%.  That if serious shit was going down that there would be one or two news articles about it and that that would blow up to the point that they would hear about it on reddit or wherever.

       If you think about it, it makes perfect sense that the news of a news journalist being assassinated wouldn't be reported by other news journalists.  That was likely the main purpose of the assassination in the first place.

      <p>
       Very correct.  It's nigh impossible, however, to crack the illusion if/when one is emotionally attached and committed to the lie.  Those types will often attack, fight with, and ridicule those that might try to help them.

       Have you seen the "public" lately? The old believe everything the government says, the middle aged are fat and lazy and too comfortable, the young are self involved in more important matters like finger fucking their phones to ask Tiffany to send them a tit pic and the rest are considered crazy for even bringing up such boring topics in conversation as politics, wars for profit or the surveillance state. Too bad the revolution won't be televised, unless it was most of the public won't even know about it.

       Good points, but it seems that part of the reason many don't care is because we've been manipulated into thinking many of these issues aren't as big a deal as they actually are.  That's not
       <em>
        purely
       </em>
       apathy.  It's "manipulated apathy", if you will; an apathy that might actually NOT be as apathetic as it is if it were not manipulated and contrived by the MSM and TPTB to be that very way.

       You know, I wouldn't doubt that, in all honesty.  I wouldn't doubt it's a further ploy by TPTB to do a serious character assassination on Manning.  For me, I see passed that shit.  It doesn't matter whether Manning is straight as an arrow or likes sucking donkey dick dressed as a woman.  If so, who cares?  That's
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       besides the point.  The real point is what he/she did in exposing the shit that was exposed, and how TPTB responded so horribly afterward w/the Guantanamo solitary confinement and the current, ongoing prison sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT'S the real issue - not how Manning gender identifies.  That has nothing to do with anything actually.  But oh well.  I guess that's enough to distract people and somehow cause everyone to stop thinking about what the actual truth and the issues themselves are in all of this.

       I don't have an issue with Trans people, but it is an attempt to discredit anything he has to say by playing on those old tropes that trans people are inherently lesser people.
      </p>
      <p>
       By making him say these things they make his testimony and any information he talked about less impactful, and mean less, becuase the mainstream media, and the rednecks who do have an issue with his sexuality are too busy concentrating on what organ is between his legs then to decide what to do about the lies, and deciets he exposed abou the US military machine. It puts a spin on it that is intended to make him less trustworthy and intend to distract from the issue at hand.

       Sure, it could all be staged. But so could Chelsea Manning, wouldn't be the first time they burned an asset to give that asset legitimacy. We just can't know, we really can't, and I hate this assertion of people as being "confirmed assets" just because they get media attention. I'm not saying they definitely aren't, it's just, we don't know until evidence is revealed one way or the other.

       Really?  Chelsea Manning rotting in jail could be staged?  Well, I suppose so, but 1) I believe there have been at least a few people who have said "Yep.  He/she's in jail alright." and, 2) if she
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       in jail, I'd imagine we would have

       found out about it by now.

       Not saying there's "no way" Manning's
       <em>
        not

       in prison...but saying she isn't seems to need a bit more than the "it can happen" possibility alone to make such an idea actually stick.

       I never said Chelsea Manning wasn't in prison, I said it wouldn't be the first time they "burned an asset" by which I meant, their assets (people) are expendable and will be "burned" to further an agenda if it would give the narrative legitimacy.

       As far as movies go, there was recently a movie released called Kill The Messenger that exposes the CIA bringing crack cocaine into Los Angeles through Rick Ross, and killing a journalist to cover it up. It was a fairly big Hollywood film, you're probably aware of it. So, is this movie cointelpro?
      </p>

       I'm not saying one way or the other about Snowden, or Assange, I'm just saying I have not seen conclusive evidence, or any evidence really, that they are cointelpro. I'm open to new evidence as always.

       I wouldn't know.  I haven't seen it (and don't plan to).  The point behind Assange and now Snowden having big Hollywood movies made about them, however, is that it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       ultimately glamorize them

       I'd be WAAAYYY shocked if they weren't getting some serious kickback for having themselves portrayed on film.

       Let's look at the CIA crack cocaine scandal I mentioned earlier. So, the CIA shipped plane loads full of cocaine into South Central Los Angeles black neighborhoods, where it is sold by a middleman to Rick Ross, who is unaware that he is in fact dealing with the CIA. Rick Ross becomes the biggest US cocaine dealer of all time, and the CIA gets to fund their war, and also decimate the black panther party / black communities in general. Win / win for them. Fast forward a few years, Rick Ross has made a fuckton of money, and decides to get out of the game. After this, feds swoop in and arrest him. Now they get a big "win" on their books for arresting this huge kingpin, and Rick Ross never even knew he was a drug dealer for the CIA, until intrepid reporter Gary Webb tells him while trying to get the story on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here we can see a documented case of a CIA asset being burned, and understand the motivation behind said burning. The reason I mention it, is because we can clearly see in this instance, the ability of using an asset and then burning them allows playing both sides of the card. Moving on to Manning, what would the motivation be behind said burning? I can't say but you can imagine it would be the same behind the burning of Assange or Snowden, allowing them to play both sides. But again, I don't necessarily think they are or aren't. I would like to lean towards aren't, but that is a emotional call. I mean, you think Manning is legit while Assange is limited hangout, conveniently ignoring that Manning leaked through Assange's outfit, Wikileaks.

       Seems to me those who are "conspiracy" researchers like to declare pretty much anyone who gains any kind of mainstream acceptance as an agent. It's healthy skepticism, but just because Snowden was on the cover of wired does not mean he is an agent. Hastings wrote for Rolling Stone. There is legitimate journalism still being conducted in this world, albeit very scarce in the mainstream.

       Uh-huh, listen buddy, just because one guy is in gitmo and one guy is on house arrest doesn't mean that the guy on house arrest is "100% free"

       It's like saying that because someone else has ebola and is bleeding out their butt, and I "only" have manageable HIV, that I am "100% healthy".

       But I never said anyone is "100% free" - I said compared to the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       whistleblower they are.  So if you have manageable HIV, you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       in quite a significantly better state than someone who is bleeding out of their butt.

       What I said still completely stands.

       Yes.  It is indeed possible.  I can be an asshole sometimes/more than I need to be, I guess.  Apologies.  That being said, I strongly feel that not only are Snowden, Assaunge, and Greenwald all LHs, it seems Manning (again), isn't one as far as almost any indication points to.  That's all.

       Check out Assange's background and childhood.  It is

       Look ill read and listen I judge things for what they are, I don't consider myself "morally bankrupt ". But none of you explain why Putin would grant snowmen asylum and allow him to live in his country if snowmen was a limited hangout. Every other article on this thread is about Putin standing up to the NWO/banking cartles and your telling me he wouldn't lnow snowmen was working with the powers that be?

       This Snowden hatred is a paid shill limited hangout circlejerk.  Get
       <a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com/">
        RES
       </a>
       and tag the people who constantly spout this anti-snowden propaganda. You'll quickly see it is itself a "limited hangout"(a termed coined by Frank Lutz) and the majority of the submitter/commenters are accounts who share the same creation date and content verbatim...copypasta shills who vote brigade. AKA, reddit as usual.

       Snowden's maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett, was a rear admiral in the United States Coast Guard who became a senior official with the FBI.

       Snowden definitely got his job at Booz-Allen Hamilton because of his grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think the FBI section Cheif of Aviation and Special operations units, is a different Edward J. Barrett.
