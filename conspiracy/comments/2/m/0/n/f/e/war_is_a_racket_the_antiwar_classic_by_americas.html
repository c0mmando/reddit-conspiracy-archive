        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.” -  Smedley D. Butler, The most decorated marine 1935</p>

<p>Banksters control us all. Happy veteran&#39;s day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to speak to what went on behind the scenes of the business plot as I don&#39;t know for sure, but there is no doubt that FDR was aligned with the globalists and Wall Street bankers.  He was &quot;their man&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of our modern wars have been totally about making our defense industry money and bending our laws to give the government powers they shouldn&#39;t have to the point where we have completely lost control but the average citizen believes in their modicum of control and in their political process because of fear, propaganda and lies.  I am ashamed of my fellow citizens, ashamed of those who participate in this sham government and identify with politicians, all of them, who have no interest in anything other than lining corporations pockets via lobbyists and special interest groups.</p>

<p>Besides his opus that was War is a Racket (more because of its symbolism and historic significant than the writing itself) we must not forget how he faced up against the establishment was called paranoid (even by the NYT) and prevented Prescott Bush and co. from transforming America into a Fascist paradise through the Business Plot.</p>
