       Edward House was a aide to Woodrow Wilson and was instrumental in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. He was, most likely, an agent of the Rothschild/Rockefeller combine of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also wrote a book:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://librivox.org/philip-dru-administrator-by-edward-m-house/">
         Philip Dru: Administrator: a Story of Tomorrow
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        "...a futuristic political novel published anonymously in 1912 by Edward Mandell House, an American diplomat, politician and presidential foreign policy advisor. His book's hero leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the plutocratic East, and becomes the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms that resemble the Bull Moose platform of 1912 and then vanishes."

       House is sometimes cited as having more real input in Wilson's policies than Wilson himself, and while people conjecture that it was Wilson's wife really running things when he was debilitated at the end of his second term, it seems more likely that it was House.

       It baffles me how people turn the other cheek to this information, but then get up in arms about petty issues like gay marriage ect.
Not saying that it's not an issue, but considering the financial control of our politics leads to an enormous amount of deaths (incalculable) I just don't understand where peoples priorities are at.

       I was thinking something similar today... not about this, but about the racism inherent in our criminal justice system in the US. It is absolutely an awful idea to be black and poor here, because there is a very good chance you will end up in prison for a long time for some stupid crime such as possession of marijuana or whatnot. The US incarcerates a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country in the world - even North Korea... and most of them are black (even though black people make up about 10% of the population of the country) and most of them for non-violent drug offenses (even though black people and white people use a similar amount of drugs on a per-capita basis).
      </p>
      <p>
       And people have the fucking balls to moan about gay marriage. Are you fucking kidding me? It's not like they don't know about the plight of black people and our racist justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can't blame them. It is not their fault. They are not inherently mean, racist or stupid - they just appear to be because they are completely mentally dominated by the pervading culture - because it is "cool" to be pro-gay marriage and it is not "cool" to be against racism within the justice system. These people are just programmed slaves who have long given up on the idea of having any kind of independent thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now I think about it, at least here in this subreddit there are some (actually quite a few) independent thinkers. And even the crackpots are thinking independently and I applaud them at least for that, because nothing is worse than someone who cannot think for him/herself - these people are the lowest. They are beneath contempt because they deserve only pity.

       There's been a deliberate social engineering campaign specifically to get people to argue and bicker over inconsequential social issues while the important problems are hidden from view as much as possible.

       thesis + antithesis = synthesis, that's the formula that's used against us all.

       Well, first off, this quote is from Roosevelt, who had a huge agenda to turn the USA into basically a monarchy.  Anything he said was about making government bigger, so he'd have no problem making false claims to increase his own power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the guy who tried to pack the Supreme Court, pass a new bill of rights that would make everyone slaves to their fellow citizens, played us into ww2, put Americans in camps, and seized everyone's gold.  Is anything he says likely to be the truth?  The man was a walking limited hangout and false flag.

       It's also pretty funny that FDR made this quote considering that it was by and large Wall Street bankers who were responsible for his becoming president.  Who would know better than him?
