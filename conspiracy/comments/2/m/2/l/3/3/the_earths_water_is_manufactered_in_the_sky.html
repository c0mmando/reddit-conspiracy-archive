       The concept is really easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hydrogen + Oxygen + Energy = Water
      </p>
      <p>
       It couldn't get any simpler. Recent discoveries about atmospheric lighting which extends way up into the stratosphere, terrestrial gamma ray flashes, and an Ozone layer that seems to keep replenishing itself, no matter what we throw at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you still believe that the water for the Earth comes from ice comets?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've never seen, which there is good chance you are oblivious to these phenomenon.

       Ever wonder why you smell Ozone after a thunder storm? Ever wonder why thunder is normally accompanied by a down pour? Water still evaporates, and clouds still form as normal, however, there are deeper processes at work, some which extend universally to other planets.

       You didn't provide anything about how such water would be produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because one thing is produced here doesn't mean everything can be produced here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atmospheric lighting was predicted based on current knowledge we had back in the 1920's.  It isn't a new phenomena nor does it defy current scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrestrial gamma ray flashes are interesting, but are still not anything special that defies scientific understand of the earth.  Consensus appears to be that it is photons and electrons emitted from a storm creating the electrical field colliding with air molecules and other molecules in the atmosphere at high speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ozone layer we already knew would replenish itself if we stopped putting cfc's into the air.  It was predicted, and they were correct.  Another known natural process.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things sit within the realm of known science and what current scientific knowledge allows for.  What you are saying sits outside that realm.  Without new evidence, there is nothing that indicates that water can be readily produced on the earth by its own natural processes.  Not to say we won't find that data at some point, or that it is impossible, only that we do not have anything to say it does.  And pointing out things that happen that are odd, is not evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I still believe water came from comets early on, or possibly formed during the earlier years of our planets evolution through as yet undiscovered processes.  I do not believe we are currently making water on earth.

       Upper Atmospheric Lightning. It's entirely new.

       However, yeah, I'm willing to believe that weather modification technology works because it was known by some before hand.

        Earth's water probably didn't come from comets, Caltech researchers say

       <em>
        PASADENA -- A new Caltech study of comet Hale-Bopp suggests that comets did not give Earth its water, buttressing other recent studies but contrary to the longstanding belief of many planetary scientists.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In the March 18 issue of Nature, cosmochemist Geoff Blake and his team show that Hale-Bopp contains sizable amounts of "heavy water," which contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen called deuterium.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Thus, if Hale-Bopp is a typical comet, and if comets indeed gave Earth its water supply billions of years ago, then the oceans should have roughly the same amount of deuterium as comets. In fact, the oceans have significantly less.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether or not you believe it is currently being made. You only need to look to the Aurora Borealis and noctilucent clouds.

       <em>
        In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as trioxidane with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, trioxidanylidene may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature.

       Upper atmospheric lightening was predicted in the 1920's by C.T.R. Wilson.  It was first documented in 1989.  We had video of it by research planes by 1994.  Its not new.

       Weather technology is one thing.  Natural earth processes of creating water is something else entirely.  It would be fascinating if evidence was found to support this idea.

       I'm not defending orthodoxy, I'm asking you to provide data that backs up the idea that water was produced on earth naturally instead of via a comet.  I'm not arguing for anything, but you aren't giving me anything here. I like the idea, its interesting, so give me something to look at!

       Now, if you would be so kind as to provide any basis whatsoever for your idea that water originated on earth.  That is how you discuss issues.  You make a claim, you provide the evidence for why you believe that, and we discuss.  You don't make a claim out of no where and expect people to accept the claim of someone on reddit out of hand.

       The idea is out there and they have their proofs.

       It is new. 1994 is new. There's been a few documentaries on Upper Atmospheric Lighting, which is something independent of this hypothesis.

       Man, all I wanted was some interesting data on what you presented as possible new knowledge to discuss.  Why is it so hard for you to do this? I love discussing new science.  Am I crying? Why would you even say that? Did I ask to much? Were you seriously not prepared to discuss a claim as revolutionary as water being spontaneously created on earth by natural processes? No, I'm not crying, but I'm pretty disappointed that you took the path of making a claim then stalling and getting defensive and ultimately not presenting anything.  Yeah, I might cry, give me a few to get done with my work and take a break, then I'll cry.

       Excuse me but there is a science which says water can be produced on earth, it's called chemistry.

        Earth's water brewed at home, not in space
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But now planetary scientists in Japan suggest the oceans were actually "home-grown" - they may have formed because the young Earth had a thick blanket of hydrogen, which reacted with oxides in the Earth's mantle to form lakes and seas.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Water is essential for the origin and evolution of life," says Hidenori Genda from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. "Why does water exist on Earth, where did it come from? These are fundamental questions for human beings."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Scientists believe that just after the Earth formed, it was very hot and dry. Theory also suggests that millions of water-rich comets and asteroids bombarded our planet around 3.8 billion years ago, neatly explaining why oceans later appeared.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        What's more, the ratio of deuterium - or "heavy hydrogen" because it contains a neutron in addition to a proton - to hydrogen in our sea water matches the value found in water-rich asteroids, suggesting a common origin.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But Genda and his colleague Masahiro Ikoma suggest another possibility. They say the Earth could have had a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, which reacted with oxides in the Earth's mantle to produce copious water.

       Forget it.  All I'm asking for is something to discuss, you are giving me opinions and statements with nothing else.  What you literally just did was come on reddit, say water is produced naturally and not from a comet, said others think so too, and left it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one can come on reddit and say anything at all.  But if you provide nothing to discuss and no foundation to your claim, then there isn't any reason to keep going with it.  Its fascinating, but if you just came up with it out of no where then I have no where to go with it.

       I gave you the first recorded proof of sprite lighting, in 1994, and you argued that it was known before then. Then you went on to say it's nothing new, and was predicted like 80 years ago, then you demanded a law to explain what the process was for it, and said there is nothing that proves it.

         Upper Atmospheric Lightning is not a new phenomena.  It was predicted nearly 80 years ago, and discovered over 20 years ago.  That is not new.

       But at least be honest.  I was responding to your posts.  I didn't go back and see you edited almost everyone of them to include the links I was asking for.  Everyone can see by the little star that you edited your posts and responses.  Every single one I responded to in my inbox had no links.  It is bullshit to add them later then claim I'm just not watching them and I'm ignoring them.  Its not true, thats a bullshit way to do things.  I'm enjoying the video's now.  I never crapped on your theorys because you didn't have anything to crap on.  Like I said I find the idea fascinating, but at the time I said that, there was literally nothing but you saying something.  Nothing.  Now there is.  Thank you.  Its what I've been hoping to get.  So far, its very interesting and raises some good questions.

      <p>
       A hypothesis is nothing more than something waiting to be proven. It is different than physical proven phenomenon video taped by cameras. BTW. 1994 is new. This hypothesis is relatively new. There is no hot of the presses measurement that one can accurately gauge the freshness of these ideas. Which are totally based in the laws of chemistry, btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather prediction at it is, isn't accurate. There is no way you could measure this for accuracy. You can observe and wonder.

       I'll give you that.  So far its some pretty interesting stuff.  The plasma core stuff is probably the most unique idea I've heard in a long time.  Science hasn't really explored this area much in a long time.   Stagnant area's should be revisited time to time.  Maybe time to start looking at the evidence for the composition of the earths core again.

       Yes, DVD's for the classroom. I haven't seen them all, the salt domes one looks interesting. That's normally what is said when canyons are mentioned anywhere. If you go to the USGS, you can see that Canyons are some of the most seismically active, fault ridden, places on earth. I guess it could be salt domes, but yeah, it's probably not.

        Atmospheric lighting was predicted based on current knowledge we had back in the 1920's.

       Somewhat, here's what it says on Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       In ensuing decades, high altitude electrical discharges were reported by aircraft pilots and discounted by meteorologists until the first direct visual evidence was documented in 1989.
      </p>
      <p>
       So apparently meteorologists are such idiots that they just said "uh-huh, sure." to people reporting what should have been well known natural phenomena. They literally didn't listen until they saw visual proof, so that should tell you how "smart" those people are.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ozone layer we already knew would replenish itself if we stopped putting cfc's into the air. It was predicted, and they were correct. Another known natural process.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which should further show to people that the Earth was designed to heal itself, just like the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the human body, it is unable to repair itself in certain ways when we do certain forms of irreparable damage to it such as blowing up mountain tops and caves and sink holes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without new evidence, there is nothing that indicates that water can be readily produced on the earth by its own natural processes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Perhaps we should be doing this research then to ensure that we will never run out of water by ensuring the Earth always has the proper conditions to create it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So yes, I still believe water came from comets early on, or possibly formed during the earlier years of our planets evolution through as yet undiscovered processes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I do not believe that, as it is unproven and based on speculative observational research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll believe it once they can prove it through a working model.

       This is true.  Its one of those accepted ideas that we forget has no evidence to support it.  So the origin of water is definitely up for debate.

       I see right through that bullshit every single time they try it.

       This is why I do not believe their macro-evolution theories, I have been presented absolutely zero solid evidence which confirms their theory of the evolution of the Giraffe, which is the most insane bullshit I've ever heard in my entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never been shown an actual explanation as to which animal it supposedly came from, how it went about deciding to evolve its' neck to grow taller with the trees rather than just going to lower trees which is more logical, and how all of those structures evolved into their new structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refuse to believe that which can't be explained but is still presented as fact, that's what I call bullshit.

       Tbh, there is probably a slim chance this is wrong. I mean it's a slim chance. It's very probable. It simply is not proven and nobody on a forum is going to be able to prove it. None of us have the gear to do so. However the more you look into it the more probable it becomes.

       What I do know, however I really should figure out exactly why they recalibrate the system every four years or so, but the ITRF, is generally a product that earth measurement systems are based off of. At first look, it appears rather scalar, the logic. If I ever do get the time, maybe it's something to dissect, eh?

       That is the conspiracy, that the current "scientific" explanation of "Water PROBABLY came from comets, even though we can't actually prove it" is just that, unprovable probably wrong bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this would be far from the first time where "science" has had to go back and re-update the theory with the actual correct information.
      </p>
      <p>
       They used to think that stars were thermo-nuclear reactors, but they're not, they're spheres of plasma formed from gas and other space matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these stars also emit radio frequencies and electromagnetic waves, which wasn't discovered until 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, this is a conspiracy in that the scientific community may very well be bullshitting with their THEORY on how water formed on Earth.

       Fresh water is formed from evaporation and most from our earths ocean. In fact there is an ocean 400 miles beneath us that can fill our oceans 3 times over.

       Just stop, please.  I'm making my way through the links you posted now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at least be honest.  I was responding to your posts.  I didn't go back and see you edited almost everyone of them to include the links I was asking for.  Everyone can see by the little star that you edited your posts and responses.  Every single one I responded to in my inbox had no links.  It is bullshit to add them later then claim I'm just not watching them and I'm ignoring them.  Its not true, thats a bullshit way to do things.  I'm enjoying the video's now.  I never crapped on your theorys because you didn't have anything to crap on.  Like I said I find the idea fascinating, but at the time I said that, there was literally nothing but you saying something.  Nothing.  Now there is.  Thank you.  Its what I've been hoping to get.  So far, its very interesting and raises some good questions.

       Enough with the idiotic martyr complex.  No one is shitting on your theories, stop being a dick and let me watch your fucking links.

       So you're saying that the notion that sometime science delivers answers that later have to be revised based on new evidence is a conspiracy?
