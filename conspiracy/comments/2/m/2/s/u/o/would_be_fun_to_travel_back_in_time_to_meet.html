<p>Worked with cell phones.  If you don&#39;t have one, or the latest one, you&#39;re seen as being a fuddy duddy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are new phones you can remove the battery from: the best options IMO are the galaxy s phones, and several of the windows lumia phones :)</p>

<p>In terms of privacy, you&#39;re pretty screwed with w.e device you get. I personally am tech savvy and removed the bulk of the spyware off my gs5 (there was amazon, T-Mobile, samsung, and google software tracking things like text and calls installed by default).   I&#39;m sure there is some tracking software I missed, but I feel a little better knowing I got all those guys off my phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not particularly. I rooted it and started uninstalling services.  Where it gets tricky is if you accidently remove something important to the system. Then your phone won&#39;t boot and you need to reflash the ROM. </p>

<p>As long as you&#39;re careful it&#39;s fine, but I can&#39;t in good faith say &quot;oh it&#39;s easy and not that risky&quot; because if you do delete something critical, and you can&#39;t figure out how to reflash it, your kinda screwed. Plus this of course voids your warranty.</p>

<p>I am hooking it up to a new Amazon account.</p>

<p>I plan on taking deliberate steps to turn it &quot;on&quot; and talk about specific things and see how it influences how Amazon advertises things to me (that&#39;s why they do this... Right?)</p>

<p>Then I will make sure to talk about outrageous, crazy things while I know it is &quot;off,&quot; and not listening, and then see if these other ridiculous products start to be advertised as well, proving my hypothesis that it is <em>actually always listening</em>, and then plan on suing for a billion dollars. Or something. Anyone want to get in on this class action? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was some research done in a country like Malaysia or something (I don&#39;t remember exactly where), that essentially was looking to see how understanding of the technology the users are.</p>

<p>The main question was two part:</p>

<p>&quot;What do you use the internet for&quot; and &quot;What social media is your favorite&quot; or something similar.</p>

<p>People pretty much came out saying they don&#39;t use the internet but only use Facebook. Meaning that when they check their mobile device and open the app, its not clicking that its an INTERNET application. They just see it as an &#39;app.&#39; </p>

<p>This is pretty much the view of our leaders today - they don&#39;t understand it so they have someone tell them how it works. It just so happens that the person telling them is a high priced lobbyist for major telecommunications companies and the result is hardly in the consumers favor.</p>
