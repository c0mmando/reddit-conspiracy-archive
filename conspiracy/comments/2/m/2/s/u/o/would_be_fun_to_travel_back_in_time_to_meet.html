       Don't try and force it on them. Coercion generates resistance. Instead, portray your device as being desirable.... fashionable even. Make it expensive so that the consumers can brag to their friends about their latest purchase. Then, as time goes by... reduce price so that everyone can afford one.

       There are new phones you can remove the battery from: the best options IMO are the galaxy s phones, and several of the windows lumia phones :)

      <p>
       In terms of privacy, you're pretty screwed with w.e device you get. I personally am tech savvy and removed the bulk of the spyware off my gs5 (there was amazon, T-Mobile, samsung, and google software tracking things like text and calls installed by default).   I'm sure there is some tracking software I missed, but I feel a little better knowing I got all those guys off my phone.

       CyanogenMod is pretty awesome.  I can't really put it on my phone yet though.  It's missing some features I use a lot, namele: Wifi Calling, VoLTE, and the heart-rate monitor.

       Not particularly. I rooted it and started uninstalling services.  Where it gets tricky is if you accidently remove something important to the system. Then your phone won't boot and you need to reflash the ROM.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you're careful it's fine, but I can't in good faith say "oh it's easy and not that risky" because if you do delete something critical, and you can't figure out how to reflash it, your kinda screwed. Plus this of course voids your warranty.

       I am hooking it up to a new Amazon account.

      <p>
       I plan on taking deliberate steps to turn it "on" and talk about specific things and see how it influences how Amazon advertises things to me (that's why they do this... Right?)

      <p>
       Then I will make sure to talk about outrageous, crazy things while I know it is "off," and not listening, and then see if these other ridiculous products start to be advertised as well, proving my hypothesis that it is
       <em>
        actually always listening

       There was some research done in a country like Malaysia or something (I don't remember exactly where), that essentially was looking to see how understanding of the technology the users are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main question was two part:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What do you use the internet for" and "What social media is your favorite" or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       People pretty much came out saying they don't use the internet but only use Facebook. Meaning that when they check their mobile device and open the app, its not clicking that its an INTERNET application. They just see it as an 'app.'
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty much the view of our leaders today - they don't understand it so they have someone tell them how it works. It just so happens that the person telling them is a high priced lobbyist for major telecommunications companies and the result is hardly in the consumers favor.

       While the device opens the door to surveillance, 'no such agency' would only be interested in some households.  Otherwise, that is a crazy amount of data.

       A bigger question is what is the likelihood Amazon will watch for keywords and specific events for marketing to the home?

       There could be some Joe Sixpack, who installs it in his house today, still trusting the government.  Ten years from now, he wakes up and becomes a dissident, but it's too late.  Amazon (and hence, the NSA) already knows everything about him and his family.

       That's the benefit of cross correlation in massive data sets.  It's actually fascinating if used for good purposes, but who knows how this data will be used :(

       I'm going to bet 100% chance of that. That's why companies are pushing voice assistants so hard. The way this tech works (in many implantations) is that besides the key word to wake it up, all voice processing is done server side.  There's no reason for them not to have a "word cloud" tied to your account so they can target you with ads.

       Why would they be interested in only some households? Have you spent the last 5 years in a cave? It's by their own admission that we know the purpose is to collect everything and look for "problems" later.
