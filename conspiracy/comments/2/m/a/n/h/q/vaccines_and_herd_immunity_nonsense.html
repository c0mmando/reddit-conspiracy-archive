        From Jon Rappoport
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hail to the group! The group is all!
       </p>
       <p>
        The concept of herd immunity (protection for the population) is often used by vaccine addicts as a way to push guilt at people who don’t line up, with their children, like robots for their shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the point of view of protecting people who are already vaccinated, herd immunity is flat-out absurd.
       </p>
       <p>
        Little Jimmy, whose parents have decided not to vaccinate him, will pass diseases on to kids who are already vaccinated? Oh, you mean those immunized kids aren’t really safe? Then why did you vaccinate them in the first place?
       </p>
       <p>
        From another point of view, herd immunity is the idea that people who “can’t be” vaccinated (for example, those who are obviously allergic to elements contained in vaccines) will gain a measure of protection, if larger and larger numbers of others are vaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vaccinated protecting the unvaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is foolish, because what actually protects people against disease is the strength of their immune systems, and that strength has nothing to do with vaccination.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a person has a weak immune system, he will get dangerously sick, and it doesn’t matter how many people around him are vaccinated against how many diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        So even if one accepts the (false) premise that vaccines are effective and safe, the premise of herd immunity is ludicrous.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaccination is, in fact, a cover story used to conceal the fact that the health of populations has everything to do with good nutrition, adequate sanitation, and an absence of toxic elements in the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many doctors who know this, but they refuse to speak out, because they know they’ll suffer consequences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaccination, as a propaganda strategy, is used to medicalize the population—to assert that good health is fundamentally a medical matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        It isn’t.
       </p>
       <p>
        If tomorrow, two things happened, they would change the face of health in any industrialized country:
       </p>
       <p>
        One, millions more people buying healthy food and/or growing their own food, in yards; and in inner cities, growing food in community gardens;
       </p>
       <p>
        And two, the courts delivering justice in the form of billion-dollar fines and long, long prison sentences to corporate employees (including CEOs) for severe and real pollution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note: That justice would eliminate GMO crops which rely on toxic pesticide use.
       </p>
       <p>
        I’m not spinning rainbows. I’m just pointing out that, with these two changes alone, hospitals and clinics and doctors’ offices would empty out, and the medical cartel would finally experience vast comeuppance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Health and life are not medical functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any science that claims they are is false science, and the people who make those claims are liars or morons or criminals, or some combination of all three.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's an excerpt
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/23og48/the_skeptics_guide_to_vaccines_part_i_poxes_polio/">
        from my own research
       </a>
       on vaccines:
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most oft-cited truism among those who unequivocally defend the current vaccine program is the notion of “herd immunity.” The idea is that if a large enough percentage of the population is immunized against a certain disease, then epidemics can be prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, it was suggested that 60-70% of the population needed to be immunized to reach those goals...today some claim that 95-100% immunization is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very strong, and rarely mentioned, case against the perceived state of “herd immunity” in the population today. The mistake lies in the assumption that high percentages of the population are
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       immune to diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The problem with this is that most of the protection afforded by these childhood vaccines waned many decades ago, so that most baby boomers, the largest percentage of the population, have
        <em>
         no
        </em>
        protection. In fact, vaccines for most Americans declined to non-protective levels within 5 to 10 years of the vaccines.
       </p>
       <h2>
        This means that for a majority of Americans, as well as others in the developed world, herd immunity doesn't exist and hasn't for over 60 years.
       </h2>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The media and vaccine enthusiasts would have us believe otherwise, like claiming that as many as 40,000 people die from the “flu” every year, despite this claim being completely unsupported by the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Peter Doshi, Ph.D., a Johns Hopkins scientist, recently issued a
       <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6770">
        blistering report
       </a>
       , claiming that only a small portion of those diagnosed with the “flu”
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       have the influenza virus present.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the United States,
        <a href="http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Headline/influenza-virus-flu-vaccine-Peter-Doshi-Ph-D-/2013/05/16/id/504942/">
         says Doshi
        </a>
        of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Drug companies and public officials press for widespread vaccination each fall, offering vaccinations in drugstores and supermarkets.
       </p>
       <p>
        The results have been phenomenal. Only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States on an annual basis. Today, the total has skyrocketed to 135 million doses. Mandatory vaccination polices have been enacted, often in healthcare facilities, forcing some people to take the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to Doshi, “The vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated. For most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it.” That's not the case, he says.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although the CDC implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, Doshi disagrees. He points to
        <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2994">
         an Australian study
        </a>
        that found 1 in every 110 children under the age of 5 had convulsions following vaccinations in 2009 for H1N1 influenza. Additional investigations found that the H1N1 vaccine was also associated with a spike in cases of narcolepsy among adolescents.

       I agree but most people just look at their reddit front page, meaning they only ever see if and when a post from this sub makes it to the #1 spot.  Of those who actually visit the sub specifically, most probably just look at "hot" or "top".  It wouldn't take many people to significantly influence the flow of information, especially for a post like this which has clearly been cross posted to a sub dedicated to discrediting posts like this.

       I assume I am the one you are talking about as the conspiratard since you pointed it out earlier. Just to clarify, I have made one post and three comments in that sub since I joined reddit. I have about 30 times the karma on this sub as I do on that. I did not downvote you on this submission as I believe in the rule that downvotes are not the disagree button, and I have been and still am in favor of making this a subscriber only sub due to the brigading that often happens to your posts as well as many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will continue to be a skeptic who looks for sources in the field for which the claims are made, which is why I made my original comment in this thread. I was simply pointing out what I felt should be known about one of the sources you used as I do not find him to be credible on the subject. It is up to the other readers to decide if my point was valid. If you don't like having your sources so easily discredited, I suggest finding better ones to use.

       I thank you for posting, because I do like reading the opinions opposing my own. First though Jon Rappoport is not creditable. A quick Google search shows him as a loon. Secondly your own research isn't credible. What are your qualifications to make you credible? Your Australian study is behind a pay wall.

       While your post was an interesting read I do think everyone should take it with a gain of salt at the very least.

       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/disease/flushot.asp">
        Peter Doshi

       is neither a virologist nor a epidemiologist, but rather an anthropologist who completed a fellowship in comparative effectiveness research at Johns Hopkins. He conducted no research about influenza or vaccines at Johns Hopkins, nor does he speak for the university on that subject.

       I have a pretty long history of posting here - I don't have as many comments as links posted. Apparently you have checked my history if you say that I am a contributor over there, so you should know this. I may at some point have contributed to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       , but generally I read the comments only. I believe this sub plays an important role in creating awareness of some issues, but I also believe that some of the more outlandish theories are crazy and should be treated as such.

       I'm don't hold anything that would give me any credibility in this subject matter. So I didn't post my own research that would dispute his. If I wasn't mobile currently, or at the time of my post, I may have linked more credible sources.

       There is nothing wrong with enjoying a good conspiracy, but before you preach it, have some actually evidence. Is that too complicated? Or should I just start making stuff up that goes against the masses?

       KingDoink did. You ignored the substance of his comment, choosing to go through his posting history.

       Are you willing to debate this topic, or are you going to dismiss all criticisms of your position out of hand?

       Lol. You call this "substance"?

       There's absolutely nothing of substance there, just character assassination.

       Is Rappoport credible? I don't see any reason to take him as such. So at the very least, axolotl could have provided just a little reason to consider him an authority in this field.

       edit: I found a blurb about one of Rappoport's books:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The more you are able to do magic because magic flows from the uniqueness of you the more magic you will be able to do. That's what it is all about. And so, in the New Magic Age as energy and the anticipation of this age begins to bleed into the atmosphere of our planet, it is an invitation for each individual to set foot on that infinite road of magic.

       This doesn't seem like a person who has a strong background in science.

       My point was that KingDoink simply saying so doesn't make it so and neither does him saying so have any substance.
