        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/02/black-911-a-walk-on-the-dark-side-2/">http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/02/black-911-a-walk-on-the-dark-side-2/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One consultant, Jonathan Winer, told ABC: “it’s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading covering the entire world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.”[1] The list of affected nations was long, and included the US, Germany, Japan, France Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the UK, Switzerland and Spain.[2] Soon, independent investigations were underway on three continents in the belief that the paper trail would lead to the terrorists.</p>

<p>Press statements by leading figures in the international banking community left little doubt that the evidence was compelling. Ernst Welteke, President of the German Deutsche Bundesbank, told reporters that “a preliminary review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in airlines and insurance companies, along with major trades in gold and oil markets, before September 11 that suggest….advance knowledge of the attacks. Welteke said that his researchers came across….almost irrefutable proof of insider trading.”  Welteke was blunt: “What we found makes us sure that people connected to the terrorists must have been trying to profit from this tragedy.”[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the insider trading was very obvious in the early days after the attack. Everyone seemed gung-ho to track down these traders as it would lead directly to the terrorists.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/011218reuters">http://www.wanttoknow.info/011218reuters</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using a pioneering laser scanning technology to find data on damaged computer hard drives and main frames found in the rubble of the World Trade Center and other nearby collapsed buildings, Convar has recovered information from 32 computers that support assumptions of dirty doomsday dealings. </p>

<p>&quot;The suspicion is that inside information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amid all the chaos the criminals would have, at the very least, a good head start,&quot; said Convar director Peter Henschel. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were even able to recover hundreds of harddrives from the rubble and were able to recover almost all of the data held on them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It could turn out that Americans went on an absolute shopping binge on that Tuesday morning. But at this point there are many transactions that cannot be accounted for,&#39;&#39; Henschel said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not only the volume but the size of the transactions was far higher than usual for a day like that. There is a suspicion that these were possibly planned to take advantage of the chaos.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>&quot;There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes in order to move out amounts exceeding $100 million,&#39;&#39; Wagner said. &quot;They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed.&#39;&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some time all mention of this investigation seemed to disappear and people started wondering what the SEC had found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his book “Crossing the Rubicon”, former LAPD detective Mike Ruppert explains the SEC’s unprecedented move to deputize:</p>

<p>What happens when you deputize someone in a national security or criminal investigation is that you make it illegal for them to disclose publicly what they know…. In effect, they become government agents and are controlled by government regulations rather than their own conscience. In fact, they can be thrown in jail without a hearing if they talk publicly. I have seen this implied threat time and again with federal investigations, intelligence agents, and even members of the United States Congress who are bound so tightly by secrecy oaths and agreements that they are not even able to disclose criminal activities inside the government for fear of incarceration.[13]</p>

<p>Notice, this surely means that Al Qaeda had nothing to do with the insider trading.[14] When the evidentiary trail led back to Wall Street, the SEC moved quickly to control the evidence and muzzle potential witnesses. Despite the best efforts of the SEC, a few details did leak to the world press. In mid-October 2001, The Independent (UK) reported that, “To the embarrassment of investigators, it has….emerged that the firm used to buy many of the ‘put’ options (where a trader, in effect, bets on a share price fall) on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by Alvin ‘Buzzy’ Krongard, now executive director of the CIA.”[15]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it turns out that when the SEC found direct connections between the firms involved in the trading and the CIA they moved to make everything secret. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence was all the more incriminating, because in at least one case the purchaser failed to collect a reported $2.5 million in profits made from the collapsing share price of UAL stock. The only plausible explanation was that someone at the purchasing bank feared exposure and subsequent arrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/06/sec-government-destroyed-documents-regarding-pre-911-put-options.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/06/sec-government-destroyed-documents-regarding-pre-911-put-options.html</a></p>

<p>So after the trail seemingly goes cold David Callahan submits a FOIA request to find out what the SEC had discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been advised that the potentially responsive records have been destroyed.</p>

<p>If the SEC had responded by producing documents showing that the pre-9/11 put options had an innocent explanation (such as a hedge made by a smaller airline), that would be understandable.</p>

<p>If the SEC had responded by saying that the documents were classified as somehow protecting proprietary financial information, I wouldn’t like it, but I would at least understand the argument.</p>

<p>But destroyed? Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documents were destroyed.</p>

It is interesting to note that Australia has recently enacted draconian new security laws and there was discussion about how it would make it legal for ASIO to put files on your computer. As well as making things like that, ASIO and ASIS agents were given immunity to prosecution for crimes commited during the course of an operation. Australia is a part of the Five Eyes.

    <div class="md"><p>What this means is that the ultra-wealthy <strong>knew in advance</strong> what was about to take place that day.</p>

<p>This, in and of itself, is <em>absolute proof</em> that there were other people in on the attacks besides Bin Laden and his merry band of Afghani cave dwellers.</p>

<p>Either that, or you have to accept the fact that hundreds of rich people simultaneously got the same idea at the same time.... take advantage of the chaos and do some insider deals within minutes of the attacks happening. But this line of reasoning doesn&#39;t hold up in light of the following;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in airlines and insurance companies, along with major trades in gold and oil markets, <strong>before</strong> September 11 that suggest….advance knowledge of the attacks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So someone knew the attack was coming, and they told their rich friends so that they could take advantage of the confusion about it. The kind of people that could make money off an event like this. </p>

<p>When you consider who fits this description, you don&#39;t end up with a very long list.</p>

<p>Edit: I wonder how the conspiracy deniers would explain this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al-Qaeda purchased 95% of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10... much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, that recommended these trades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But wasn&#39;t there an SEC investigation to ascertain if there were any possible links?</p>

<p>I find this interesting because it does tacitly imply that there <em>was</em> suspicious trading activity going on before the attacks took place. But then that same investigation claims there was no such link. Not that there wasn&#39;t suspicious trading activity.</p>

<p>So that leaves at least two possibilities. One, someone else had advance knowledge of what was going to happen. Two, it actually <em>was</em> Al Qaeda and the SEC opted for denial (ie lied about it). Three, whether or not there was any suspicious activity, it was an unrelated coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those three reports in fact do not show any irregularities. They have some random investigator making claims that they are irregular. </p>

<p>They do not, however,  show any trading history to back up those claims. In fact, I suspect that their wording is specially made to infer a conspiracy without providing any real information. An example of this is how they talk about a sharp rise in the market just prior, yet that is how the market works. On any given day/month/year,  there are always sharp rises and drops. that&#39;s not necessarily suspicious behavior unless it goes against their trading histories,  none of which they actually show. Then they talk about the large exchanges of money, but guess what..... they always handle sums of money. </p>

<p>So unless someone can show me trading histories that go back a few years and then trades around 9/11 that don&#39;t masks sense, I don&#39;t take what they have to say too seriously. I want to see real data,  but hear someone say a dozen different ways its suspicious. </p>

<p>People with lots of money trade often. Stocks spike and drop all the time. Sometimes people also get randomly lucky. I believe in data,  which in something none of these sites seem to show even though they have lots of opinions about this data. Where are these trading histories they keep referring to? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are statistical analyses of the data you are talking about.  The whole point of something being <em>irregular</em> is that it is not the noraml fluctuations you are talking about.  Of course, it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s all a coincidence (but unlikely).

    <div class="md"><p>After googling it, on PROMIS&#39; servers:</p>

<p>&quot;PROMIS is a software program that seems to be fitted with almost &quot;magical&quot; abilities. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Between September 6 and 7, the CBOE saw purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines, but only 396 call options. Assuming that 4,000 of the options were bought by people with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks, these &quot;insiders&quot; would have profited by almost $5 million.
On September 10, 4,516 put options on American Airlines were bought on the Chicago exchange, compared to only 748 calls. Again, there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance; again, assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent &quot;insiders&quot;, they would represent a gain of about $4 million.
[The levels of put options purchased above were more than six times higher than normal.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about building 7 though is that you&#39;re never gonna convinced Joe six pack with math and physics. But that really doesn&#39;t matter. Because the real smoking gun of 9/11 is every-fucking-thing about. Everything that happened leading up to it from the creation of the cia to all the coups and assassinations in the 50s and 60s. Iran Contra. MK Ultra. Operation Gladio. Operation Northwoods. The anthrax attacks that coincided with 9/11 came from a US govt lab. That&#39;s the official story. A us govt scientist with no ties to middle eastern terrorists mailed those letters because he was crazy or something and then he killed himself before he could be put on trial or any evidence could be presented. Then Osama who used to work for the CIA avoided capture for years before and after 9/11 and then we killed him and threw his body in the ocean. And then a couple months later all the unreleased evidence was destroyed for no reason (probably becasue it never existed in the first place). It&#39;s all a big fucking lie. And not a very convincing one either. You really gotta have you&#39;re brain shut off to accept this narrative. Once you wake up from the media induced fictional reality matrix and learn all the suppressed history of the cold war up to today well then it just becomes incredibly fucking obvious what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s far better explained by the general confusion of live news reporting than by any aspect of conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>There is literally no reason, in any interpretation of 9/11 inside job conspiracy theory, to tell news organisations ahead of time of events like that. They are conditioned to reporting in response to events, if something happens they will report it. You don&#39;t need to tell them about it beforehand.</p>

Also, to have the BBC reporter a full 26 minutes early reporting on the building coming down while it is visibly still standing right behind her proves they don&#39;t report &#39;happenings&#39;...They read off what ever script is handed to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that several outlets said similar things actually counts <em>against</em> the 9/11 Truth idea that the BBC simply got ahead of schedule...</p>

<p>In fact what happened, which you&#39;d see if you&#39;d read the link, was that a 4:15pm a CNN reporter said they&#39;d received reports about WTC7 - <em>&quot; there is a fire there and that the building may collapse as well&quot;</em></p>

<p>12 minutes later a BBC reporter appears on a radio report, quoting &quot;local media&quot; reports and says <em>&quot;another building may have caught light and is in danger of collapse&quot;</em> and clarifies further when queried <em>&quot;&quot;I&#39;m not sure if it has yet collapsed but the report we have is talking about Building 7&quot;</em></p>

<p>The same report is paraphrased a few more times over then next half hour or so on a few BBC broadcasts, which eventually morphs into &quot;has collapsed&quot;</p>

<p>Jane Standley, in New York, didn&#39;t offer the information about the collapse, she was just relaying the information she&#39;d been given by researchers and production staff - mostly in London.</p>

<p>Your explanation is awesome, and I thank you for sharing it. I haven&#39;t seen this information before. I just still find the whole thing suspicious. Usually if the news reports something inaccurately, they just roll with it and correct it later. They don&#39;t cut the reporter off mysteriously while she&#39;s still giving her report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite a lot of 9/11 videos claim that the Pentagon entry hole was only 16-20 feet in diameter - far too small to be explained by the 757.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsRm8M-qOjQ#t=1252">Loose Change for example</a> - they&#39;ve been making that claim through a number of revisions despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. They appear to be <em>deliberately</em> misrepresenting photographs to make their point.</p>

<p>Some videos are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypc4ieJO0pg#t=92">even worse</a> - using photographs of the &quot;punch out&quot; hole while claiming they are the impact hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It requires a massive amount of work to check on all the claims. </p>

<p>For Loose Change there are two interesting critiques... </p>

<p>One is from <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/reviews/loose_change/index.html">a 9/11 Truth website</a> that takes issue with quite a few points in the film (although is predictably on board with others). </p>

<p>The other is [Screw Loose Change](screwloosechange.blogspot.com), which is obviously a little more critical of the overall points of the film. They even produced an annotated version (although it seems to have been lost to the ages). </p>

<p>But, of course, there are rebuttals to those critiques because, well, there isn&#39;t a lot of consensus between Truthers and skeptics. </p>

<p>Nobody has made that claim and I consider it a strawman. The media, BBC in this case, was simply reporting what they were told to report. Edit: However, the BBC did make sure they covered up the error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/3544">FEMA&#39;s</a> report on the attacks, including the chapter on WTC 7.  It doesn&#39;t really make much sense (to me), but apparently there was a diesel fuel line or two that may have been severed by falling tower debris.  This in turn may have caused raging fires that eventually led to a single major support column collapsing and taking the whole thing down with it.  It&#39;s hard to verify the story (and they admit that) and one of the hardest parts is that the FBI and other law-enforcement limited the ability of civilians to take pictures on that day (as well as the huge smoke and dust clouds).  FEMA and NIST mention pictures showing a huge fire in the building, but they don&#39;t show them.  So a lot of people consider WTC 7 to be the &quot;smoking gun.&quot;</p>

<p>Look it&#39;s <em>obvious</em> more people knew about it prior to the act than we are led to believe, but the whole controlled demolition thing seems to be either a huge fuck up in terms of people who first proposed it or some kind of disinfo operation to confuse and discredit anyone looking into the 9/11 events deep enough to find the real truth.</p>

<p>Nowadays you get massively downvoted if you question 911 on Reddit, people thing that 911 denier is the same as Holocaust denier or Moon landing denier or alien shape shifting overlord believer... It&#39;s crazy that I swear a few years ago the majority of people thought it was some kind of conspiracy, nowadays only a <em>few</em> people do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re concerned about what people on reddit think (especially since they hid the vote counts) you&#39;re living your life all wrong. </p>

<p>Building 7 fell at freefall. The other two fell at close to freefall. There&#39;s plenty of disinfo related to all aspects of this event but those building blew the fuck up with explosives. Watch the video. They blew up. You can see it with your eyes. Boom. The buildings break apart and launch up and over and out. </p>

<p>You were lied to because people are liars. You&#39;re a liar too and you probably lie to yourself about plenty of things just like everyone else. It&#39;s how our society functions. Everyone lies to everyone, including themselves, about everything. We live in a cold, uncaring universe on a tiny speck of dust where dumb apes in tacky clothing blow each other up in order to accumulate pieces of green paper covered in traces of fecal matter. Lies bring people comfort. You&#39;re just gonna have to get used to that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason no &quot;official&quot; study found explosives is beacuse they never looked for them. They said looking for them would be a waste of time and money. They &quot; &#39;study&#39; &quot; you refer to has so been published in a peer reviewed journal. It&#39;s just not one that people consider &quot;official&quot; enough. The sort of journals you&#39;d like to see it published in are never going to broach such subjects because they&#39;re all owned by the same powerful moneyed interests who planned and executed 9/11. Science is a wonderful tool. But it&#39;s not some panacea to human nature. History shows again and again that politics trumps science every time.  Just look at the war on drugs for fucks sake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure which study you&#39;re talking about. There have been several. I don&#39;t really care much either. These studies are just tiny examples in a vast mountain of evidence. To me the real proof of 9/11 is just the geopolitical/ historical context in which it happened. PNAC for fucks sake. It&#39;s obvious what happened. It&#39;s obvious what&#39;s been happening way before 9/11 and continues to happen today. The evidence is all out there. They tell you exactly what they&#39;re doing, they just phrase it in a way that leaves you an out to rationalize it. &quot;We need a new pearl harbor to bring about revolutionary change in America and transform it into the global dominant force&quot; wink wink. Oh yeah, but no that&#39;s not what they meant. They just got lucky. Sure. Go back to bed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People say they &quot;fell at free-fall,&quot; but it&#39;s more accurate to say &quot;near free-fall.&quot;  The point is that they fell darn fast, almost free-fall, suggesting that the bottom (more robust) sections of the building did not offer hardly any resistance.  NIST hardly mentions this in their report, they are only concerned with what could have led to the initiation of collapse and don&#39;t worry about the actual collapse.  There is a mention in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">FAQ</a> though, but it seems like a pretty circular explanation to me.  Chandler did a <a href="http://www.scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/ChandlerDownwardAccelerationOfWTC1.pdf">paper</a> on how it was ridiculous that they could have fallen so fast, if you are into math or physics I would give it a read as it is rather short.</p>

<p>A total of 92 <em>pages</em> of end notes and citations makes this the most comprehensive refutation of the official narrative published in the wake of the attacks.  Apparently the folks who knew of-- and profited from-- 9/11 (I&#39;m talking to <em>you</em> Cheney, Bandar Bush, et al,) didn&#39;t fully account for the existence of the internet as an archive of historical record. Perhaps someday that same historical record will hold them to accounts. </p>

<p>I have a rule I go by that hasn&#39;t done me wrong yet. If it has any tie to the CIA, then I can&#39;t trust it. The article states he started talking 6 weeks after stepping down as Executive Director. I have a hard time believing he wouldn&#39;t still be a hardcore &quot;company man&quot; at that point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...said AB &quot;Buzzy&quot; Krongard, who stepped down six weeks ago as the CIA’s third most senior executive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes both ways though. I have a hard time with Cathy O&#39;Brien as well. Totally different topic, and there are plenty of reasons to have a hard time with her testimony. But the fact that an ex-CIA man always talks with her, and before her, and is basically always around her... is just too suspicious for me.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re in the CIA, you&#39;re never out. Just like any other intelligence agency. Disinfo, disinfo, disinfo.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it done before, years ago, but I alas did not keep the link.  Suffice to say, the growth of improbability is geometric so even if all the &quot;coincidences&quot; are only slightly improbable the sum total is ridiculously unlikely.  The guy who did it before had a method where you would attack a probability rating from one to three and then it calculated it for you.  Pretty much anyone who went through that list would have to admit that there was no chance of the official story being true.  Also, this was over ten years ago so by now I&#39;m sure the list of &quot;coincidences&quot; has gotten much much larger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asbestos, WTC, Cheney, and the Bush family. (and of course Halluburton)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=5659">http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=5659</a></p>

<p>&quot;CHENEY, HALLIBURTON, THE BUSH FAMILY, AND ASBESTOS</p>

<p>Dick Cheney, Halliburton, Inc., and, reportedly, the Bush family are surprisingly well acquainted with asbestos-related concerns. [7]</p>

<p>On December 18, 2002, CBS News reported that Halliburton &quot;has agreed to pay about $4 billion in cash and stock to settle hundreds of thousands of asbestos claims against it.&quot; Reportedly, Halliburton inherited its asbestos liability from Harbison-Walker, a unit of Halliburton&#39;s subsidiary Dresser Industries, and from Halliburton&#39;s Kellog Brown &amp; Root subsidiary.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2001, the World Socialist Web Site reported that &quot;During the 2000 election campaign critics noted that in the last several years Cheney and Halliburton had contributed $157,500 to congressional candidates who had co-sponsored legislation to cut off victims&#39; rights to a fair recovery when injured or killed as a result of asbestos exposure.&quot;</p>

<p>And on August 11, 2002, The Olympian (from Olympia, WA), carried a Washington Post article noting that:</p>

<p>&quot;Dresser had close ties to a family Cheney knew well: the Bushes. Cheney&#39;s boss while he served as Secretary of Defense, President George H.W. Bush, was once being groomed to run Dresser, a company that Bush&#39;s father and grandfather had reshaped decades earlier.</p>

<p>When Dresser went public in the 1920s, it turned to W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., whose president was George Herbert Walker, grandfather and namesake to former president Bush. Prescott Bush, the former president&#39;s father, helped organize Dresser and select its new president, H. Neil Mallon. Prescott Bush eventually sat on the board and by 1941, still held 1,900 shares of Dresser stock. Mallon was so close to former president Bush that he described him in his autobiography as &quot;surrogate uncle and father-confessor.&quot; One of his sons, Neil Mallon Bush, is named after him. After World War II, Mallon employed George H.W. Bush and Dresser executives expected him to take over the company, according to journalist Darwin Payne, who wrote a history of Dresser. Instead, the former president left to prospect for oil.</p>

<p>While Cheney saw sound business reasons for acquiring Dresser, there was a problem in its past -- the use of asbestos in Harbison-Walker division products.&quot;</p>

<p>THE WTC&#39;S CHANGE TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP--JUST WEEKS BEFORE 9/11</p>

<p>On July 24, 2001, private investors (Silverstein Properties, with minority partner Westfield America, Inc.) took control of the WTC under a 99-year lease.</p>

<p>In &quot;Waking Up From Our Nightmare,&quot; Paul and Hoffman note that the WTC&#39;s estimated value at the time was 8 billion dollars. [8]</p>

<p>According to professor of economics Michel Chossudovsky, the lease called for payments to the Port Authority &quot;amounting to 3.2 billion dollars in installments&quot; payable over 99 years. With several hundred million dollars being provided by mortgage holders, Mr. Silverstein put just 14 million dollars of his own money into the deal. [9]</p>

<p>Quoting from a May 20, 2002 article in The New Yorker, Chossudovsky notes that &quot;Explicity included in the [lease] agreement was that Silverstein and Westfield &#39;WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REBUILD THE STRUCTURES IF THEY WERE DESTROYED.&#39; &quot; [9] [with emphasis added]</p>

<p>Paul and Hoffman add that &quot;Quoting the British Financial Times of September 14, 2001, the American Reporter wrote that &#39;THE LEASE HAS AN ALL-IMPORTANT ESCAPE CLAUSE: IF THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUCK BY &quot;AN ACT OF TERRORISM,&quot; THE NEW OWNERS&#39; OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE ARE VOID. As a result, the new owners are not required to make any payments under their lease, but they will be able to collect on the loss of the buildings...destroyed and damaged in the attacks.&#39; &quot; (The American Reporter&#39;s article was titled &quot;No Fraud, but Huge Profits Seen in World Trade Center Attacks.&quot;) [8] [with emphasis added]</p>

<p>It&#39;s also reported that Mr. Silverstein is &quot;a large contributor to Democrat and Republican office-holders.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its really sad that the public bought in to the whole 9/11 since they can never come to the fact the it was an inside job. </p>

<p>This could be considered a major <strong>&quot;traumatic bonding</strong>&quot; event or Stalkhome Syndrome for the planet.</p>

<p>Stockholm syndrome, or capture-bonding, is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with them. These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness. The FBI&#39;s Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.</p>

<p>Stockholm syndrome can be seen as a form of traumatic bonding, which does not necessarily require a hostage scenario, but which describes &quot;strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other.&quot; One commonly used hypothesis to explain the effect of Stockholm syndrome is based on Freudian theory. It suggests that the bonding is the individual&#39;s response to trauma in becoming a victim. Identifying with the aggressor is one way that the ego defends itself. When a victim believes the same values as the aggressor, they cease to be perceived as a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God I love the 9/11 Commission report, it&#39;s almost like it was written to be funny.  Here is basically the crux of their &quot;counter-argument&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The UAL trading on September 6 is a good example. On that day alone, the UAL put option volume was much higher than any surrounding day and exceeded the call option volume by more than 20 times—highly suspicious numbers on their face.170 The SEC quickly discovered, however, that a single U.S. investment adviser had purchased 95 percent of the UAL put option volume for the day. The investment adviser certainly did not fit the profile of an al Qaeda operative: it was based in the United States, registered with the SEC, and managed several hedge funds with $5.3 billion under management. In interviews by the SEC, both the CEO of the adviser and the trader who executed the trade explained that they—and not any client—made the decision to buy the put as part of a trading strategy based on a bearish view of the airline industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since they weren&#39;t linked to Al-Qaeda, they have to be innocent!  Plus, they said so.  It seems as if the entire methodology of the SEC&#39;s investigation was to find out if any of the companies with the unusual put-options either profited or had any ties to Al Qaeda.  Pretty much standard fare of working backwards from their conclusions that we see throughout the entire &quot;investigation.&quot;  Still, they are unable to report that there were not statistically anomalous trades as is reported above, merely that they were &quot;just another coincidence.&quot;  I do wonder though if it is possible for individuals to profit from the put options even if the hedge fund as a whole lost as a result of 9/11 (most did since the market crashed).  I also wonder how the news networks knew before the towers even fell that it was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda that had done it.  Just another coincidence I guess...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be clear about what this is in reference to.</p>

<ol>
<li>We&#39;re not talking about &quot;insider trading&quot; in the typical sense. These alleged traders were not insiders, but rather were privy to information that would affect the markets externally (i.e. they were or were working for terrorists).</li>
<li>We&#39;re not talking about most of the trades that might have been made, but only the few that were transacted immediately before the attack. Because of the way derivatives work, I actually don&#39;t think this is terribly interesting. The same trades could have been placed days in advance to the same effect.</li>
<li>We lack any compelling evidence that such trades did exist, just lots of questions about the rushed handling at the time of the admittedly spotty records of trades that were damaged during the attacks. This is to be expected, given that they were trades damaged during the attacks...</li>
</ol>

<p>The last bit seems to be the point of focus:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been advised that the potentially responsive records have been destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not terribly shocking. Any documents recovered from a period when the market was shut down automatically represent a potential exposure of client information that the government has to respect. The financial firm&#39;s fiduciary duty can&#39;t be interfered with by investigators without compelling reasons, and whether we are curious or not, if they felt they didn&#39;t have such compelling reasons, then they had only one legal course.</p>

<p>Yet the first article linked refers to &quot;the evidence for informed, or insider, trading in the <em>days</em> and hours before the 9/11 attacks.&quot; (My emphasis)  I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just missed that one because it&#39;s placed at the top and easy to skip over.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>To say that we lack evidence that this did occur is besides the point since the evidence that apparently existed was destroyed.  However, that in itself is evidence that there was something to cover up which can be taken as indirect evidence that there was malfeasance.  </p>

<p>Your last point, about the documents being destroyed by the government makes sense, but not in this context.  Destroying criminal evidence is itself criminal, regardless of client privilege.  I think that most rational people would consider foreknowledge of 9/11 a &quot;compelling reason&quot; to take a look at private transactions.  You may agree once you take a peek at the FPJ article that it seems you missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not denying that it&#39;s normal procedure, I&#39;m just pointing out that the events of 9/11 were not normal events and there is plenty of statistical evidence of fore-knowledge by large players in financial markets.  There are no studies explaining away the statistical anomalies, just assertions that it was &quot;coincidence.&quot;  In a criminal investigation, there is no &quot;coincidence.&quot;  The leads should have been followed, at least the parties involved interviewed, even if the paper trail didn&#39;t lead to Al Qaeda.  </p>

<p>This is just a classic example of the 9/11 investigators working backwards from a fixed conclusion, a highly inappropriate methodology for criminal investigators.  The destruction of the evidence, whether it showed guilt or not, means we can only take the SEC&#39;s word at face value.  Given the track record of this organization I think you would be a fool to be satisfied with that.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously it was both normal procedure and destruction of evidence, the point I&#39;m making is that the context of the procedure was not normal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/503645">This paper generates systematic information about option market activity that can be used to assess the option trading that precedes any event of interest. Examination of the option trading leading up to September 11 reveals that there was an unusually high level of put buying. This finding is consistent with informed investors having traded options in advance of the attacks.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1522157">Our main empirical findings are summarized as follows.  First, detected option informed trades tend to cluster prior to certain events such as... the terrorist attacks of September 11th... We note that only undertaking an extensive empirical analysis this finding could emerge. Second, prior to a particular event which will impact a particular company, informed trading can involve more than one option but rarely the cheapest option, i.e., deep out-of-the-money and with shortest maturity. This finding is consistent with informed investors trading fairly liquid options and attempting not to immediately reveal their private signals.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1588523">After the September 11 attacks, several major newswires reported that there were insiders who tried to profiteer from the options market in anticipation of the event... index call options lead us to reject the null hypotheses that there was no abnormal trading in these contracts prior to the September 11 attacks... this, in turn, is consistent with insiders anticipating the 9-11 attacks.</a></p>

<p>This seems like &quot;evidence&quot; to me.</p>

<p>The entity itself. If people knew that the Federal Reserve was so non-government and corrupt to go so far as to assassinate a sitting US President for moving to a gold standard, there would be a huge rise in the statistical <em>possibility</em> of the Fed being driven out of the country. Doubtful, if you ask me, but only because the information on the Fed is already public and only a relative handful of people seem to REALLY care about it. </p>

<p>But I could see something like that as the catalyst for real and systemic change to rid ourselves of the shackles forged by the Federal Reserve and placed on every man, woman, and child born in this country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SEC sought the assistance of countries where there was significant trading of U.S. securities. Each of these countries had previously entered into information sharing agreements with the SEC to cooperate in securities investigations, and each willingly cooperated in the 9/11 investigation. According to the SEC, there is generally little trading of U.S. securities overseas, since U.S. securities trade primarily in U.S. markets. Thus, unusual trading in U.S. securities would not have been very hard for foreign regulators to detect. <strong>Each country the SEC contacted conducted an investigation and reported back to the SEC that there was no trading in U.S. securities in their jurisdiction that appeared to have been influenced by foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks.</strong></p>

<p>Could be Jews who knew the attacks were going to happen sat up late in Melbourne and Sydney Australia, on the evening of September 11, to watch the show which began in those cities sometime around 00:02 AEST Sept 12.</p>

<p>Maybe it was common knowledge in some schools, picture teenage entrepreneurs sitting up late stuffing their guts with pizza, watching their investments mature.</p>

<p>It was via the buddy system on Odigo software, which allows one to communicate to a large group of people that share a trait such as the Hebrew language, that thousands of Israelis were warned not to go to the twin towers on 9/11.</p>

<p>The same evidence in concert with the evidence against Australian resident Jews <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?498-911-Australia-TerrorGr%FCppe-Kurzberg-Pizza-Woodledoodledoo&amp;amp;p=1148#post1148">Yaron Shmuel, and Sivan &amp; Paul Kurzberg,</a> who were arrested in New York on 911 filming the attack in their words to &quot;document the event,&quot; will be used to convict them..</p>

<p>The Put Option investors and the Jews who never turned up on the day, the ones who distributed warnings from NY synagogues the Friday before, and the entire political, law enforcement and anti terrorism forces in both countries who spurn the evidence, similarly on capital charges .. anticipate massive execution!

<blockquote>
<p>Take the official toll of around 3,000 dead and divide by the four hundred dead Jews, we arrive at a figure of around one in twelve, while the Jew population of New York is usually stated to be twelve and a half percent or one in eight.</p>

<p>Add the unknown number of Jews with non Jewish names who perished to the list, to bring the number to parity .. however the official death toll of some under 3,000 dead is a gross underestimation.</p>

<p>Peter Jennings in consultation with the NY Port Authority on the late afternoon of the same day, made an estimate of around eighty thousand dead .. dividing his number by four hundred only one in two hundred was a Jew, while and there should have been around 6400 dead Jews.</p>

<p>I will advance the notion that the four hundred Jews who died were Zionists who stayed in the building, who went about <a href="http://i014.radikal.ru/1109/53/9000fd1a5fbe.jpg">throwing ppl out of the windows</a> at Cantor Fitzgerald for instance, who were sold out when <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?6-The-Most-Shameful-Act-on-a-Day-of-Shame!&amp;amp;p=6#post6">NYPD helicopters never showed up!</a></p>

<p>Given estimates are of between 12-18,000 people in the Twin Towers at the time of the attacks, I&#39;m calling total bullshit on that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey counted 14 417 card accesses to the towers on Tuesday, May 8, 2001, between 12:00 am and 8:47 am, the closest date to September 11 for which data were available. USA Today matched floor plans, architectural drawings, and photographs to the accounts of many survivors and estimated that between 12 000 and 16 000 people were in the towers at the time of the first crash. The National Institute of Standards and Technology contacted a stratified random sample of individuals from a list of persons with building access as of September 11 and estimated that 17 400 (95% CI = 16 260, 18 620) were present.</p>
