        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First -  what this theory claims to  accomplish</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolves the ~122 orders of magnitude discrepancy between the cosmological constant (universal density or dark energy) and the Planck quantum vacuum density</li>
<li>Describes the cosmological scale gravitational force as a product of discrete Planck quantities making up the structure of spacetime</li>
<li>Identifies the source of mass for the proton which makes up matter</li>
<li>Resolves the hierarchy problem between the proton mass, the Planck mass, and the gravitational force</li>
<li>Finds the gravitational-to-strong force coupling constant</li>
<li>Identifies the source of energy and mass and the mechanism from which the speed of light is defined in the famous energy mass equivalence equation</li>
<li>Calculates the angular frequency and period of a holographic proton resulting in the interaction time of the strong force</li>
<li>Demonstrates utilizing special relativity that gravity can behave with the range typically associated with the strong force giving the first analytical solution to confinement and unifying gravity with the quantum world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the first four sections of the textbook, for you to tear apart. If you take the time to read this, you will have effectively re-learned physics properly. The whole is in each piece. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the link shows, peer review does not make something instantly credible. A group of like minded people (peers) often base their conclusions on common assumptions which can be wrong.

<p>Peer review is the process of analyzing the data collection and the conclusions drawn from them. Do not chew up and swallow something because it has passed peer review, as the link shows, it is easily manipulated. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the media saying it. The papers usually make it clear what the findings actually are. </p>

<p>But I get what you&#39;re saying: If something is peer reviewed, don&#39;t take it as gospel. Which I don&#39;t do. However, the OP&#39;s linked stuffed isn&#39;t peer reviewed by anyone. So...</p>

<p>He claims the proton contains the mass information for all protons. It is the singularity of space. Each proton derives it&#39;s mass from 1/(number of protons in universe) out of the holographic mass.</p>

<p>This is different from the generalized holographic principle equation he uses to deduces mass, which is very well understood. The above is simply a logical deduction from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Is that your reasoning for dismissal though?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the example of quantum gravity, the simplest you&#39;ll ever see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already present in modern physics, and elaborated upon in the last module, the Holographic Principle is defined as the capacity for information storage on the surface of the event horizon of a black hole, where one “bit” of information is equal to one Planck area, which defines the entropy (heat or temperature) of the black hole.</p>

<p>Haramein generalized this principle by first redefining the Planck area bit (or pixel) as a Planck Spherical Unit (PSU) of volume (a quantum voxel), since it is more plausible that the Universe tiles with spherical units rather than with two-dimensional squares, or with three-dimensional cubes for that matter.  (Pun intended)</p>

<p>He further demonstrates that there is a simple and fundamental relationship between the information content, in terms of PSUs inside the volume of a black hole, and the PSU information on the surface event horizon, giving a ratio that when multiplied by the Planck mass (the energy of that ratio), generates the exact mass-energy of the black hole. The Schwarzschild solution to Einstein’s field equations gives the exact same answer for the mass of a black hole, however, in the case of Haramein’s generalized holographic solution using quantum voxels we have a quantized gravitational solution (in fine-grained or discrete quantities). Since we find the granularity of spacetime to be a Planck, a quantum object, we have quantum gravity as opposed to the smooth surface of Einstein’s curvature. This reconciles quantum mechanics with General Relativity by demonstrating that the source of gravitation, which is currently unknown in standard theory (the curvature of spacetime describes the mechanics but does not identify what spacetime is made of), is the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations of the quantum information network. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The relationship between the information content inside the volume of a black hole and the information on the surface event horizon is considered for the case of the well-known black hole Cygnus X-1.</p>

<p>The quantity of Planck spherical oscillators within the interior volume of the black hole was calculated as</p>

<p>R = Volume of black hole / Volume of PSU = 2.96 x 10<sup>118</sup></p>

<p>These PSUs, or Planck voxels, tile along the spherical surface horizon of the black hole as well, where the ratio of the information bit to the spherical surface is calculated as:</p>

<p>n = A / A (lc) = 3.83 x 10<sup>79</sup></p>

<p>where A is the spherical surface horizon of the black hole and Alc is the area of the PSU equatorial disc. Therefore, now we have found the number of Planck Spherical Units in the volume and on the surface η (eta) of the black hole.</p>

<p>In these calculations the radius of the black hole was taken as r=25km. The resulting value for the holographic mass is then,</p>

<p>mh = R/n (ml) = 1.68 x 10<sup>34</sup> g</p>

<p>where ml is the Planck mass which is multiplied by the volume-to-surface ratio η/R to get the mass of the black hole, which is exactly equal to the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein’s field equation for a black hole of this particular size.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the most recent observational mass determination for Cygnus X-1 is 2.95 x 10<sup>34</sup> g with a corresponding Schwarzschild radius of r=43km.1 Of course, the holographic solution generates the correct answer as well, as it is equivalent to the Schwarzschild solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can also be done at the hadron scale to deduce a holographic mass of the proton and a rest mass when distributed to all protons. </p>

<p><strong>Hadron/Proton</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to achieve a quantum scale solution for gravity, Haramein eventually realized that the volume-to-surface ratio of “Plancks” (as we might call the Planck Spherical Units) in his holographic cosmological (large scale) gravitational solution (which we covered in the previous topic) must be inverted at the quantum scale, so that the surface information content is divided by the amount of Planck information within the volume (in terms of PSUs) to define the standard mass of the proton. The result in his first order approximation is extremely compelling. Indeed, the surface-to-volume Planck ratio, when multiplied by the Planck mass to get the energy of the ratio, generates a mass for the proton:</p>

<p>2 n/R m(l) = 1.603498 x 10<sup>-24</sup> g - the proven standard mass</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Where is that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s really fishy that he changes the equation between calculations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% explained.</p>

<p>“Let’s restate these calculations in simple terms: when calculating the gravity of a cosmological black hole, <strong>we take its total volume of mass-energy and divide that by its surface (charge radius or event horizon), which tells us how much of an effect the inside information of the object (a relative amount) has on the outside spacetime (the rest of the universe), which is defined as its gravity.</strong></p>

<p>When calculating the gravity (or mass) of a proton,<strong>we invert this and take the outside information on the surface that we perceive (the relative amount), and divide it into the inside volume (the universal or holographic amount). The proton has the special property of having an internal vacuum fluctuation mass-energy equal to the mass of the visible Universe, therefore we’re taking our perceived view of a single instance of a proton by the size of its charge radius in Plancks, and dividing it into the internal volume in Plancks (or Universal mass-energy) in order to understand its individual mass-energy or gravity in relationship to all other protons in the universe.</strong>”</p>

<p>This is the half-assed critiques of his theory that don&#39;t even begin to evaluate it within his framework (<strong>A HOLOGRAPHIC ENCODING OF INFORMATION</strong>).</p>

<p>Not sure why you&#39;re pulling the victimization card here, seeing that I&#39;ve found <em>several</em> long threads in the last month where someone addresses you head on for quite a while (u/stembruh, u/mofo69extreme, u/mahatmagandalf, u/bobathon, others.)</p>

<p>In several of these threads, they engage you, meaningfully, and ask for <em>very specific</em> formulas/questions/etc, and in almost every single one you don&#39;t address them.</p>

<p>Now I know you&#39;re thinking that they&#39;re doing the same exact thing, but truly honestly, they are not dodging your questions in the same way you are theirs. People who read these threads see two people arguing -- one person trying to discuss claims one point at a time, trying to narrow the focus to one formula/graph and keep the conversation on that, and another who is just throwing copy/pasted terms and links to graphs, and dodging very direct remarks.</p>

<p>Now there is definitely a group-think factor when it comes to downvotes -- especially when going against the majority opinion -- and while many downvotes can be attributed to that, a solid many other are because you are not a persuasive debater, unnecessarily hostile, fervently dogmatic, and do not engage others in a meaningful way (i.e. walls of copied text with obnoxious bolding in response to a simple question addressing a very particular point.)</p>

<p>Now, like others before me have brought up, you clearly have a deep intellectual curiosity which is fantastic. I highly encourage you to continue the pursuit of education, probably physics, and really get into the game (wouldn&#39;t be awesome to link to <em>your</em> published paper in response to critique?) instead of aggressively confronting strangers on the internet.</p>

<p>1) One of the main tenants of the theory is that it modifies Einsteins field equations to incorporate torsion. This obviously does not sit well with many people, however it is from this modification that the rest of the theory arises.</p>

<p>The problem with that is that many of the aspects of the theory are evaluated against the <em>current</em> framework, without the change. This makes it impossible to defend, because the model in which it is written for is not included.</p>

<p>This also happens with the holographic theory itself, e.g. the criticisms concering how massive the Schwartzchild mass is itself (this is <em>not</em> the rest mass of the proton, this is the holographic mass) and again, the holographic theory is not integrated when the theory is being evaluated.</p>

<p>This is much like looking at observational data of black holes, saying they cannot exist, while ignoring the mathematics that could describe such an event.</p>

<p>However i agree, I do not have all the answers.</p>

<p>What I do <em>know</em> and why I am aggressively defending the theory - is that it <em>does</em> show many astounding results and conclusions, and does so with mathematical proof, that is dismissed due to anyone finding any little hole they can use to dismiss the entire thing (when I can&#39;t accurately defend it)</p>

<p>From the texts I&#39;ve listed comes every single claim in the OP. They are all very straightforward, and all major current physics problems. </p>

<p>I just wish it was evaluated with an open-mind framework, but it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>It makes it all or nothing against me, a layman, and so as soon as it gets a bit in depth, the theory is dismissed instead of me and my lack of deep understanding. </p>

<p>However, if you check the current <a href="/r/askphysics">/r/askphysics</a> thread here <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/2m4xsa/so_theres_a_unification_textbook_floating_around/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/2m4xsa/so_theres_a_unification_textbook_floating_around/</a> - after I am much more capable of understanding and defending the theory, it is clear that it is absolutely not easily dismissible in any aspect - and yet the hivemind prevails, downvoting fact and upvoting wrong assumption. I don&#39;t implicate a conspiracy, I implicate group-think.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you (and everyone reading this) looks into it for themselves, much like we don&#39;t trust most PHD architects on WTC7 even though <strong>they have an official scientific explanation that 90% of scientists accept</strong> we <strong>know</strong> it is a physical impossibility as it is described.</p>

<p>However it&#39;s not my wish to debate the merits of this theory, instead I just really want to urge you to continue your education. You&#39;re passionate about physics, have self-taught yourself thus far, and would make a fantastic teacher if you could impart any of that enthusiasm unto your students.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about your life situation, and I know there&#39;s different barriers for different people, but I do know that there are a million reasons not do something, and only a few good reasons to do it. Your enthusiasm and passion are one of those few good reasons, and it would be a shame for it to be wasted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already present in modern physics, and elaborated upon in the last module, the Holographic Principle is defined as the capacity for information storage on the surface of the event horizon of a black hole, where one “bit” of information is equal to one Planck area, which defines the entropy (heat or temperature) of the black hole.</p>

<p>Haramein generalized this principle by first redefining the Planck area bit (or pixel) as a Planck Spherical Unit (PSU) of volume (a quantum voxel), since it is more plausible that the Universe tiles with spherical units rather than with two-dimensional squares, or with three-dimensional cubes for that matter.  (Pun intended)</p>

<p>He further demonstrates that there is a simple and fundamental relationship between the information content, in terms of PSUs inside the volume of a black hole, and the PSU information on the surface event horizon, giving a ratio that when multiplied by the Planck mass (the energy of that ratio), generates the exact mass-energy of the black hole. The Schwarzschild solution to Einstein’s field equations gives the exact same answer for the mass of a black hole, however, in the case of Haramein’s generalized holographic solution using quantum voxels we have a quantized gravitational solution (in fine-grained or discrete quantities). Since we find the granularity of spacetime to be a Planck, a quantum object, we have quantum gravity as opposed to the smooth surface of Einstein’s curvature. This reconciles quantum mechanics with General Relativity by demonstrating that the source of gravitation, which is currently unknown in standard theory (the curvature of spacetime describes the mechanics but does not identify what spacetime is made of), is the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations of the quantum information network. </p>

<p>Also his idea of protons having inner black holes solves nothing and just is a further complication that isn&#39;t supported at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, I shouldn&#39;t even bother debating you if you don&#39;t understand the implications of ridding the strong force to replace it with space-curvature. This is the holy grail of physics my friend</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Ouch they really tear you apart there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s really fishy that he changes the equation between calculations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% explained.</p>

<p>“Let’s restate these calculations in simple terms: when calculating the gravity of a cosmological black hole, <strong>we take its total volume of mass-energy and divide that by its surface (charge radius or event horizon), which tells us how much of an effect the inside information of the object (a relative amount) has on the outside spacetime (the rest of the universe), which is defined as its gravity.</strong></p>

<p>When calculating the gravity (or mass) of a proton,<strong>we invert this and take the outside information on the surface that we perceive (the relative amount), and divide it into the inside volume (the universal or holographic amount). The proton has the special property of having an internal vacuum fluctuation mass-energy equal to the mass of the visible Universe, therefore we’re taking our perceived view of a single instance of a proton by the size of its charge radius in Plancks, and dividing it into the internal volume in Plancks (or Universal mass-energy) in order to understand its individual mass-energy or gravity in relationship to all other protons in the universe.</strong>”</p>

<p>This is the half-assed critiques of his theory that don&#39;t even begin to evaluate it within his framework (<strong>A HOLOGRAPHIC ENCODING OF INFORMATION</strong>).</p>

<p>However, if you check the current <a href="/r/askphysics">/r/askphysics</a> thread here <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/2m4xsa/so_theres_a_unification_textbook_floating_around/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/2m4xsa/so_theres_a_unification_textbook_floating_around/</a> - after I am much more capable of understanding and defending the theory, it is clear that it is absolutely not easily dismissible in any aspect - and yet the hivemind prevails, downvoting fact and upvoting wrong assumption. I don&#39;t implicate a conspiracy, I implicate group-think.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you (and everyone reading this) looks into it for themselves, much like we don&#39;t trust most PHD architects on WTC7 even though <strong>they have an official scientific explanation that 90% of scientists accept</strong> we <strong>know</strong> it is a physical impossibility as it is described.</p>
