    <div class="md"><p>No way a 120 pound autistic kid can carry those weapons with body armor through a window he shot and leave glass untouched on the top and bottom of where he supposedly went into the school. He had a 99.9 percent hit rate. The best US military doesn&#39;t even have that. The set up memorials a few days before, the superbowl, the guy I think his name is gene roseman. The guy who kept changing his story with the kids on his lawn. How the car lanza drove was owned by someone else who was a pedophile. How the helicopter showing the kids walking back and forth in the school. The kids being interviewed in the hallway saying it wasn&#39;t a police man or a fire man or animal control gun. No way that kid was thinking of that in his head when that was happening. The &quot;I heard it was fake&quot; part on the 911 tape. I know you said tldr eli5 but you can&#39;t with sandy hook. There are tons more bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jokes on people who use ad hominem and not attack my argument. Ad hominems are one of the most abused fallacies. Whenever people can&#39;t attack your argument thatd what they go to, character attacks. My beliefs have nothing to do with what I think about government or conspiracy. I personally just want to be left alone and not be bothered. I&#39;m not a bad person. I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone. I just want to be left alone and live in peace. I&#39;m not a weak bad human.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, you can thank public schooling for the current state of consciousness.  Remove the arts and music programs and you destroy the ability of self discovery.  Remove the acts of literary (speaking and writing) and replace them with endless worksheets and you destroy the imagination.  This is the most crucial part, once the imagination is destroyed people then lack the capacity to envision a conspiracy or a better future.  Unable to imagine they walk around confused, eager to take on the next simple pleasure to distract them from the mental weight of actual thought.  I often think about the people I converse with at the gym, they&#39;re fucked.  Their world perception matches a Fox News narrative and they can&#39;t imagine a reality different from the one O&#39;reilly and Hannity portray for them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just telling my 14 y/o step sister this same thing yesterday.
I was going off about the government and she said, &quot;You sound just like your dad!&quot; (Which I&#39;m very glad my dad is a free thinker too) 
But I said the only reason you say that is because we question things and don&#39;t take everything at face value like you, and we&#39;ve got our minds on what matters and not pop culture/drama tv. 
I&#39;m 20 years old and I think if anything is going to change in this world it&#39;s going to be up to my generation and older generations because the government finally has control over the education system to breed millions that can&#39;t think for themselves.

<p>But overall this is nothing new. For fuck&#39;s sake just 40 years ago it was revealed that the FBI was involved in spying, harassement and assassinations. Now go ask the average American what the fuck is COINTELPRO ?! </p>

<p>No one cares OP. Everyone is too busy in the rat-race. False dictonomies; takers versus makers, democrats versus republicans, are all that matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly well said, and I&#39;ll just add that this is nothing new for human beings in general.  A study of history reveals that very rarely if ever are revolutions (especially popular revolutions) completely or even mostly ideological.  Almost always they spring from long term abuses by the upper classes upon a lower class, and this lower class having very little for themselves (serfs etc)....and then things need to be getting worse for them.  Only then do they rise up, and often the bulk of them do it to improve their desperate lots in life, only to take up lofty ideals later in the struggle.  Most people who are interested in revolutions have known this for a while, which is part of the reason why Lenin and others advocated for a &quot;vanguard&quot; of intellectuals to stimulate revolution (which also often happens to be the case in history, the leaders of the proles are often middle or upper already).</p>

<p>So the average American might care about the NSA and Snowden, but not enough to lose the house, the job, the car, the food, the ability to feed their daughter and son etc.  Only when this is already gone or going fast can we expect to see a general majority &quot;care&quot; and start to support activity to bring this sort of thing (NSA etc) to an end.  Unfortunately those in power know this all too well (they&#39;ve been studying the same stuff and learning the opposite lesson: how to keep their wealth and power in tact) and are attempting to ward this off...not by refraining from taking all of our productivity, their greed (their weakness) would never allow for that, so we will lose the car, the house, the family etc, but over a LONG period of time and with what many others in this thread have mentioned already (schools, tv, propaganda, rat race, military police, disarmament of pop, mass distraction, etc) making sure each new generation is willing to accept the new horrors put upon them by this small ruling elite.  Those who control the future control the past, and they can re-write it and teach it how they want etc. </p>

<p>However this is a spot of hope in this seemingly hopeless situation (well probably a lot more than one) that is the internet! Or rather the ability to spread information quickly, which not only partially neutralizes the need for the &quot;vanguard&quot; or upper class leaders, but also at the same time perhaps allows a class consciousness to build fast enough NOT to need to hit almost rock bottom before we rise up and &quot;care&quot;.  Of course they&#39;ve know this for a long time too, hence the NSA and everything they do.  Its a race, for the future of the human race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Revolutions&quot; aren&#39;t by the people, for the people, they are led by interests who are against the people. The French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, both were engineered by secret forces that wanted to tear apart functioning society and create a new order out of the chaos they manufactured. There are no popular revolutions, only astroturf movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not without some merit, but of course the reality of the situation is far more complicated than that.  In both cases (and remember I was talking about all revolutions, not just those two, but we can limit it if that makes it easier for you) the circumstances I mentioned were met, and the revolutions started at the bottom (with help from some factions of the middle and top).  There had been dissident movements and revolutionary in both countries for centuries, who were generally upper/middle class.  However they were able to do practically NOTHING for hundreds of years because the situation was not ripe, and the masses had not reached a breaking point (and a lot of other reasons).  However once that class consciousness/horrible conditions criteria were met and those on the bottom began to rise of course revolutionary in both places participated, enticed, and took as much advantage as possible of the situation to push their own agendas (as did other governments, I mean Germany put Lenin on a train BACK to Russia just to take them out of the war, it would have been a VERY different revolution had that little event not happened and history in general is filled with little-big events like that).  The ones that won out in both circumstances happened by chance (as it often does) to not be in the majorities interests, but MORE so than the previous regimes. </p>

<p>No event called be called just one thing or another without massive oversimplification, so yes revolutions are not by and large always FOR the people (for various reasons, mostly hijacking by elite interests etc.) but they generally are BY the people.  The revolutions you mentioned were not just some astroturf in a smoke filled room nonsense, but rather incredibly complex series of events that some factions took better advantage of than others. </p>

<p>Get fucked. Everyone has a brain, you choose to believe and do with it as you please. The people like us (not bragging) have had the courage, either through adversity or the blatant hypocrisy and wrongdoing, to rethink what we&#39;ve been taught. </p>

<p>The majority of people don&#39;t have the emotional capacity and empathy to really care. Along with the required mental courage to challenge their beliefs, they <em>choose</em> to live in their lala utopia where the government farts rainbows and shits sunshine- because its easier to do so because you&#39;ll go with the crowd.</p>

All I can do is spread the truth online and to my friends as much as I can, and even that is limited because most people don&#39;t want to hear the truth, most people are stuck with a particular point of view they&#39;ve been indoctrinated into and they absolutely refuse to get past it, or care at all. I blame THEM because it&#39;s really THEIR fault that I have to pay taxes to fund wars for Israel. If it weren&#39;t for THEIR stupidity, no one would pay taxes and the government couldn&#39;t put us all in jail.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, what a completely ignorant comment.  &quot;People&quot; tend to only be retards when they are denied basic human rights (education, food etc) and poisoned from day 1.  Malnutrition in the womb and during the developmental years alone can reduce IQ massively, and that&#39;s not even counting the horrid factory &quot;food&quot; and fluoride etc etc.  Pile onto that a school system built to turn out brain-dead factory workers and a media system built to maintain the same, and you&#39;ve got your &quot;retards&quot;.  O and where are the parents in all this?  Guess what the parents 99% of the time are just as bad, as they were brainwashed in the same system because this class war started a LONG time ago.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree it is frustrating dealing with these people daily, but they must be dealt with because ultimately they are the majority, and therefor pretty much the only hope when it comes to overthrowing the power elite responsible for perpetrating this and many other crimes upon them and others all over the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a problem that people don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>I have a lot of issues with the Limited Hangout theory, but forgetting that debate for a minute, what is the end result of the acceptance of the theory? Let&#39;s look at the big picture, Snowden&#39;s cult hero status encourages other people to become whistleblowers. If he is transformed from a martyr to a traitor even in the eyes of the people who he vindicated.. us... Who will be willing to walk that path again?</p>

<p>In the wake of the Snowden leaks exposing what was once considered the paranoid ramblings of madmen, as truth, there has been a huge cultural shift. Even the 9/11 truth movement has enjoyed a resurgence, as more and more people question the actions and motivations of the US government. Maybe a shocking amount of people <em>are</em> willing to accept mass surveillance, maybe Snowden <em>is</em> a LH and made a fool of Putin too, and he&#39;s exaggerating the NSA&#39;s capabilities to maximize the &quot;chilling effect.&quot; Maybe that&#39;s true but I see the positive effects on discourse still outweighing the negative. The dissent has gotten louder, not quieter, as a result of the leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass surveillance is discussed in public forums such as TED, DragonCon, ACLU , and not exclusive to the conspiracy community, as it was prior to the leaks. </p>

<p>Limited Hangout ? No one can know for sure. Is Putin part of the shadow government ? First we need definite proof there is such a government !!!</p>

<p>So instead of making wild claims which you simply cannot prove, let&#39;s just concentrate on the facts at hand; the rabbit is out of the hat !!! Mass surveillance is now a <strong>conspiracy fact</strong>. And even if the public doesn&#39;t seem to care (much like no one cares about COINTELPRO, MK-ULTRA, and the number of <strong>proven</strong> false flags throughout history), that is completely a different subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mate, people are intrinsically selfish. Its what we do best. Its human nature. We are selfish too, but we choose to empathize.</p>

<p>Selfishness v Selflessness is what more or less what defines bad vs. good on a broader scale.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t have time to unplug from their lives and lend some time and thought to the pain and suffering being caused in the world.</p>

<p>If they can&#39;t be bothered to empathize and <em>feel</em> what&#39;s wrong, I can&#39;t be bothered to give a fuck about them.</p>

<p><a href="/u/tripsick">/u/tripsick</a> is right, they have a defeatist mentality, &#39;Oh, but I don&#39;t do anything wrong, I&#39;m totally cool with the government reaching into my private life&#39;. </p>

<p>Submissive and docile creatures. By defnintion they should be eaten by prey and shit back out. Its nature&#39;s laws bro. You keep the strong you dispose of the weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also the reason I&#39;m not going to stop paying taxes. All that would happen is I&#39;d get thrown in jail and fucked in the ass. Literally. No one would care. No one would understand. It wouldn&#39;t change a thing. All I can do is spread the truth online and to my friends as much as I can, and even that is limited because most people don&#39;t want to hear the truth, most people are stuck with a particular point of view they&#39;ve been indoctrinated into and they absolutely refuse to get past it, or care at all. I blame THEM because it&#39;s really THEIR fault that I have to pay taxes to fund wars for Israel. If it weren&#39;t for THEIR stupidity, no one would pay taxes and the government couldn&#39;t put us all in jail. But they ARE stupid, they ARE willfully ignorant, and they ALLOW the world to be the way it is.</p>
