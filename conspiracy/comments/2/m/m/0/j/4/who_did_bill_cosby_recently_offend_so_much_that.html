       Hannibal Burress, a comedian, went off about it in a set of his weeks ago. The fact the people think this is a Ferguson Psyop is fucking ridiculous and so detached from reality its astonishing. Conspiracies exist but not every single thing under the sun is a conspiracy. A lot of people like to act as though they're free-thinkers and skeptics on this sub, but rarely take the time to examine their own beliefs; I've seen so many examples of people leading themselves to their own conclusions because it fits their frame of reference that its exhausting. Do some fucking homework.

       It's not a theory that the weather underground was infiltrated by Larry Grathwohl.  During his time undercover they told him in meetings that they wanted a race war.  They wanted to take over America and sell parts of it to other countries like China.  Bill Ayers was one of those people in the weather underground.  The people in charge today have connections with Bill Ayers.  And the policies they create and the tone of race baiting in the media, knowing the media is tilted toward the socialists agenda (which is what the weather underground wanted also), and selling off America to other countries - IE Globalization - India, China, etc... allowing mexico free rein and open borders.  Watching them say they want a one world government and new world order.  It's hard not to think there is a real threat and coup taking place by these same people who share the same ideology.

       An interesting theory I never considered (i.e. selling off parts of America). It would fit in with the idea of Israel becoming the centerpiece of the New World Order, what with the government persecuting non-Jews and deporting Africans. One day the facts will set in and people will call for the Knesset to be destroyed like they called for the heads of the Nazis.

       There is no way those people came to power.  They might have come in contact with some other group that used their ideas and absorbed them, but most of the heads are all in jail and were rounded up, and there were no more than 300 of them it looks like.  Something is happening, someone in power took their ideals and are using them for their own.  And they can easily be used as a scape goat if things go awry.

       In 1985, former Weather Underground members Susan Rosenberg (who also was implicated in the Nyack robbery) and Linda Evans were apprehended while transporting 740 pounds of explosives which they both acknowledged were slated for use in additional bombings. Rosenberg was sentenced to 58 years in prison, Evans 40;

       This isn't true.  Something like "global socialism", a "one world utopia" (controlled by them, of course) is the end goal of the NWO (or whatever you want to call it).

       Globalization is a capitalist, free market thing. It honestly is. "New World Order" was a phrase coined by George Bush senior. What he meant was that the commies had lost, and neo-liberal capitalism had triumphed.

       That's false, the term was in use long before Bush uttered it.  Look no further than one H.G. Wells, renowned author, member of the Cecil Rhodes Round Table Society, and head of British intelligence during WWII (somewhat little known fact).  He literally wrote a book called
       <em>
        The New World Order
       </em>
       in 1940, along with a bunch of others that either explicitly or implicitly dealt with the exact same subject such as
       <em>
        The Open Conspiracy: Blueprints for a World Revolution
       </em>
       and
       <em>

       Your mistake is in not realizing that these are just two sides of the same coin, ultimately created, co-opted, and/or controlled by the same group of people.

       I think you're getting confused here. I can't think what H.G. Wells would have in common with Cecil Rhodes, who died in 1902. Wells was a socialist and did write a book called the New World Order, but that's not to be confused with the "New World Order" proposed by Bush. They are two different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism and socialism are two different, opposed ideas: One says that property should be privately owned and operated for profit, and the other says that property should be owned by workers and operated on the basis of need. Completely different ideas.

       They actually aren't at all - have you read the book?  The idea is a One World "socialist" government controlled by a "ruling elite".  The real life applications of these ideologies are nothing like the textbook definitions of the words.  I'm sure you're aware that what we have in America currently is neither capitalism nor democracy - this is what I'm getting at.

      <p>
       I'm aware that, in theory, they're two different ideas.  But, in practice, both are just ideologies used as tools by the same elite.  It's the hegelian idea of thesis + antithesis = synthesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is the thesis, socialism/communism are the antitheses.  Look at what's actually happening and has happened in the real world instead of at the textbook definitions.

       Citation? Don't see his name mentioned in the Wikipedia article. Why would H.G. Wells, of all people, want to get involved in some sort of imperialist organisation? H.G. Wells didn't like imperialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall my definition of capitalism- Private ownership of means of production, operated for profit. Indeed this is what you do have in America, more or less. A mixed market economy, like almost everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what we have now is a dialectic synthesis of capitalism and communism (which it isn't), then presumably, from this new thesis, an antithesis will arise? Because that's how the dialectic works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for this theory, what we have now is not a dialectical synthesis of capitalism and communism, but simply neoliberal capitalism, with mixed market economies. That's the model that has triumphed almost everywhere. Don't confuse that with whatever H.G. Wells was talking about in 1940.

       Are you serious?  If it isn't on wikipedia it doesn't exist?  Literally 10 seconds on google would have confirmed the historical fact that he was a member of the Cecil Rhodes society.  Go ahead, try it.

       I think you're misinformed about our friend H.G.  Like I said, he was the head of British intelligence during WWII and was a clear proponent of the NWO.  Just read a couple of those books I mentioned before yourself, you'll see the entire agenda for the future outlined as he saw it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in his first will he literally wrote of the desire to fund a secret society aimed at bringing about: "...the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise... and the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire."
      </p>
      <p>
       He also described one world government as "manifestly the only possible solution of the human problem."

      <p>
       It's that "more or less" qualification that you're glazing over but which really makes all the difference.  The collusion between corporate/state/banking power that we see in America, as well as all of the foreign influence we're subjected to, is nothing even remotely resembling the textbook definition capitalism.  But again, this is still just a label which isn't what we should be concerned about.  Bickering over definitions doesn't change the reality we find ourselves in.

       You're so caught up on these word constructions and ideologies that you're ignoring the obvious staring you in the face which is that, quite simply, there is a self-proclaimed "elite" and then there is the rest of us.  There are enslavers and the enslaved and they've been pushing their agenda forward for the last 300+ years (at minimum).  It isn't really much more complicated than that and the "left" and "right" are simply tools.

       I did Google it. The only reference to H.G. Wells and Cecil Rhodes was some Google books result where Wells is quoted as saying that he never met him.
      </p>
      <p>
       H.G. Wells was never "the head of British intelligence". H.G. Wells was a novelist, and also an outspoken socialist. The British intelligence service does not recruit outspoken socialists, not now and not then. Mi5 and 6 have had lots of director generals, but H.G. Wells was not one of them. 
The head of Mi6 during the war was Stewart Menzies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read H.G. Wells. "A Modern Utopia" and so on. Wells was a socialist. Not an imperialist or a conservative. That quote that you've written comes from
       <strong>
        Cecil Rhodes
       </strong>
       , who died in 1902.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, H.G. Wells didn't like imperialism. You're confusing him with Cecil Rhodes. Wells did, however, believe in a world government, a very common belief among socialists in the early part of the 20th century. You're confusing two completely different people, one of whom was an imperialist, and the other of whom was a socialist.

      <p>
       Do we have private ownership of means of production and production for profit or not? Yes, we do. Therefore it resembles the textbook definition pretty closely.

      <p>
       Yes. And in America and the West, that self-proclaimed elite is capitalistic and not socialistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Left" and "right" have meanings. I can't agree that they simply don't mean anything. The basic idea of the left is equality, and the basic idea of the right is hierarchy.

       I typed up a whole long response but then I realized that we're just going to keep going back and forth all day and that arguing won't get us anywhere.  I think we agree on the main points, which are that a globalist ruling elite uses these ideologies as a means to keep us divided and controlled.

       But you are right, I did misspeak when I said that quote was from Wells rather than Rhodes.  The point still stands though (if it can be shown that Wells was a member of the Rhodes Society).

       So you're saying that you don't believe that HG Wells was a Fabian?  It's a fact that he was and Cecil Rhodes, of course, was one of the main people responsible for the group's foundation (if not
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       main person)...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only question is whether he, Wells, broke off from the group or not later in life.

       I'm not trying to be a douche either, my apologies if I came off as such earlier.

       Imagine a line. Imagine Cecil Rhodes at one end of it, and Wells and the Fabians at the other. That's how different they are.

       I disagree.  I've read numerous sources showing the many links between the Rhodes and Fabian Societies, both of which were/are thinly veiled covers for a British "elite" intent on global control.

       I glanced at that article and I immediately saw that it was nonsense, and from a rubbishy source.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, you've got Rhodes (who died in 1902, remember), and his Round Table council. Imperialist, capitalist businessmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other, Wells and the Fabians. Socialists, writers, political figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rhodes: Let's have a world dominated by the British Empire and capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wells: Let's have a world dominated by a socialist system and internationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how you can say these huge differences don't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk about enslavers and enslaved, I'd put Rhodes in one camp and Wells in the other.

       The point I've been trying to make is that it doesn't matter what terminology is used: liberal, communist, socialist, capitalist, etc.  The terms themselves
       <em>
        do not matter

       when talking about the NWO.  What matters is the actions taken in their name and the end goal which, in all cases, is a one world government controlled by a small "ruling elite".

       As to the sources, I don't know. But I do know that this association of Cecil Rhodes and H.G. Wells is rubbish. Honestly, I'm wouldn't lie or conceal the truth about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one man (Rhodes) is a capitalist businessman, and imperialist, and the other (Wells) is a socialist internationalist, who is opposed to capitalist business and imperialism, how can you say that that difference doesn't matter? The two ideas are opposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did read Well's "A Modern Utopia", from about 1905, and there are lots of daft ideas in it, such as that recidivists and chronic drunks and gamblers should be put on an island. George Orwell critiques some of Well's more dated ideas in The Road To Wigan Pier and elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that has got nothing to do with the Bush "New World Order", which meant that Russia had lost and American capitalism had won. H.G. Wells was a novelist.

       I'm saying that, in

This is the same mistake people make today when they talk about US democrats and republicans being opposed without realizing that they're both working for the same people and pushing the same (ultimate) agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       When socialism and capitalism are both tools used by the same group of "elites", and when the definition of the terms in no way match the reality of how they're being implemented, and when both ideologies are leading to a one world government ruled by the few, then the labels themselves become mostly meaningless - which has been my point all along.

       a part of the British elite. He was a novelist who happened to be a socialist. If you think the British elite is tolerant of avowed socialists, especially ones from ordinary middle class backgrounds like Wells, then you don't know much about it. He was looked down upon by the British establishment for his progressive ideas and for not having gone to a public school. He was not a politician and had not much power. He was just a man who wrote books, some of them good and some of them silly.

       He was a Fabian.  They are an "elite" society through and through and they always have been.

       He was also close personal friends with
       <em>
        numerous

       "movers and shakers" and members of the British establishment.  I don't know where you're getting his being an outsider from.

      <p>
       And my point is that the people who rule the world (or who desire to) don't really care about names or ideologies outside of how they can be used as tools.  An example of this, again, are the Fabians.  Apparently a "socialist" society but if you look at some of their members and what they've been involved in historically, it's pretty clear that this is simply a group of "elites" working towards a one world government.  The term "socialist", in this case, is at best misleading and at worst meaningless.  We all get so focused on the terms that we ignore what's being done in their name and whether or not these things are consistent with the definitions of the terms.  They quite often aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one I think.  Just keep in mind that any word that ends in "-ism" is a dogmatic ideology and almost every one of them was either directly created and/or later co-opted by the globalists I'm talking about.

       The Fabian society was just a British socialist organization that set up the Labour Party. There is nothing more sinister about them than that. And H.G. Wells was just a novelist, who, as a prominent socialist, was involved with the Fabians, but not very. As socialists, they were quite clearly, at the time, enemies of the British establishment, as much as the British establishment is not socialistic, either now or then.

       I'm sorry but this just isn't true.  Seriously, just look at who some members of the Fabian Society have been historically.  These people, many of them,
       <em>

       </em>
       the British establishment.

       Yes, definitely.  I'm of the opinion that the world could do without "-isms" in general.  People should think for themselves and form their own opinions instead of adopting those dreamt up by others.

       I agree that the Fabian Society and the Labour Party are the British establishment
       <em>
        now

       It's well known that certain sections of the left, as well as the right, 100 years ago, were in favour of eugenics. I just don't know what bearing that has on the modern world, at all. There are very few people, if any, on the modern left who are in favour of eugenics. On the modern right, on the other hand, it's a different story, as you can see by how popular the idea is on Reddit.

       We'll agree to disagree on the aims and goals of the Fabian Society as I think they were very "elite-centric" and driven from the start and up to the present day based on everything I've seen over the last few years.  You've reached a different conclusion after doing your own research and that's fine.

       As for the last part, I'd tell that person that if they truly investigated it on their own and are comfortable with that decision then more power to them.  I just hate the labels themselves because, again, more often than not these ideologies aren't anything like their definitions in practice.  But I can understand how they simplify discussing them and also how they
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       work in theory if implemented properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a "socialist"-type society
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       work, I just don't think it would have a chance to succeed in the current power structure this planet finds itself in where everyone is a slave to debt and the people who own the money.

       Well I agree with you there. But the big disagreement I think we have is that I think ideas exist independently of how they're misused by elites. "Socialism, capitalism, left, right"
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other guy I was talking to on here told me that the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Tariff agreement, and American jobs being shipped overseas because corporations can employ labour cheaper in China, is because of "socialism", and the very best people to solve this problem are Ron Paul and his son.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a very good example of the kind of thinking that happens when you just don't care what the terms "socialism" and "capitalism" mean. Believe it or not, the system we have now is called neoliberal capitalism.

       You're right.  I try to focus, though, on actions instead of words.  By that I mean when someone claims to be promoting socialism, I look at what they're actually
       <em>
        doing
       </em>
       rather than at what they
       <em>
        would be doing
       </em>
       if it were true socialism.  People say Obamacare is socialist and I just have to lol and tell them to look at what it
       <em>
        actually is
       </em>
       as opposed to what it's
       <em>
        claimed to be
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The current power structure in most of the world is elite vs. the rest of us.  That's it.  Throw out all of the word constructions, all of the definitions, and look at what's actually happening.  All of the religions and -isms are used as much as possible by these people as tools to further this "us vs. them" paradigm, to keep us all divided and fighting amongst ourselves, to keep us distracted, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I mean when I say the words themselves don't matter.  It isn't that they literally don't matter, or that they literally have no meaning, it's that they don't matter in the context of discussing the "elite" and the ways we're all being fucked over by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, Bolshevism was funded almost completely by Wall Street and its allies.  It was a sinister parody of Communism, so to study
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       communism is meaningless here if you want to understand what really happened - and it would likely only confuse you more.  I hope this makes sense.

       Not when you think of the bigger picture.  I'm talking about socialism for the entire world.  That's what globalization is pushing for.  A centralized one world socialist government.  Ayers would be all for it.  Number one because it destroys capitalist countries like America.  Globalization is ruining America as we speak.  Getting slave labor from China and India to do all the work while people in America lose their jobs and are forced to take minimum wage jobs just to have food to eat.  Watch the video where Larry talks about their true agenda and what they wish to do to America.  They weren't just 'protesting the war'.  They were terrorists plotting a coup against the USA and Bill Clinton pardoned this Ayers.  That should make it pretty clear what their intentions are.  That and this video of Hillarys speach supporting a one world government group WFA.

       It's not capitalism.  It's a precursor to socialization.  Centralized markets, centralized money system, centralized government.

       Karl Marx in his own words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up the old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense, gentlemen, that I vote in favour of free trade.''

       These socialist traitors have taken over in many areas of America including media, corporations and even the white house.  But their time will be limited as people begin to really feel the effects of their actions and take steps to right all their wrongs.  Point being - democrats are on their way out.  Republicans are bad too but at least libertarians on the republican ticket like Ron Paul and Rand Paul are stepping in to make a difference.

       I really don't understand why you think socialism has got anything to do with this. Everything you've described is part of capitalism. That's how it works. It's even called the North American
       <em>
        Free Trade
       </em>
       Agreement. Free Trade, markets, ie, capitalism, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is an effort to reduce tariffs, which is also a free market idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalisation is capitalism. That's how it works. There is supposed to be free movement of goods and services and labour under capitalism, and it's supposed to expand all over the world. It's called "a free market". That's why American jobs are going to China, because the American capitalists can employ people there more cheaply, and thus make more profit. It has got absolutely nothing to do with socialism.

       So you are denying the Clintons are socialists and have an agenda for a one world government.  I did supply links that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are.  Globalization is not capitalism.  It is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism">

       or better yet a form of

        Corporatism

       .  The system is being cheated to destroy it from within and blame capitalism.  And the only people who buy into it are uniformed people like yourself.  I informed you and you still don't get it.  I'm guessing you just refuse to watch the videos with an open mind and real understanding of what is being said.  They are socialist with an agenda to destroy America and that is what their globalization agenda is doing and it's getting them one step closer to their
       <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/hillary_cronkite_nwo.htm">
        one world government plans

       .  It's no theory.  It's a fact.  Either understand it is happening or play along with their lies.  Like Gruber said the only way to pass the laws is to lie to the 'the stupid American voters'.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is what they are interested in.  Assimilation.  For their One World Government.  One economy, one currency, one court system, one world government.  If you say it doesn't exist why is there a video of Hillary talking about it, promoting it? The video exists yes?  Why is there an award for people who promote it?

       I am denying the Clintons are socialists, yes. Because they aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe there is any difference between "crony capitalism" and "capitalism". "Crony capitalism"
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       capitalism. There has never existed any other kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't say capitalism is synonymous with globalization, I say it's globalization is
       <em>
        part of
       </em>
       capitalism, which your link confirms. It has got absolutely nothing to do with socialism. The unified world system that the various business elites of the various countries want is a
       <em>
        market
       </em>
       system, and it can be summed up by the phrase "neoliberal capitalism".

       Because people took the momentum Burress started in that standup set and raided a social media event made by Cosby's PR people. They made memes referring to his numerous counts of rape. When a guy whose whole notoriety comes from the promotion of family values is accused of something of this nature, it tends to be news worthy.

       I don't know why you're quoting that first part of my post because I never said they didn't do that. You're right, that is indeed what happened. Cosby's PR people started that whole social media engagement. Is there something being lost in translation?

       A celebrity gets accused of unwelcomed forgotten sex years ago all the time. Cosby grew up in the 60s and 70s when drugs were everywhere.  Even if you beleive their completely unsubstatiated stories its pretty hard to say they didnt wsnt to be i  a star's bed if they were hanging out with him.  None of them accussed him of forcing them off the street at knife or gu point into his car or house did they?  No. So they wanted to be there near the star. But we aresupposed to beleive i the era of free love and drugs they were the few who wanted to be nesr him alone but NOT have sex with him.

       Cosby was born in the late thirties, and was married by the time the 60's rolled around. The man on all accounts doesn't drink or do drugs, in fact he built his career on conservative values. But hey, if you want to slut shame, I'm not going to stop you

       I don't know...maybe because he is accused of raping 14 women? Yes, these accusations have been levied at him before but never in the age of social media, which is now a conduit for oppressed minorities (and yes, sexually assaulted women are an oppressed minority) to get their voice out.

       Well according to another redditors post above Cosby apparently criticised black people in Ferguson so he didnt play along with the agenda to make black people the victims there and THATS why Cosby is getting the slapdown.

       Considering Ferguson has a history of racial tension and the recent protests kicked off when an unarmed black man was gunned down and left to cook on the pavement, I'm curious to get your read on WHO'S agenda it is to make black people the victims.

       What?  These allegations have been waged for decades.  It's more popular now because more people are on the internet now and more news media is desperate for ratings.  Hannibal Buress (a comedian) brought this shit up during a standup comedy routine a month or so ago so now it's getting mainstream traction.  Maybe Bill Cosby was a scumbag?  Who knows.  I don't see how this would tie into anything political.  Nobody really was talking about the guy until these charges came up again.

       He was in a comedy show and made a joke about how Bill Cosby is always giving advice to the black community like "hey black kids, pull your pants up!" and then said "Yeah.. but you're a rapist, Bill Cosby.  You raped a bunch of girls."  That was the punchline.  After he said that a lot of people started googling Bill Cosby rape allegations so it became news again.

       of research you would find out that the recent resurgence is the result of comedian Hannibal Buress calling him out in his latest bit after Cosby scolded black people after Ferguson.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Bill Cosby has the f—ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said. “He just gets on TV — ‘Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the ’80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.’ Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.”

       Ummm, my read is they made a bad PR move, as many other people have made before and will continue to make in the future.  See JP Morgan, NYPD, Dr. Oz, or any of the dozens of other people who have had similar situations.

       Ok well it was still just a PR mistake... Or do you think his PR team is on the conspiracy too? Was it fake twitter handles coming up with the memes? How deep does this thing go?

      <p>
       And yes I am saying buress has a bigger following than twitter. Spot on deduction sir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Buress made the joke to bring the subject back into the limelight at the same time Cosby is attempting a bit of a late career resurgence.  Then, after Buress, Cosby's PR team naively thought that twitter thing was a good idea to help with his career comeback, but it backfired.  Nothing about Buress or twitter having a larger fanbase than the other, (although obviously I think twitter is maybe a little more well known)...

       No, I also believe it was a (huge) PR mistake. I'm simply saying that PR mistake was far more responsible for bringing Cosby's moral issues into the public discussion than Buress.

       Of course i knew about the no name comedian mentioning cosby but that would not be news worthy it self unless someone WANTED it to be.

       However the reason above most likely IS the reason becuase Cosby isnt playing along with the news runners agenda of Ferguson victimization.

       Sometimes it takes decades for a victim to speak out and when one victim speaks out, the others feel safer to come out again. The same happened here in the UK with Jimmy Savile. 
Often this is triggered by other cases first. 
Thankfully when put on the news, others can hear about it and gather the strength to come forward.

       Ok well it was still just a PR mistake... Or do you think his PR team is on the conspiracy too? Was it fake twitter handles coming up with the memes? How deep does this thing go?

       And yes I am saying buress has a bigger following than twitter. Spot on deduction sir.

       Edit:  Buress made the joke to bring the subject back into the limelight at the same time Cosby is attempting a bit of a late career resurgence.  Then, after Buress, Cosby's PR team naively thought that twitter thing was a good idea to help with his career comeback, but it backfired.  Nothing about Buress or twitter having a larger fanbase than the other, (although obviously I think twitter is maybe a little more well known)...

       OK. I don't say these things just to be a douche. I honestly can't think of anyone less alike than H.G. Wells and Cecil Rhodes.
