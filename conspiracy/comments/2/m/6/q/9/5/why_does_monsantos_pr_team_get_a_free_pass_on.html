    <div class="md"><p>Yes I&#39;m aware of that. I agree the manipulation and shilling is pretty ridiculous, and it has an extremely adverse effect on the posts/info we get to see, and that is a DAMN shame.</p>

<p>BUT. If you read the OP&#39;s claim: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit makes money by selling previously active accounts to corporate interests and PR firms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was just asking for any proof of THAT. I did NOT refute the idea that accounts are bought or sold, I even pointed out that I KNOW it happens. ALL the time. I was literally just curious of the claim that <em>reddit sells inactive accounts</em>. If <em>reddit itself</em> were doing that, why would they take old accounts? They would just make new accounts, then edit them to have as much karma and age as they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t prove that <em>admins/owners</em> sell accounts, just that <em>people</em> do. This is already pretty obvious once you think about why some accounts do <em>nothing</em> but repost previous high karma shit to do nothing other than build up karma. It works the same way as groups on Facebook. A group will claim to be (for example) giving away 20 PS4s. All you have to do is &#39;like and share&#39; in order to enter, then once they have a few thousand &#39;likes and shares&#39; they turn around and sell the group to (insert entity here) then that entity can turn the group into anything they want and make it look like it already has a solid userbase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That still doesn&#39;t actually PROVE that reddit SELLS old accounts though.</p>

<p>I agree there are plenty of shills on reddit, and I know there is plenty of vote brigading (NOT limited to just shills/corporate PR though) but that alone doesn&#39;t mean reddit SELLS them accounts. I&#39;ve heard of people building up shitloads of karma specifically to sell accounts, but this is the first time I&#39;ve heard the admins/owners being accused of doing it.</p>

<p>I just find that somewhat unlikely, because what if the original owner comes back and can&#39;t get on their account? Wouldn&#39;t we hear from at least SOME of them through new accounts accusing the admins of doing it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to say that some people build up accounts like that specifically to sell them (the dickwads that do NOTHING but repost old high karma stuff for example). But honestly, I DO think it&#39;s a stretch to say the ADMINS are doing it.</p>

<p>EDIT; The more I think about it, I actually wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if there are entire businesses built around building up accounts specifically to sell. I know it happens on facebook all the time (with groups and shit, offer &quot;free ITEMS, just like and share!&quot; then once they have a few thousand likes, they sell the group to whomever to change into whatever they want making it look like they already have a major userbase) so it happening here too would not surprise me in the slightest.</p>

<p>All your bullet points prove is that <em>shills exist on reddit</em>, and that I do NOT deny at all, I&#39;ve seen more than a few. But nothing there at all proves that <em>reddit sells accounts</em>. <em>THAT</em> is what I was asking for proof of.</p>

<p>The admins obviously have people to create accounts and give them a sense of legitimate usership then they sell the accounts to paid interests. </p>

<p>Look at it like this: If there was an investigation into insider trading, and everybody lost money except 3 investors and the owners of the company, and the owners of that company never reported those investors, and those 3 investors publicly fucking joked about insider trading on a regular basis, what exactly would you think is going on?

    <div class="md"><p>I am not asking for a confession. I&#39;m asking for evidence that suggests <em>reddit</em> sells accounts. ALL the evidence you&#39;ve given me suggests that <em>shills exist on reddit</em>. Which is blatantly true.</p>

<p>Show me an account that existed for some years, then had a period of inactivity before all of a sudden turning into <em>nothing</em> but pro GMO posts for example.</p>

<p>Show me an account that was banned, but then came back later as a shill for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>How about an account that once in a while spoke out against (insert controversy here) that later all of a sudden started ADVOCATING (insert same controversy here).</p>

<p>Or how about showing me some reports of people claiming their account was stolen, with said account now being a shill?</p>

<p>ALL you have shown so far is that shills exist on reddit, and the admins don&#39;t give a fuck. THIS is very true.</p>

<p>You said yourself that reddit does it to cover expansions (server costs?) so there MUST be at the very least hundreds of such accounts. Unless a single account is worth thousands of dollars alone (in which case, <a href="/u/Silver_Foxx">/u/Silver_Foxx</a> for sale!)</p>

<p>And you know something, if <em>REDDIT</em> were doing this, why would they take <em>other people&#39;s inactive accounts</em> when they could just CREATE an account and artificially increase the karma/years spent on reddit?</p>

<p>So far all you&#39;ve shown is shills exist &gt; admins don&#39;t care &gt; therefore admins sold the accounts to shills. Your argument is a complete logical fallacy.

<p>Regardless, that&#39;s not precisely a Taco Bell issue.  There was a <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_meat_adulteration_scandal">wholesale contamination of the meat supply in the UK</a></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of 27 beef burger products tested, 37% were positive for horse DNA, and 85% were positive for pig DNA.</p>

<p>On 7 February 2013, Findus announced that in a sample of 18 beef lasagne products that it tested, 11 contained between 60% and 100% horse meat. It was also revealed that some of the products sold had minced meat declared as beef that was 60–100% horse meat.</p>

<p>The horse meat that was found in Comigel products originated at Doly Com, a Romanian-based slaughterhouse. An inquiry by the French government showed that &quot;the meat had left Romania clearly and correctly labelled as horse. It was afterwards that it was relabelled as beef.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s almost inconceivable that this was a accidental.  Eighteen months ago the <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22639020">director of a Dutch company accused of selling 300 tonnes of horsemeat</a></strong> as beef was arrested, but after that the whole thing basically disappeared without a word.</p>

<p>So not only does Monsanto get a free pass on reddit, it gets active support by reddit in the form of vote manipulation to keep posts critical of the company from getting high scores and upvote totals.</p>

<p><strong>edit- 12:35pm CDT</strong> So far I have evidence of at least <strong>100 upvotes shaved off</strong> this topic in the last 2 hours from 10:28am to 12:28pm - I have been screenshotting on literally a minute-by-minute basis to watch the voting patterns and one of the factors definitely present is manipulating the &quot;upvote percentage&quot; to keep it under 75% (<em>my</em> running theory) - Both the total upvotes and upvote percentage should be MUCH higher than the illusion you are seeing displayed in the queue and along the right side once you are inside the comments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup®, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise. Residues are found in the main foods of the Western diet, comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat. Glyphosate&#39;s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Here, we show how interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We explain the documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and we show that glyphosate is the “textbook example” of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins. </p>

<p>Hell wider adoption of GMO crops could do a lot to help curb hunger in many parts of the world, yet idiots do shit like <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/08/26/golden_rice_attack_in_philippines_anti_gmo_activists_lie_about_protest_and.html">destroy golden rice crops.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syngenta owns the sole right to distribute Golden Rice.  This is not a humanitarian mission, it is just a ploy to use patenting to capture marketshare for the ag-chem industry.  This is an oft-repeated trend in the industry: offer &quot;superior&quot; patented product, make customer sign waiver agreeing not to replant seed, offer customer special pesiticde/fertilizer that must be used in conjunction with said product.</p>

<p>There are many other, cheaper ways of introducing vitamin A into some of these people&#39;s diets.  in fact, the vast majority of rice growing nations have ample access to vitamin A.  Just to show how ludicrous the myth of vitamin A deficiency is: The sweet potato is native to Philippines (where Golden Rice trials took place).  The sweet potato has the highest density of Vitamin A of any commercially produced vegetable; even higher than carrots.  Also: China, Indonesia and Vietnam are 3 of the top 5 sweet potato producing nations in the world.</p>

<p>Put simply, these people are aware of the business tactics of these corporations.  They have seen how hundreds of thousands of cotton producers in India have gone bankrupt and committed suicide because they fell for Ag-Chem&#39;s lies.  And they don&#39;t want the same to happen to them.  This isn&#39;t an issue of science vs. dumb paranoid peasants as you people like to frame it.</p>

<p>And just to thoroughly disprove you:  <a href="http://farmandranchfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/glyphosate-accumulates-roundup-ready-gmo-soybeans.pdf">Here&#39;s a study that refutes many of the findings of the one you posted.  Which study is more correct?  The independent one or the one with a huge profit interest behind obtaining positive results?</a></p>

<p>I never claimed it would be, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be beneficial</p>

<p>Also if there were no demand for it, there&#39;d be no demand for it and it wouldn&#39;t be present. There&#39;s lots of ways to introduce vitamin A to a diet, this is one of them. </p>

<p>Also, really? Hundreds of thousands of cotton producers gone bankrupt and committed suicide? You know that&#39;d only put them ahead of every other nation combined in terms of suicide rates right?

<p>All it says is they were able to identify differences in the composition of one strain of soybean from another. To which I would reply, no shit? And what&#39;s the significance? </p>

Some newspapers in India have uncovered massive fraud in the Government reporting suicide rates, even finding certain agricultural areas specializing in cotton reporting suicide rates of 0, despite the population being multiple millions.  Do you really think I&#39;m just making this up?  The estimate is between 100,000-200,000 over the last ten years which is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>The difference in the composition of the soybean was the GM strain was largely nutritionally inferior and had far higher herbicide residue.</p>

<p>So one strain of bean holds certain characteristics.</p>

<p>Significance? What am I supposed to draw from that?</p>

<p>Some organic plants use large amounts of copper spray for pesticide which is incredibly toxic for humans. They have pretty significant residue numbers as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop playing dumb.  The study clearly states that organically grown soybeans have much higher levels of vitamins and minerals and a lower omega 3:6 ratio than conventional and GM.   The GM soy had high levels of glyphosate residue while conventional and organic had none.</p>

<p>Some organic farms use bad pesticides but there are dozens of published studies showing organic produce is often more nutritive, does far less damage to soil (nitrate leeching), leaves composting bacteria &amp; mycelium intact, and has a less harmful ecological impact. </p>

<p>Some studies don&#39;t find much comparable difference in nutrition, some do, but essentially no studies find GM to be more nutritious than organic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect them to, the differences between a GM crop and a non GM crop is largely negligible.</p>

<p>And as I already said, the study I linked was in relation to health effects. Not the nutritional value of bean A vs bean B. And even then, so what? </p>

<p>Seriously, what&#39;s the significance of that study? That this one bean is somewhat more nutritious? If you have a study that points towards the nutrition of ALL (or at least more than a single species) GMO crops when compared to organic crops, you might be able to make some statement from that.</p>

<p>But this? Totally inconsequential.</p>

<p>If I found a GMO crop that was more nutritious than an organically grown one, I wouldn&#39;t use that study to prove anything than that particular crop is more nutritious than the other.</p>

<p>Also, just because the group is independent does not mean it cannot be politically motivated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A common saying in pseudologic is &quot;You can&#39;t prove a negative.&quot; That saying is not true. An absence of something can be proved in various ways, e.g., by a reductio ad absurdum or by proving something else that is inconsistent with the presence of that something (a very useful approach known in mathematics as proof by contradiction[wp]). For example, in law, a party may have the burden of proving nonreceipt of certain correspondence and may bear that burden of proof (at least by a preponderance of the evidence) by introducing into evidence a docket record in which the correspondence would have been noted. In mathematics, there are plenty of proofs of negative propositions, such as &quot;there is no largest prime number&quot;[1] or &quot;there is no rational square root of 2&quot;.[2] One might also note that the saying itself is a negative.</p>

<p>This is all besides the point, you are not asked to prove a negative. You are asked to give one good reason all these people are denying well-established facts about Monsanto.</p>

<p>Not hating someone, is a far cry from impassioned advocacy on an almost round the clock basis, with almost instant appearances in threads regarding Monsanto.

Their &quot;studies,&quot; of course, showed they were safe.  Sound familiar to what&#39;s happening today?  PCBs have been banned for over 10 years but still every single baby born on Earth today will have PCBs in their blood.</p>

<p>So one case proves the existence of many cases now? And one case where the <em>actual article you linked</em> makes it clear that people (like you) keep citing it erroneously as proof of heavy-handed lawsuits? Seriously, you should have actually read the article first.</p>

<p>You should also read the OSGATA Vs Monsanto case too. Despite the money that OSGATA threw at their class action lawsuit and all the lawyers they had working on the case, they couldn&#39;t cite even one occasion of Monsanto suing a farmer over a few wind-blown seeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong though, it is a statistical fact that herbicide use has increased significantly since GM crops came to market.  This is largely because repeated use of round-up for 20+ years has selected for extremely glyphosate resistant weeds to grow in fields.  Every year, more and more herbicide must be used to &quot;fight&quot; them. If you didn&#39;t know this than you must know little of the agricultural climate of the modern world, and probably shouldn&#39;t be expressing an uninformed opinion.

<p>Have you ever liked a product so much that you literally talk about it 24/7 and don&#39;t have anything else to talk about at all? The term literally is actually literally in this context. So it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;most of the time&quot;. Yeah if you say so, and you claim you are not a shill, then you are fucking liar. </p>

<p>If you have a hard time imagining what that is like. Here is an example. Let&#39;s say I like diet coke. If I talk about diet coke all the time and nothing else, then that is not normal human behavior but is a clear sign that I am a shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, which is why I never have to comment on evolution or vaccine threads.  I often don&#39;t have to comment on fluoride or climate change, although each has their own niche which they&#39;re disliked (i.e., <a href="/r/portland">/r/portland</a> for fluoride and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> has more climate change deniers than you might expect).  </p>

<p>However, many people in many subreddits are anti-GMO, and even the ones that aren&#39;t anti-GMO almost always acknowledge that Monsanto is bad (in order to appear &quot;centrist&quot;) and then cite claims which I must repeatedly show are wrong.</p>

<p>Deflection. Flytape is pointing out that you accused people of something without any proof, the very thing you are upset about OP doing to you.</p>

<p>No, this thread (and sub) is claiming that people are <em>paid</em> to make their comments. Sleekery was making the claim that supporters of Chavez were downvoting anti-Chavez posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are paid to make comments on the internet.  Its called AstroTurfing and its no big fucking mystery. Its not a conspiracy theory and there is zero doubt that it happens.  </p>

<p>This is why you can buy followers on twitter, Facebook and every other social media platform.  There is nothing to debate!</p>

<p>The fact that there are paid shills doesn&#39;t give anyone free reign to claim that anyone is a shill. It just provides the foundation that it <em>could</em> happen. It&#39;s not sufficient evidence in itself. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, it&#39;s not outrageous to say that government supporters (you use zealot to color the debate) downvote anti-government sentiment. Hell, if a post lauding GW Bush was downvoted, it&#39;s not really a stretch to say that those downvoting it are opposed to Bush.</p>

<p>But when you make specific allegations against specific users, you are making an entirely different claim. This isn&#39;t saying &quot;Monsanto shills are downvoting&quot;, this is saying that individual users are paid representatives of Monsanto. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no fucking difference. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you understand why making individual accusations is different than saying that opponents are downvoting a post? If you want to say that there are paid shills, that can&#39;t be disproven. But if you want to say that individuals are shills, you need evidence. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why are people here so interested in digging through post histories? You can&#39;t engage in a simple argument, so you have to attack individuals? Oh, and you&#39;re bad at it, too. On Sunday I was over in r/nfl.</p>

<p>Blatantly obvious to people who want to see it. The problem is <em>you have created your own idea of who and what a shill looks like</em>. But have you ever actually proven that this model of a shill is what professional astroturfers do? </p>

<p>This gets old after a while. Either post actual evidence of &quot;vote manipulation&quot; on my part or ...</p>

<p>well ...</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything I can really do. Let&#39;s be honest. There are people in this sub who believe the moon landing was faked, who believe that world leaders are actually lizard people, who believe that directed energy weapons took down the WTC.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a subset of people here who are immune to any kind of reason or truth. I don&#39;t know, you could be one. But there&#39;s far more people here who are willing to learn the truth about things. Who are willing to listen to reasonable discussion. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is, if you&#39;re a reasonable person, if you truly do want to seek the truth about what&#39;s going on in the world, if you&#39;re not nuts, you should provide evidence for the things you say. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t, then you appear to be someone who requires no evidence to be convinced of something. Which reflects kind of poorly on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG what a big number... unless you compare it to Monsanto&#39;s valuation which alone is $60 billion (edit: or the <em>$2.6 trillion</em> non-organic agriculture business). It&#39;s amazing how the evil &quot;organics industry&quot; is so successful at getting everyone together in secret meetings to plan to disparage Monsanto, whilst Monsanto, the poor victim, the honorable company that just wants to do what&#39;s right, has to rely on unpaid freedom fighters like you to defend itself. So noble. So righteous. Monsanto is really one in a million, the fairest of the fair, the noblest of the noble, a company that can do no wrong.</p>

<p>Those evil organic bastards! Producing food that isn&#39;t covered in toxic cancer-causing chemicals and who seem to think it&#39;s not okay to just produce the highest <em>quantity</em> of food for the highest <em>profit</em> at the sacrifice of nutritional value and public health!</p>

<p>Keep on fightin&#39; the good fight sir. I commend you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, Monsanto, the good ol&#39; freedom fighter, the last man standing, the lone warrior in a sea of organic food companies that are against it, spreading lies.</p>

<p>You claim organic agriculture is a $65 billion business.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rest of the agriculture industry is a $2.6 trillion business.</p>

<p>You would think Monsanto could do a better job combating the evils of the organic food bastards, with all the friends they have in the non-organic business, making <em>all</em> that money with them. Forty times as much as the organic evil bastards.</p>

<p>So $65 billion? HUGE. $2.6 trillion? Small change.</p>

<p>Look at it like this: If there was an investigation into insider trading, and everybody lost money except 3 investors and the owners of the company, and the owners of that company never reported those investors, and those 3 investors publicly fucking joked about insider trading on a regular basis, what exactly would you think is going on?

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong though, it is a statistical fact that herbicide use has increased significantly since GM crops came to market.  This is largely because repeated use of round-up for 20+ years has selected for extremely glyphosate resistant weeds to grow in fields.  Every year, more and more herbicide must be used to &quot;fight&quot; them. If you didn&#39;t know this than you must know little of the agricultural climate of the modern world, and probably shouldn&#39;t be expressing an uninformed opinion. The problem is that we will never &quot;beat&quot; nature, and the more we try, the more the consumer suffers. </p>
