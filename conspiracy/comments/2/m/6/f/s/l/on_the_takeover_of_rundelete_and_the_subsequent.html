        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">889</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-11-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Magnora.html">Magnora</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I post here because I don&#39;t know where else I can post without this getting deleted. I have a story to tell you about me and reddit and censorship. </p>

<p>You perhaps may remember me from 5 months ago, by the name <a href="/r/magnora2">/r/magnora2</a> from my <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> meta-post &quot;We are about to reach critical mass.&quot; It got to #5 of all time on that subreddit, and was crossposted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and got highly upvoted as well. Here&#39;s the post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/27v0oh/we_are_about_to_hit_critical_mass/">http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/27v0oh/we_are_about_to_hit_critical_mass/</a></p>

<p>It is no longer visible as #5 of all time on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> because my acccount <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> was shadowbanned, which I&#39;ll get in to in a moment.</p>

<p>Soon after this post got hugely popular, maybe a month or two later, <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> was compromised by mods from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and undelete posts started disappearing left and right. I&#39;m sure many of you followed this development and were as pissed off about it as I was. There&#39;s a million other posts about this if you want to read more, I won&#39;t bother covering it here. Suffice to say, it was a sad day for freedom of information on reddit.</p>

<p>I was pissed, so I started a backup subreddit called <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a>. It got about 150 subscribers and I was the only moderator. The goal was to add things that were getting deleted from <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, and to never ever delete anything ever.</p>

<p>However, I soon started getting trolled. Hard. By <a href="/r/oppression">/r/oppression</a>, by <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a>, etc etc. Specifically <a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a> and <a href="/u/unclesamuel">/u/unclesamuel</a>. They were posting all sorts of goreporn and nasty shit all over <a href="/u/undeleteundelete">/u/undeleteundelete</a>. I held to my principles of not deleting anything, even though I probably shouldn&#39;t have. I eventually caved and deleted a couple of the worst ones though. They were absolutely gross pictures.</p>

<p>Then, after deleting these awful posts, those same people (and some other user accounts) made a post in <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> saying that I should not be a mod, if this is a truly free subreddit. That I broke my own rules of not deleting anything, and therefore am a tyrant or whatever. Not knowing the specific rules of moderating subreddits, I foolishly agreed that no mod would be best since that would guarantee no censorship. So I unmodded myself. Foolish, I now know.</p>

<p>Literally 5 minutes later, <a href="/r/unclesamuel">/r/unclesamuel</a> posted to a subreddit that I didn&#39;t know existed called <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>, that lets you claim a subreddit that is abandoned, and the mods will appoint whoever requests it as moderator. I commented in that thread, saying that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> abandoned because it did not meet their criteria that required at least a month of vacancy. They did not give it to <a href="/u/unclesamuel">/u/unclesamuel</a> because of my comments, thankfully. But the clock was ticking and I had no way to make myself moderator again. I felt like a fool. I got tricked. So I dropped it and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Then, one day about a month later, I was in <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a> and there was a meme about the then ongoing Israeli-Palestinian massacre. Someone was cheerleading for Israel in the comments, and it was blatantly biased, and so after some discussion I called them a JIDF shill because it seemed like he honestly was one. I was told by a <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a> moderator that I am not allowed to do &#39;personal attacks&#39; (which apparently calling someone a shill is) and that if I did not cease I would be blocked from <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a>. I stopped. But they blocked me anyway. Not only did they block me, but they shadowbanned my entire account from all of reddit. Not just that account, but 2 of my other accounts too, including one that was over 7 years old. I&#39;m still a bit mad about that. </p>

<p>Anyway, as a consequence of all this, I was no longer moderator of <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a>. My popular post about censorship from <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> no longer appears in the top of all time list. They shut me down.</p>

<p>So all this was about a month ago.</p>

<p>Today, I log in to <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> for the first time in a long time just for kicks. I see that I have a new mail. How odd, since that account is shadowbanned. I opened it up, and this is what I see. Read the first message:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tt9vPBt.png">http://i.imgur.com/tt9vPBt.png</a></p>

<p>&quot;Guess we won this round.&quot; And guess who the mods of <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> now are? 
<a href="/u/UncleSamuel">/u/UncleSamuel</a>, <a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a>, and <a href="/u/Semebay">/u/Semebay</a></p>

<p>Well fuck me sideways.</p>

<p>And to top it off, compare what I see at <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> when logged in to <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/aljJrWo.png">http://i.imgur.com/aljJrWo.png</a> </p>

<p>to what everyone else sees when they go to <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a>: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HUBs84U.png">http://i.imgur.com/HUBs84U.png</a></p>

<p>Notice the difference? The post that makes Israel look bad is gone. </p>

<p>And just you watch, now that I&#39;ve referenced these subreddits and these people and told this story, they will start trolling this thread and posting all kinds of defamation about me, just like before. Just watch. They will sound so logical and well thought out and even-tempered, but you will see their intent is to make me look crazy and stupid. </p>

<p>That is, if this post doesn&#39;t get deleted from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before anyone sees it. Or downvoted to oblivion by the aforementioned users and subreddits. I have hopes that this is one of the last remaining places free of censorship on reddit, and I hope I am not proven wrong. Please give this visibility. I had to get this story out there so people would know just to what depths people on this site are willing to go to suppress information and troll users to discredit what they say. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve given up on reddit as a whole. But at least now you know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderator, I hate to hijack the top comment here but I want people to see this. This thread has inspired me to create a new subreddit called <a href="/r/nobias">/r/nobias</a>. It&#39;s a place for completely unbiased news with no tolerance for sensationalism or biased news sources. While the idea of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> are noble, they are incredibly susceptible to the trolling and bullshit that no life assholes such as <a href="/u/UncleSamuel">/u/UncleSamuel</a> and <a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a> like to inflict. All mods of this subreddit as well as <a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a> and <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> are welcome to moderate this subreddit. </p>

I think its better to incorporate other sites into use that dont have that weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know how many more ways I can possibly answer the same question, especially when the answer is so blatantly obvious. I mean, I realize you&#39;re probably just one of those mods mentioned in the OP and are trolling the thread, but screw it:</p>

<p>Moving people&#39;s comments down to a point where the general population isn&#39;t going to bother trying to read them is a form of censorship. It&#39;s a way to suppress dissenting opinions that goes against the mob&#39;s own. It leads to a lack of real debate and discussion and creates an echo chamber where, instead of having one&#39;s thoughts and ideals challenged, you can have them reaffirmed. Think all women are bitches just waiting to be put in there place? <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/">There&#39;s a sub for that</a>. Think all those people are annoying twats ripe for satire? <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/">There&#39;s a sub for that too</a>.</p>

<p>To sum up, Reddit is a place for people to have their opinions reaffirmed, not challenged. It is not a place for open and honest discussion, nor is it a place for intelligent debate. <strong><em>It&#39;s an echo chamber.</em></strong></p>

There&#39;s more crossover from other boards so it less of an echo chamber than this sub.  And the best thing is the readers are young and hungry for red-pilling.  Pass the info to them and let them do the fighting, I&#39;m too old and need to take care of myself now.  Just don&#39;t take the extreme stuff too seriously and learn the lingo so you&#39;ll be heard.  And a faggot is a good thing over there.</p>

<p>edit:  don&#39;t mention reddit, everyone will pile on you.  It&#39;s just a thing they do,  in fact most probably come here too.  But lurk first, and you must say faggot, it&#39;s a greeting and a compliment, and an insult.  We&#39;re all faggots.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten death threats for a series of posts I stickied as a mod of <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a>. Also, the <a href="/r/conspiro">/r/conspiro</a> project (automated real shill detection) got my original accounts all shadowbanned as well. They even created a bot to counter the work we were doing there.</p>

<p>The admins even stepped in and &quot;stickied-deleted&quot; (coining the term now, a self post that cannot be stickied -- it appears as stickied to the moderators and not to anyone else) the original word-frequency review posts we were putting up on <a href="/r/conspiro">/r/conspiro</a>.</p>

<p>We even had CNN try to contact us, we avoided that like the plague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A subreddit can display a certain stylesheet based on what kind of domain is used. In this case, linking to np.reddit.com instead of reddit.com will cause the subreddit to display the No Particpation stylesheet. It’s a read-only mode where users linked through the NP domain cannot vote or comment. This works only if the subreddit has installed the NP CSS. If not, linking to the subreddit with the NP domain will cause to display without the subreddit’s custom CSS, and voting and commenting will still be possible. This way we can still watch drama as it develops, but if the subreddit wishes to preserve its own culture by discouraging popcorn pissers, they have that option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have managed some sites that hosted unpopular opinions and I&#39;ve run into these types of people who all share these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>They seem to have all the free time in the world to argue and troll, as if they are doing it as a job (and maybe they are).</li>
<li>They cannot be argued with. If the falsehood of what they say is pointed out, they immediately switch to another attack.</li>
<li>They act like robots with no conscience. They do not care to use the dirtiest tactics to get what they want.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now imagine someone whose job is to support a particular agenda. He is sitting in an office with multiple screens, managing dozens (or hundreds) of social media accounts (all of which are properly proxy&#39;d or VPN&#39;s through various ISPs to seem like genuine accounts), watching the topics and replying accordingly, and attacking anything that goes against his mission.</p>

<p>To him it is just like a video game, it is not about truth or falsehood, and the people he trolls and attacks do not exist to him, they are just new challenges, new stages in the game that he has to play through. Post supports Israel? Upvote using many accounts and leave supporting comments. Someone replies against it, he downvotes him using multiple accounts and replies with various attacks and adds that person to his list of people to watch, downvote and harass.</p>

<p>A single person who does this as a job can easily control a lot of the conversations regarding his topic of interest.</p>

<p>Nah, that&#39;s just one instance of one private channel on one IRC network. </p>

<p>A lot of the more active reddit mods do have a negative emotional obsession with places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> though. The fear the spotlight that places like that can shine so they invest a lot of time and energy to discredit and disrupt them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that they like censorship insofar as they like being censored, it&#39;s simply that they don&#39;t mind censoring anyone who disagrees.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the &quot;I&#39;m open minded and tolerant!&quot; line.  They say that, but then when someone who disagrees with them or holds another opinion speaks up, that open mindedness and tolerance goes out the window and they seek to censor them either by name calling, public shaming, or completely ignoring them, etc.  </p>

<p>Cojoco used that as an excuse to ban me for life.</p>

<p>So not only did he not defend his audience when moderators came in to berate them, he accused me of being in league with a sociopath, and then used my exacerbation because he didn&#39;t like upsetting the SubredditDrama turnip cart.</p>

<p>Banned for life yet another user posted that he wanted to throw the TIL mods into the sun recently, and that user had to ask cojoco to remove it from another sub as cojoco was celebrating that &quot;wish for death&quot; while using mine as a pretext because he thought I was annoying.</p>

<p>By placing conditions on your reinstatement, it looks like you&#39;re attempting to make this transaction appear to be one between equals.</p>

<p>However, as we know, the power imbalance between moderators and users in a single subreddit is large, so why does your conversation not reflect the reality of this situation?</p>

<p>The only limit to my actions on undelete is my own personal integrity, and, I guess, the opinion of the top mod.</p>

<p>You have banned me for doing x. You have shown disregard for other people doing x. You&#39;ve asked me to demean myself by promising not to do x in the future. You got it. Now, you have no excuse for why you&#39;ve banned me.</p>

<p>A word of advice, though, which is that inciting witch-hunts against other users is a shadowbannable offense.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a judgment call on the part of the admins, and to avoid <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> being banned, the mods of that sub must pre-emptively ban users likely to bring the subreddit out of favour with the admins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The frightening part about reddit today is it will NEVER go under the way DIGG did. </p>

<p>People on reddit are borderline insane for it. Reddit has become a stimulant with its crazy stream of memes and pics that provide instant satisfaction. People are slaves for reddit, some can&#39;t live without it. Not suggesting this sub is free from it either. </p>

<p>Worse, whatever the subject matter, there is a place for you to belong. Whether your niche is a shitty TV show, or White Supremacy. </p>

<p>People have bought in, been indoctrinated, and will transforim WITH reddit. Not away from it. </p>

<p>How do you tell people that have been had, that they&#39;ve been had? You&#39;re as dead as a witch in Salem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in social media peer to peer dialogs since 1986, published my first BBS software.</p>

<p>Most of the things I see here are still peer to peer nonsense.  You see all kinds of insanity on video game networks that has very little to do with politics, etc. </p>

<p>Humanity is extremely immature on ego differences.  It&#39;s funny, we like to think skin color, national barriers, divide us the most.  But that&#39;s not it.  It&#39;s ego, pure mental.  That&#39;s how husband/wife and father/son can be so much in conflict!  Marriage has been freed from most of the society punishment, so couples aren&#39;t forced to stay together except by their own hearts. All the things we tend to popularly believe as &quot;technical causes&quot; are washed away when a choice marriage is presented.  Suddenly you see it isn&#39;t French language vs. Spanish, it&#39;s pure Ego.  Homosexual choice relationships can be just as revealing of how nonsense we &quot;say&quot; the problems are - that all point to ego.  Carl Jung was spot on.</p>

They just want to appease to a certain demographic.</p>

<p>I would offer 4chan as an alternative, but considering how every day Moot bends over backwards for the government to keep it up I&#39;d say that&#39;s gone too.</p>

<p>So many have lost so ma y accounts and get hit with so many time delays and know whatever they post might just get deleted affer all the effort anywsy.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;ll take a bit of time to get used to it. The links are replies to other posts. On the settings at the top you can select inline links, and that makes it a lot easier to follow. Not sure if there is a way to hide the images or not, though. I suppose I like it because I was on 4chan for years before I even knew Reddit existed, so it&#39;s kind of hours I &quot;grew up&quot; on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good tips thanks.</p>

<p>Yeah i am not a big fan of images taking up screen space surfing on my phone . I have all redddits subreddits graphics turned off.</p>

<p>The link thing threw me.  I&#39;ll explore the settings.</p>

<p>Actuwlly so more new things on 8chan in ten minutes than i have seen on reddit in a year.  And have you noticed the slowing rate of submissions on reddit now?</p>

<p>Thet have pissed off so many of the prime submitters that the only people left or the resders and no one submits much of anything. Its frustrating. But then you try to submit four or five things qnd reddits starts putting time blocks on you! Reddit&#39;s last owners bought it to shut it down  slowly so people wouldnt form an alternative en masse and they are doing a good job of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s gotten bad. So many mods the last few years have gotten to where they ban people for silly things, or otherwise hide good posts, and things that conform to what they feel is the correct view are brought up to the front. Much of this is due to the user base and the voting system, though we have all seen many time submissions being hidden because it goes against the popular viewpoint. 4 and 8chan definitely have a lot of shit on them, and much of the user base can be seen as toxic, but at least you can rest assured that every post will have the same visibility as every other.</p>

But they blocked me anyway. <strong>Not only did they block me, but they shadowbanned my entire account from all of reddit</strong>. Not just that account, but 2 of my other accounts too, including one that was over 7 years old. I&#39;m still a bit mad about that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, mods <em>can&#39;t</em> shadowban anyone - they can kick them out of any subreddit the mod moderates, but shadowbanning is admin-level functionality.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no way for mods to reliably track down your alt accounts (at least, unless you did something stupid like explicitly link them in a post somewhere that the mod saw).  Again, that requires IP logs or user-activity histories, which (IIRC) again requires admin-level access to look at.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling you a liar, but the narrative you&#39;ve presented here doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Are you implying that the mods concerned have help from reddit admins, or could you have been legitimately shadowbanned for <em>actual</em> transgressions (in which case, y&#39;know, you get much less sympathy), and the mod(s) concerned just noticed them and reported you (possibly because of your ongoing beef with them).</p>

<p>Yes. This is what I am implying. No other explanation makes sense. Even if it was punishment on a longstanding legitimate transgression, the <em>timing</em> implies that the admins have a relationship with the moderators, since nothing happened until I called out a JIDF shill.</p>

<p>I was pissed, so I started a backup subreddit called <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> . It got about 150 subscribers and I was the only moderator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, this claim that you created the subreddit seems to conflict with the little gray sentence in all of your screenshots with read &quot;Created by Semebay&quot;. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more, the Semebay account is still listed as a moderator in your first image. </p>

<p>And finally, why does your first image show that you&#39;ve set your own flair on that account as &quot;fritzly&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Well, the last question seems to have been answered. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2ma9iy/that_user_who_posted_about_rundelete_and/">This thread</a> recently popped up on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, and more importantly, contained <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jSnj7c9.png">this image</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> subreddit right now. On its hot page, you should see the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undeleteundelete/comments/2ba0w1/live_stream_of_israel_bombing_gaza/">Live stream of Israel bombing Gaza</a> submission. Go ahead and click the username of the submitter, and you&#39;ll find that account is no longer in existence. The same can not be said for the <a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a> username on the side bar.</p>

<p>Hell, depending on your browser, you can even just hover your mouse over the submission author name on the page, you should then get a box that says &quot;magnora2&quot;.</p>

<p>I am unimpressed, OP.</p>

<p>Very peculiar CSS, to be sure. But basically, the mods of <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> seem to have changed it to make him look more or less insane.

    <div class="md"><p>What I think you fail to understand is that that is not what happened.</p>

<p><a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> made <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a>. It was taken from him by <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> after he was tricked into un-modding himself due to breaking his own rules. In the screenshot he took, it shows the current state of the subreddit as it appears to <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>, specifically that he upvoted his OWN posts. This is in contrast to what is claimed by your post, mainly that he was upvoting his alt. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.</p>

<p>Let me explain as simply as I can.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>In the current sub CSS:</strong> The CSS changes &quot;created by magnora2&quot; to &quot;created by Semebay&quot;. In addition, it changes &quot;by magnora2&quot; in posts to &quot;by fritzly&quot;. Notice the fritzly tag on the posts. In the context that we see it in the current CSS, it appears that fritzly tags his own posts, so they stand out. Sort of like a Mod Post flair. However, and this is where it gets interesting: this is not the case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you remove the stylesheet, using RES:</strong> You see the facade unfold. Suddenly &quot;created by Semebay&quot; reverts to &quot;created by magnora2&quot;. At the same time, you&#39;ll notice that <a href="/u/Semebay">/u/Semebay</a> under moderators does NOT revert to <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>. This is the key part: it proves that <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> wasn&#39;t using CSS to lie, in fact it&#39;s the current mod team that wants to make it look like they never took the sub from <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>. In addition, &quot;by fritzly&quot; changes back to &quot;by magnora2&quot;, which puts the &quot;fritzly&quot; flair in a new light: <strong>this flair was made to point out posts INVOLVING <a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a> and/or his abuses</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So to respond to your post: it&#39;s FAR more complicated than what you stated, mainly in that it&#39;s the exact opposite. These &quot;brilliant minds&quot; here seem to have a better grasp on the actual situation than you did, since you completely fell (hook, line, AND sinker) for the falsehood that the current mods laid out to tell their own tale.</p>

<p>I hope that clears up any misconceptions you may have.</p>

<p>tl;dr: No, look at the CSS. They changed it to hide that they stole the sub and to make <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a> and <a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a> look crazy. They were impersonating him, not the other way around.</p>

<p>So to respond to your post: it&#39;s FAR more complicated than what you stated, mainly in that it&#39;s the exact opposite. These &quot;brilliant minds&quot; here seem to have a better grasp on the actual situation than you did, since you completely fell (hook, line, AND sinker) for the falsehood that the current mods laid out to tell their own tale.</p>

<p>I hope that clears up any misconceptions you may have.</p>

<p>tl;dr: No, look at the CSS. They changed it to hide that they stole the sub and to make <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>[10] and <a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a>[11] look crazy. They were impersonating him, not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet <em>somehow</em> the Reddit admins, the people able to see who is who down to every IP that&#39;s ever been logged to an account, banned <em><a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a></em> for vote manipulation. And soon after <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>.</p>

<p>And then every iteration of the account up to number friggin&#39; seven.</p>

<p>Fuck, Magnora just posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/cm1wrje">a screen shot of his own vote manipulation <em>again</em>.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You...you clearly don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on here.</p>

<p>That screenshot that somehow proves that he&#39;s manipulating his votes? Look more closely. Do you see who&#39;s logged in? AH! It&#39;s <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>! And what did I just get done saying? THAT&#39;S RIGHT! That the CSS changes &quot;by magnora2&quot; to &quot;by fritzly&quot;.</p>

<p>But wait? What does that mean?! OF COURSE! It&#39;s just him upvoting his own posts <strong>which happens every single time you make a post automatically</strong>. Vote manipulation? No. Auto-upvoting your own posts as per reddit&#39;s system? <strong>Absolutely</strong>.</p>

<p>So, once again Murgie, you have proven nothing except that you have been utterly and completely fooled by the CSS, compliments of fritzly and co.</p>

<p>As for the admins, no idea, maybe they were similarly fooled. All I know is: <strong>per the &quot;proof&quot; you&#39;ve shown, there is NO evidence of any foul play on the part of <a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a>, <a href="/u/magnora2">/u/magnora2</a>, <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a>, or any other of his multitude of alts.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, that&#39;s basically what happened. Fritzly has even bragged about it several times. He changed the sub&#39;s logo to &quot;I support the JIDF&quot; too. Which is what I was banned for, calling out JIDF. He sure went to a lot of work to troll me as hard as possible. </p>

<p>But really it only makes him and his cohort look bad, and I&#39;m glad people are waking up these types of people. No admin is banning these people despite all these obviously trollish things they do regularly, and despite the fact they mod hundreds of subreddits. So it&#39;s clear they&#39;re a part of the stucture of reddit itself, implicitly sanctioned by the Reddit administrators, owned by the parent company. Reddit has a serious problem with information freedom and people like fritzly and his cohort are the henchmen that make it happen. The parent companies Advance Publications and Conde Nast turn a blind eye because it helps them sell advertising space and get information-sharing contracts with the government which are very profitable. Basically, they tolerate useful idiots like these because they achieve the goal of bullying people in to only talking about certain categories of information, only certain topics. The bullies themselves may not even realize they&#39;re doing this, they may just see it as having a fun lulzy time, but the people in the parent companies who turn a blind eye do understand their function which is why they&#39;re permitted to not only remain on reddit, but flourish. It serves their interests. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense. </p>

<p>I think  you are mistaken.  You lost <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> through redditrequest after you were shadowbanned.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/2e58eu/requesting_undeleteundelete_only_mod_shadowbanned/"> redditrequest thread</a></p>

<p>You are talking about <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a>.  You demodded yourself from there and there are currently no mods.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/DeleteNothing/comments/289fop/this_subreddit_officially_has_no_moderator_as_of/">deletenothing thread</a></p>

<p>You can probably get <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> back through <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought it was all a bit of fun and people playing pranks in response to your rhetoric.  It was educational for what the trolls get upto and why ultimately we need some kind of moderation to protect a subreddit.  </p>

<p>I had a <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/Oppression/comments/26h8kk/infamous_moderator_oppresses_me_and_censors_me_in/">similar thing happen to me when I was demodded from /r/trueoppression</a> in a hostile takeover .  I had all my posts deleted and was banned by the new mods.  So I totally understand why you are bitter.  It isn&#39;t nice when people steal something you have helped create and distort it to something that mocks and attacks you.  However, don&#39;t let them win and don&#39;t let them silence you!</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen you post in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> recently.  We got rid of emr but still have cojoco .  I think it is safe to return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is mixing up a lot of details here.  First off he created and left <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> after we trolling with him.  We were just showing how moderation <em>is</em> necessary.  Which it work, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2878zz/ever_wondered_if_reddit_is_censored_the_gig_is_up/ci9g9ho">we taught him the importance of moderation</a> </p>

<p>So after that we left him alone.  He gets shadow banned (most likely for vote manipulation) and after a while a friend of ours reqeusts his sub <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> because he was the only mod, he was inactive and shadowbanned.  So sembay gets it and invites me and unclesamuel.  After I get modded I <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DYIFIb4.png">remove 1 post</a>  and change his name to &quot;fritzly&quot; and ban him just to annoy him.  Then wait a month and here we are.   </p>

<p>sure Im an open book.  I can only comment every 8 min however because all this negative karma Ive gotten in this thread so my responses will be slow. </p>

<p>I got involved with <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> because I hate seeing people say that no moderation is the way to go or the assumption that moderation = censorship.   I use to be like that until I saw it fail first hand.  Once I got into modding some subs I realized how important it was.  So I try to pass my experience to those who use to think like how I did.   So when OP here made <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> (around when emr was modded iirc) I tried to show him that moderation was necessary.  It worked.  </p>

<p>How I got involved in <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> was that a friend redditrequested it and invited me.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing. You said &quot;SEALs are Special Forces.&quot;
Can they fall under the same command? Yes. No one&#39;s arguing that, you little bitch.
As someone who has over 300 confirmed kills, I am telling you, specifically, in the military, no one calls SEALs SF. If you want to be &quot;specific&quot; like you said, then you shouldn&#39;t either. They&#39;re not the same thing.
If you&#39;re saying &quot;Special Operations&quot; you&#39;re referring to the United States Special Operations Command, which includes things from Army Rangers to my secret network of spies across the USA.
So your reasoning for calling a SEAL SF is because random people &quot;call the gorilla ones SF?&quot; Let&#39;s get SOW and MRR in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six? It&#39;s not one or the other, that&#39;s not how Special Operations Command works. They&#39;re both. A SEAL is a SEAL and a member of USSOCOM. But that&#39;s not what you said. You said a SEAL is SF, which is not true unless you&#39;re okay with calling all operators of the USSOCOM family SF, which means you&#39;d call Rangers, Pararescuemen, and other operators SF, too. Which you said you don&#39;t.
It&#39;s okay to just admit you&#39;re fucking dead, kiddo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look out everyone, he&#39;s had over 300 kills! I recon he got really baked and played to much COD</p>

<p>Good to know your commitment to <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> only extended to your own sensibilities.  You were offended by the content so elected to censor it.  </p>

<p>Considering how little effort went into showing you why <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> was a silly idea, I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t reevaluate your commitment(which you broke) to having a forum with no moderation.  I showed you the exact reason why moderation is necessary.  </p>
