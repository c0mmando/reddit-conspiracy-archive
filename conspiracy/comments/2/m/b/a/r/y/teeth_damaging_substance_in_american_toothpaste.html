       Okay so here is a conspiracy theory about toothpaste and how it is being used to make money. We all know healthcare in the US isn't free so if you need to go to the dentist or doctors you have to pay, toothpaste is meant to help your teeth stay strong and fresh so we all use it. So if we all use it twice a day and there is something damaging your teeth in toothpaste then your teeth will have problems and have to pay to get them fixed. I live in the UK and have only had to get my teeth straightened (which was free as we have free healthcare), I've never had a cavity dispite my sweet tooth and brush my teeth twice a day, so maybe it's only in American toothpaste as you have to pay to get them fixed when damaged. So what do you all think? Is toothpaste being used to damaged teeth so you have to go to the dentist and pay to get your teeth fixed?

       Tooth health is largely genetic.  I rarely brush my teeth and have perfect teeth.  I've had 4 total cavities ever, three when I was a child and teenager.

       Wife brushes religiously, has tooth problems constantly.  My son has to be beaten into brushing his teeth but has the same problems she has.

       You just provided a great example of how those who are uneducated spread the most mistruth and cause spread of an already growing epidemic (dental caries).
      </p>
      <p>
       The articles you posted are terrible. Even the ones that make mention to genetics are related to people having different dietary preferences based on heredity (duh?). The simple fact that your diet habits are the number one influence on rate of caries doesn't change in that fact.  One of the articles you posted even mentions soft enamel... Ugh. Automatic discredit from any educated individual as there is no such thing.

       Good to know.  I'll go tell my dentist and orthodontist that he's full of shit.  I'll also tell my wife who brushes three times a day and religiously watches what she eats because of her massive amount of tooth decay, that the dentist is full of shit too.  I'll tell her its her fault that she gets teeth decaying from the inside out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure she'll be happy to know that Reddit was there to help her out when every dentist hasn't known shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anonymous reddit username, what should she do to prevent these crazy different tooth decay problems? She brushes after every meal and flosses religiously.  Her teeth LOOK emaculate but then they start hurting, she gets an xray, and the center of the tooth is rotting out.  Now up till now she's been told its genetic, and our son has it as well and her father had it too.  But since thats bullshit and so rare that it shouldn't be common place to my ears, let me know what to do next.
      </p>

       Get the X-ray so i can see the decay from the inside out. I guarantee that's not how it's happening. Then we'll move on from there. Any dentist who says its genetic is being lazy and not wanting to help a patient modify their diet and hygiene.

       You are full of shit. Like I'm gonna go pay to get copies of the xrays for some reddit know it all.  Would you like me to get the dentist testimony from missouri and Indiana? What no requests for blood test results? What kind of ridiculous know it all are you? You only demanded part off what you know I won't give you regardless of the situation.  The idea that any one in their right mind would go through that much for you, anonymous reddit person. What a joke.

       Continue believing that genetics are to blame for you and your wife's nasty mouths. Just do the public a favor and don't spread those lies. It's only going to make the disease worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go to a PPO/HMO/DHMO dentist. They don't make enough off you to give a shit about educating you on dental disease. Thus are content with letting you believe it's genetics as a scapegoat instead of taking the time to educate and investigate why you're getting the problems you are.

       I pity prior who are so self assured that they won't listen to anything but themselves. The idea that two dentists and several blood tests are wrong, but you are right is laughable. Pity yourself. You've convinced yourself you are smarter than two dentists with xrays, exams, and blood tests to go off. Pathetic.

       You're lying and can't even admit it.... You didn't get blood tests. If you did the only possibility of diagnosis is AI or DI. And then you would know well enough that those don't consist of the "majority" of the population. Hence why you're being called out on your bullshit.

       Does it matter? Any way he said he didn't find anything.  My assumption was that it was to remove the possibility of other factors that would help determine the problem. What he was looking for he didn't find.

       Dentist and optometrist are the only medical practitioners in the US whose prices are low enough insurance really just acts as a coupon program for it rather than a necessity.  However, I firmly believe the number of "cavities" found has more to do with which dentist you visit and how much they think you are willing to pay for than your actual dental health.

       I'd say it's more likely to be due to Americans putting too much sugar into all their foods. Even their

       is sweet!
