<p>Gregorian Bivolaru was convicted by the Romanian High Court to 6 years for sex with a minor and sex-trafficking, and it is protected by Sweeden. </p>

<p>And they tried to harass Assange even if it is not convicted.
So much for the Sweden neutrality in Justice.</p>

<p>When they will extradite Bivolaru I will trust Sweeden with correctly handling Assange.</p>

(Romanian Police site to date that says that Bivolaru is wanted for executing 6 years for sex with a minor)</p>

<p>Some of the other charges were dropped (sex trafficking, human trafficking, etc) not  because he was not guilty, but because they expired (because Bivolaru could not be prosecuted). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has a tantric cult, so Sweeden thinks he was religiously persecuted, although Romania is an European country and the asylum should at least be rediscussed. </p>

<p>The law is the law and if his religion includes sex with minors, sex traffiking, sexual abuse or raping he should face the law withou Sweden giving him asylum.</p>

<p>If a catholic priest has sex with a minor is not given asylum by Vatican he goes to jail.</p>

<p>sexual acts with a minor (17 and 1/2 years old girl)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a pedophile, and really it&#39;s pretty ridiculous to criminalize sex with a 17 1/2 year old girl.</p>

<p>Western society demonizes normal male-female relations in order to force a decline in population numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quote your sources man, I had to search for it, and that was Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Try to search something on the Internet about him and you will understand because you will find the internet flooded by his sect acolytes. Acolytes who know SEO, and how to modify Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The girl was 15 when police interogated and under 15 when Bivolaru used her as his mistress. When first Bivolaru used his quality as her professor of yoga to have sex with her she had 13 years. The girl was presured by the sect to change her stance.</p>

<p>They flooded the internet with Garbage unfortunately I cannot find those documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah you may not have a source, well it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that were true.</p>

<p>On the other hand I also don&#39;t really care about him &quot;using his quality as her professor of yoga&quot; as the whole kick for a female in a relationship with a male is to be under his position of dominance. That&#39;s why all the little girls love football players. The idea that it&#39;s somehow wrong to be with someone just because you are their teacher is pretty ridiculous, just another way of demonizing normal heterosexual relationships in our leftist crazy world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough about the Romanian dude to say, doesn&#39;t seem a very strong case but he does look like a creeper so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he did something fishy. Then again if the girl consented whether she was legally supposedly able to consent or not, I don&#39;t see a problem with it.</p>

<p>The Assange case was feminist propaganda. He didn&#39;t rape anyone. It was basically a case of a female getting mad that he had sex with another girl and making a false rape accusation because of it. False rape is extremely common, with over 50% of accusations being false. It was all a big feminist thing, wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was all done to remind him not to dig too deep, or else.</p>

<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn was also framed for sexual assault. I hear he wasn&#39;t cooperating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sect did almost a decade of appeals, but the Romanian High Court of Justice gave a final sentence (cannot be appealed) for him, 6 years for sex with a minor. And they have an European Warrant on his name. I think it should have been fried. Unless... Sweeden says so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minor heh. You old enough to fuck, you old enough to fuck. Crazy world we live in where it&#39;s illegal to have sex. All because they don&#39;t want girls producing kids young since the kids will be healthier and they&#39;ll have more of them. Rather keep women riding the cock carousel and working a slave job till 40 then settle down and get in vitro and have 1 1/2 kids. Career is more important than motherhood, don&#39;tchaknow Rockafeller said so.</p>
