        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-11-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora3.html">magnora3</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello again, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. <a href="/u/magnora">/u/magnora</a> here. After I wrote <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/">On the takeover of /r/undelete and the subsequent takeover of the backup subreddit /r/undeleteundelete</a>  about 48 hours ago my account was shadowbanned about 1 hour after posting it. I was only able to write one comment response out that was visible before I got shadowbanned. I tried to create a new account, but apparently <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has limitations on new accounts posting, they have to be 12 hours old or something. So I found myself able to post, but the posts were not appearing in the threads at the time, so no one could see what I was saying. It&#39;s all settled now though, I&#39;m able to post again with a new account.</p>

<p>I want to thank user <a href="/u/gameshowissues">/u/gameshowissues</a> for making <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m8il8/umagnora_creator_of_the_current_1_post_calling/">this thread</a> letting everyone know I&#39;d been shadowbanned. I also want to point out the crosspost to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> that got completely overrun by trolls almost immediately: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2m7ju8/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/">http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2m7ju8/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about these trolls. From what I gather, they belong to a group called Antique jetpack. This group is based around a user named <a href="/u/BipolarBear">/u/BipolarBear</a> (edit:<a href="/u/BipolarBear0">/u/BipolarBear0</a>, excuse me), from what I understand. They coordinate in IRC chat, which according to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/cm23pkl">this post</a> &quot;our mod assuradlyathrowaway found their hideaway chatroom, which is hidden on snoonet in the room #yiff&quot;. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s all true, but this is my understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>I now realize I did have a couple details confused that I would like to make corrections about. <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> was the initial subreddit I made as a backup to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. It was the one that was trolled by all those guys with the goreporn and that I stopped modding and that they eventually claimed on <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>. <a href="/r/undeleteundelete">/r/undeleteundelete</a> was my <em>second</em> try (after learning I shouldn&#39;t un-mod myself...lesson learned) and they didn&#39;t take that one over until I was shadowbanned and THEN they requested it on <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>. So essentially they did their sub takeover technique <em>twice.</em> Very dedicated people. I had gotten this minor detail incorrect and wanted to make a correction. If you go to <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> you will see all the posts where they try and defame me. </p>

<p>Back to the <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> crosspost,, there was one good thing that came of it.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2m7ju8/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/cm270af">This post</a> in the comments. Literally every one of those people showed up in that thread to defend themselves and talk to each other to defame OP and other commenters who agree. </p>

<p>Here is the full list (so far) of people known to participate in this:</p>

<p><a href="/u/fritzly">/u/fritzly</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/eberkneezer">/u/eberkneezer</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/eightNote">/u/eightNote</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/Meepster23">/u/Meepster23</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/ky1e">/u/ky1e</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/Batty-Koda">/u/Batty-Koda</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/UncleSamuel">/u/UncleSamuel</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/emr1028">/u/emr1028</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> (this is a new account, not completely sure if it should be on the list, but it seems so)</p>

<p><a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> (moderator of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and 200 other subreddits)</p>

<p>I can personally vouch for all these to be shills and/or extremely dedicated trolls, except for <a href="/u/eightnote">/u/eightnote</a> and <a href="/u/ky1e">/u/ky1e</a>, I don&#39;t know much about them but I do see them all replying to each other quite often, and always in support. <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> made the <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> crosspost and was the moderator that was appointed to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> right as it got corrupted is also part of this. He does seem to moderate many many many subreddits and spends a lot of time on reddit, and seems to be buddy-buddy with many of the people on this list, which are telltale signs. Same for most of the others. It&#39;s interesting how they get together and chat to back each other up, even using their upvotes to help each other out, which could be considered a form of vote brigading. They coordinate in IRC to locate reddit threads they want to target, and then work together to sway the votes as much as they can and overload the comments sections with opposing opinions. I don&#39;t think vote brigading is rare on this site, but it&#39;s interesting that no one seems to care about it until you start highlighting certain stories (Israel seems to be one common denominator as evidenced in my post 2 days ago), then they go in to search-and-destroy shadowban mode. Anyway, I would like your help filling out this list.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to point out the yishan post that was the 3rd message in the picture I posted 2 days ago: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tt9vPBt.png">http://i.imgur.com/tt9vPBt.png</a></p>

<p>I posted this picture by itself to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and got a lot of upvotes about 2 months ago, if anyone remembers, but I blacked out the name yishan because I didn&#39;t want to get the admin in trouble who revealed this information. To get this info, I had messaged literally every single reddit administrator on the site (about 40 of them in all), asking them why they removed the visibility of the up and down votes individually through RES and if there was any governmental involvement that forced their hand. The individual up and down vote counts had been a feature of reddit and RES for 6 years, and then they suddenly decided to remove it one day. I&#39;m sure many of you remember this, people were pretty pissed. After asking all the admins why, the only response I got was this one from yishan. The same yishan, who I found out yesterday, is the CEO of reddit that <em>just</em> resigned. I did not know yishan was the CEO until yesterday. I still do not know if yishan&#39;s response is genuine or satirical, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services#Strengthening_Communities_Fund">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services#Strengthening_Communities_Fund</a> is a real link about a real governmental program. I haven&#39;t researched it that thoroughly to see how legitimate a claim is, maybe someone else can help do that, understanding the structure and function of government programs is not my strong suit. I do think it is possible the response is real, and the fact he resigned so suddenly slightly bolsters my case imo.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to voice one caution relating again to the takeover of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. <a href="/u/IAmAnAnonymousCoward">/u/IAmAnAnonymousCoward</a> was originally the sole moderator of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. He did a good job running that subreddit for several months until one day the reddit admins messaged him that he had to appoint another administrator to help with the moderation of that subreddit, under the claims that deleted child porn would end up on <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and they would miss it due to having only one moderator and that would place a legal liability on reddit administrators. He (smartly) refused this, and was open to the community of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> about it, and instead created a secondary subreddit called <a href="/r/undeleteNSFW">/r/undeleteNSFW</a> or something (that&#39;s not it, but I don&#39;t remember what the name was), and the reddit admins agreed to this idea. Then, about 2 weeks later, <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> (a very questionable mod, if you look at how many subs he moderates and which ones) was appointed as a moderator to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, everyone got mad, and then things started getting deleted. This same mechanism of administrators threatening moderators (because they&#39;re allegedly being threatened legally by the government for something) is a mechanism by which subreddits get taken over. They may have been legitimately been threatened by the government in to doing this, I don&#39;t know. Kind of seems like it might be the case, which goes back to my earlier message from yishan. </p>

<p>Now, after posting all this, I again expect these trolls on that list to come out of the woodwork, as they do, to defend themselves and try and explain away why this isn&#39;t the case. I expect them to manipulate the votes of the comments and the thread. I also expect this account will probably get shadowbanned after I post this, judging by what happens after my past posts. But thankfully I think I can depend on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> not to delete this. The mods really proved themselves by not deleting my post 2 days ago, and I&#39;m very grateful for that. Seriously, this mod team is the best. </p>

<p>Anyway, the info is now 100% out there. I&#39;d like it if people built up the list of these troll/shill people, and raised awareness about it. This rabbit hole has gone deeper than I thought it ever would. As they say, truth is stranger than fiction. But I&#39;m tired of it and I know some of you are too. Let&#39;s name usernames and bring this to awareness. Hopefully some of you out there have open ears and are listening to what I&#39;m saying about what is happening on reddit (and possibly by extension internet social media as a whole). Thank you for reading and good luck with everything.  Let&#39;s blow the lid off this nonsense. </p>

<p>edit: updated with more accurate information.</p>

<p>edit2: Notice how low the percent upvoted is? I&#39;m stuck between 58% and 65% net upvotes, even though I keep getting more and more overall votes. It hasn&#39;t left that range since it was posted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or they&#39;re paid, I&#39;m not sure which. I&#39;m sure the governments of many first-world countries have teams of people who get paid to manipulate reddit opinions  (and other social media websites too, obviously). Maybe they found some people to do it for free, just for the joy of screwing with others and having a bit of a power trip by being moderator of 200 subreddits. </p>

<p>Maybe no one on that list I made is related to the government, and these guys are paid by corporations. Monsanto is known to do social media astroturfing. I&#39;m sure other companies do the same thing.</p>

<p>Maybe they just like to screw with people, and they&#39;re just doing it for fun, completely on their own. I somewhat doubt it due to their level of dedication, but certainly it&#39;s possible. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, it&#39;s pretty clear they have a damaged moral compass and they have a certain bias towards creating visibility for certain topics and hiding visibility for others. It&#39;s media manipulation 101, and it&#39;s similar to the fact that 93% of American media (movies, TV, print) is owned by 5 corporations. The governments of the world are certainly very aware of the visibility of what&#39;s on top social media sites, millions of people come to reddit every day, and if they wanted to manufacture consent, this would be a great place to do it. Posting pro-military pro-nationalistic pictures and images, and hiding any of the bad secrets that happen to crop up. And it&#39;s almost certain they have entire think tanks devoted to developing strategies for these things. Why wouldn&#39;t they? It certainly seems important enough that they would care about that, and they have a track record of caring about public opinion. I don&#39;t know if the people I listed are related to any of this, but evidence seems to suggest that is the case, in my opinion. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the answer is, but there is certainly a lot to think about. </p>

<p>Comcast, pornhub, pebble, a lot of gaming related site are all here transparently.   I think controversial companies that want to influence public opinion are bound to be here in some form.  So expect big oil, GMO and hi-tech.  Maybe weapons manufacturers who want to sell drones.  I think the comment sections are more of interest than the stark posts that get pinned up in <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a>. However, it is often impossible to distinguish between a company spokesman and a superfan.  So no point trying.</p>

<p>I agree.  I think a platform like reddit is a great target for any military to prepare us all for war.  It is also something the military would want to protect from outside propaganda.   I dont see that there is much activity right now but <a href="/r/MilitaryConspiracy">/r/MilitaryConspiracy</a>  is pretty interesting and can raises some questions.  I also wonder what happens in things like moderate religious subreddits where  perhaps recruiters lurk.   I thought some of the stuff around the Ukraine conflict was pretty suspect propaganda.  Altogether, I think it is strategically important for the military to have assets in place or a means of deploying them.  So this could mean sleeper cells of mods, click farms or it could mean some technological way of interefering with the operation of reddit.  I don&#39;t think reddit owns its own servers and just rents them from amazon.  So the influence could take place on the server farm without admin or mods permission.   </p>

<p>I tend not to rule anything or anybody out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I probably shouldn&#39;t say this for my own sake, but I&#39;m going to be super super honest because I&#39;m so sick of seeing lies and half-truths on reddit and I want the truth on record, for honesty and transparency&#39;s sake and so that other people can know exactly what happened. I know some people are wondering what&#39;s up with that.</p>

<p>I sometimes would upvote my own posts, it&#39;s true. At the most it was 4 extra upvotes because I had 5 accounts. <a href="/u/Magnora">/u/Magnora</a>, <a href="/u/Magnora2">/u/Magnora2</a>, <a href="/u/FoxFaction">/u/FoxFaction</a>, <a href="/u/CommentsTLDR">/u/CommentsTLDR</a>, and <a href="/u/WhyUFail">/u/WhyUFail</a>. I registered these over a period of 3 years. So it wasn&#39;t like I was going crazy with it. I would do it to give them extra visibility in the new section because I felt they were important. I know it&#39;s against the rules and I regret it and I&#39;m sorry. Over 5 years, I did the +4 upvote thing a few dozen times, maybe once a month or so. I would just switch accounts on RES (which takes 2 seconds) and upvote my own stuff sometimes... I&#39;m sorry for that, it broke reddit rules and I won&#39;t ever do it again. I&#39;ve seriously learned my lesson after all my accounts got shadowbanned.</p>

<p>However I find it interesting I did it off-and-on for roughly 5 years without anyone caring until I called out a JIDF shill in <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a>. Then they went through my voting history and matched it with my other accounts and shadowbanned those too. That&#39;s the only way they could&#39;ve linked them all together, other than IP address perhaps. Why didn&#39;t they do this before? Why wasn&#39;t this automated across all users, which would&#39;ve picked me up a long time ago? Just exactly when do accounts get flagged for this type of investigation? Is it only for people who insult the wrong authority group? I&#39;m not trying to justify what I did in any way, I did break the reddit rules and deserve to have those accounts shadowbanned for that. I take responsibility for that. I am not complaining about that. But it is interesting what suddenly made them care after 5 years of not caring.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to reiterate that I have learned my lesson after all my accounts getting shadowbanned, and that I will never engage in this vote rigging on reddit ever again. But I don&#39;t think my explaining this part detracts from the main story here. I&#39;m a loser for doing minor vote rigging, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the first, nor the biggest (there are websites that sell upvotes by the dozen), and I find it interesting what caused me to finally get in trouble for it. I wonder if I had avoided that topic if I&#39;d still have all my accounts. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry that&#39;s so long, I just had to explain it fully since it is a fairly glaring omission to this whole story and I respect you for asking the question because it is a relevant one. Sorry about that, but now I&#39;ve come clean. Feel free to judge me because of what I did, which I take full responsibility for, but don&#39;t let it detract from the rest of what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you were not using TOR or any kind of anonymiser and just simply switching.   I expect reddit are tollerant of the odd mistake for genuine users make when switching between user accounts.  However, I think it is no accident when 4 linked accounts are voting on the same comment.  Reddit  should easily spot the low-effort cheaters.  I wonder why it takes a mod report or suspicion for action.  Maybe the problem is so big they choose to ignore it or just nullify the votes?</p>

<p>I always suspected <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> had voting irregularities because of the way comments would swing from +20 to -20 within a few hours - especially a few months ago... but who knows as it was kind of crazy all over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is you have linked together so many conspiracies in your op that it ends up being  a really entertaining and interesting post.  I usually hate people that attack me and my reputation because unlike a lot of others I don&#39;t have a group of IRC friends to laugh about it etc or an established alt account to fall back on.  However, the way you accuse people is fun and upvote worthy.  Maybe it isn&#39;t seriousness or plausible enough for the community here to be interested in a 3rd post.   </p>

<p>Altogether, I think your revelations about how you were cheating in plain site are really interesting and need more visibility.  It is kind of worthy of a separate thread and discussion.   A full confession about what you did and for how long you got away with it for..... and then  about when you finally got caught would be super interesting for all.  If some one like you can get away with it for some time, imagine what the really &quot;bad&quot; people get upto who have massive resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like you were his personal addition to someone else&#39;s list of terrible people.   The worst thing is being listed alongside other users like me that you know nothing about.  So if there is any negative attention on me it rubs off on you and vice-versa.   </p>

<p>It is a good way to target individuals who are otherwise not that well known.  It is a common technique used in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>.  Some of those JTRIG slides on how to destroy reputations  online are kind of relevant to this strategy.    </p>

<p>I think that is the charm of this place.  I don&#39;t usually feel the need to post here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it was just you saying everyone you disagree with is shills and how they must be working to trick reddit.</p>

<p>All while ignoring that YOU were actually the one manipulating reddits votes to try to give extra visibility and make it look like people approved of your posts. Even LYING about what it was that got you banned, trying to pretend that it was because you called someone a shill. AGAIN that was you lying about what happened to try to get people on your side. You lied about what happened to make the other guys seem like the bad guys. Oh hey, what&#39;s this whole post about again? Watch out for these bad guys? Well you&#39;ve got SO much credibility...</p>

<p>You are the one that&#39;s guilty of what you accuse everyone of doing. You&#39;re the one that tried to cheat to make it seem like you were right and people agreed with you, and then lied about it up and down until you were dumb enough to provide evidence against yourself and everyone with half a brain called you on it.</p>

<p>You are creating extra accounts to gain a false sense of support for your cause. You are, quite literally and with proof provided by yourself, a shill. And of course, one hell of a hypocrite. With the final bonus of pointing out the hypocrisy of this sub, where they are willing to completely overlook that you are literally a shill and admitted it, because you were shilling for their side. It&#39;s laughable how unaware the people here are, to  actually support you.</p>
