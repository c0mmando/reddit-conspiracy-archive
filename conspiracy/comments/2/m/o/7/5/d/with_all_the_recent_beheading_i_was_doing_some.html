    <div class="md"><p>This is my OC from investigating after Sotloff was &quot;beheaded&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillPolitics/comments/2fjp80/oc_two_beheading_victims_both_tied_to_the/">http://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillPolitics/comments/2fjp80/oc_two_beheading_victims_both_tied_to_the/</a></p>

<p>copypasta from the page:</p>

<p>I was just researching this Steven Sotloff.</p>

<p>His father is a ghost. His name is Arthur Sotloff. He appeared to found Arthur Sotloff Enterprises in the early 80s out of his home. I can find no mention of what it was that he actually did for employment. Be assured though that Arthur was making big enough money to send Steven to a ritzy private school in New Hampshire called Kimball Union Academy which has a current annual tuition of over $50k.</p>

<p>The girl who has been coming out talking about Steven is named Danielle Berrin. <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Danielle Berrin, who writes for the Los Angeles Jewish Journal, knew Sotloff since first grade and had corresponded with him in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She is is @hollywoodjew on twitter. She published this article on August 25th talking about how great zionism is and how thankful that the jews in hollywood stick up for Israel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black">http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s comforting to know that at least 200 Hollywood leaders care about Israel&#39;s welfare. But the Zionist hero of the summer is Kavanaugh, grandchild of Holocaust survivors, who didn’t require groupthink to use his mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&#39;s deal with Danielle Berrin for now. She is vouching for Steven. She may well know him, but I haven&#39;t seen any pictures or evidence of a friendship or that she has been contacting him as she has claimed. Furthermore, we don&#39;t really know the nature of what they would talk about.</p>

<p>The connection we have is that she works with the American Jewish World Service. <a href="http://ajws.org/what_we_do/service_and_travel_opportunities/global_justice_fellowship/los_angeles/2013_bios/danielle_berrin.html">http://ajws.org/what_we_do/service_and_travel_opportunities/global_justice_fellowship/los_angeles/2013_bios/danielle_berrin.html</a></p>

<p>This was an organization founded by Ruth Messinger. <a href="http://ajws.org/who_we_are/executive_team/ruth_messinger.html">http://ajws.org/who_we_are/executive_team/ruth_messinger.html</a></p>

<p>She had Nick Berg, the original man to be &quot;beheaded&quot;, to her home shortly before he left for Israel, then Iraq! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Messinger, who opened her home to Mr. Berg and other volunteers for a gathering last summer, said that much of Mr. Berg&#39;s work with the service stemmed from a desire to get closer to his Jewish heritage, particularly the Hebrew concept of &#39;&#39;Tikkun Olam&#39;&#39; or helping to heal or repair the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it that this zionist organization is so close to two people who were &quot;randomly&quot; captured and &quot;beheaded&quot;?</p>

<p>We have to further the question with the evidence of Nick Berg&#39;s &quot;random encounter&quot; with the terrorist named Moussaoui? We are supposed to believe he let him borrow his computer on a bus to check his email? We are supposed to further believe that this guy had wifi/satellite back in the 90s/early 2000s on a bus?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/">http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At one point during the bus ride, Berg said, the man sitting next to his son asked if he could use Nick&#39;s laptop computer. &quot;It turned out this guy was a terrorist and that he, you know, used my son&#39;s e-mail, amongst many other people&#39;s e-mail who he did the same thing to,&quot; Berg said.</p>

<p>Government sources said Berg gave the man his password, which was later used by Moussaoui, the sources said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean seriously.... how much &quot;random coincidence&quot; hyperbole are we supposed to believe?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good story, a good distraction, that gets <em>viewers so you can sell ad space</em>. This story is <em>great for business</em>. The government loves it because it can distract us away from anything else it wants to do, like ramp up bills to control the internet <em>again</em>. Remember CISPA/SOPA/PIPA? That&#39;s back, and I bet you haven&#39;t heard of it.</p>

<p>Never forget that the Federal Reserve Act was passed during an illegal quorum in December. That the Patriot Act was passed 3 weeks after 9/11, debated in the House <em>for one day</em>, in the Senate <em>for one day</em>, and signed into law <em>in one day</em>. And never forget that they tried passing it in the aftermath of the OKCity bombing, but that event wasn&#39;t <em>big enough</em>. And that Joe Biden helped write it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/joe-biden-drafted-the-core-of-the-patriot-act-in-1995-before-the-oklahoma-city-bombing.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/joe-biden-drafted-the-core-of-the-patriot-act-in-1995-before-the-oklahoma-city-bombing.html</a></p>

<p>And do not forget <em>after the next event</em>, something is going to be rammed through if we&#39;re not prepared and loud enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Canadian, I can&#39;t forget because they just did it to us! It&#39;s so obvious too. A few months ago we had a kid in BC shooting RCMP officers and the worst terrorist was never mentioned. But a week after Harper talks about the need for stricter anti-terrorism laws there is a shooting and everyone calls it terrorism to rush bills through. Ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OPINION: Nick Berg is an off the books, non-mil/intel sponsored Israeli spy who is very much not dead. He had ZM&#39;s email on his laptop because he had hacked it and was monitoring his emails/sending them out himself to gain intel. He couldn&#39;t readily admit that when caught, so his father (who does the same thing or something similar) came up with a (pretty lame) cover story. After this, he goes to Iraq, travels alone under the cover of night, apparently lies about his identity to people, and &quot;has difficulty finding work&quot; in an industry where people have stated there was plenty at the time (cover story for visit). The conflicting reports from consulate/military about his detainment are because one was in on the hoax and the other was not. What we saw get it&#39;s head cut off (in a very clean, straight line) was a cadaver that bore a likeness to him (either through coincidence or prosthetics) with it&#39;s head previously removed and then &quot;reattached&quot; so as to look like a live beheading in front of the camera. Berg was in on this, because now after his highly publicized death, he is free to roam/move in and out of organizations/collect intel as someone else, perhaps as an Islam convert, and feed it back to the military/Israel because who is going to suspect that he is the dead Nick Berg? </p>

<p>Just my thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the story Berg&#39;s dad originally said is that Nick had met one of Zac&#39;s associates on a bus and asked if he could use his e-mail. This makes no sense, first why give away your password to a stranger, why would a stranger give the password to someone else? And why would you tell your dad you did this. </p>
