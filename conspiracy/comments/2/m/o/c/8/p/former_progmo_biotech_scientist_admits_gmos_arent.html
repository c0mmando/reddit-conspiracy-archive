        From Joseph P. Farrell:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yesterday
        <a href="http://gizadeathstar.com/2014/11/gmo-scrapbook-hawaiian-ban-gmos-monstersantos-predictable-response/">
         I wrote about the GMO ban in Maui county of Hawaii, and about the GMO “industry’s” entirely predictable response.
        </a>
        And at the risk of wearing out this subject, I want to talk about it again, and to reassert some points I’ve made on this website before with respect to this issue, because they bear repeating again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Thierry Vrain, a biotech scientist, and former supporter of GMOs and all their wonders, has now come out and completely repudiated his former support – and the “science” behind that support – of GMOs:
       </p>

        Former Pro-GMO Biotech Scientist Admits GMOs Aren’t Safe, Refutes Claims by Monsanto
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I first want to draw your attention to this particular passage in the article:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “Vrain thinks the public is being swindled. He believes we should all demand that government agencies replicate tests showing that GMOs are safe rather than rely on studies paid for by the biotech companies. He continues:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Bt corn and soya plants that are now everywhere in our environment are registered as insecticides. But are these insecticidal plants regulated and have their proteins been tested for safety? Not by the federal departments in charge of food safety, not in Canada and not in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no long-term feeding studies performed in these countries to demonstrate the claims that engineered corn and soya are safe. All we have are scientific studies out of Europe and Russia, showing that rats fed engineered food die prematurely.
      </p>
      <p>
       These studies show that proteins produced by engineered plants are different than what they should be. Inserting a gene in a genome using this technology can and does result in damaged proteins. The scientific literature is full of studies showing that engineered corn and soya contain toxic or allergenic proteins."
      </p>
      <p>
       “This science is actually only about 40 years old. It is all based on a theory of genetic manipulation hypothesized around 70 years ago – of the ONE GENE – meaning that each gene codes for one single protein. The Human Genome project proved this totally wrong.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And there’s the rub: in the USA and Canada at least (we might to some extent include Australia here), no real independent government testing has been done at the bought-and-paid-for corrupt federal level; the independent science is not independent at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        If anything, the independent studies have been done at the state level, at places such as the University of Iowa; and that is why, as I blogged yesterday, opposition to GMOs and to companies and corporate “practices” of such morally bankrupt entities as Mon(ster)santo is occurring at a local level, and has begun to shift from “labeling” laws to outright moratoriums on GMO planting and testing.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there’s an even more important thing going on here, one suggested by comments at the beginning of the article, and raising the issue I have attempted to raise before, and which I do here again, in hopes that people understand the insane irrationality of any study – pro or con – to have settled the issue:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “Monsanto openly admits “after 30” whole “years of research” that they are convinced GMOs are safe. Just one type of pine tree lives more
       <a href="http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/bristlecone-pines-oldest-trees-on-earth.html">
        than 5000 years
       </a>
       , but yea – Monsanto has all of Mother Nature figured out in its 30 years of tinkering with genes.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, there has not and never been any real long term intergenerational study of GMO effects on the environment, and on animal and human health. The claim is made that a mere thirty years of study is sufficient; and that, of course, in the face of millennia of agronomical practice and the careful selection of traits in seeds over several generations, is nonsense.
       </p>
       <p>
        At root, the claims of “scientific GMO safety” is a form of hubris, a hubris bought and paid for by corporate money and – calling a spade a spade – bribed government officials. The preponderance of reason would thus seem to have demanded that, whatever the science or its conclusions, a moratorium on wide spread GMO cultivation should have been maintained for at least three generations, if not longer.
       </p>
       <p>
        And there can be no corporate side-stepping of this issue: they knew they were playing with animal and human life itself, and in pursuit of their “bottom line,” simply didn’t, and don’t, care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oh, and that honey bee colony collapse thing? Well,even though bees are essential to the pollination of plants of all types, and hence, essential to food cycles on earth, they don’t care about that either:

        And one more thing: the contamination is now so widespread that it may be unstoppable:

       <p>
        Maybe it’s time for a class action, international lawsuit in every country against these companies, to be brought by the very governments they have tried buy, for damages against nature, crops, and crimes against humanity, because as I stated before, these companies are not for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maybe it’s time to test the “science” before a jury, because labeling laws are a distraction from the real danger, the danger to life and the environment.

       I find this testimony in Kauai by Dr. Pang to be most interesting. Dr. Pang is the  Maui County Department of Health District Officer, he graduated with honors from Princeton University in Chemistry, he has an MD Degree and a Masters Degree from Tulane, he worked 24 years with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, he also worked as a consultant for 20 years with the WHO (World Health Organization) in Geneva where he founded the program on training researchers. I have just named a few of his credentials. He is highly educated and is a very outspoken opponent on the biotech industry here and beyond. He is one of the people filing the lawsuit against biotech in Maui county. His testimonies are quite intriguing.

       I couldn't watch it all, but basically the first guy is saying, they want to know what they are spraying on the crops, so when people get sick, they can test for the chemicals being sprayed, and so they can set limits on how much can be sprayed during specific wind conditions.

       The person to whom I responded stated that "they" (whomever "they" are) designed a slow death for "us".
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the numbers indicate that people are living longer and dying at a slower rate than they ever have.
      </p>
      <p>
       This indicates the person to whom I replied doesn't understand the facts or is just imagining shit to be afraid of.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you wrote there doesn't in any way refute what I wrote. The simple fact is, if "they" are trying to kill "us", "they" are doing a piss poor job of it.

       The truth is buddy, we are killing ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must say though, ever since they did those emission laws to reduce road pollution, I've been much more happy. Do you ever remember what it was before they did that riding a bike on the road. You know, before they made bicycle lanes, and so on?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a "they". That is industry. If you buy commercial products, then we are "they".

       As for longevity, yeah medicine can cure a host of issues it couldn't in the past, and people that should be dead and gone, are celebrating additional years to their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what I am guessing, is that, instead of us living to 80, we could probably be living to 90 or 100.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, yeah, I'm one of those people that think humans could live a few centuries worth of life down the road.

        Cambridge University geneticist Aubrey de Grey has famously stated, “The first person to live to be 1,000 years old is certainly alive today …whether they realize it or not, barring accidents and suicide, most people now 40 years or younger can expect to live for centuries.”
