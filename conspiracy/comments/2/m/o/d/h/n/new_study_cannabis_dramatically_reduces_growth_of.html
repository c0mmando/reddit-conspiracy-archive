<p><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/cannabis-dramatically-reduces-growth-brain-cancer-cells-new-study/">From Natural Society</a>:</p>

<p>Cannabis has already been proven to treat cancer anecdotally in many people – some with leukemia, others with lymphoma. But what’s gaining the most spotlight is how cannabis is able to eradicate brain cancer. In a recent study, researchers at the University of London have found that cannabis helps to ‘dramatically reduce’ the growth of new brain cancer cells.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sgul.ac.uk/media/latest-news/cannabis-extract-can-have-dramatic-effect-on-brain-cancer-says-new-research">The research showed</a> that two active chemical components found in cannabis plants, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), helped in the treatment of cancerous brain tumors. </p>

<p>This is one of the most difficult types of cancer to treat effectively, and the rate of survival for patients who get brain cancer is often very low. For many – once they receive a diagnosis – they are given a short five years to live; any hope of living after their prognosis is given a mere 10% chance. Those are some stark statistics.</p>

<p>It’s promising that a team of researchers was able to treat brain tumors in mice in a variety of ways, either without any treatment, using the cannabinoids alone, using irradiation alone, or with the cannabinoids and irradiation at the same time.</p>

<p>Complimenting other research finding <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/cannabis-cures-brain-cancer-zero-psychoactive-effects/">cannabis can treat brain cancer with zero psychoactive effects,</a> the researchers with this most recent study have found that the active compounds in cannabis (THC and CBD) in combination with irradiation were able to ‘dramatically slow down’ brain tumor growth in mice.</p>

<p>Dr. Wai Liu, Senior Research Fellow and lead researcher on the project, described the results as “extremely exciting.”</p>

<p>“Those treated with both irradiation and the cannabinoids saw the most beneficial results and a drastic reduction in size. In some cases, the tumours effectively disappeared in the animals. This augurs well for further research in humans in the future. – this is a mostly fatal disease at the moment.</p>

<p>The benefits of the cannabis plant elements were known before but the drastic reduction of brain cancers if used with irradiation is something new and may well prove promising for patients who are in gravely serious situations with such cancers in the future.”</p>

<p>Truly, the extracts of cannabis – namely utilized through cannabis oil – can help treat cancerous cells without radiation. But at least those who choose to combine alternative health solutions with the pharmaceutical paradigm can expect better recovery rates than if they utilized radiation and chemo alone.</p>

<p>While the study is reported <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cannabis-extracts-can-dramatically-slow-growth-of-brain-cancer-tumours-9863097.html">in a mainstream publication,</a> and still advocates for radiation treatment along with the use of cannabis – it is a step in the right direction to promote the obvious medical miracle that cannabis keeps showing itself to be.</p>

<p>Here are 4 more studies showing how <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/4-studies-marijuana-treat-brain-cancer/">marijuana treats brain cancer.</a>
What exactly are cannabinoids?</p>

<p>About <a href="http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org/factsheets/cannabinoids.htm#sthash.0caE6WJi.dpuf">66 compounds unique to Cannabis sativa</a> have been classified as ‘cannabinoids’ of the 480 natural components of the plant. Researchers are just starting to understand a portion of these plant components.</p>

<p>The effects of THC are thought to be moderated by the influence of the other components of the plant, most particularly the cannabinoids.</p>

<p>The cannabinoids are separated into subclasses:</p>

<p>Cannabigerols (CBG)</p>

<p>Cannabichromenes (CBC)</p>

<p>Cannabidiols (CBD)</p>

<p>Tetrahydrocannabinols (THC)</p>

<p>Cannabinol (CBN) and cannabinodiol (CBDL)</p>

<p>Other cannabinoids (such as cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabielsoin (CBE), cannabitriol (CBT) and other miscellaneous types).</p>

<p>“CBD is probably the most abundant cannabinoid, contributing up to 40% of cannabis resin. Interestingly, CBD may actually have anti-anxiety effects and lessen the psychoactive effects of THC.”</p>

<p>Far from just causing psychological changes in a person, the active plant compounds in cannabis are now even reversing brain cancer. This plant’s benefits are simply amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think there is medicinal value in the high terpine content, if what they are saying is true.</p>

<p><a href="http://terpenes.weebly.com/">http://terpenes.weebly.com/</a></p>

<p><em>-over 120 different terpenes can be manufactured by Cannabis, some only in trace amounts with others in double-digit percentage</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-medical-uses-of-terpenes.htm">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-medical-uses-of-terpenes.htm</a></p>

<p><em>Terpenes are hydrocarbon compounds found in plants most commonly associated with essential oils and represent many pharmaceutical uses. These chemicals form the basis of some antiseptics, expectorants, gastrointestinal drugs, and pain relievers. Terpenes also show promise as an antioxidant.</em></p>

<p>Unsure if the terpines are doing it, but it&#39;s something to maybe consider.</p>

<p><strong>Marijuana stops child&#39;s severe seizures</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;They weren&#39;t calling it epilepsy,&quot; Paige said. &quot;We just thought it was one random seizure. They did a million-dollar work-up -- the MRI, EEG, spinal tap -- they did the whole work-up and found nothing. And sent us home.&quot;
A week later, Charlotte had another seizure. This one was longer, and it was only the beginning. Over the next few months, Charlotte -- affectionately called Charlie -- had frequent seizures lasting two to four hours, and she was hospitalized repeatedly.</em></p>

<p><em>Doctors were stumped. Her blood tests were normal. Her scans were all normal.</em></p>

<p><strong>Terpenes Influence The Synergy Effect Of Cannabis</strong></p>

<p><em>Terpenoids can be used for more than countering THC-induced anxiety. Russo discussed interactions to treat a number of issues including: pain, inflammation, depression, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, and infections.</em></p>

<p>????</p>

<p>Well, looks like people are suspecting anti-cancer properties with terepines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17576427">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17576427</a></p>

<p><em>Terpenes represent one of the largest and most diverse classes of secondary metabolites, with over 55,000 members isolated to date. The terpene cyclase enzymes used in nature convert simple, linear hydrocarbon phosphates into an exotic array of chiral, carbocyclic skeletons. Further oxidation and rearrangement results in an almost endless number of conceivable structures. The enormous structural diversity presented by this class of natural products ensures a broad range of biological properties-ranging from anti-cancer and anti-malarial activities to tumor promotion and ion-channel binding.</em></p>

<p>I am no chemist. I can&#39;t understand it all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharecare.com/health/cancer-prevention/what-are-terpenes">http://www.sharecare.com/health/cancer-prevention/what-are-terpenes</a></p>

<p><em>Perillyl alcohol are the most widely tested terpenes. In animal studies, they have been shown to provide considerable benefits against a wide number of cancers. Both of these terpenes are being investigated in humans with advanced cancers; the preliminary results are encouraging.</em></p>

<p>So you can&#39;t ask &#39;why?&#39; to the guy that posts the tripe all the time trying to influence peoples idea/stance on the subject. There is not context to base an idea on in the post.

<p>This post is just garbage anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the fact that you blatantly just discount it without a reason.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  But it&#39;s my opinion that exposing or discussing some of the benefits of cannabis that have been suppressed is essential to understanding the conspiracies surrounding it that I was talking about.  It&#39;s one thing to know that there was a conspiracy to demonize cannabis, it&#39;s another to know that <em>and also know why</em> - which I think OPs like this help to do.</p>

<p>I also see people in almost every thread on this sub saying, &quot;What&#39;s the conspiracy?!?!?!&quot; even when it&#39;s obvious so I&#39;m a little more sensitive to it now when I see it.</p>

<p>Once again, great point. Since there is nothing in this article to tie it into conspiracies, that is what I took issue with.</p>

<p>There is no discernible conspiracy to speak of on the information presented by OP. Regardless, I&#39;m just pointing out a rather obvious (IMO) non-story on the front page.</p>

<p>Nothing more, nothing less. </p>
