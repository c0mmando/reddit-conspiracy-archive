       I have heard from a documentary that Russia has the Tesla "scalar" weapon. It is like an advanced form of HAARPish Technology I think. I'm No expert but; What if the recent Saudi oil overproduction to hurt Russia's economy is forcing the latter to use weather modification on the US currently. Every state is freezing or below right now. Anyway it is kind of cooky, let me know what you think.

       I have no idea if Russia is doing anything to affect global weather or has the potential to do so, but as a Russian i'll tell you that 2, maybe 3 years ago when Russia had extreme heat waves and droughts everyone including the mass media was blaming US HAARP technology for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am more inclined to think that we are living in an increasingly paranoid world with increasingly unpredictable weather patterns and our ever-opposing leaders will use any excuse to blame one another.

       Also, cold weather isn't so bad, you get used to it.

       Interesting that the mass media had a role in conspiracy theory. I couldn't imagine CNN or FOX news blaming Russian Scalar weaponry for "Superstorm Sandy". I agree paranoia runs wild in the world today, no matter how cold it gets my vodka doesn't freeze YAY.

       Thanks, if you are wondering how I know English so well, it's because I have spent a good part of my adulthood years living in England and studying in an American university in London.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russians weren't really a welcome group in England even back in the year 2000, but despite that, instead of hanging out with Russians, I mostly hung around Americans because they always seemed like such a friendly bunch and we always seemed to have so much fun and for some reason I always just felt so much closer to Americans than I did to any of the Europeans, maybe it was because both Russians and Americans were a minority group, or maybe because I was accustomed to American culture more by watching all these American movies and cartoon when I was a kid,  regardless, I only have fond memories of these so called "enemies" and my time spent with them and there's no news media in the world today can persuade me to think that America as a nation wants to destroy Russia (this has been doing the rounds in Russia for a long time now).
      </p>
      <p>
       Funnily, when I was deciding on my next education step after finishing high school in Russia, I first applied to go to a college in USA, but USA embassy denied me entry because I couldn't name the exact courses I was going to take in the first year of a particular university of my choice, so when my visa got declined I opted to go to an American university in England. I guess there's a meaning in there somewhere. A detrimental role of the bureaucratic system maybe ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, i still keep in touch with quite a few of my American buddies and I never feel any hostility from them and I have had quite a few invites from them to come visit them, which probably shows that regular Americans don't feel in such a bad way about Russians as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Peace! P.S. don't succumb to global propaganda and paranoia!

       You might consider me a defeatist, but I honestly don't think it's possible for you or me to change anything in the global system. I think the current system is like the mythological Hydra, when one head is cut, the other grows in its place. Russia had many regime changes, from tsar, to communist to socialist-democracy to Putin, yet in all of them the regular people suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many influential people adapt and they stay in power regardless, it's funny to see that so many people who were the "elite" in communist times, have became the new "elite" under Yeltsin and if you look at the "elite" and people who are making up rules and regulations in parliament now, you can trace their name back a few generations, they dont just get to be in power because they were an honorary student at a top university.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say that alot has changed since communism for Russians, we got access to all the quality stuff from europe (technology, clothes) and we get to travel abroad and enjoy ourselves more. I was too young to remember life under communism, but when I talk with my grand-parents they always say how things were better back then and my parents also share their sentiment, I am not sure if that's exactly the case or if they just miss the times when they were younger, but I can deduct that if not better, at least it wasn't that much worse than it is today if they have such good memories about their evil communistic past.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, TLDR: I don't think that regular people can ever have a truly fair society, I see that despite their heritage and wealth, regular European people aren't that happy with their current situation either and neither are the American people who I talk to quite often. So, in all the vastness of economic and social differences it seems that regular people aren't in such a great position, how can that be ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the working class is just a term for "slave", hence our happiness is not a priority for the ruling class, their priority is to keep us occupied. A few thousand years back they used force to keep us working and when they realised it was too expensive to maintain slavemasters and revolts were too brutal and too frequent they had to adapt the system and it kept adapting until the slaves no longer realised that they were slaves, but in reality, that's what we are to the ruling class. And if the situation hasn't really changed at all in hundreds maybe thousands of years, how can we hope that it will change now ? I don't think it will :(

       Also, I am pretty sure that we are also "cannon fodder".
I can't  remember a time without a major crisis, let alone local wars.
Warring fractions are constantly fighting over territories and they brainwash their citizens to wage their wars for them.
It's win-win for them, they get to reduce world population and they get to play their little power games.

       I doubt Russia is doing it. If anyone is fucking with the weather in the US, it's the US itself.

       However, the
       <em>
        Soviets
       </em>
       and the US almost definitely had some "scalar" battles during the 80's and 90's and possibly earlier.

       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/12gye2/dae_remember_the_1989_loma_prieta_earthquake_in/">
        Check out this post I made a few years ago
       </a>
       on the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On September 12, 1989, sensors called magnetometers, (at Corralitos, near Monterrey Bay, California) detected unusual ULF (between 0.01 Hz and 10 Hz--the lowest ELF frequencies) radio signals, which grew 30 times stronger October 5, and then weakened somewhat.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 2:00pm on October 17, the signals grew so strong that they went off of the sensor's scales. Three hours later, the San Francisco Bay area shook violently as the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake killed more than 60 people and injured 3800 others.
       </p>
       <p>
        The catastrophic January 17, 1994 Los Angeles earthquake was also preceded by mysterious radio signals. Some observers in Los Angeles reported hearing two loud "sonic booms" (which are typical symptoms of Soviet Tesla weapons usage) immediately before the earthquake.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then there's Aum Shinrikyo:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm inclined to believe that exotic warfare has been going on for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the scalar stuff is old news by now. I'm sure they have planet-busting shit at this point.

       Mother nature is the ultimate scapegoat. See Haiti in 2010 and Japan in 2011.

       more or less the color ramp represents deviation from "normal". Red shows areas of abnormally high pressure, purple shows areas of abnormally low pressure. Since they are to some extent similar, we can expect the weather associated with them to be the same.

       Did it say it's freezing everywhere on the news?  That would be some pretty suspicious messaging.  It's supposed to be up to the low 80s in the afternoon here.

       No, the low today was 52, and the low tonight is supposed to be 56.  I think you must've been shown an exaggerated map or something.  Big Coat is trying to boost sales :).
