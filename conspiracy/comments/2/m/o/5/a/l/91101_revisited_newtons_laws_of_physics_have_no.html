       -------------------------------------------------------THE AIRPORTS
      </p>
      <p>
       19 alleged terrorists (to be referred just as terrorists from now on) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.
Of those 3,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">
        one of the recordings
       </a>
       (which will be named Dulles from now on) that was only
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5485376/ns/us_news-security/t/sept-panelcriticizes-dullessecurity-screeners/">
        released in 2004
       </a>
       poses a serious problem:
      </p>
      <p>
       At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (including the Pentagons') only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the Dulles was recording at +12FPS(if I am not mistaken) and has no timestamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">
        Dulles
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNVWpjOjLe0">
        Portland, Maine
       </a>
       ) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.
The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">
        constant tracking via CCTV
       </a>
       of the navy yard shooting using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.
Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       --------------------------------------------------------THE HIJACKS
      </p>
      <p>
       Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;t=46">
        -7500-
       </a>
       is the code for
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=57d_1392620694">
        hijacking
       </a>
       and it takes 3s to input and send.
Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.
The alleged Flight11's FDR shows that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;t=251">
        the airplane was too high
       </a>
       to have struck the lamp posts.
Todd Beamer, one of Flight93's passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5Vx2cxf.jpg">
        at 9:43 AM
       </a>
       ) when in fact this event had already happened
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">
        ~20 minutes earlier.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       --------------------------------------------------------
       <strong>
        THE CRASHES
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -------------------------THE PENTAGON-------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 2 cameras recorded an object crashing into the Pentagon, one recorded only a flash.
The 2 cameras that recorded the object show a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EvtM7nN.jpg">
        white smoke
       </a>
       coming from the object that the Flight77 could not have produced:
      </p>
      <p>
       Engine damage from lamp-posts impact: Not possible, airplane engine smoke produces a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE">
        thin and dark smoke
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn't catch fire when the airplane exploded,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dJkv2XB.jpg">
        the lawn has no jetfuel burn marks.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrails: Not possible seen that the humidity levels were not enough, corroborated by the lack of those on both airplanes that crashed into the twin towers
      </p>
      <p>
       Condensation: Not possible, same reason as contrails
      </p>
      <p>
       Rocket/missile-like smoke: Strongly resembles the smoke produced by
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WXrH3vv.jpg">
        missiles/rockets
       </a>
       and
       <strong>
        might
       </strong>
       explain why Pentagon personnel stated that they noticed the
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Even+before+stepping+outside+I+could+smell+the+cordite">
        smell of cordite
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These 2 cameras have all frames perfectly synchronized -including the moment of the high speed explosion- except the one where the object enters the frame. According to the cameras, the airplane existed in 2 different places in the same moment of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       -------------------------THE PENNSYLVANIA---------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CvyJNQw.png">
        engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site.
       </a>
       This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The engine that was buried under the ground was
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4IcZzuY.jpg">
        compressed along it's length under ~3 and half feet of dirt.
       </a>
       This engine had a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r0dxyQB.jpg">
        clam shell
       </a>
       of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmTLqpx.gif">
        flying on the opposite direction
       </a>
       and not the one officially told. This also fits
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF5vSXo.png">
        Val MacClatchey's testimony of the plane path.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Val MacClatchey's famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that is
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P0bEagi.jpg">
        consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.
       </a>
       When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">
        another witness.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast with Flight 93, here is an airplane crash of a Boeing 737-200 of 17,November 2013 that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUV3xRIraU">
        nose dived
       </a>
       in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan_Airlines_Flight_363#Crash">
        70º
       </a>
       and still had plenty of
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509388/Video-shows-Boeing-737-plane-crash-Russia-killing-50-people.html">
        easily identifiable airplane parts
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/">
        both engines were found in the same location.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you can see more airplane crashes comparisons with Flight 93 and see how unique Flight 93 was.

       ----------------------------------------------------------THE CALLS
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">
        Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick's.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Todd Beamer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Flight 93 hijack occured at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">
         9:28
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Todd Beamer's call describes the hijack about to happen at
        <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">
         9:43
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Flight 93 crashed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">
         10:03
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Todd Beamer's call made with an airphone last for
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">
         3925 seconds.
        </a>
        It last 45 minutes
        <em>
         after
        </em>
        the plane had already crashed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost:
        <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">
         "We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent."
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Jeremy Glick:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Call starts at 9:37
       </p>
       <p>
        Flight 93 crashes at 10:03
       </p>
       <p>
        Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes
        <em>
         after
        </em>
        the plane had already crashed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These calls were made from the airplane's airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE's assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to "stay connected" when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have "disconnected" at the same time, the time of the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">
        ACARS data also corroborates the above,
       </a>
       seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       --------------------------------------------
       <strong>
        THE TOWERS' COLLAPSES
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -------------------------SOUTH TOWER--------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton's First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">
        this was the expected movement of the top
       </a>
       if it was simply collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton's third law.
      </p>
      <p>
       -------------------------NORTH TOWER--------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;t=26">
        debris fall occuring on the right face of the building.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton's third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact
       <del>
        93%
       </del>
       83% (92 floors).
      </p>
      <p>
       According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within
        <strong>
         12s
        </strong>
        , the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">
        NIST file NCSTAR1 section 2.9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that
       <em>
        -according to NIST-
       </em>
       all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).
      </p>
      <p>
       Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in
       <strong>
        0.029s
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>

        1000ths
       </strong>
       of a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to NIST, each floor -composed by concrete and steel- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the top being only ~
       <strong>
        16%
       </strong>
       of the building (weaker and lighter), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining

       83% perfectly intact structure (
       <em>
        stronger as well
       </em>
       ) defying yet again another law of physics -Newton's third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: for every floor of the
       <del>
        93%
       </del>
       83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton's third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.

       It's not so much that 9/11 was an inside job, an isolated event. It's what it tells us. Consider the implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our own government attacked us, killing nearly 3,000, and using it as justification for killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent people. Nearly every corporate media outlet helped cover for them.

       Building 7 was hit by the debris
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">
        from one of the collapses
       </a>
       which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">
        top to bottom gash.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the presence of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">
        large quantities of smoke,
       </a>
       there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg">
        soot in the windows
       </a>
       are the indicator of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">
        fires that were already extinct.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">
        3 floors
       </a>
       and they were only partial small fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7's small office fires, here you have an example of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">
        normal office fires
       </a>
       (or just plain office fires) and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">
        extreme office fires
       </a>
       (or
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">
        infernos
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time that the collapse initiated
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">
        there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.
       </a>
       This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (
       <em>
        18 visible stories in 3.9s
       </em>
       ), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.

       There was also
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">
        a loud explosion
       </a>
       that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure "snapping" or "failing" because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn't possibly be from a column failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers' debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:

       The acceleration of gravity would not be enough to cause a net gain in acceleration, given that there is a massive steel and concrete structure resisting acceleration. There's a reason steel is used for sky scrapers and not pure concrete, one reason being steel can bend and absorb stress that would otherwise pulverize concrete. The top section of the building would face a nonuniform, yielding resistance that would make it impossible for the falling section to pulverize every floor in the uniform way it did. If I drop a cinder block on a steel wire rectangular structure would you expect the structure to be flattened, let alone pulverized?

      <p>
       Possibly - but the impact would cause similar damage to both the lower parts of the upper portion

       the upper parts of the lower portion.

        Sort of like this.
       </a>
       . Notice that both the stationary body and the moving body, being of similar construction, sustained similar damage? Why would this not be the case with the twin towers? Why would the force not dissipate among both the upper
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       lower portions of the buildings during the impact, pulverizing both simultaneously?

       Unless you can explain how encountering resistance (friction) results in acceleration, rather than deceleration, your theory is bunk.

       How does the lower part get destroyed one floor at a time while the top part acts as a singular mass?  The top floors would be destroyed at nearly 1:1 with the bottom floors. The top floors are composed of the exact same structure as the lower floors. If we consider nearly all the heat from the fires traveled upwards and "weakened the steel and caused the trusses to sag" (as NIST puts it) the top mass would actually have a considerably weaker structure than the fully intact lower 84 floors.  The top mass can only accelerate through something offering negligible resistance, in this case something nearly 10x as massive and composed of the exact same material is not negligible resistance.

       So let's say that 9-11 is proven to be very different from the official version (i.e. black flag).
      </p>
      <p>
       What next? Do you think that the truth will disrupt in any way those pulling the strings?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, even if you take the official version for true, was it not a massive failure from the security services that should have led to resignations, firings and other impeachments?

       While I do respect the amount of effort of the people trying to uncover the truth, I am very much disillusioned as to the power or willingness of the American citizens to affect how their country is run.

       Transponder codes are public knowledge and the transponder control panel is easily accessible from behind the seats.
If I was intending to hijack an aircraft and keep it secret for as long as possible, the transponder Mode A control panel would be the very first thing I'd cover in the cockpit.

       It is correct, with the top falling over it would have carried on with its trajectory taking into consideration the onset of free fall at different points in time it had the possibility to crush an adjacent building; there also would have been a much larger debris pile regardless
