<p>What is a limited hangout? Combine MKULTRA (psy-op) with COINTELPRO (combating dissent) with Operation Mockingbird (propaganda)</p>

<p>The biggest sign that Snowden&#39;s limited hangout is that he&#39;s been given so much coverage on the MSM (anything on there, they want you to know for a reason)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naomi Wolf: &quot;But do consider that in Eastern Germany, for instance, it was the fear of a machine of surveillance that people believed watched them at all times — rather than the machine itself — that drove compliance and passivity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I do believe Snowden is a limited hangout. Like every good limited hangout, it produces some good. i.e. the public becomes more broadly aware of some issue and some percentage of them follow the cookie trail down the rabbit hole (to mix a metaphor). But it also tells us nothing fundamentally new and obscures some very important aspects of the intelligence/surveillance complex, specifically the role of the CIA who Snowden &quot;used to&quot; work for and still claims allegiance to.</p>

<p>I plan on doing an interview with Douglas Valentine on the CIA angle of the Snowden story in particular and a more in-depth podcast documenting the psyop in general, but in the meantime you can see this editorial I wrote for the International Forecaster:</p>

<p><a href="http://theinternationalforecaster.com/International_Forecaster_Weekly/Snowden_Mission_Accomplished">http://theinternationalforecaster.com/International_Forecaster_Weekly/Snowden_Mission_Accomplished</a></p>

<p>And my work on &quot;the panopticon&quot; and the conditioning of the public to accept total surveillance:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/?s=panopticon">http://www.corbettreport.com/?s=panopticon</a></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>some think its a NSAvCIA turf war, i think its the panopticon thing</p>

<p>they need us to be scared</p>

<p>also, MOST americans dont know who snowden is, let alone omidyar. they just got the message that big brother spies on them... so they change their behavior</p>

<p>TPTB used Snowden to let the 99% know just how powerful was/is their surveillance technology.</p>

<p>TPTB&#39;s surveillance technology is so powerful and advanced, that the majority of the 99% didn&#39;t even know about the extent to which they/we were/are being surveilled. How could you hope to scare the shit out of the sheep you control if the power you have over them is so advanced that they&#39;re not even AWARE of it?</p>

<p>You have to make them aware of your ability and power over them first, right?</p>

<p>How else are you going to keep them scared and intimidated if they don&#39;t even know the big bad wolf is always watching them?</p>

<p>Enter a stool pigeon that puts forth just enough of a limited hangout to let everyone know that &quot;Yes. TPTB are that advanced in their technology.&quot; but doesn&#39;t really tell the people anything that wasn&#39;t already available and public knowledge before hand. Just give the pigeon enough of a platform that he&#39;ll be listened to exclusively.
This is exactly what&#39;s happened w/Snowden.</p>

<p>That dude has gotten so much frickin&#39; press over this whole issue, and yet he hasn&#39;t actually made any real mention of just HOW advanced the technology really is. What he&#39;s mentioned has kind of been out in the mainstream for a while now. He just consolidated it for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Now that Snowden has said what he&#39;s said NOW everyone is scared and up in arms about &quot;government surveillance!!&quot; The sheeple are even MORE scared of the big bad wolf now than ever before now that they know that big brother&#39;s been watching them this whole time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s been the main point behind Snowden&#39;s info. He&#39;s an agent TPTB have used to keep the people all the more controlled and scared and agitated and on edge than before. After all, a people on edge and in conflict and agitated are a people much, much easier to control.</p>

<p>And Greenwald? He&#39;s just the delivery mechanism&#39;s delivery mechanism.</p>

<p>A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I believe Snowden is a limited hangout, I don&#39;t push it on this sub because I believe it is an issue that has been identified by JTRIG operators as a wedge issue that will be of use to them causing endless arguments and fighting on this sub. I see commentators on this thread both of the Snowden is a limited hangout variety and of the Snowden couldn&#39;t be a limited hangout variety get caught up in what seem to me to be manufactured dramas. To me the question is not important enough and is too difficult to pin down one way or the other to be worth my time. To a person new to conspiracies, the public version of Snowden, the government is spying on you version, is a big enough challenge to their understanding of the world without adding the conspiracy within a conspiracy aspect that Snowden as a psyop adds. Yes I would like to be able to examine the motivations for some of the things Snowden has said that seem to make more sense to me if you accept Snowden as an insider. His comments about how if the public accept surveillance then surveillance is okay for example. But at the end of the day I would rather not piss off the many genuine people here who get their backs up once the discussion comes up. Whether you believe Snowden is a genuine whistle blower, a true hero, a spy or a dupe I think we can all agree that mass surveillance is a bad thing. Fighting over how we arrived at that position just seems pointless to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answer would be that r/conspiracy members have a tendency to focus on content instead of form. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this most of the time. But with a limited-hangout psyop, the partial revelation of information is what serves as the distraction.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when a strength can become a weakness. We hate the idea of universal surveillance. So it&#39;s easy to focus on whatever Snowden (as a putative whistleblower) has to say about it. Not so easy, is to focus on how he&#39;s saying it, or to notice what he <em>hasn&#39;t</em> mentioned.</p>

<p>One other point of interest. A limited hangout protects the secret-keeper against a more complete (and unwanted) disclosure. So if Snowden is a hangout, and he&#39;s told us about PRISM, Five eyes and universal email and cell monitoring.... What could possibly be left that they don&#39;t want the world to find out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s damning what Snowden&#39;s not talking about. V2K is especially damning. The Army let it slip that they can put subliminal or audible voices directly into people&#39;s minds with a &quot;neuroelectromagnetic device&quot; here: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/">http://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/</a></p>

<p>The DC Navy Yard Shooter literally had &quot;My ELF Weapon&quot; carved into his shotgun, saying he was being harrassed with electromagnetic weapons. More interestingly it slipped out in official documents from 2006 that the Undersecretary of the Navy was the approval authority for experiments involving &quot;severe and unusual physical and psychological intrusions including consciousness altering drugs and mind control techniques.&quot; They even discuss bypassing normal human consent for these experiments. <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/valtin/tag/navy/">http://my.firedoglake.com/valtin/tag/navy/</a></p>

<p>Then someone shoots up the navy yard claiming to be being abused by mind control weapons and no one&#39;s asking exactly what the fuck kind of &quot;mind control&quot; experiments they are doing?! </p>

<p>Snowden&#39;s telling us the tip of the iceberg in the hopes that the populace will be appeased- happy and content knowing that even within some shady spy organizations there are people with a conscious who will alert the masses when they really step over the line, by like snooping our emails. </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t he mentioned V2K? Why is he continuing the charade that one can be secure on the internet at all considering TEMPEST and Van Eck Phreaking? The Dutch government doesn&#39;t allow electronic voting anymore because it&#39;s common enough knowledge that anything on a computer screen can be duplicated exactly by analyzing the EM emanations the screen puts off. This could be done at the distance of miles by the CIA decades ago. Van Eck did it with $20 in radio equipment in the 80s at the distance of several hundred yards IIRC. </p>

<p>Snowden is the waving left hand in the magician&#39;s trick, while the things the right hand are doing are so nefarious and terrible they are hardly to be believed. </p>

<p>One thing to note about the limited hangout is note who was pilloried--the NSA. Not the CIA, not the FBI. Nope, the NSA.

<p>This. Snowden basically confirmed (what Dan Brown first suggested to this redditor in <em>Digital Fortress</em> in 1998) that the NSA have access to <strong>everything</strong> and can do whatever they want with it. However, I believe that they were and still are more interested in what they can do with the data on a case-by-case basis, rather than it&#39;s usefulness as a behavioral modification tool.</p>

<p>If the intention of the NSA / CIA / TPTB is as suggested here, to use Snowden to intimidate and encourage self-correcting behavior, then they have failed miserably to understand basic human psychology, and how people (and governments) will always adapt their behavior to make detection of their true intentions more difficult. They also would have failed to foresee the (global) commercial blowback on all of the U.S. tech firms in bed with them. This would be astoundingly naive and difficult to imagine, even beyond the usual pale excuse of incompetence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: Digital Fortress</p>

<p>I have read that book too. It&#39;s an interesting premise, especially the part about a rotating cleartext. So interesting, in fact, that I went online to check it out.</p>

<p>Basically, Dan Brown is wrong about a few things. He  also takes certain liberties with facts in order to produce a more entertaining novel. </p>

<p>One idea in Digital Fortress that is probably on the right track is that awesome ultra-computer they use for decryption. I also think they&#39;re right about most encryption software having a back door that allows for quick and easy decryption.</p>

<p>This might very well be the secret that the Russians, Chinese and Americans would be willing to cooperate on. <em>Nobody&#39;s</em> encryption software is completely secure against the NSA and it&#39;s counterparts in other nations.</p>

<p>The best thing in the world (as suggested in Digital Fortress) is if everybody thinks their brand new encryption software makes their data unreadable. The reality may be the exact opposite. You encrypt something because you want to keep it secret. </p>

<p>To the NSA, encryption might very well be an advertisement that says &quot;Hey, come read me.... there&#39;s something good inside!!!&quot;</p>

<p>And what does <em>Snowden</em> have to say about encryption? Definitely something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting and to be clear, I believe that unbreakable encryption is possible. But I also think it&#39;s possible that all mainstream encryption software (regardless of the company&#39;s nationality) could contain a backdoor.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you start your own company and create an unbreakable software package that offers 2048 bit encryption. What&#39;s more, your software is affordable and available to the general public. That would mean anyone from drug dealers to terrorists could have completely secure communications.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to see any government being willing to tolerate this situation. So one day someone gives you a call and sets up a meeting.</p>

<p>At the meeting they let you in on how things are. &quot;We&#39;re from the NSA, and we need you to cooperate with us.&quot; To which you reply &quot;Go fuck yourself.... people are buying my product so they can have truly secure communications and privacy.&quot; To which they reply &quot;We appreciate your integrity, keep it up and we&#39;ll ruin your company and the cops are going to find kiddy porn on your computer when you get home from this meeting.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the wikilink! Here&#39;s some critical footnotes from the article:</p>

<p>&quot;Theoretical arguments in favor of rejecting the Foucauldian model of Panopticism may be considered under five general headings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Displacement of the Panoptical ideal by mechanisms of seduction,</li>
<li>Redundancy of the Panoptical impulse brought about by the evident durability of the self-surveillance functions which partly constitute the normal, socialized, ‘Western’ subject,</li>
<li>Reduction in the number of occasions of any conceivable need for Panoptical surveillance on account of simulation, prediction and action before the fact,</li>
<li>Supplementation of the Panopticon by the Synopticon,</li>
<li><strong>Failure of Panoptical control to produce reliably docile subjects</strong>.
 The fifth point concerns the <strong>self-defeating nature</strong> of Panoptical regimes. The failure of surveillance states is illustrated by examples such as &#39;prison riots, asylum sub-cultures, ego survival in Gulag or concentration camp, [and] retribalization in the Balkans.&#39; &quot; [1]</li>
</ol>

<p>More analysis (Bart Simon, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, <em>Surveillance &amp; Society</em>, 2005) can be found <a href="http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/Articles3%281%29/return.pdf">here</a>:</p>

<p>(excerpt) &quot;...we can at least see that structuring the seeing/being seen relationship alone is not enough to effect social control. Under a purely structural-deterministic model, <strong>people who are blind, ignorant or irrational would be immune to the effects of panoptic power.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TOh yeah, no disagreeing there. Its at the heart of the issue. </p>

<p>I try to unify people. To dispel polarity and vitriol. To control the division we are subjected to. Tired of the elite, the tools of control, the class hierarchy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe we can fix this world until after some major event, like economical collapse. Everybody is sick with cognitive dissonance because of the feeling of hopelessness. Once pushed over the ledge, I suspect the issues we have collectively campaigned on will be accepted.</p>

<p>My agenda is simple. To promote humanity. Because our current top of the chain sickens me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of users ignore comments and simply use reddit as a news source, not a forum. Silent nodding does occur. </p>

<p>I talk more about this shit with people in the streets. People are awar, and feel powerless, but are aware. To what extent, they protected their mental state with apathy, but its pretty much a consensus that things are fucked in a lot of places. We can&#39;t all protest, give up our responsibilities, and commit to the cause. But we silently nod. </p>

<p>So do not get disheartened, and maintain your patriotic duties, the fundamentals of democracy which we truly should employ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Snowden revelations were what originally brought me to r/conspiracy.  The coverage on this subreddit for that set of incidents was better than anywhere else.  It was kinda crazy sitting in front of the tv watching news about snowden, reading r/conspiracy on the computer, then updating the other people in the room with breaking revelations that they&#39;d soon be seeing on tv.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that much of what was supposedly released by Snowden may have actually come from the infamous second leaker, and Snowden was a smokescreen used to protect him/her so that the gov&#39;t would potentially drop their guard while going after snowden.  On snowden being a company man, I think his initial choice of Hong Kong as a destination, and his ability to stay hidden there for awhile, gave that away completely.  HK is CIA turf.  They had a safehouse ready for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m0xzv/the_verdict_is_in_on_edward_snowden/">This post</a> was made just a couple days ago. So far lots of opinions, many stated as foregon conclusions, like you said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest sign that Snowden&#39;s limited hangout is that he&#39;s been given so much coverage on the MSM </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but just understand that&#39;s your opinion. Is Ron Paul limited hangout too? He receives lots of coverage, and he openly questions 911 and calls for an end to the fed. I agree that he is <em>incredibly</em> marginalized, but he is a household name and receives a lot of begrudging media coverage. Regardless I think it is an important issue to discuss, and I welcome questions being raised about anyone and anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people should REALLY be focusing on is how most popular social movements have actually been engineered by NWO puppets, from feminism to libertarianism to neoconservatism. But a lot of people here seem to be stuck thinking these obvious NWO ploys are actually GOOD. When will people learn to make the default assumption, which is that EVERYTHING we are told is a lie, and ALL popular movements and so-called &quot;progress&quot; is to be distrusted. The French Revolution was a Judeo-Masonic plot, for example, and so was the American Revolution. Hitler was a Zionist Jew. The history is a lie. These are the important things people should be thinking about, the things that tie it all together. Not Snowden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett suggests that Snowden is primarily: &#39;a) diverting attention from the long line of more damning NSA whistleblowers who preceded him, and b) steering the conversation into a limited hangout dead end about <em>metadata</em>.&#39;</p>

<p>No doubt that there is more damning material (as Snowden himself freely admits) that he either a) <strong>did not</strong> copy or download, or b) <strong>did not</strong> hand over, or otherwise c) <strong>did not</strong> have (higher-level) access to. Nevertheless, I&#39;d like to know more about these so-called &#39;<em>more damning</em>&#39; programs that Corbett alludes to and, more specifically, <strong>how</strong> they are more damaging than the cumulative Snowden leaks regarding programs like PRISM, Boundless Informant, Tempora, XKeyscore, MUSCULAR, Turbine, and Monster Mind, among others, including the damage done in relation to leaks about spying on political allies and international companies?</p>

<p>Finally, I don&#39;t see where anyone has been &quot;steering the conversation into a limited hangout dead end about metadata&quot;. On the contrary, it has become <strong>quite clear</strong> in the past year (to anyone paying attention) that this is all about <strong>much more</strong> than <em>metadata</em>. </p>
