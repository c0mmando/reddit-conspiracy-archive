       Several people were being assholes in the announcement thread because they don't like/believe Karen's PoV.  They were such huge assholes that Karen cancelled her AMA.

       Not sure it's worth getting that chapped over. Let the vote-based system work, no? She's been slow-dripped around here for some time, so it's not like we need a permanent sticky to understand the message she so despirately needs to share to this crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your anger is rooted in the fact you had to pull down a stickied post, and that made the mod(s) look bad. Understandable. The name-calling seems a bit sophomoric, though.

       No my anger is rooted in the fact that we are trying to make this community a better place by setting up direct access between our members and the semi-celebrities of the greater conspiracy community, and then our members have rudely scared off our guests.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have hundreds of people who wanted to ask Karen questions about her experiences and a handful who wanted to out her as a [disinfo tool]â€¦
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy doesn't exist to out people as tools or wage war upon their ideas and opinions.  Its pretty fucking simple, if you aren't interested in a specific conspiracy theory then fuck off to one you are interested in.  We have enough problems with self proclaimed intellectual superiors trying to "shut down the retards before they poison people's minds" from conspiratard without our own  members fracturing off into little cliques that serve no other purpose than to piss in each other's conversations until nobody gets to talk about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AMA getting canceled makes the members here look bad, not the mods.

       Have a great day!

       Seems more like she canceled because the mods censored her, not because of anyone else.

       Since you were the one banned, and also the one who thought it was a good question I thought I would give you a chance to answer it yourself... seeing how you seem to be desperately trying to make an issue out of.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's start at the top shall we!
      </p>
      <p>
       Karen doesn't understand that /conspiracy is a separate entity from /news where she was censored.  She also doesn't/didn't understand that upon the start time and date of her scheduled AMA that she was required to make the AMA post herself so that she would receive the replies to her account...
      </p>
      <p>
       Karen thought that a mod mail she sent to us would basically have us edit our pre-ama announcement with a big conversation starter, even though she didn't actually ask us to do anything with it...
      </p>
      <p>
       That was all a big misunderstanding as you can see in her user history the comment she claims was censored 4 times, exists 3 times in /conspiracy... the missing 4th time was posted in /news and deleted by one of their fascist mods.  Something the mods here can do nothing about...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now about the ban, you were the user I banned for posting how you can't wait to [out this disinfo tool] and immediately created a hostile environment for our guest and she replied to you directly and stated that you were the reason she cancelled her AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also unbanned you because you appealed at the time and sounded like you understood why your behavior was inappropriate. A decision that I'm starting to regret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a 20 day old account trying to misrepresent the whole situation by cherry picking comments and pointing all fingers at the mods here and you seem happily amused to entertain his nonsense and take the spotlight off of yourself.

       If I was "desperately trying to make an issue of it", I could have posted pictures of my correspondence with you and with the other mods, but I won't because it's over and it's not that big of a deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why I said "that's a good question" is because you said

       A couple people questioned her credibility (myself included) and she felt that what she sent to the mods was censored in her post.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was talking about how the UK and City of London have been subservient to the Vatican and how the US is still a British colony to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this is true actually makes me question whether she's disinfo after all, as did her response to me in that very thread when I expressed my skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty bummed that she won't be doing the AMA but, at the same time, she had to expect that people would question her and ask her the tough questions no?  Especially based on the nature of who she is and what she's talking about?

       I understand that there is room for this kind of discussion, but when you mix the worlds of the metaphysical discussion and real world, practical conversations (like how QE affects the economy), you should have to present extraordinary evidence if you make extraordinary claims. She does not.

       She backed away from talking about that too much, as it's not essential to the financial discussion and presents a credibility barrier for most people. And she's not trying to be an expert on non-human life forms; she just says they exist and are at the heart of the financial crisis. Could just have easily been the Swedes. Damn Swedes.

       It's pretty telling that she chose to throw a hissyfit and leave instead of stick around and defend her position. I mean, she's allegedly got information that can change the world and she lets words from anonymous people scare her away?

       Your perspective is based upon a belief that you have - based, in great part, by the manipulation that has taken place on this planet - that the Earth is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       inhabited by beings just as if not more intelligent than homo sapien sapien.
      </p>
      <p>
       That belief is likely incorrect, but it is indeed widely held amongst a great majority of the homo sapien species here.  The unanimity of that belief leads you and many to believe that someone like Hudes "could not possibly be correct" in what she's saying, when the fact of the matter (and the great irony) is that you are actually being more uncritical in what you say than she is being in what she says.

       You know what, I don't deny that there is a much more apt explanation as to reality than the one conclusion I have come to due to my own experiences. I never said that "Hudes could not possibly correct" (I usually try to use quotation marks only when there is an actual quote), in fact, I will concede that there is the distinct possibility she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       correct. However, that doesn't change the fact that she, in her own words, is only going by hearsay that these people exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. But generally when people make a claim like "there are 1.75
       <em>
        million
       </em>
       metric tonnes of gold in a trust that will be opened that will back all the world's currencies", forgive me I'm a little skeptical when the only proof is word of mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I even care? Because people who really subscribe to these theories, people who other wise are already aware of the corruption and manipulations that go on daily, think that they are going to be saved by these anonymous characters. These people who could have otherwise been skilled truth speakers fall into the pit of ambiguity and apathy and start to believe anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is exactly what disinfo is; speaking the truth ~90% of the time and lie the other 10.

       She is going by the type of "hearsay" that is based on and comes from reliable enough sources to move forward with.  The type of "hearsay" that she  is working with can also be looked upon as and called "reliable information".
      </p>

       I'm not necessarily saying that the information she got from her sources is "100% correct".  Of course not.  However, I'm also not saying that the information is "100%"

       correct simply because it was transfered verbally.

       And why is it that you are "skeptical" of that?  Is it because you grew up watching an MSM that has told you that that is an unlikely amount for
       <em>
        anyone

       Let me give you a little bit of information:  By your very own definition here, it can then be said that pretty much
       <strong>
        <em>
         100%
        </em>
       </strong>
       of all the information on this very PLANET is disinfo.  Almost NOTHING here is "100% correct".  Almost EVERYTHING has quite a bit of ambiguity, vagueness, confusion (purposeful or accidental) and requires further digging and critical thinking to confirm or get a better idea about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be a critical thinker and learn how to sift the wheat from the chaff ON YOUR OWN.  No one can do it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that I've spent MAAANY years doing a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of research, and - even though I may very well be as lost as the next ignoramus - I've found that much of what Hudes says is very much corroborated and backed up by many other books and pieces of information that are out there.

       Not sure it's worth getting that chapped over. Let the vote-based system work, no? She's been slow-dripped around here for some time, so it's not like we need a permanent sticky to understand the message she so despirately needs to share to this crowd.

       I think your anger is rooted in the fact you had to pull down a stickied post, and that made the mod(s) look bad. Understandable. The name-calling seems a bit sophomoric, though.
