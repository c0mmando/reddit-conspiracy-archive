<p>Why do think the government won&#39;t tell us about aliens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they&#39;re not allowed by their masters - the ones that tell them what to say and not say to the masses.</p>

<p>You see, the government doesn&#39;t really control shit.  It&#39;s only there to make the majority of us plebs think that it&#39;s they that control things.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t.</p>

<p>That being said, the real question is: &quot;Why don&#39;t TPTB (whoever/whatever they are) tell us about aliens?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ll tell you right off the bat that one huge reason (though possibly not the <em>only</em> one) is because revealing the truth about the existence of off world races on and around this planet also reveals the fact that <em>they have mastered the science of FREE ENERGY</em>.</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment.  How else can any being get from wherever they originate to here? a planet (Earth) presumably many light years away from their home planet?</p>

<p>Fossil fuels?  Coal burning technology?  Gas?</p>

<p>Hell no.</p>

<p>They got here by being able to utilize a type of energy and propulsion technology that allows them to travel many light years at or near the speed of light or having the capacity to take advantage of or <em>create</em> worm holes and/or gravity fields.  They would not be able to make the voyage otherwise.  That travel is not possible without using a type of free energy technology.</p>

<p>...and what would happen on this planet if the truth about free energy technology were to get out to the humans here?  What do you think would happen if a technology were made available to the human race that would allow everyone to be able to access as much energy as they would ever need to warm their house, warm their food, power all their tools and appliances...and do all this for absolutely free by just accessing the energy directly from the very atmosphere around?</p>

<p>What do you think would happen to the human race?</p>

<p>It would <em>free</em> them/us.</p>

<p>And what do you think would happen to the oil and energy cartels that have invested literally <em>trillions</em> of dollars into raping the planet and in acquiring almost absolute control over all the governments of the world?</p>

<p>They would come crumbling down because the energy and power they hold the civilizations of the world hostage with would no longer be needed and would be usurped by a form of energy that is infinitely cleaner, infinitely more abundant, unimaginably more powerful, and effortlessly easy (with the right/proper technology) to access and use.</p>

<p>In other words, the .0001% would literally lose ALL their power over the masses, and the human race would become freer than it&#39;s ever been.</p>

<p>TPTB can&#39;t have that, and revealing the truth about ET existence on and around this planet would inevitably lead to that type of free energy discovery because it would eventually/inevitably be discovered <em>how</em> they got here and what energy propulsion systems they used to get here.</p>

<p>So, you see, keeping the truth about ET existence from the human race isn&#39;t about not letting us know that we&#39;re not alone in this universe, galaxy, solar system, <em>planet</em>.  It&#39;s about keeping the human race from freeing itself.  It&#39;s about keeping the human race in the abject state of servitude and subservience that we&#39;ve been in from perhaps time immemorial.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the <del>government</del> powers that be have not revealed the truth about the existence of off planet civilizations in and around this planet.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Reading just a bit through this thread, there are also various other valid reasons presented by other posters with regard to why we are kept ignorant of the truth.</p>

<p>Saw that doc a while back.  I thought it was pretty good and definitely liked it.  There are a LOOOOT of people saying that the man in the film - being the heir to the Johnson and Johnson throne worth billions of dollars - <em>has</em> to have some sort of nefarious ulterior motive behind making this film...and while I am, of course, very circumspect of the big, multinational corporations of the world, I will say that the things the man said in the documentary seem pretty decently sound to me and I would not generally disagree with his premises.</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn&#39;t account for aliens working with the US government, or that it might not even be aliens inside those UFOs, but it&#39;s something, I guess. I personally think that there are just too many videos/photos/testimonies for UFOs not to be real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about aliens mining or needing resources from our planet, but the need for resources would not be dependent on the level of advancement of a species.  All that would need to happen would be that some other species evolved on a planet with similar resources to ours in which they ran out of it.  In other words, being superior in every would have no bearing on their need for a particular natural resource.  It would only take the creation of a product with a resource found on that planet that is also on our planet.  Various types of metal have been valuable to us.  But the need for it by the Romans is vastly different than the reason we would need it today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A great question! I don&#39;t know for sure, but if I was an alien race there would be a couple possible reasons.  One, our atmosphere is not conducive to their health.  So its either bundle up in protective gear or get us to do it.  </p>

<p>Second would be that they might be seen and they worry about our response to them seeing that we are a violent species. </p>

<p>Third, perhaps it boils down essentially to slave labor.  Hawking warns us that simply being technologically advanced does not make a species morally or ethically superior.  We assume that must be the case, but why would it? Every more advanced human civilization has taken advantage of a less advanced civilization.  Why should we assume an alien race would not also take advantage of us by making us do the dirty work?</p>

<p>That being said I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that aliens are currently mining our planet for resources, but its a very interesting topic to discuss non the less. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I would think that any species advanced enough to get here would have thought of this well beforehand.</p>

<p>Same as above.  Any species with the technology to get here would probably not need to worry about us as a threat.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe, this one seems the most probable.  But my thoughts here are: if your goal was to mine all of the resources of the planet using its subjects as slaves and you were incredibly technologically advanced, wouldn&#39;t the easiest thing to do be to cull the population as much as possible (both making them easier to control as well as limiting how many resources they consume for themselves)?  Then you&#39;d have a smaller work force to worry about, less of your resources would be wasted, and you&#39;d pretty much have free reign to do whatever you wanted.</p>

<p>I think &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;beings&quot; or &quot;thoughtforms&quot; of some kind probably do exist - maybe they all exist separately - but I just haven&#39;t ever been convinced that they&#39;re responsible for the UFO phenomenon, at least not wholly.  My opinion is that most if not all UFO&#39;s are human in origin.</p>

<p>Maybe - I&#39;m more of the belief that sometime around the turn of the 20th century, we stumbled upon a new type of science/technology with the work of Tesla and later T.T. Brown and others.  There is so much to uncover with regards to black ops research in Nazi Germany and the US before, during, and after WWII.</p>

<p>There are also a ton of strange anomalies in the MJ-12 documents and with the supposed facts of both the Roswell and Kecksburg crashes.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s still possible that it&#39;s a combination of both i.e. some UFO&#39;s are from somewhere else but others were made here.  Seems a little implausible that a race of beings could conquer interstellar space flight and then crash land on Earth like amateurs...</p>

<p>Another thing I&#39;ve thought of is that, perhaps, some of these UFO&#39;s come from <em>within</em> our own solar system.  Maybe some or all of the other planets are inhabited somehow?  With the Roswell crash, it was determined that the craft was flying at around 1200 MPH.  It would take an <em>absurdly long</em> time to get to Earth from outside of our solar system traveling at those speeds - but slightly more manageable if traveling within our own solar system.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, interesting stuff to speculate about for sure.  And I agree with you about the abductions, what better cover would there be than &quot;aliens&quot; if you wanted to covertly experiment on the population?</p>

<p>Yes they 100% were.  They, &quot;they&quot; being mainly the SS led by Hans Kammler (you&#39;ll note that the circumstances of his &quot;disappearance&quot; after the war are <em>very</em> sketchy), were also heavily involved in the occult and their research reflected that - they didn&#39;t limit themselves strictly to the current scientific dogma.</p>

<p>There are some even weirder things I&#39;ve read suggesting that the Nazis may have created and even tested an atomic bomb before the Allies did and that suggest collusion at the highest levels of power between the Allied and Axis powers during the war (and obviously after as well, as things like Paperclip make abundantly clear).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they were working on a special project called die glocke. They built this bell shaped thing that the bottom rotated creating some sort of anti gravity. Hans Kammler reportedly stepped into the machine and it took off. He was never seen again. And then in the 70s a bell shaped craft crashed in Kecksburg, PA. Could be the Nazi bell. </p>

<p>In reality earth has no unique resources, except lifeforms. And lifeforms reproduce exponentially when given the food, air and water they need. So aliens could&#39;ve just abducted few hundred humans way back when and get a new huge population within a few centuries on another planet, if that&#39;s what they wanted.</p>

<p>But no, they stay here in secret, anally probing mentally unstable individuals.</p>

<p>I meant that humans created the &quot;aliens&quot; <strong>meme</strong>.  My opinion is that most if not all UFO&#39;s are human in origin - just high tech black technology - and in order to cover up the fact that certain human beings have access to really advanced, very cheap/free energy technology, the &quot;aliens&quot; meme has been discreetly seeded into the public consciousness to get us all looking away from the actual <em>human beings</em> who are responsible.</p>

<p>If we are being visited by an alien presence (I believe we are), it is my opinion that it is not just one species. These beings have most likely interacted with one another way before interacting with humans.
