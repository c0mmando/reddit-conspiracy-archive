       These days the Simpsonwood Freedom of Information release can only be found on what the shills call 'anti-vaxx' websites, here's an example of the typical comment they will make
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I saw the link. Now, can you provide a link to legitmate proof? Not something posted on an anti-vaxxer website. You know, real....not fake."
       </strong>

      <p>
       Having followed the story from the beginning, I was well-aware that the document was real, in recent years there's been an operation to remove the document from the Internet.  Why?  Well, the document speaks for itself, it's a group of CDC doctors discussing the neurological damages which vaccines can cause, one even says he will not vaccinate his own grandchild.  The CDC and the rest of Big Pharma would hate for you to know how they discuss vaccines when they think the public aren't listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, fortunately we all have the Internet Archive at our finger-tips, hence it's easy to dig out the official Simpsonwood document from a 2006 version of the CDC website.  The CDC will be harassing them to remove it, but let's make sure this is documented now that the CDC once had the Simpsonwood document on their own website, confirming it's validity for all those who weren't sure.

       Interesting, we see that at one point the CDC were content to admit that some children would go Autistic after vaccines, years later they had a change of heart and started covering it up.

       Since I hope we can have a debate on this and see more than one side.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off this paper is not being hidden, it was the subject of an article by RFK Jr and published in both Rolling Stone and Salon.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a rash of corrections and factual errors it was retracted in both publications, its worth noting that the article is still available on salons website.

       Here are the results of a review on the Simpsonwood meeting. I encourage people to read both the article OP provided and this response. Its also slightly misleading to say that there was a consensus at this meeting there were many opposing views.

       The big difference here is that this is designed for public viewing, it was written in 2007, many years after the meeting, it's just spin, not the same as something which wasn't ever meant to be consumed by the public like the original Simpsonwood release.

       The timeline here is a bit wonky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2000 "paper" you linked to is literally just a transcript of the meeting, with no sources. I unfortunately dont have the Simpsonwood second analysis of what was discussed in 2000 but if anyone can get to it here is the link
       <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/4/932.full">
        http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/4/932.full
       </a>
       this was published in 2004. Please take not of the company the lead researcher at Simpsonwood is working for.
      </p>
      <p>
       RFK Jr. published his article in 2005 and the response was published in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science takes time, you never rush something as important as this thats why it 3-4 years for Simpsonwood to release their actual data and they released the transcript f the meeting immediately, well as soon as the news embargo ended a short time after the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I encourage people to look into it themselves.

      <p>
       Let's make this clear, the transcript is the source, the CDC are discussing a source of research they can see, they are saying they don't want the public to find out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any new Simpsonswood information released by Big Pharma years after has been prepared for public consumption i.e. fake, just for marketing and cover-up.  The best information is what was released not as PR, but as an accident, the doctors never intended the public to find out their discussions, they were being honest in their original meeting.

       So we should just ignore the factual errors in the 2000 paper?
      </p>
      <p>
       And again I can not stress enough that science doesn't care about your opinions or even the opinions of scientists (and the numerous pr groups also present).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only concerned about facts, reproducible tests and per review. The 2000 paper has none of those. It's interesting and a good debate starter but I would just be careful when there is a much more factual source that takes issue with some of their points.

       The 2000 paper is a discussion by CDC doctors about facts and tests, they make it clear that the facts and tests have proved how dangerous vaccines are, they make it clear they need to cover up the real science.

       I think you should look into what peer review is and actually look into the criticisms of not only this paper but a lot of the anti Vax views.

       I'm well aware of what peer-review is, I have also looked at the criticisms which Big Pharma throw around, it's such a shame that Big Pharma can't admit this and take it on the chin, but I suppose it would destroy trust in the vaccine schedule and also ruin the reputations of incredible powerful people, so hence the cover-up continues.

       The problem is when the risk is greater than any theoretical benefit, one of the doctors said he wouldn't be vaccinating his own grandchild, that tells you a lot about his risk/benefit analysis after studying the data.

       I know what Junk Science is, look into the 'science' used to backup the push for mass vaccination, if you know much about science you'll soon see the studies are of poor design and full of conflicts of interest; vaccines are based on myth, assumption and belief.  The important studies are never done to show if vaccines are safe, necessary or effective.

       I dont want to get into an argument with you over aluminium poisoning or whatever, but smallpox was eradicated through a comibation of both quarantine and vaccinations. Believe it or not, its not junk science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminium is used as a adjuvant in vaccines, it helps increase the immune response to the vaccine because dead virus particles dont pose any real threat and wouldnt leave a lasting immune response.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are different adjuvants to elicit different immune responses such as oil emulsions and various cytokines. The problem comes down to this, funding for adjuvant development is lacking because we already have some that work in vaccines that are time tested and safe, and an immune target (the dead virus) is approved by the fda in conjunction with an adjuvant, not separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       No real point to make, just wanted to throw it out there.

       Experts involved in the eradication say that at best the vaccination speeded up the eradication slightly, but quarantine was the key to it.  Every country eradicated Small Pox, even ones that did not use mass Small Pox vaccination programs.  The problem with the vaccine was that it would leave a lot of people with lifelong autoimmune disorders, this meant that they would only ring-fence vaccinate the family of a person with Small Pox, to minimize the risk of vaccine-injuring people miles away from the outbreak.

       Yes, you're right about why Aluminum is in the vaccines, like you say they need more funding to develop safer adjuvants, that's what France are going to look into, they've realized how dangerous Aluminum is and want Aluminum-free vaccines.

       Again, I don't want to debate aluminum toxicity with you, because based on everything I've read the levels used in vaccines are safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be the first to admit that I am very highly biased on the side of the science supported by the cdc and fda because I work in the biological research field and the studies that have come out on aluminum toxicity in 2005 and 2007 I believe (ill find links after I get off work) had much better experimental design and data analysis than the reports available at the time of this cdc meeting the thread is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even with my biases, I can never forget the tragedy of thalidomide and therefore I am of the mindset that just because it has been determined to be safe by a few doesnt mean we shouldnt perform additional tests to find out for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thats my 2 cents. Ill go back to lurking on conspiracy now, I just like to pop in from time to time to throw some actual science into discussions, hope you don't mind.

       The main difficulty is that they haven't actually studied the effects of injecting Aluminum, it was only when a professor studying something different stumbled across the dangers of injecting Aluminum that the harm to the brain first started to come to light, he explains his findings in the short video below.

       The FDA/CDC should be funding new studies into this, but they are not, they have a conflict of interest as it would show the harm vaccines ingredients which they approved have been doing to the brains of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear from the Simpsonwood cover-up that the CDC are not the right people to place trust in.

       Not exactly true, there is funding out there, its just few and far between, however the same can be said for all research funding right now, a lab down the hall from me had an nih grant to study aluminum alternatives in vaccines, but that could be an isolated case, I dont know for sure.

       I know I said I would go back to lurking, but I couldnt help myself and found a paper from the journal of toxicology published early last month that you may find interesting, I belive its written by the same dr.shaw featured in the video you linked me, its free on pmc and does a decent job at explaining things at a basic level. Sorry for the link formatting, im on mobile,

       I was slightly disappointed with the article I linked because it only briefly touches on epigenetics, which could very well be the mechanism of action undertaken by aluminum to induce lasting effects, id like to see some papers come out concerning the dna methylation status resulting from long term exposure, that would be really interesting to me.
      </p>

       Side note; Im unsure of your level of scientific training or whatever, but id like to offer my services as a translator. If theres any jargon in an article, or an article you want to read is behind a paywall, whatever, id be happy to help decipher jargon and provide more detailed descriptions of articles than are provided in their abstracts. Just send me a pm or reply to this comment and ill help out as soon as I can.

       You've jumped to the wrong conclusion Teethpasta, everyone knows the Small Pox vaccine didn't contain Small Pox, it's that the Small Pox vaccine was damaging to the immune system which made you more likely to go down with Small Pox after receiving it.

       Thimerosal/Mercury is still found in Flu vaccines (a large and dangerous amount), it's also found in a number of the vaccines in the childhood schedule, they say at 'trace' amounts but 'trace' is not the right description, it's a lot more than a trace

       The freedom of information request was about Mercury containing vaccines and how toxic to the brain they are.  The study which I posted from Professor Chris Shaw was about the type of Aluminum in vaccines i.e. Aluminum Hydroxide, as he says in the video.  It's clear both are Mercury and Aluminum are toxic to the brain, vaccines need to be cleaned up!

       Aluminum free vaccines have been possible since the 80s. The only reason some are being reintroduced now is to provide a cheap alternative to thimerosal. The more expensive option being preservative-free, which must be made in small batches and be administered within a few days.

       Aluminum neurotoxicity has been debated for close to a century now. The consensus is that it's safe for at much higher levels than the FDA allows for anyone who doesn't have impaired kidney function. Even Dr Shaw's study only repeats earlier results, but emphasizes that injection is worse than ingestion. The FDA already had differing standards in place regarding ingestion and and injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       ps - Also, the only part of those links I sent relative to our discussion was the "safe levels" of aluminum versus mercury. So the CDC's "conflict of interest" is irrelevant. Google down another source for the same numbers, there are many reference works out there with the info.

       It is a trace amount, what you say doesn't make it not a trace amount. Thimerosal is easily cleared out of the body it really isn't a problem.

       Yes, get this up on the front page!
Also, I still vac my kid, but only like 1 or two vacs at a time. They usually try to give her 3-4 but I think that's the biggest issue with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are "acceptable" levels of mercury in these things I think. They just don't have to report that there is any in them if the amount within the vaccine is considered "acceptable". Which might be fine I suppose if they were only giving them one or two at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you give a kid 4-5 vacs at a time then perhaps the levels of mercury a child is exposed to is no longer "acceptable" and that's where I think the issues come in.
      </p>
      <p>
       My child certainly doesn't seem autistic after getting some vaccines, but again, I only let them give her 1 or 2 at a time and then we just come back a week or two later for ther other ones. I think the hospital thinks my wife and I are crazy but they don't seem to mind and it makes me feel safer about what I'm exposing my kid to.

       When it comes to injections, no amount of Mercury is acceptable.  The Flu vaccines have a lot of Mercury, some other vaccines have what they call 'Trace' but if you look at the amount it's a lot more than a 'Trace'.  The ones without Mercury now have Aluminum which is even more toxic to the brain.

       Many doctors and nurses don't vaccinate their own children, but they'll lose their job if they tell you not to vaccinate yours.

       If you're someone who wants to vaccinate your child, then yes, you are right, it is less risky to go for one vaccine at a time, it's also important to hold off until after age 2, never use Tylenol around the time of vaccination, never vaccinate a sick child, never vaccinate a child who has had antibiotics within the last couple of months.  Avoid DPT the most dangerous vaccine, avoid pointless vaccines like Flu,  Hib and Chicken Pox. Avoid MMR obviously, avoid Hep B another of the most dangerous

       You still don't get it, do you? There's a reason anti-vaxx is so mainstream and we are constantly being programmed not to trust vaccines through talk shows/sit-coms/celebrities. You may not be able to wrap your brain around this because it involves
       <em>
        math
       </em>
       (as opposed to maniacal screeching about "shills!" (i.e., anyone who disagrees with you).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the deal folks: The DTaP vaccine rakes in a
       <em>
        whopping
       </em>
       average of $15.38 per person for Big Pharma. (ooooooo!) However - since vaccines have proven effective for things like Pertussis over the years, our Pharma friends eventually ended up with a cash flow problem - you see, the average cost of a Pertussis hospitalization is $9,586 per stay. And that's just for ONE preventable disease! Most of that is spent on pharma and medical supplies at a HUGE markup. MONEY MONEY MONEY!!! $$$$
      </p>
      <p>
       So what to do? Big Insurance loves vaccines because they don't want to spend their money on hospital stays, so they can't just be gotten rid of. Why not make them a loss leader? They're still around, but the demand needed to be
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       lower. How to sink demand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well it turns out that if you want to influence the behavior of a Western society, you need to start with their celebrities. Enter Jenny McCarthy and the rest of Hollywood. Let's pay big money to have them scare people away, and watch those revenues SOAR!! It caught on - and business is booming. Especially in SoCal, where the celebs are based. But you'll still find a granny in every bible belt town that saw that episode of "The Doctors" and now knows to stay away from those horrible vaccines!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem solved. Big Insurance is happy. Big Pharma is happy. What's not to like?

       This is completely false and flawed, they want to make money not keep costs down.  Vaccines are there to induce highly profitable autoimmune diseases leaving us on drugs for life, they want money, make no mistake about that.  The money is in leaving people with Diabetes Type 1, Asthma, MS, Motor Neurone Disease, Epilepsy etc etc.  The more people who get sick the more money Big Pharma make through drugs sales.  As for the insurance companies they can charge higher premiums if more people are getting sick, so their interests are aligned with those of Big Pharma i.e. the sicker we are the richer they get, hence why we're being regularly jabbed with dangerous vaccines.
