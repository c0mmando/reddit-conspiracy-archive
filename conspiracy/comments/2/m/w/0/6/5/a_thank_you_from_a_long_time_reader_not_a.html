       Probably will garner little attention and probably get some hate, but just wanted to say thank you to everyone who legitimately supports this community with hard work and dedication.  I know reddit has been brigaded by

        shills and the like
       </a>
       but I still come here for valuable information.  I would have never have learned who John Taylor Gatto or Smedley Buttler was or ever heard of Operation Northwoods for that matter.  Please keep up the good fight for this community all those spending their time supporting it.

       Great post! Thank you from me, too. This sub is a fantastic source of information, provided you keep your critical thinking skills engaged. I stumbled in here frightened and confused after figuring out the game pretty much on my own about 8 months ago. To have a group of like-minded individuals unafraid to speak up has meant the world to me and inspired me to do more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thank you to the shills too. Without you, I would have no idea the depth of Internet corruption and control. I hope your lives are spared once this is all over. I mean that sincerely.

       Yes. Thank you fellow conspiracy theorists. It's an honor &amp; a privilege. The shills are waay too obvious. I dislike most organized religion, but I don't hang out day after day trying to dissuade believers.

       Remind you? There's no explanation for it. All you have is a single blog post. I guess for some people that's going to spell "shill".

      <p>
       I've answered this further down the thread. There's simply nowhere near a respectable amount of data to make any sort of judgement. There's a simple reddit blog post and that's it. Nothing that puts the position in context, nothing that explains how the "addicted" metric is constructed, no idea of how the second place cities match up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, the 2nd-place city is Oak Brook IL. Smaller in population than Eglin, but home to the world headquarters of McDonalds. So probably more people there during the working day than the population, maybe. Lot of people in offices all day. Same with the military, the damn thing runs on bureaucracy. That doesn't prove anything of course, but it's a little bit of thinking on why Eglin might be up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just off the top of my head and a bit of wiki, but still there's just not enough information about the metric to make question you're asking a reasonable one.

       "This stuff" meaning this sub in particular, and I think reddit in general. The idea that companies like Ntrepid have got military contracts for persona management software and the like is verifiable and not exactly news. A lot of rather nasty people communicate exclusively via the internet and social media and it's not surprising that there are efforts to eavesdrop/manipulate that.

       's posts tend to be heavily downvoted by an already small group, making them less visible anyway. The idea that the US military is controlling his account is ludicrous. What devote time and resources to ensure that a small number of internet users
       <em>

       ? It's ridiculous.

       It might explain the military budget if every reddit account had it's own uniformed minder, though.

       That's sensible. Nowhere did I say that this is my opinion of the sub though. I don't think it's particularly racist, I think it dances close to the line but that's mostly the fault of a few frequent posters. I do think there's a rather hilarious oversensitivity and inflated sense of it's own importance, which is how this whole discussion got started in the first place. All the talk of "waking up" and "rabbit hole" when people really mean Global Research and Veterans fucking Today.

       Hardly post at all in general, this sub just seems to push my buttons every so often with regard to misinformation. Especially when you get a lot of posts from people asking for pointers and things to research. That's exactly when you don't want Chemtrail Charlie getting away with not explaining himself. This does indeed make most of what I post critical, but only at things that I'd consider worth criticising. Or funny to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not every theory, just a lot of what gets posted here is not worth much attention. It's about 60-70% reposts, and most of them from loonybins like VeteransToday or straight-up propaganda such as RT, Fox or PressTV.
