To have a group of like-minded individuals unafraid to speak up has meant the world to me and inspired me to do more.</p>

<p>And thank you to the shills too. Without you, I would have no idea the depth of Internet corruption and control. I hope your lives are spared once this is all over. I mean that sincerely.</p>

<p>I created an account on reddit to take part in discussions about all manners of incredibly interesting and thought provoking stuff on this sub. There was little to no &#39;trolling&#39; or &#39;shilling&#39; or any shenanigans. Now this place is overrun with (I hate to say it because a lot of those guys are funny cunts <a href="/r/montageparodies">/r/montageparodies</a> amirite) conspiritards with nothing better to do than derail on-point conversation. <sup><sup><sup><sup>There</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>is</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>also</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>a</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>heavy</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>JIDF</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>presence</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>here.</sup></sup></sup></sup> </p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to go ahead and point out where I did that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that the idea <a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> is sitting in a US military base, being paid to make comments here is ridiculous. I consider that to be a perfect case of &quot;extraordinary claims&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Remind you? There&#39;s no explanation for it. All you have is a single blog post. I guess for some people that&#39;s going to spell &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve answered this further down the thread. There&#39;s simply nowhere near a respectable amount of data to make any sort of judgement. There&#39;s a simple reddit blog post and that&#39;s it. Nothing that puts the position in context, nothing that explains how the &quot;addicted&quot; metric is constructed, no idea of how the second place cities match up.</p>

<p>Seriously, the 2nd-place city is Oak Brook IL. Smaller in population than Eglin, but home to the world headquarters of McDonalds. So probably more people there during the working day than the population, maybe. Lot of people in offices all day. Same with the military, the damn thing runs on bureaucracy. That doesn&#39;t prove anything of course, but it&#39;s a little bit of thinking on why Eglin might be up there. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just off the top of my head and a bit of wiki, but still there&#39;s just not enough information about the metric to make question you&#39;re asking a reasonable one.</p>

<p>Rhetorical questions do not an argument make.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Har.</p>

<p>EDIT - Can&#39;t seem to explain the third city at all, except that the population is higher. Care to have a go, <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">/u/Ambiguously_Ironic</a> ?</p>

<p>The clear implication you&#39;re making is that the US military <em>doesn&#39;t</em> post on reddit because &quot;this stuff&quot; <em>isn&#39;t</em> important.  At least stand by what you said.  Whether nwowon is a shill or not is irrelevant to their existence on this site.</p>

The idea that companies like Ntrepid have got military contracts for persona management software and the like is verifiable and not exactly news.

<p>First of all it&#39;s hardly &quot;masses&quot; in this case. <a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a>&#39;s posts tend to be heavily downvoted by an already small group, making them less visible anyway. The idea that the US military is controlling his account is ludicrous. What devote time and resources to ensure that a small number of internet users <em>don&#39;t change their mind at all</em>? It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>It might explain the military budget if every reddit account had it&#39;s own uniformed minder, though.</p>

<p>And calling something &quot;disinformation&quot; in general needs to be backed up a bit better than what <a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> has been getting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t comment on stuff I agree with because I don&#39;t see the point, half the threads here turn into &quot;DAE NORTHWOODS&quot; circlejerks anyway so that&#39;s off-putting.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m motivated to put something up it&#39;s because there&#39;s either a) flagrant wrong information b) opinion posing as fact or possibly c) something funny that would be interesting to poke with a stick</p>

<p>That&#39;s sensible. Nowhere did I say that this is my opinion of the sub though. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly racist, I think it dances close to the line but that&#39;s mostly the fault of a few frequent posters. I do think there&#39;s a rather hilarious oversensitivity and inflated sense of it&#39;s own importance, which is how this whole discussion got started in the first place. All the talk of &quot;waking up&quot; and &quot;rabbit hole&quot; when people really mean Global Research and Veterans fucking Today.</p>

<p>If commenting stops people taking shite like that seriously then it&#39;s worth the odd sentence.</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re probably right that it was a little hostile. I guess I figured that if you&#39;re not the type who feels just about every conspiracy theory is bunk then you&#39;d occasionally post something supportive, or even submit your own content once in a while. You&#39;re clearly an intelligent person, if you&#39;re into this stuff I&#39;d think you would share some of your findings sometimes like I try to. So I decided to point blank ask you, because I&#39;m being honest when I say I&#39;ve never seen a post from you that I considered positive.</p>

<p>Anyways, like I said I appreciate it and I will try to wipe the slate clean and see your comments without any preconceptions.</p>

<p>I appreciate you taking the time to respond to me this way. Most people who I feel are trolls would never get to this point in a conversation like this, so I do recognize that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, glad to chat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess I figured that if you&#39;re not the type who feels just about every conspiracy theory is bunk then you&#39;d occasionally post something supportive, or even submit your own content once in a while. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardly post at all in general, this sub just seems to push my buttons every so often with regard to misinformation. Especially when you get a lot of posts from people asking for pointers and things to research. That&#39;s exactly when you don&#39;t want Chemtrail Charlie getting away with not explaining himself. This does indeed make most of what I post critical, but only at things that I&#39;d consider worth criticising. Or funny to.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not every theory, just a lot of what gets posted here is not worth much attention. It&#39;s about 60-70% reposts, and most of them from loonybins like VeteransToday or straight-up propaganda such as RT, Fox or PressTV. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re clearly an intelligent person, if you&#39;re into this stuff I&#39;d think you would share some of your findings sometimes like I try to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheers. Well I&#39;m more into history than anything current so findings aren&#39;t happening. Also not from the US so couldn&#39;t really give a toss about the police-related content that&#39;s becoming more and more common.</p>

<p>The enjoyment I get from this place is rare but valuable, people here generally aren&#39;t afraid to say what&#39;s on their mind and are very ready to dig deep so there&#39;s occasionally something interesting. As before, I just don&#39;t feel the need to comment with &quot;this&quot; or something similar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I decided to point blank ask you, because I&#39;m being honest when I say I&#39;ve never seen a post from you that I considered positive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, I can see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyways, like I said I appreciate it and I will try to wipe the slate clean and see your comments without any preconceptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appreciated and reciprocated.</p>

<p>Well I wasn&#39;t exactly responding to <em>Das Kapital</em> so you&#39;ll forgive the brevity.</p>

<p>Had a go at an explanation in another comment here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No they&#39;re not. They might be, they probably are, but we know <em>nothing</em> about the metric so making judgements like this one don&#39;t work</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know that that is what this number means.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t dress up supposition as fact.</p>
