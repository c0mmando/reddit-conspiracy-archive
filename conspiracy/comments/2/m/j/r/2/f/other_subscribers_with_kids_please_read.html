<p>Get your childs history book and skim thru it. Now you are looking for important events in history that are just as much info as a foot note. I would do this as well but well mine son is a kindergartner.  Not really at the point for books less its full of pictures. </p>

<p>I think what we can find is going to be interesting. Its very important for us to do this because the change for our generation isnt going to happen. Although maybe we can help our children with our knowledge and by teaching them the actual facts they have a chance.</p>

<p>Dont force them either give them links so they can do it themself. Trust me they will all kids want to learn. If you actually get involved then it will be eaiser for them to find interest. </p>

<p>Just try it and please post pics of the inconsistencies. I would really like to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did this last year with my 16 y.o., they had a whole course about Iran.  They learned about the Shah (late 1950&#39;s - 1979 overthrough), I checked her book and there wasn&#39;t a word about the 1953 coup that installed the Shah.  During parent night, I had brought it up infront of everyone during the general Q &amp; A, and the teacher tries to scoff at it.  I had a quick diatribe about how talking about the middle east/Iran without recognizing the overthrow is the equivalent of talking about US history and not discussing the revolutionary war.  This was also a couple months after the CIA admitted to it.  Anyways, I&#39;ll check if my daughter still has her book, but as I recall, most history classes skip the 53&#39; overthrough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Great post!</strong></p>

<p>This is a real and serious issue. If you&#39;re of or above parenting age, you&#39;re probably well aware at just how bloody horrible the education you received was. </p>

<p>I will most certainly be very involved in my child&#39;s education. I will not allow state sponsored propaganda to pollute her learning or thinking. </p>

<p>While she&#39;s still very far away from this, I&#39;m thinking that &quot;Tragedy &amp; Hope&quot; will be her main history book for the 20th century when she&#39;s ready. </p>

<p>Where I&#39;m from, they want to teach elementary school children all about masturbation and anal sex and... yeah... twisted shit from demonic, sick people. </p>

<p>At the moment, my child is too young to have text books, so I won&#39;t be posting any pics. However, I would really like to see others post on this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect that, but you will lose your son if he gets the wrong kind of teacher, and you stepping-in in front of the government won&#39;t do him much good. Furthermore, if he can&#39;t vomit what school force feed him, he ain&#39;t getting a university degree, ever. This being said, one can live without a university degree, depends what he aims for...</p>

<p>edit: I can probably be clearer... i guess what i mean to say is that he needs to be able to assess who he is communicating with, before spreading truth all over their face, not only are some believers completely oblivious to truth which makes it an uter waste of time to try, but eventually he will also face non-believers who still promote the ideology, and that&#39;s when the problems arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Berry Fell founded something called the Epigraphy Society in the USA, and he went around keeping records of all the ancient inscriptions he could find. In that video, he presents his book, &quot;Bronze Age America&quot;, and 29 minutes 22 seconds into it, he discusses rocks in Peterborough, which he has interpreted to be an Ancient Scandinavian Ogham. If you think about things loosely. The pacific coast has culture diffusion with the polynesian totem poles. Well, the Iroquois built longhouses. They say the Tomahawk was largely an east coat culture trend, so if that is shared with the Scandinavians, I dunno. Possible.</p>

<p>In any event people do believe there are ancient copper mines that the Native Indians used for trade with Europeans.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_mining_in_Michigan#Native_American_mining">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_mining_in_Michigan#Native_American_mining</a></p>

<p><em>Native Americans were the first to mine and work the copper of Lake Superior and the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan between 5000 BCE and 1200 BCE. The natives used this copper to produce tools. Archaeological expeditions in the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale revealed the existence of copper producing pits and hammering stones which were used to work the copper.[2] Some writers have suggested that as much as 1.5 billion pounds of copper was extracted during this period, but some archaeologists consider such high figures as &quot;ill-constructed estimates&quot; and that the actual figure is unknown.[3]</em></p>

<p>The Berry Fell translation talks about the trades between the two cultures.</p>

<p>There is a significant amount of ancient history in the area. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-4sI34aIZ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-4sI34aIZ0</a></p>

<p>(Interpret as you will, right? I don&#39;t trust that video interpretation as much as I do the the Berry Fell stuff. So, I don&#39;t know if should mix the two together. It&#39;s good anyways, even if dates are way off, etc...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MK-ULTRA is the only strictly CIA op I mentioned.  Public school, particularly history classes, are propaganda.  I thought that was the point of this thread...</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying to focus on what&#39;s <em>barely</em> mentioned in the books, and I&#39;m saying that what you should actually focus on is what isn&#39;t mentioned in them at all since outside of public school textbooks is where all of the actually important information is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not suggesting we explain in detail the torture carried out on US citizens by their own government to 8 year olds, I was simply saying that looking at what&#39;s <em>never</em> mentioned in a history textbook is more enlightening than looking at what&#39;s <em>barely</em> mentioned.  I was also saying that I do think kids should be taught about these things and also that there are damn good reasons why they aren&#39;t - namely that public schooling is, for the most part, propaganda.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why any of that is counter productive - but maybe I&#39;m just missing your point somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read in a history book last year at a high school that 9/11 was the first terrorist attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>They had just mentioned the &#39;93 WTC bombing, so I don&#39;t know why they would say that 9/11 was the first terrorist attack since Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like these books are written by idiots.</p>

<p>Other than that, the school system is still by and large an indoctrination center.</p>

<p>Dare is still in full effect, that piece of shit program full of hypocrite liars indoctrinating children about drugs.</p>

<p>There is also a new organization called &quot;No Excuses University&quot; which is a huge part of their &quot;you have to go to college&quot; indoctrination propaganda that they plaster over almost every inch of wall space they have, no joke.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always a &quot;look at all us teachers degrees&quot; wall, and every other cork board is decorated for individual colleges that the teachers went to, and &quot;No Excuses U&quot; logos all over the place too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s freaking nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I am going to be a history teacher in the Netherlands (second year of the study).
 I don&#39;t know what kind of information you can find in a american history book or how teachers are educated in the states.</p>

<p>I am told that all the history school books are just tools for your own lessons. Do not use only the history book as a source, but use other sources as well! If i make a lesson about Columbus, I must use at least 6 or 7 books about this subject.</p>

<p>Teachers decides what is important and what is correct. A teacher can only make that decision if he/she uses diffrent sources. Not only one history book.</p>

<p>(btw, I am happy when a student corrects me or start a discussion. That means he&#39;s paying attention and that he knows already something about the subject.)</p>

<p>You are not a teacher within usa. I know that here they dont appreciate when you question them.I am gonna admit this lesson plan thing you speak of I doubt many teachers here do that.</p>

<p>As when I was is school all the answers were printed off in the back of the book. So they were prepared in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that means the problem is not the books, but the teachers... If they use only one textbook as a source, wrong information will be teached.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that you guys are parents that check the history books of your children. </p>

<p>I am sorry if I insult the American educationsystem. Dutch teachers are not perfect either.</p>

<p>I dont deal in conjecture with people in this sub its easier you know. For every article or scrap of &quot;evidence&quot; for either argument is contradicted by experts in the field. Its tought to take sides in here because we just cant verify most the time.</p>
