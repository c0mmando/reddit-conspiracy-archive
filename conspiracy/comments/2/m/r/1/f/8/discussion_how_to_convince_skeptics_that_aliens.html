        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m just throwing this out there --</p>

<p>Over the years I&#39;ve collected information and come up with – what you could call –‘interpersonal argument strategies’ that have helped me bring others into the fold, so to speak. </p>

<p>You have no reason to believe me - but I&#39;ve had a lot of success in convincing highly skeptical and intelligent people of some crazy shit, like the fact that aliens exist and have visited US nuclear silos (easy right? - Disclosure conference) and the MMR vaccine link (no duh - CDC whistleblower). </p>

<p>I&#39;m preaching to the choir. I know all of you are convinced of this shit anyway and have seen the evidence for yourselves and come to the right conclusions. </p>

<p>But what I think a lot of people are missing is strategy. It took me a long time to sort through all of the information, bad information, and disinformation before I was able to synthesize a persuasive, evidence-based worldview on a number of issues, like the ones mentioned.</p>

<p>But that was the easy part. The hard part was figuring out how to present that information to my skeptical (i.e., propagandized) friends and colleagues in person (rule #1: convincing anyone of anything online is a waste of time) without them thinking I&#39;m a fucking nut. </p>

<p>Well, I’ve figured that out and I can present it to you in ‘field manual’ style. The emphasis would be on psychology and interpersonal communication strategies, couched in evidence-based arguments. What I would like from you is some feedback on what subjects you would like covered, and any other questions you might have. I could anticipate them, but I’d like to leave it open. </p>

<p>Here are some general topics I can cover right away without much work on my part:</p>

<ul>
<li>9/11 (if you insist) </li>
<li>MMR autism link</li>
<li>Aliens exist and are visiting Earth</li>
<li>Chemtrails/Climate Engineering</li>
<li>Fed is owned by private interests; markets are manipulated</li>
<li>Critical geopolitics (oil interests, PNAC, etc.) </li>
</ul>

<p>You name it, really. If you want me to get really out there, I can make some compelling arguments on more esoteric aspects, like secret/occult societies and – gasp - magic. But I hesitate to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  I guess the difficulty with the &quot;convincing others&quot; part is that many will refuse to listen...and sometimes you simply can&#39;t really do too much of anything about that...so if one spends too much time being too concerned about trying to convince others, then they may find themselves <em>veeeery</em> frustrated and spinning their wheels in life.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, everyone has to drink <em>on their own</em>.  No one will or even can do it for them.  You can, of course, direct them to the water and tell them where the well is.  If they choose to listen or not is up to them.  If they don&#39;t?  I just as soon say &quot;Meh.  Okay.  Suit yourself.&quot;  And walk on toward the water hole to quench my thirst while they remain parched wondering why they can&#39;t find a drink anywhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had enough thirsty folks tell me that I don&#39;t know where any water is for me to continue trying to help anyone get a drink but myself at this point.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t help people.  I <em>do</em>.  Definitely.  I just don&#39;t spend my time trying to convince them of too much of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In political science and PR they like to divide people along a spectrum -- there are people who are too stupid and stubborn to be convinced of anything, there are people who are on the fence, and there are those who agree with you. So you&#39;re told to identify and shoot for the middle category. </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that across the board - especially in political polls - the &#39;middle&#39; is vastly <em>under</em>-estimated. Americans routinely over-estimate how polarized politics is, mostly because that&#39;s the message the news media feeds you. In fact most people are confused, don&#39;t have time for it, and swing on on core issues frequently. Which is what you&#39;d expect -- the world is a fucking big complex place, no way we&#39;re going to agree on everything or fit anything into a simple &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;left wing&quot; dichotomy. </p>

<p>So, I think you might be underestimating the number of people in your life who are &#39;in the middle&#39;. A lot of people are programmed with reflexive/defensive arguments and attitudes against anything that questions the status quo, so as soon as you say &quot;9/11&quot; it&#39;s like their brains shut down. </p>

<p>If you know a little bit about how these information control mechanisms work, it&#39;s actually not that hard to overcome them and get people to listen to you. I&#39;ve done it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that.  It&#39;s more that I simply don&#39;t really care who agrees or doesn&#39;t agree with me.  I care about what I personally learn and don&#39;t learn.  I care about how much I can accrue in terms of good, valid information.  After all, I can&#39;t help keep anyone from drowning if I myself don&#39;t know how to swim.</p>

<p>Correct and agreed.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I just, again, don&#39;t actually <em>care</em> about convincing anyone.  I respect that you do/may.  I just don&#39;t.  I care about making sure that <strong><em>I</em></strong> know wtf is going on.</p>

<p>I have a difficult enough time of figuring it all out myself - what with all the misinformation and disinformation that&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>I just want to make sure that <em>my</em> ship&#39;s in order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that. I guess where you and I differ is that I don&#39;t really look at myself as sailing my own boat. It&#39;s more like we&#39;re all on the same ship together and it&#39;s going to sink because the guys on deck are psychopaths. ;)</p>

<p>We don&#39;t differ on that point.  We are all in the same boat.  However, many don&#39;t see it that way, and going around trying to convince everyone around that we <em>are</em> all together might be a bit of an exercise in futility.  I&#39;ve found it to be a great waste of valuable time that I can much more effectively spend on making sure and understanding the ship we&#39;re in itself as well as understanding the psychopaths that are driving it to hell.</p>

<p>TPTB would still find you, so you definitely wouldn&#39;t be all THAT comfortable.</p>

<p>I work on not giving a shit while still living in the muck of a big city surrounded by tons of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the &#39;90s when I first got a computer and hooked up to the internet (I really miss the dialup noise - is that weird?) I often brought up how police/gov&#39;t could use it to monitor and spy on people. I was often told I was a f&#39;ing loon. To this day, when I try and discuss &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; issues with others, my wife included, I get rolling eyes and expressions of &#39;here we go&#39;. </p>

<p>When I was growing up, we kids were always told to question things. Never believe whatever your told without proof. We were taught that those attributes were what journalism was about.</p>

<p>I consider myself a pretty skeptical kind of guy. I tend not to believe things without concrete proof. I also believe that security/political entities are capable of engaging in acts that are not in the best interests of the public they serve. History has numerous examples of this. Declassified documents and whistleblowers have confirmed this. </p>

<p>What I do find incredible is the atitude and actions of many so-called die hard skeptics. I&#39;ve heard some of them belittle others because they don&#39;t strictly adhere to science. But I&#39;d say that the people they are so belittling are in fact practicing scientific principles by questioning. Isn&#39;t that the base principle of science? To question and then to seek the answer to either prove or disprove and to allow one&#39;s peers to confirm? I find it absurd for a skeptic to flatly state &#39;there is no God, it&#39;s a fairy tale&#39; when humanity has not conclusively proved or disproved the existence of God. Same could be said of GMO&#39;s, or Vaccines, or Global Warming, or whether or not a country&#39;s political/security entities could perform dispicable actions against it&#39;s own citizens - which I find curious since history shows that it can and has happened before. Everyone has no trouble believing the Reichstag fire was Hitler&#39;s fault, but they find it impossible to believe that Bush or Cheney or who ever arranged for planes to be hijacked? People of done dastardly things throughout history for money/fame/power, why would some today be immune from doing the same thing? In the end, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p>

<p>No, its nostalgic! You been around long enough to remember 14.4 baud rate modems? I remember when 56k modems came out, nearly crapped myself.  When I got a second one free I figure out how to use them both at the same time! My parents were pissed when I took up both phone lines :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m old enough to have used commodore 64&#39;s, with the tape drive. My friend had one and we spent stupid amounts of time tooling around with it. And his father used it and had this massive modem they hooked up the rotary phone to it. I don&#39;t remember them doing anything cool with it though.</p>

<p>I resisted owning a computer at first when I became an adult and went to work (I believed them to be a huge time waste before getting one. I still do, but I&#39;m resigned now to the fate of it). My first x86 had a 28.8k. It wasn&#39;t long then until the 56k&#39;s came out. Seems then the industry was advancing really fast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One big issue is disinformation. It seems a lot of conspiracy theorists are too scared to call other conspiracy theorists out on disinformation. </p>

<p>Example: A 9/11 thread recently claimed the collapse of WTC 1 &amp; 2 violated Newton&#39;s Third Law. Now anyone with a high school-level of physics education knows that&#39;s not true, yet nobody called the OP out. And when I asked for someone to explain how the collapses violated said Law, I got no explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I myself no longer join in the fight to convince people who want nothing more than to be left alone in a world they have created for themselves that is safe and secure from all conspiracies, I would find it interesting watching or reading someone else show how they can argue the point.  </p>

<p>You know what, even the esoteric would be fun.  Especially since things like magic and the occult aren&#39;t things I subscribe too.  I wouldn&#39;t argue it with you but would find it interesting to read.  I guess that is to say the subject of the occult and magic fascinate me even though I don&#39;t subscribe to them, same with religion in general. </p>
