    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve cracked the psychological profile on the anti-conspiracy crowd. </p>

<p>To put it quite simply, they observe reality with a binary frame of reference.</p>

<p>Black and white. Up and down. Right and wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy, because to them things just are, or they are not.</p>

<p>You can observe this phenomena when you ask them about known and exposed historical conspiracies. In their opinion, the existence of said conspiracies does not support the existence of unknown conspiracies. </p>

<p>They are wholly incapable of abstract thought necessary to contemplate the infinite possibilities between the two states. </p>

<p>And in the event that their binary state is forced to switch poles, the brain rewires a new binary state to supersede the failed state. </p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>Ruling state: The U.S. Government is generally good and seeks to improve the welfare of it&#39;s citizenry.</p>

<p>Existing sub state: The U.S. government does not spy on it&#39;s own citizens. A good government would not do that. </p>

<p>Now enter new information: NSA revealed to be spying on it&#39;s own citizens. </p>

<p>New state: The U.S. government does spy on it&#39;s own people, <strong>but</strong> a good government would do that as a means to protect them from danger. </p>

<p>To protect the ruling state, which governs a great number of important sub-states, the non-intellectual quickly switches sub states without contemplation and hopes that no one will notice the short circuit of logic. </p>

<p>It is this lack of intellectual capacity to let thoughts and beliefs exist between the two states, to contemplate known unknowns and unknown unknowns that absolutely infuriates the anti-conspiracy crowd.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In predictable fashion, the anti-conspiracy crowd, who clearly self identify with this <strong>binary label</strong> are here to defend their position (what a surprise!) and further illustrate my point with their usual tactics: Misrepresenation of the argument, gross exaggerations and their personal favorite, Mockery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent comment, however, I disagree with your last sentence. Based on my own personal experience with being &#39;awakened&#39; and coming to terms with the reality of our world, I do not believe it is a lack of <em>intellectual</em> capacity preventing otherwise logically minded persons from entertaining conspiracies. I believe it is a lack of <em>emotional</em> capacity. Using 9/11 as an example, it wasn&#39;t until I was ready, on an emotional and spiritual level, to accept the <em>meaning</em> of this conspiracy that I was finally able to acknowledge the logic of it. To use a cliche, when I &#39;took the red pill&#39;, it didn&#39;t allow me to see the world any differently, it allowed me to overcome my fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If our best minds were able to use psychedelics in a legal and uninhibited fashion things would change. Look at all the discoveries and renowned people that were affected by them. Steve Jobs, Kary Mullis and the development of the PCR technique, Francis Crick and the double helix, Bill Gates, and people like Terrence Mckenna are good examples. I’m not talking about a bunch of teenagers smoking pot or taking mushrooms at a rock concert and subsequently developing highly advanced technology. I’m talking about intelligent people, free to explore their minds and expand their consciousness. We had a glimpse of what this might be like in the 60’s and it was squashed before it could take off. You can’t have everyone running around with big ideas like that. They become a threat. </p>

I also mocked him about smoking pot because i was a brainwashed idiot. &quot;america is the best, the government loves us, the canadian government loves me, they want the best for us, lets make marijuana illegal&quot; just some of the shit i use to think. I tried marijuana one day, and EVER since that day, my mind has opened up to the real world. Me and my friend always talk about politics, the world, how it runs, what is the matter with it. And although we are not political scientists, or politicians, or economists, we understand the intensity of the situation us as a human race is in. We don&#39;t beat around the bush like politics do, we don&#39;t talk about unnecessary bullshit, we talk about WhAT IS WRONG, instead of &quot;this and that leads to this and thats why we must do this and that&quot; Pot opened my third eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point re: 9/11.</p>

<p>I have a few buddies who I can at least get to agree that what the government told us happened <em>probably didn&#39;t happen, or if anything, it&#39;s not the whole truth</em>. </p>

<p>I used to see this as a slight victory - because I wanted them to see <em>the big picture</em>, and they aren&#39;t ready. It took me and I&#39;m assuming yourself years, and I can&#39;t deny them that.</p>

<p>In those years it took awhile to fully realize <em>the implications</em> of it being an Inside Job. It was an attack, alright, and an overt action of war, I would argue. But it wasn&#39;t al-Qaeda, and the majority of the American public are not ready to compute that. And that&#39;s how good of a psyop 9/11 was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a hundred posts a day on here about this, and feel free to ignore me, but I just I feel like I&#39;m missing something. I know the government is capable of nearly anything it wants to do, and that it doesn&#39;t care about restraints put on it by law or by itself, because there is no oversight. I know they spy on everyone, I know they have no time for human rights, I know they topple governments and when they do certain businesses tend to get very wealthy. I know they kill random people all around the world, and I know they try to hide all of this from us.</p>

<p>I have no trust for the government, and am frankly more afraid of what they do/can do than I am of any terrorist or foreign state. I just can&#39;t seem to see 9/11 as anything other than people furious with our decades of blowing up their homes, toppling their governments, and keeping them in poverty. The way the Patriot act was passed? Yeah I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the NSA was involved in the anthrax scare, and every level of government was involved in whipping the public up into a frenzy. I&#39;m certain they made sure to benefit from 9/11, but I just don&#39;t see it as being something they did. </p>

<p>Would you or could you tell me the specific thing that made you come to believe 9/11 was a conspiracy? In that video what element was so profound it changed your thinking? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was the realization that the twin towers couldn&#39;t have fallen the way they did without the help of some kind of explosive. If they had of fell sideways on the path of least resistance that might have been probable but they fell neatly into their own footprint. </p>

<p>Newtons third laws states &quot;When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body&quot;.  </p>

<p>Richard Gage used an interesting analogy during his ama about this subject. Imagine suspending a bowling ball above your head and letting go. The ball will certainly do some damage but eventually our bodies will absorb the energy and the ball will fall on the path of least resistance. Keep in mind the bowling ball has an higher average weight and density then a human body. This fact alone warrants a new investigation imo.</p>

<p>That would be the specific thing that changed my mind. That vid was just the beginning.  Building 7 is even crazier because of the fact it fell at freefall speed. There&#39;s a lot more weird shit that happened. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk">September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor</a> for good info on the inconsistencies.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.  When I first saw the buildings collapse when I was in high school I always thought something wasn&#39;t right about it.  It just seemed too perfectly hollywood the way they dropped straight down.  I chalked it up to my emotions being out of control and never witnessing an attack like this to compare it to.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until about a year later around the anniversary I was emotionally desensitized enough to rewatch the building collapses closely including building 7.  I knew right away that these were controlled demolitions before I had even gotten wind of the conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>FFw to a couple years ago I drunkenly told my grandpa about the conspiracy thinking it would break his feeble brain and he responds casually that he knew as soon as the first building started falling on tv.  This coming from a man who refuses to use the internet!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>couldn&#39;t have fallen </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These kinds of phrases are why I tend to have trouble accepting the &#39;unofficial&#39; story. There have been lots of demonstrations as to how they could have fallen that way, even without explosives. It revolves around the fact that the burning jet fuel weakened, not melted, but weakened the supports of the building. When this happens the outside of the building falls inwards as the weight pushing in on the supports finally bends the weakened metal. There have actually been some videos and simulations on the subject, though I can&#39;t seem to find em right now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the bowling ball analogy is trying to demonstrate. The impact didn&#39;t bring down the towers, it was the intense heat weakening the supports of the towers. Least resistance was for the top floors to fall &#39;in&#39; towards the center of the building, which caused a continual collapse. </p>

<p>The thing that set me hard against most of the conspiracies, when I was 15 in high school we watched a documentary on the subject in class. Once it got as far as to say that the fuel couldn&#39;t &quot;melt&quot; the supports, because the boiling point of steel is higher than the boiling point of &quot;hydro-carbons&quot; not this specific fuel, but hydro-carbons in general. And it got the boiling point of hydro-carbons by <em>adding</em> the boiling point of hydrogen to the boiling point of carbon, which is obviously not how chemistry works. At all. That&#39;s when I decided this particular theory was probably reaching a bit. </p>

<p>That filming was very interesting, I actually haven&#39;t heard about that before, thank you for sharing. I was also really impressed by the article like,  it was actually well written, covered the issue, provided information, and didn&#39;t politicize it. Is this what journalism was back then?

<p>The war-games coincidence is also a very intriguing one, that one has been among the most interesting for me.

<p>We need an evil government.... to protect us from evil. Logic fail. If people are innately evil, then we should not have government, because the most evil will rise to the top.

</blockquote>

<p>While it&#39;s true that people don&#39;t need &#39;government&#39; in order to cooperate peacefully, we certainly need order and organization and leadership. Afterall, cooperation requires consensus, and persons of authority to carry out the will of those in agreement. Otherwise, a dictatorship or monarchy provides the above functions. This has been true since the dawn of time, on every scale of human organization and cooperation, beginning with the family, clan, village, tribe, and up. Final decisions and agreements have to be made by someone, and if you have a voice and a choice and choose not to participate, then someone else will do it for you. Theoretically, if <strong>everyone</strong> suddenly and simultaneously chose to stop participating in political life, then there would literally be no vehicle for concensus or cooperation above the most personal level, and the result would be social chaos. </p>

<p>In other words, you may not like the (corrupt) government you have, but government is necessary for cooperation. What kind of government you get depends on the level of participation.</p>

<p>On a final note...semantically speaking, the word &#39;<em>government</em>&#39; (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/govern">steerer / navigator / pilot / leader</a>) may not be the best choice of words. It might make a difference if people started saying, eg, &#39;The US <em>democracy / republic</em> is archaic, corrupt and dysfunctional because only 12% of people under age 30 regularly participate.&#39;</p>

I&#39;m against data collection, intrusion and spying on citizens, my point however is especially on this sub when anything violent that involves civilian casualties happens the majority of people here jump up and say it&#39;s a false flag attack. That&#39;s having a very black and white view of the world and ignoring the shades of gray that hey there are messed up individuals in the world that do messed up things. Now again I&#39;m talking generally about this sub I don&#39;t know your personal beliefs in conspiracy theories but you have to put the blinders on to not recognise there are people in this sub that are as you described &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39; people just in the opposite way.</p>

You world view is your paradigm.  Trying to change someone&#39;s paradigm by force is very difficult.  Even when it happens naturally it can have dramatic effects on one&#39;s brain.  Take my dad, who is a lifetime military.  He never believes conspiracy, and if was made known to him it might blow his mind forever, so his brain works overtime to ensure he doesn&#39;t see it.   It works the same way with people in a cult or religious zealots.   They cant see it until they do, then it blows their mind.  Sometimes that has a negative effect.</p>

<p>It&#39;s BS like this that keeps you guys from being taken seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I&#39;ve cracked the psychological profile on the anti-conspiracy crowd. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there is a crowd of pro and con conspiracy people? Seems pretty binary but not outside of the realm of possibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To put it quite simply, they observe reality with a binary frame of reference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh. That was fast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black and white. Up and down. Right and wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy, because to them things just are, or they are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense.  You&#39;re 3 pips in and you&#39;re already doubling back.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can observe this phenomena when you ask them about known and exposed historical conspiracies. In their opinion, the existence of said conspiracies does not support the existence of unknown conspiracies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this is the first accurate thing you&#39;ve said.  Because it&#39;s true.  Washington inducting 140 thousand people in to the freemasons has absolutely 0 effect on the WTC.  They are separate, individual historical events separated by 200 years.  You need to have actual evidence of your current theory, not anecdotal evidence that conspiracies can happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are wholly incapable of abstract thought necessary to contemplate the infinite possibilities between the two states. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone?  You&#39;re back to that binary thing again. I&#39;ll point out that absolutes are pretty unreliable unless you&#39;re talking about a very small subset of people.  For instance, all Shakers currently alive are abstinent. We can say this with confidence because there are only 5 or 6 alive.  But saying something like, all school children do not understand math fails to take in to account the staggeringly large number of school children and their various individual abilities.  It cannot, statistically, be true.  Nor can your accusation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And in the event that their binary state is forced to switch poles, the brain rewires a new binary state to supersede the failed state. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People aren&#39;t computers. You are thinking in binary terms here, so let me clear this up.  People come with a vast array of emotional and psychological baggage, and no fact, however jarring, is going to change that.  Sure, sometimes a switch gets flipped and triggers an instant all encompassing reaction.  But that&#39;s reserved for things like &quot;gee that lion is close and hungry looking. Maybe I should do something about that.&quot;  </p>

<p>But telling people W. planned 9/11, you&#39;re going to need to support that with hard science.  Otherwise you just soind like a loon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example:</p>

<p>Ruling state: The U.S. Government is generally good and seeks to improve the welfare of it&#39;s citizenry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said they are generally good? I know a lot of noon conspiracy people that have not said a kind word about the government in years.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Existing sub state: The U.S. government does not spy on it&#39;s own citizens. A good government would not do that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, who said?  We know they do.  We&#39;re on the internet too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now enter new information: NSA revealed to be spying on it&#39;s own citizens. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know this already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New state: The U.S. government does spy on it&#39;s own people, <strong>but</strong> a good government would do that as a means to protect them from danger. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh?  Where do you get that leap from?  Or do you think that every writer in the world criticizing this action is a conspiracy theorist?  If that&#39;s the case, I have a bridge to sell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just because there may be an infinite amount of possibilities, doesn&#39;t make any of them true. Skeptics and conspiracy theorists can both contemplate possibilities, but skeptics understand you need evidence to decide those possibilities are true. </p>

<p>No. I can understand the possibility of conspiracy theories, but it infuriates me and skeptics like me to see people thinking that possibility equates to fact. It doesn&#39;t. If you don&#39;t understand this basic principle, you can never apply logic and critical thinking to your beliefs.</p>

<p>Black and white. Up and down. Right and wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy, because to them things just are, or they are not.</p>

<p>it&#39;s better to say back <em>is</em> white. War <em>is</em> peace. Debt is wealth. Law is freedom. So it&#39;s not just a binary world for them, it&#39;s the opposite of reality. </p>

<p>So there is a crowd of pro and con conspiracy people? Seems pretty binary but not outside of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>To put it quite simply, they observe reality with a binary frame of reference.</p>

<p>Oh. That was fast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black and white. Up and down. Right and wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy, because to them things just are, or they are not.</p>

<p>This makes no sense.  You&#39;re 3 pips in and you&#39;re already doubling back.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can observe this phenomena when you ask them about known and exposed historical conspiracies. In their opinion, the existence of said conspiracies does not support the existence of unknown conspiracies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this is the first accurate thing you&#39;ve said.  Because it&#39;s true.  Washington inducting 140 thousand people in to the freemasons has absolutely 0 effect on the WTC.  They are separate, individual historical events separated by 200 years.  You need to have actual evidence of your current theory, not anecdotal evidence that conspiracies can happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are wholly incapable of abstract thought necessary to contemplate the infinite possibilities between the two states. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone?  You&#39;re back to that binary thing again. I&#39;ll point out that absolutes are pretty unreliable unless you&#39;re talking about a very small subset of people.  For instance, all Shakers currently alive are abstinent. We can say this with confidence because there are only 5 or 6 alive.  But saying something like, all school children do not understand math fails to take in to account the staggeringly large number of school children and their various individual abilities.  It cannot, statistically, be true.  Nor can your accusation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve cracked the psychological profile of the conspiracy crowd.  </p>

<p>To put it quite simply, they believe in the omnipotence of elites.</p>

<p>Power is bad.  There is no such thing as a coincidence because, to them, things don&#39;t just happen, there is always someone or some group behind the scene pulling the strings.  </p>

<p>You can observe this phenomena when anything bad happens and they immediately hop to the internet to claim false flags perpetrated by TBTB. </p>

<p>They are wholly incapable of abstract thought necessary to understand that everyone who doesn’t think the government is behind 9/11 isn’t an ignorant sheep with the critical thinking skills of a two year old.  </p>

<p>And in the event that they attempt to deduce something logically, their brain just poops the bed.  </p>

<p>An example: your condescending statement</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can observe this phenomena when you ask them about known and exposed historical conspiracies. In their opinion, the existence of said conspiracies does not support the existence of unknown conspiracies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is actually a perfectly logical position.  The fact that there were ‘conspiracies’ in the past lends zero credibility to any current claims, the only thing that could do that is actual evidence, which needs to be vetted on a case by case basis.  It’s why in a court of law the fact that a man on trial for murder may have murdered someone in the past is deemed irrelevant.  Also, most of the confirmed conspiracy’s (Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, MKUltra) weren’t even known about or suspected until the government declassified the information itself.  It’s not like these are things people were sitting around saying had happened and then all of a sudden their beliefs were confirmed, these conspiracy’s really came out of nowhere for the most part.  </p>

<p>I’m done copying your formatting, but you have quite an inflated ego, which I&#39;m pretty sure is another thing I cracked about the psychological profile of conspiracy theorists.  Damn I&#39;m fucking smart.  </p>

<p>Edit:  on account of your edit calling out my shillery for Big Shill<sup>TM</sup> - yes, I am totally misrepresenting the argument, guy who thinks &quot;anti-conspiracy people&quot; worship authoiry and only see the world in black and white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll bite.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s BS like this that keeps you guys from being taken seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I&#39;ve cracked the psychological profile on the anti-conspiracy crowd. 
So there is a crowd of pro and con conspiracy people? Seems pretty binary but not outside of the realm of possibility.
To put it quite simply, they observe reality with a binary frame of reference.
Oh. That was fast.
Black and white. Up and down. Right and wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy, because to them things just are, or they are not.
This makes no sense.  You&#39;re 3 pips in and you&#39;re already doubling back.<br/>
You can observe this phenomena when you ask them about known and exposed historical conspiracies. In their opinion, the existence of said conspiracies does not support the existence of unknown conspiracies. 
Well, this is the first accurate thing you&#39;ve said.  Because it&#39;s true.  Washington inducting 140 thousand people in to the freemasons has absolutely 0 effect on the WTC.  They are separate, individual historical events separated by 200 years.  You need to have actual evidence of your current theory, not anecdotal evidence that conspiracies can happen.
They are wholly incapable of abstract thought necessary to contemplate the infinite possibilities between the two states. 
Everyone?  You&#39;re back to that binary thing again. I&#39;ll point out that absolutes are pretty unreliable unless you&#39;re talking about a very small subset of people.  For instance, all Shakers currently alive are abstinent. We can say this with confidence because there are only 5 or 6 alive.  But saying something like, all school children do not understand math fails to take in to account the staggeringly large number of school children and their various individual abilities.  It cannot, statistically, be true.  Nor can your accusation.
And in the event that their binary state is forced to switch poles, the brain rewires a new binary state to supersede the failed state. 
People aren&#39;t computers. You are thinking in binary terms here, so let me clear this up.  People come with a vast array of emotional and psychological baggage, and no fact, however jarring, is going to change that.  Sure, sometimes a switch gets flipped and triggers an instant all encompassing reaction.  But that&#39;s reserved for things like &quot;gee that lion is close and hungry looking. Maybe I should do something about that.&quot;<br/>
But telling people W. planned 9/11, you&#39;re going to need to support that with hard science.  Otherwise you just soind like a loon.
An example: 
Ooh I like these.
Ruling state: The U.S. Government is generally good and seeks to improve the welfare of it&#39;s citizenry.
Who said they are generally good? I know a lot of noon conspiracy people that have not said a kind word about the government in years.<br/>
Existing sub state: The U.S. government does not spy on it&#39;s own citizens. A good government would not do that. 
Also, who said?  We know they do.  We&#39;re on the internet too.
Now enter new information: NSA revealed to be spying on it&#39;s own citizens. 
We know this already.
New state: The U.S. government does spy on it&#39;s own people, <strong>but</strong> a good government would do that as a means to protect them from danger. 
Huh?  Where do you get that leap from?  Or do you think that every writer in the world criticizing this action is a conspiracy theorist?  If that&#39;s the case, I have a bridge to sell.
To protect the ruling state, which governs a great number of important sub-states, the non-intellectual quickly switches sub states without contemplation and hopes that no one will notice the short circuit of logic. 
This is wrong, but I&#39;ve already touched on why this is terrible logic.
It is this lack of intellectual capacity to let thoughts and beliefs exist between the two states, to contemplate known unknowns and unknown unknowns that absolutely infuriates the anti-conspiracy crowd.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, see, you&#39;re just a troll. And that&#39;s why no one is engaging you (except me I guess). Feigning not understanding things, and nit picking rather than adding anything useful to the discussion, typical troll behavior. (Being a grammar nazi doesn&#39;t make you smart, and patronizingly implying I am using a thesaurus because I have command of vocabulary is just petty condescension) </p>

<p>You must be bored with life.</p>

<p>You said &quot;so you&#39;re saying poets, artists, and writers don&#39;t have the intellectual qualities useful for abstract thought?&quot; But <a href="/u/americandreamsicle">/u/americandreamsicle</a> never said that, and you never explained how you interpreted what he said as having said that. There is no substance in what you are saying, and you are the only one who fails to see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m right up the middle on stuff. I believe in the necessity of authority and that generally authority is good or at least trying its best in good faith at most times. </p>

<p>Too much of conspiracy rejects any authority, to the point if there was an anarchist running for president, there&#39;d be unfounded claims that he was in on any number of conspiracies. </p>

<p>Too much of conspiratard is blind authority worship like OP says to the point that if Hitler were around today they would be mocking people for believing he wanted to start the holocaust. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not surprising as any group usually reinforces an ethos. The major problem being when evidence takes a back seat to ethos which is the same problem political parties have or the new wave feminists versus gamergate has. Once you self-identify as a believer in something, you&#39;re self-worth becomes wrapped up in making sure all cases fit your belief instead of making sure your beliefs fit all cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist. I&#39;m right there with Eisenhower warning about the military/industrial complex, I&#39;m certain that <em>something</em> strange went down in Dallas, the 18 minutes were probably edited out by people with the right clearance, Iran/Contra was probably only the tip of the iceberg, etc.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s another kind of conspiracy theorist out there... They&#39;re not actually engaging in theory, so much as wild speculation. And it&#39;s not really about conspiracy so much as fear. That&#39;s the crowd that thinks that everything that&#39;s not a government false flag is satanic. They&#39;re the people who are crippled by fear of unknown forces wielding unimaginable power, observing and controlling everything they do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not conspiracy theory, really, it&#39;s just unenlightened paranoia.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t know which of those camps you fall into, but if you demand evidence before you leap to conclusions, then you&#39;re okay in my book. It&#39;s fine to have suspicions, but the reddit &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; rarely stops at suspicions just because they lack evidence, and any YouTube video that strokes their confirmation bias can be called, &quot;research.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of a fascist state.</p>

<p>People used to be suspicious of authority. Take a look at some old Hollywood movies and you&#39;ll see this as a common theme. Capricorn 1, Silkwood, The China Syndrome.... just to name a few. That was the attitude back then.</p>

<p>What has changed? There are still a lot of people that think this way. We at r/conspiracy represent this way of thinking. But there is a trend towards disbelief. This trend is being supported (pushed even) by the MSM.</p>

<p>If we really are transitioning over to an Orwellian style fascist state, I would expect to see a few things. One, continued ridicule of people with opinions that dissent/diverge from the official narrative. Two, increased efforts to censor stories and content that reflect this perspective. Three, increased legislation against same.</p>

<p>The government is not God, nor is it a god. The government is people. Therefore, the government acts just like people do. It can cheat, steal, lie and kill as long as it thinks that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes there are many small pieces of evidence that paint a larger picture and there is no one piece of evidence that is a smoking gun.  It seems that many debunkers demand that you lay out every detail to support an alternative theory besides the official theory.

It&#39;s irrational to do otherwise.  One has to be comfortable enough accepting that one <em>does not know</em> certain things and not insistant that they <em>must</em> be known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope</p>

<p>Views with a near unanimity of support do get certain benefits in the cultural milieu, because most people reasonably assume that in order for that view to be as common as it is some persuasive evidence must have been presented at some point in the past. And I suppose that  this constitutes an extremely low level of proof. </p>

<p>But any statement of fact needs to be proven. Accepting something as true because it&#39;s accepted by nearly everyone is legitimate if you haven&#39;t done the research yourself, but if you&#39;ve done the research and discover the evidence is faulty then stop believing. However, the fact that you met one person who said, &quot;maybe what you believe isn&#39;t true. You only believe what you believe now because it&#39;s the status quo&quot; doesn&#39;t count as sufficient reason to abandon belief in beliefs that are held by a near consensus, and doesn&#39;t necessitate a person go on a quest to understand the evidence behind their belief to maintain rationality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To start with, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s only two sides to every story. Whole media outlets make a living by digging around what you&#39;re calling the &quot;status quo perspective&quot; -  term that&#39;s vague enough to be absolutely meaningless. Other places you find wild speculation and theorising, which is laudable in a free-speech sense, but usually makes no goddamm sense and relies on either vitriol or wilfully obtuse reasoning. </p>

<p>Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that. It&#39;s useful and sometimes illuminating. But it&#39;s not the product of several people&#39;s working days, not signed at the bottom by anyone, the author is in no danger of legal repercussions if they are wrong. The cost to the reddit/YouTube user of being wrong is nil. The cost to media is real. It&#39;s growing less over time, and indeed is less than it should be, but it means more than it does to the redditor. </p>

<p>That would be one reason that it isn&#39;t unreasonable to ask for evidence. The other is the old canard about extraordinary claims. That&#39;s fairly subjective but I think most people can reasonably consider what is or isn&#39;t a likely story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t love that analogy, because the divinity of Jesus probably wasn&#39;t something they became convinced of in the first place, and because even today with modern scientific advancements that contradict The Bible &amp; secular biblical scholarship, you still can&#39;t convince a believer that anything about their faith is untennable. But just to play the game, I&#39;d probably point out that the main reason they believe Jesus was divine is that they believe he came back from the dead. However, they&#39;d never seen anyone come back from the dead, they&#39;d never heard a verifiable report of anyone coming back from the dead, but they have heard of people making up fantastic stories. So, why would you choose to believe that someone came back from the dead based on ancient evidence that boils down to someone said so.</p>

<p>But in the case of many conspiracy theories, the person espousing the theory is more in the place of the Christian trying to justify their faith (but of course lacking the support of the state and culture at large), than the person requesting evidence to support it. I have no problem believing conspiracy theories when there&#39;s sufficient evidence to support them. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment happened, nothing happened in the gulf of tonkin, scientologists did infiltrate the government and destroy incriminating paperwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your NEW WORLD ORDER:</p>

<p>Stop blaming Obama. He is a Puppet. Look to the Puppet Masters. It is so much more:
Come out of the Matrix to the Truth. The top 1% aka as the elite wealthy HAVES; they don&#39;t care whether you vote liberal or conservative throughout the world because they own all of the boxes you check. The difference is how fast they shove their predetermined agenda down the throats of the masses. They instigate perpetual war while they invest in aerospace, oil, ammunition, and pharmaceuticals and they don&#39;t care who wins because they profit as they stack up coffins on all sides while the coffers of the belly of the beast / dragon continues to grow where less is less for the masses and more for them. They use war for profit and depopulation. They burn aborted fetuses aka medical waste of the unborn for energy. They have a stated/printed agenda to rid the world of 6.5 billion people (Agenda 21) while they push euthanasia, birth control, abortion, end of life, pesticides, Genetically Modified Food, Unhealthy food additives, etc. in the name of profit. They use different religious denominations to war against the others. Most churches are not cults. Most are corporations filled with lemmings where free independent thinkers are shunned. Church denominations are used to control the masses. Many pastors will lead their sheep to slaughter as long as the coffers are full. They speak and preach politically correct gospel so as not to offend. </p>

<p>&quot;Meanwhile three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.&quot; </p>

<p>Come out of the Matrix before it&#39;s too late. Before the elite wealthy HAVES force the microchipping (RFID, etc.) of humans.</p>

<p>Are you seeing a thousand points of light yet, or enjoying your less for you is more for them, and how are you enjoying your hope and change? </p>

<p>It does not matter whether ebola was intentionally brought to this country to scare the masses into voluntarily giving up rights, or to intentionally spread disease for depopulation purposes (Agenda 21), or to spread disease to force the vaccination of the masses and perhaps the marking of the population so vaccine makers (George Soros funds ebola vaccine lab in Ukraine) and patent holders (Bill Gates, CDC, NHI) could reap billions in profit. What does matter is that the elite wealthy HAVES aka as the top 1% created this for secret ulterior motives to affect their end result of ridding the planet of 6.5 billion people and to feed their perpetual war machine. What is clear is there is a pervasive consumate evil in the world today.</p>

<p>They (elite wealthy HAVES) teach a language of divisive hate speech (jew versus everyone, christian versus muslim, black versus white, left versus right, democrat versus republican, liberal versus conservative) Look to who profits. Always follow the money trail.  Reddit censors.</p>

<p>Then when you are done with that, listen to Jay Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller and David Rockefeller talk of depopulation and then listen to Bill Gates talk of &quot;new vaccines&quot; for depopulation purposes.  When you are done there, key into the article where over 100 Indian women were given sterilization procedures in exchange for cars and tvs and have since died horrible deaths.  It is understandable that you would be skeptical without first an education.  When you are done with that, look up Charles Sannat&#39;s remarks as he addresses the 2014 Bilderberg commission on world depopulation on wordpress.  Also Eisenhower warned us as well, see Youtube.  If you need links, let me know.  Draw your own conclusions keeping in mind that the UN and USA as well as FBI, NSA, etc. are paid to sit on these sites and discredit truthful information.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you listen to that speech? He&#39;s talking about the dangers of communism and he&#39;s asking the news media to be careful about the information they publish because it&#39;s providing intelligence to the enemy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>listen to Bill Gates talk of &quot;new vaccines&quot; for depopulation purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really think you misinterpreted his quote. &quot;Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3.&quot;</p>

<p>He&#39;s talking about lowering infant and general mortality (vaccines), increasing lifespan (healthcare), and providing means to control sexual health. These methods combined will allow populations to live longer and have fewer children. If you live somewhere where your children are constantly under threat of dying from disease you&#39;re going to try to have as many as possible to ensure that some survive. This causes an excess because everyone is doing the same thing. If your kids don&#39;t die from [insert disease] then you won&#39;t have to have as many and you won&#39;t if you utilize birth control.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what Indias sterilization programs have to do with this. Like China, they have a massive population and are trying to curb this. I don&#39;t really agree with government endorsed sterilization but it&#39;s not my country and I&#39;m not a party to that decision.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve bought into this pretty deeply so I doubt anything I say will make an impact on you but you really need to relax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a hierarchy of knowledge.  If you are a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; then you have leveled up and no longer regard the propaganda given to you by authority as fact.  This also goes beyond the current accepted paradigm in the world.  When you try and change someone&#39;s paradigm it usually doesn&#39;t happen willingly.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally, I say something is at &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; level because the evidence for it suggests a low probability of it being true.  Either it presents a scenario which explains all known facts but there are a thousand other radically different scenarios which also do, or there is an explanation which is orders of magnitude more likely.  It really has nothing to do with resorting to authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t the media blatantly ridicule conspiracy theories?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an ambiguity in the term.  The general usage <em>is</em> a term of ridicule, an assessment of low probability for whatever reason.  But of course it can also mean a theory about a conspiracy.  Those are presented in mass media all the time, though maybe not the ones you or I would like.  For example, &quot;The Saudis are not cutting oil production because they want to bankrupt US oil ventures/Russia&quot; is a conspiracy theory which is getting a lot of play recently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you trust them implicitly or what is wrong with you exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all, I think for myself.  Chomsky reads the NYT first thing every day knowing half of it&#39;s distorted and trying to filter that distortion out.  And you can&#39;t get much more independently minded than him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bullshit and that for two reasons:
1) The opposite of a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is not a folly which blindly believes in a &quot;good ordering hand&quot; but someone who belives that there is no higher order/control at all. </p>

<p>2) Therefore (and due to the dogmatic structure of religions) a conspiracy theorist is nearer to the group of &quot;religious freaks&quot; than someone who does not go out looking for a conspiracy behind everything. </p>

<p>Without a doubt there are conspiracies at work - big ones at that. But somehow they tend to be ignored. Why? Because the majority of the gullible conspiracy theorists concentrate on impossible-to-prove and unlikely-to-happen theories. </p>

<p>For your example of a good government: Which good Government, which good society goes on killing innocents and torturing prisoners?</p>

<p>The US has a long list of conspiracies but all people talk about are bloody idiotic accusations.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I call someone a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, it&#39;s because they subscribe to <em>every</em> conspiracy theory they hear. Sure, all of them might be true, but the conspiracy theorist immediately defends the validity of every conspiracy at first glance. I had a roommate who went straight to conspiracy theorist. Within a few months he adamantly maintained 9/11 as inside job, Sandy Hook didn&#39;t happen, chem trails control weather, hollow earth, fluoride in the water, aluminum in medicine,  JFK assassination (OK I actually lean away from the official story here), etc. </p>

<p>If you can back up any theory you adhere to with facts and evidence, you&#39;re not a conspiracy theorist. If you accept any conspiracy to a significant degree based solely on conjecture, you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>9/11: From what I can tell after viewing hours of news clips, reading pages and pages of both sides of the controversy, and looking at all sorts of reports and building plans and listening to various theories I think it was an actual conspiracy set up by powerful people in our own government. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook: Something happened there but it&#39;s not remotely like what they tried to have us believe. </p>

<p>Chemtrails: Complete bullshit as far as I can tell. Kinda hard to even take this seriously on any level. </p>

<p>Hollow Earth: Only if you&#39;re wasted on acid and delusional. </p>

<p>Fluoride: I&#39;ve read enough to think it&#39;s a very bad idea to put it in public drinking water. In fact, it should be illegal, actually, I think it is illegal but then, so are a lot of things that are being done by various governments of late. If you want to argue that it&#39;s legal then it at very least highly unethical. </p>

<p>Aluminum in medicine: I have no idea what this is even about. </p>

<p>JFK assassination: I&#39;ve seen and read enough to believe we were lied to from the beginning. </p>

<p>The thing is - a true conspiracy theorist doesn&#39;t <em>believe</em> that a theory is correct, but merely assigns probabilities to them. For instance, theory A has 10% probability, theory B has 60% probability, the official narrative has 30% probability. Sometimes facts point to certain explanations, which some theories can describe better than others. But it still does not mean they are true. As more facts emerge, some theories are discarded, and new ones are created, which take into account the new situation. And sometimes even the official narrative turns out to be highly probable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you if you don&#39;t believe things with absolutely no facts you&#39;re following authority? Also, I don&#39;t believe you can put a lot of conspiracy theories in the same boat. Someone claiming the American government killed 3 thousand of its own people or the government is poisoning our water are both absolutely extraordinary claims with no facts backing it up. Those people are way out in left field and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. But there is nothing wrong with raising questions. The problems arises when you say &quot;this thing is true even though I have nothing to prove it and anyone who tells me I&#39;m wrong is just a puppet for the man!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if someone has an issue with authority but also doesn&#39;t buy into conspiracy theories? You do realize that just because someone doesn&#39;t think authority figures are evil conspirators out to get them doesn&#39;t mean they worship or even approve of the things they do right? You see my take on the world is that it is way more boring and mundane and simple than the average theorists is willing to believe. The problem is not evil hidden hands controlling every aspect of our pathetic lives; the real problem is the fact that no one is in control. No one really knows whats going on or what they are doing. We are all clueless and incompetent. The problem is the facade we try to maintain that we have everything under control when really its not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with the implications of either of those extremes.  Reality is a mixture of both.  Sometimes there are conspiracies to control.  Sometimes there are not.  It&#39;s not always or never.  Not every conspiracy theory is true.  Not every conspiracy theory is false.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t being micromanaged in every way conceivable and we are not completely free, coasting along on our own ignorance and incompetence either.  We&#39;re doing both, <em>at the same time</em>, in <em>different ways</em>.  The best that we can do is to examine <em>all</em> of the credible evidence available to paint a larger picture.  The problem arises when we filter that evidence, because we don&#39;t like how the picture it begins to paint makes us feel.  If we were emotionless, like a machine, we&#39;d take it all in without doing that, not that we should aspire to be emotionless.  We should aspire to look at everything there is without letting our fears control us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy the supposition that no one is in control. Some are far, far more in control than others.</p>

<p>For instance, it&#39;s a fact that a tiny cartel of people pretty much owns the means to issue the currency and credit of most of the world. That means they control the volume and value of that currency and credit of much of the world, putting them in far more control than those of us, the majority, would have in the material and financial world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, believe me I&#39;m under no illusion that the government is completely morally and ethically sound. I&#39;m against data collection, intrusion and spying on citizens, my point however is especially on this sub when anything violent that involves civilian casualties happens the majority of people here jump up and say it&#39;s a false flag attack. That&#39;s having a very black and white view of the world and ignoring the shades of gray that hey there are messed up individuals in the world that do messed up things. Now again I&#39;m talking generally about this sub I don&#39;t know your personal beliefs in conspiracy theories but you have to put the blinders on to not recognise there are people in this sub that are as you described &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39; people just in the opposite way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your point. </p>

<p>I was trying to illustrate that for this type of thinker, shades of grey always tend to give way to one end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>More often than not the end of the spectrum they find themselves on is the one that they&#39;re expected to be on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the links. I&#39;m already quite familiar with Anarchism. Rings true on paper. Nevertheless, it ain&#39;t ever gonna happen without another global militant meltdown or else some catastrophic natural disaster that wipes out all of humanity except one Anarchist community who starts the whole human experiment from scratch. There are literally thousands of different languages and hundreds of nationalities and millions of religions and billions of opinions. In any case, there will be war. It&#39;s the natural way, because cooperation is ultimately driven by fear of death. Find a way to defeat death, and you might have Anarchism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the authorities help, as they usually have experience a field in, but ultimately what determines evidence is the results gathered from the scientific method. If the results are accurate, they can be replicated by others. The problem is, conspiracy theorists never seem to be able to back their claims up with evidence that can be corroborated by other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo1WZ9g1IJ4">This documentary</a> talks about the mechanism of collapse at length. Basically it got very hot, the floors collapsed into each other, the way the building was built caused the supports to twist and bend internally under its own weight and ultimately collapse. Basically it&#39;s the specific design of the WTC that was its undoing. </p>
