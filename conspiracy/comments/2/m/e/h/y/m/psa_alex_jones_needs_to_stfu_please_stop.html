       Perhaps most of you are well aware of Jones, Icke, and the other pool pissers. For the rest, I just thought I would point this out. My first clue was his

        miracle

       cures.

       Personally, I don't think Jesse Ventura, Mark Dice, or Russell Brand are any count. Maybe they aren't Jones bad, but c'mon.

       Water purification is important, big berkeys are great filers. Why is selling stuff bad? Especially things like a wter filter that gets rid of fluoride and heavy metals. I dont get it, media operations require money to survive, what is wrong with selling t shirts made in USA instead of sweatshops and high quality water filters to grow and reach more people?

       'AFAIK' and 'definitely' should never be in the same sentence. How can you think something is definite if you are simultaneously admitting that you have limited knowledge on the subject? That sounds like Infowurrur logic. Your name has been added to the list.

       I wonder how many people on this sub were "awakened" by him or by people awakened by him, and then proceeded on from him to other sources of information that more synced up with their personal leanings. I guarantee quite a few. He is often very over the top and sensational, but that does draw in people to his show, and he knows it. The coverage of the bundy ranch was excellent. He has his place in alternative media, and I think the narrative is better off with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst people can come up with is that he doesn't criticize Israel strongly enough. I would agree with that, but if you regularly listen to him he absolutely does criticize Israel and talks openly about stuff like USS Liberty. Like it or not, he has opened a lot of doors for alternative information to make it's way into the mainstream. I think now it's our job to create more and more sources so that when people get turned on by his information, they can turn to other sources when he turns them off with his character.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'll likely get downvoted for having this opinion, but meh, that's how I feel. I still listen to the podcast and appreciate him, while keeping my critical mind wide open. I don't agree with him on lots, but for me, he remains a very good source of information and I understand how being embroiled in this "black info" world absolutely makes you a bit crazy, and full of rage. It makes me really, really angry too.

       I got my start with Jones. I still keep up with his site, although I am way better a vetting information than I used to be years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these very strong aversions to AJ seem fishy. Maybe they don't know how to vet information and just assume no one can?   They scream "don't look at this information site!".. But all I hear is "go back to getting your information from the corporate news!"

       He's a good information source, he just shouldn't be your ONLY information source and you should critical think big time while listening to him, if you do. I would say his biggest sin is exaggeration and oversimplification, and freaking out on rages but that does draw in the viewers so whatever sells I guess. Like why did OP list the Piers Morgan thing as "embarrassing" I mean, is it actually embarrassing to you, as an individual, Alex going on that show and calling him out, like REALLY calling him out for what the agenda he is trying to push (the disarmament of USA)
      </p>
      <p>
       What "they" do is infinitely more crazy, they are just complete masters of maintaining a veneer of legitimacy and reason while they enact policies of madness and death. Alex is like a mirror that has come out of the earth reflecting the utter madness of the global policy makers, it might still seem less than UTTERLY INSANE to people what they are doing, and you'll only be able to see it for what it really is when the curtains really fall, the HDTV's go silent, and we're living in the aftermath.
      </p>
      <p>
       My real "start" was watching Loose Change, which Jones produced, and I know for a fact that video kickstarted a whole groundswell of awareness all over the globe. So don't tell me he is an enemy shill, when he has done more for awareness than likely most everyone else on this sub combined. I'm planning on becoming much more impactful myself, and producing some kind of media if I am able to, and it sucks knowing that if I became popular there's a really good chance that I would inevitably be accused of being on Israel's dick or being an idiot or this or that or the other thing, by all the people cowering behind their computer screens in fear of standing up themselves and actually making a fucking impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean this to be an overly negative post, I really appreciate that "conspiracy" minded people do have their minds turned in the right direction, but the trouble with this kind of information is it tends to turn the spotlight inward and make people paranoid, and even though there are plenty of reasons to be paranoid I just wish there were more ways to direct that energy outward at making impactful gains in physical reality. I think we are changing things, and then I get really cynical and depressed and think we're just not changing things fast enough or quick enough to actually change anything meaningful.

       He does have good info from time to time. I will admit that I found a DL with Icke on InfoWars and they discussed the occult, pedophilia, British royalty, Brit celebs, Vlad Țepeș, and how it is all related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Rick Ross (not the fat artist), I haven't seen the interview. Hip Hop is gay these days. There are a few good artists that aren't posing. I won't listen to most of it. Jay-Z running around in skinny pants, looking like a gay ass Joe Camel with his Zionist or really gay named label. The black male has been feminized, and it is sickening. The worst type of person is one that sells out his own people.

       For everyone saying he has good info once and a while... a broken clock is right twice a day.  AJ is a shill that is misdirecting the alternative narrative to ridiculous places.  He is an entertainer that profits on fear and libel.

       Even if he wasn't a shill/controlled opposition, he's still just a blustery moron who has never been right about anything. Civil war has been a week away from breaking out in the States for like, six years now. And what sucks is he's gonna be right one day, on accident. And then he'll never shut up.

       95% percent truth 05% Lies. Dis-info. She how this agent tries to compare Russell Brand with these people in an attempt to discredit him. You will see more of this in the very near future as more and more people listen to what he has to say.

       Mark Dice is actually okay. He is controlled by the Illuminati to a degree, but he still sneaks in references to cloning center every once in a while. Jesse Ventura dismisses chemtrails without even looking at the evidence, so he's an obvious shill.... At least Jones seems to talk mostly about the truth from what I've heard.
