        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">145</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-11-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just finished having a friendly conversation with <a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> and realized he was a new user. I&#39;ve seen dozens of these over the past 6 months or so and it seems that most of the &quot;non-conspiracy theorists&quot; who participate here often, especially in threads which gain very little attention, happen to have very new accounts. </p>

<p>So I checked a few other of these new accounts and compared. The following accounts I will mention are all &quot;non-conspiracy theorists&quot; who have very new accounts and, in my opinion, sound very similar from a perusal of their history (and all of them seem to only post to this subreddit). </p>

<p><a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> created his account 25 days ago. </p>

<p><a href="/u/modsrcorrupt">/u/modsrcorrupt</a> stopped posting 26 days ago, as if the person simply gave up on the account, despite spending much time here daily. </p>

<p>We all know you must have an account at least 3 days old to participate here, so a theoretical person who behaves like this must have a backup plan...posting on another account until the replacement has sufficient age. Perhaps that was <a href="/u/nolibs4">/u/nolibs4</a>, who stopped posting 10 days ago, and <a href="/u/NWOwon">/u/NWOwon</a> started posting 9 days ago. </p>

<p>Now, a way that I could be more convincing is to show that all of these 3 users (and presumably many more) type in the same way. For instance, nolibs4 and NWOwon both use the subreddit &quot;Im14andthisisdeep&quot; as an ad hominem attack in this sub. Further, they both use r/ instead of /r/. See <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m4atl/is_anyone_else_amazed_by_the_amount_of_pro/cm0w1zx">here</a> and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2l5i6j/physician_who_doesnt_vaccinate_her_patients_says/clrplg5">here</a>. (modsrcorrupt also uses r/ as well)</p>

<p>Modrcorrupt and nolibs4 both claim to be physicists. See <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jzqq2/the_iching_encodes_the_64_tetrahedron_array_in_3d/clgmdga">here</a> and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jisfg/the_trouble_is_that_the_stupid_people_who/clc9s9q">here</a>. Although NWOwon doesn&#39;t yet claim to be a physicist, he is very active in physics threads here. </p>

<p>All 3 of these users capitalize the &quot;S&quot; in the word &quot;Stawman.&quot; See <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2l5i6j/physician_who_doesnt_vaccinate_her_patients_says/clsn9gv">here</a>, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2me58f/organic_foods_contain_higher_levels_of_certain/cm3d7e2">here</a>, and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hsqdo/history_proves_vaccines_are_quite_safereally/ckvwq0v">here</a>. </p>

<p>All 3 users capitalize the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;Truthers.&quot; See <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2l8v0w/why_should_i_vote_it_doesnt_matter/clsm1tk">here</a>, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6zck/camera/cm1jtf7">here</a>, and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2gqnce/a_massive_digital_video_billboard_in_the_middle/ckly64n">here.</a> </p>

<p>All 3 users use quotations incorrectly when next to a comma. &quot;&quot;, instead of &quot;,&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously, any one of these coincidences doesn&#39;t mean much, but together, I believe, it really narrows down the odds of this being a coincidence. </p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s a few more similarities in writing I found but I think this is exhaustive enough. You get the idea. I just wanted to show everyone here that this massive influx of non-conspiracy theorists who only post in this subreddit might only be one guy. Either that or we have a bunch of people who just created their accounts, all have degrees in physics, and apparently abandon their new accounts after a while. I&#39;ll leave it up to the reader to speculate on why a person would spend so much time and effort into creating the illusion that there are many non-conspiracy theorists here. I&#39;ll add more of those accounts that suspiciously stopped posting if I can find them. </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much what I do. I don&#39;t agree with much of anything I find on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (if anything), but I do browse it fairly regularly -- it&#39;s entertaining to me (especially when I find a post related to my field) and I occasionally enjoy debating things or just discussing stuff with people.</p>

<p>The concept that we are not open or welcoming of viewpoints counter to our own is largely overblown by people that unilaterally dislike the concept of conspiracy research. </p>

<p>Second, what you do in this sub is a far cry from the controlled opposition that this sub has to deal with. There&#39;s frequent bouts of people creating problems, posting horrendous articles, and generally being ugly <em>with the express purpose</em> of having a reference point to come back to and say &quot;see, this sub is a disgusting place&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you &quot;not believe in&quot; conspiracies? Does that mean they think groups of people do not commit crime in secret? Or that nobody in positions of power use their power to secretly commit crimes in coordination with others? Some (a lot) of theories posted and discussed here are pretty outandish, not supported, or just plain retarded, but that doesn&#39;t mean corruption and organized crime just <em>dont exist</em> in government or corporate groups. I am so tired of this &quot;ilerminati&quot; mindset where the only way a conspiracy can exist is if aliens did it with mind control.</p>

<p>Edit: by &#39;you&#39; I dont mean OP or thr readers here. Just the groups OP may be talking about.</p>

<p>Edit2: isnt puncuation supposed to be on the outside of quotation marks for American English and inside for British English? So using &quot;commas incorrectly&quot;, like that, wouldnt be incorrect? Not really sure, fuck grammar but maybe onenofnyou experts can help me out. Or maybe ill just go post comments in the defaut subs and see which style gets more haitmail.</p>

<p>Sorry, but &quot;,&quot; is just <em>wrong</em>.

<p>But it&#39;s also possible they are different people who started coming here around the same time, having been referred from the same place or something?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I still don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. It requires you assume intent with no information that speaks to intent. </p>

<p>Even if we assume every observation in OP&#39;s post is correct (which it quite possibly is) we don&#39;t know why a single use appears to be be moving through a few different accounts. It doesn&#39;t seem that he or she is using multiple accounts at once within a thread for example, so there could be other reasons for moving between them.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were banned from here at some point?</p>

<p>I personally like the idea of assuming good faith, or assuming positive intent. It&#39;s a nicer way to cope with the world around me, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. My reason is the sad habit some in this reddit have of &quot;stalking&quot; users and using their previous post history to attack them e.g. &quot;She posted in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>! She&#39;s a shill!&quot;</p>

<p>Makes a separate user account for here almost essential, I&#39;d say. </p>
