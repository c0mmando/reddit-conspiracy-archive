    <div class="md"><p>Probably 9/11 for me as well. I was in high school when it happened and it was exactly like people talk about the JFK shooting. I remember exactly where I was and what was going on when it happened and for weeks I watched the news just soaking up everything about that event.</p>

<p>Then loose change came out and I was blown away. That was probably the beginning of it for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It was a crazy Psyop (much like JFK was) where we were all traumatized and just accepted whatever the TV told us had happened (and even when <em>it was happening</em>), and only a brave few who had seen this stuff before immediately called bullshit (see Cooper, William).</p>

<p>There are two awakenings, in my opinion. One is obviously the initial <em>startling</em>, where you realize that <em>what really happened doesn&#39;t agree with what we were told had happened</em>. </p>

<p>Then, you internalize that inner conflict, and run out and start consuming information. Memorizing details. I can rifle off as many inconsistencies in the Official Version™ compared to actual measured events and what was broadcast as TV programming.</p>

<p>But then you take a step back and <em>really see the forest in the trees</em>, and realize that America was attacked that day, but it wasn&#39;t 19 dudes with box cutters, it was the <em>Military Industrial Media Complex</em>. </p>

<p>They have done it before, but this had an accompanying media campaign that was far beyond anything we had ever seen. And the destruction they have wrought in our names and the wake of the self-inflicted tragedy have been equally massive.</p>

<p>And then you realize where things are going. You realize that the world is getting organized into a bipolar world (Anglo-American (5eyes)/NATO/Petrodollar) with BRICS/IMF-SDR, and nothing good ever happens when these forces start mobilizing and ratcheting up military spending and proxy war efforts to have control of as many natural resources as possible in the coming cataclysm.</p>

<p>And then <em>you really wake up</em>, and start visualizing the new world that will eventually be created (I&#39;m more of a pessimist today and think it&#39;ll happen not only in my lifetime, but before 2020). And you realize there there&#39;s really nothing you can do about it, and stock up on whiskey, because that&#39;s the only currency I care about.</p>

<p>One video that always got to me was this one that was taken while the buildings were burning. It&#39;s these kids, probably high school age, around a basketball court talking about what&#39;s happening and one kid says how the CIA does this stuff and it was probably an inside job.

<p>Yeah but that doesn&#39;t matter anymore. You know <em>something&#39;s</em> coming again, and I&#39;ll be ready to call bullshit. And that&#39;s why they want to shut down/regulate the Internet, why everything you hear these days is about Cyber attacks (which we have no evidence of, ever), and they&#39;re going to deputize/indemnify the telecomms and governments into sharing and blocking <em>lawful content</em>, which you know they would classify as hate-speech if they could.</p>

<p>And when this Event is coupled with the incoming Petrodollar collapse, nobody&#39;s going to want to listen to us shout that from the rooftops when they&#39;re little green rectangles printed from the Federal Reserve Corporation &quot;doesn&#39;t buy stuff no more.&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s check and mate, fellas. Hence the whiskey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apart from the defeatism in the final stanza, I wanted to say that this is a terrific post. The &#39;waking up&#39; process is a <em>process</em>. </p>

<p>It seems to me that some people who think they are &#39;awake&#39; haven&#39;t yet figured out <em>why</em> their fellow humans are asleep, and this understanding is at the heart of actually being awake.</p>

<p>There is a good reason why our fellow humans are asleep and once you understand that, it changes everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying with what I was going to say.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how much more bad for the public alcohol is versus marijuana.</p>

<p>Then you start going down the conspiracy rabbit hole and you start to see why revolution is required:</p>

<ul>
<li>First cars were designed to run on Hemp Ethanol (alcohol)</li>
<li>Standard Oil helps start prohibition to stop alcohol from taking off as a fuel</li>
<li>Marijuana is gone after by paper and cotton manufacturers which is why it was made illegal</li>
<li>Due to marijuana being illegal medicine has not has access to a chemical/drug that could effect the whole industry.</li>
<li>Manufacturing has not had access to hemp to create everything from durable clothing to car bodies to microchips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also when you smoke marijuana it does something the elite and corporate control HATES. You put yourself in someone&#39;s shoes more. You aren&#39;t as quick to judge.</p>

<p>Then when you take magic mushrooms and have full ego loss, well that&#39;s when you really start seeing how twisted everything is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This material reality is actually heaven and hell. If you can really design your own outcomes through belief, you can live how you want.</p>

<p>For example, the people you see at cashier checkouts who are just bickering or complaining about how terrible everything is. They are living terrible lives of their own design. If the same people <em>chose</em> to discuss good things and imagine <em>good</em> outcomes, they are shifting their view toward the heavens.</p>

<p>It helps to have a family which lays the groundwork for that, giving you optimism from the outset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is also material context here. One new age theory is that each life is taking all of its experiences and helping to &quot;fill up a bucket&quot; with all the varied experiences there are. When the bucket is full, that soul moves on or something. It could very well be that the &quot;chattel&quot; and the &quot;victims&quot; have already experienced a blissful life, or perhaps they will in the future. I&#39;m not saying you can just imagine it and it happens like <em>poof</em> - I think it is more like you have to guide yourself through the material world to positive outcomes. Like not joining the marines, and like not voting for Romney.</p>

<p>I like to think Dick Cheney is going to be re-incarnated as a pig a few thousand times. Be slaughtered by inefficient butchers. MMM. Cheney Bacon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two comments; It seems to minimize the arrogance/aggression in me. The arrogance kept me moving forward and assuming I was doing the correct thing. My high stress levels kept me hyper-focused and unable to relax enough to see the big picture. [I was also highly successful in career and with women]</p>

<p>Secondly, when then relaxing and evaluating that picture, it seems to allow some plasticity which did not exist before. This is a dangerous path, however, as it allows you to make connections which are not completely rational. So it must be everything in moderation. [allowed me some lateral and forward advancement in career I never would have achieved otherwise, and allowed me to start having long term/meaningful relationships with women. but made it much harder to date casually]</p>

<p>You start with a completely irrational worldview which was fed to you by the powers that be [used to be the church controlling people through faith, now the governments/corporations controlling people through desire and fear]. If you are able to gain perspective from a place of relaxation you can then abridge that worldview with your own observations and critical thinking. However in order to continue to function within the system of the former [everyone else&#39;s bullshit reality] - you must hold on to some of that animalistic arrogance or you will cease to function in society. [aka become a crazy dreamer]</p>

<p>The fact that some of my core, basic realizations about how things are [including how the Fed is a system of usury] makes people of my Father&#39;s generation believe I am batshit crazy tells me the brainwashing system was in full effect and still is. Many will never escape it, and they will continue to feed the machine with blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stolen 2000 &quot;Election&quot; of GW Bush is what really woke me up, the way the MSM whitewashed it after that then put the nail in the coffin that our democracy was really just an illusion and a big lie.</p>

<p>I immediately suspected 9/11 was a lie when the boxcutter narrative was immediately disseminated and they said it was OBL and Al Queda when they never claimed responsibility for it like they did every other attack. Why not claim responsibility for this one? Especially since, if they really did it, it would be the huge success of a lifetime for them. 9/11 was immediately fishy to me.</p>

<p>It seems like they denied responsibility afterwards. I could explain that as even the black sheep of the Saudi family didn&#39;t want to draw too much attention on the Saudi family. [the ones we helped fly out of the US during the time when the skies were supposedly on lockdown]</p>

<p>Based on what the FBI did, however, and based on all the intelligence I&#39;ve read, I am personally convinced that the aircraft part of the operation was carried out by mainly Saudis/Al Quaeda. YMMV.</p>

<p>It really is pretty crazy.  A similar one for me was when I found out the whole background of the diamond industry - how they&#39;re kept artificially scarce, how almost all of the world&#39;s supply is owned by a small handful of people, and how there was an actual propaganda campaign to make girls desire diamonds and expect them as engagement rings (when that was never done historically).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I was genuinely confused. Why would I be disqualified for performing the requested work. Is it not my job to extrapolate and explain my persuasive paper? Apparently only 1 kind of persuasion was allowed...real persuasive.</p>

<p>After that occurred, I realized that even my proctor was upset, and probably embarrassed by the whole ordeal. It inspired me to be more concerned about how &quot;free speech&quot; was interpreted around me. It probably inspired me to debate. It might have been the synapse that made me pick up a couple books I might have otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>The next year, next competition cycle, I made sure to be in the same writing competition. I&#39;m sure the talking heads were looking for a change, if they could be compelled to care. Either way, they were screwed that year, as the prompt was about 1st amendment interpretation, what I had been reading about for a full year.</p>

<p>I needed two extra sheets to get my &quot;persuasiveness&quot; on to paper. Apparently, someone had tested a pen on a corner of the back of one of these sheets of paper. I was disqualified again, but this time, it was due to a pen mark on the back of my work...and I had no pens on my person. There was no recourse, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to resubmit, even by hand. Of course, by this point, I&#39;m now a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and have to nearly beg to be allowed to go the next year.</p>

<p>All this while cutting my teeth in programming...but I digress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iraq War. there were just a lot of things that didn&#39;t add up, finding no chemical weapons was just the icing on the cake;</p>

<ul>
<li>no plan for reconstruction</li>
<li>no plan for keeping the peace between various groups</li>
<li>no plan for how to get out</li>
<li>torture, we don&#39;t do that</li>
<li>no spies on the grounds, just satellite images, it just seemed wrong that we didn&#39;t have anything but fuzzy camera images</li>
<li>no plan for Afghanistan either</li>
<li>why would the US invade <del>a country</del> two countries on its own, and have no plan for what happens next in terms of leaving? How was it that the Taliban and whoever we were fighting in Iraq were far more challenging of an enemy to defeat  than the Nazis, British Empire, Confederates, Japanese Imperialists, Viet Cong... wars dont take this long...</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I just looked at a map... whats sandwiched between Iraq and Afghanistan!?!?</p>

<p>I travelled to Central America, lived there twice, got my minor in Latin American Studies. the shit thats swept under the rug about what the US did there during the Cold War. Not that the &#39;other guys&#39; were much better, but this wasn&#39;t part of the narrative of <em>&quot;we&#39;re the good guys&quot;</em></p>

<p>it kind of just came together, a slow connecting of the dots internally. then 2008 came around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that has driven me further (further into the rabbit hole of consipracies as i&#39;ve been told) is global warming, or for that matter the anti-global warming narrative. I have a masters in Environmental Science, and just seeing the bullshit that is spoon fed to people (and then seeing those same ass wipes eat it up) is one of the most surreal things I&#39;ve ever witnessed. </p>

<p>Whatever. But something happens when you talk to people about these problems, there is the glossed over look that hits their faces. Hold that thought. </p>

<p>Now jump with me to Tower 7. Lets assume for fun that it really did collapse due to fire... a fire that couldn&#39;t be put out by its sprinkler system. Think about that. The fire sprinkler system failed. At the most financially important area of the world (lower Manhattan, let alone the World Trade Center), a modern counter measure to the most basic threat to urban areas failed... Fucking nevermind the Illuminati or Rothschild, how does this not get front page coverage!? You would think that the inability to put out a fire, in a building, a modern built building in a densely packed city would big a big deal. Even with a &#39;terrorist attack&#39; going on. </p>

<p>Either this loops back to the false flag narrative, or an equally terrifying reality... that the infrastructure millions rely on is a joke and many of us work in death traps. Neither outcome is something anyone wants to deal with, since the scope of failure by fellow human beings is so great it eats at your confidence in simple things like that car next to you not running a red light. So what do people do? remember that glazed look i talked about earlier!? Yeah, boom. Glazed look for 9/11. Global Warming. Elections. etc...</p>

<p>It seriously makes me feel like I underestimated the magnitude of a message just in the song title <em>Wake up</em> from said song by Rage Against the Machine. Wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually was 9/11. I studied and researched all day that day, digging through pictures, news on in the background (frequently changing the channel when they went off on unnecessary tangents), and recalling every second of high school physics class I&#39;d ever attended. I think THE moment when I called bullshit was when they were talking about how hot the fires were (even before the global collapse) but I kept coming back to <a href="http://911review.com/errors/wtc/imgs/rachiel.jpg">this image</a>, and I was telling people that were looking at pictures with me, &quot;you guys, that&#39;s a woman standing there <em>in the impact zone</em>! If it&#39;s so hot, how is that possible?&quot; And people told me I was seeing things, that there was no woman standing there at all, that it was just an optical illusion from the rubble, even though we were all looking at the same image. It was my introduction to how well grown, functional adults can convince themselves to ignore things that don&#39;t fit with how they understand the world to work. </p>

<p>I&#39;d always liked shows like <em>Sightings</em>, <em>Unsolved Mysteries</em>, and <em>X-Files</em>... but I guess until 9/11 I really at my core thought they were just fun things to think about and assumed reality was far more mundane than that. </p>

<p>Then what woke me up about this sub being bullshit was all the posts of pics for the dc truckers strike. I was there all day making loops around the beltway.  Did two in one direction and then two the other. Repeated that for 6 hours. </p>

<p>I saw 4 trucks and nothing of the pics people were posting. </p>

<p>Also had a friend downtown and nothing of protests like people were talking about. So the people of this sub were being just as bad as msm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the Waco siege was the slap in the face that made me realize that we Americans are only free to do as we are told. After that, the OKC bombing and the hard to swallow narrative awakened me to the fact that people were going to kill or die to maintain control over us all. Then, 9/11 was proof positive that there is so much at stake that thousands of lives don&#39;t matter to the powers that be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a gradual shift over time. Once I cut my cable chord I feel like I was able to spend more time thinking and less time being entertained and my views started to shift. I never bought into the 9/11 being an inside job when I was a kid because I was just unable to fathom that kind of criminal negligence coming from the country that took out Stalin and Hitler. I still don&#39;t know if I would consider it an inside job, per say, but I don&#39;t think it was an organic attack. After the Snowden leaks came out and he broke the story on PRISM, I became instantly jaded against those in charge and couldn&#39;t believe the scope of this abuse of power, and the fact that NOBODY WAS PUNISHED OR REPRIMANDED FOR IT, really fucking ticked me off. </p>

<p>I always knew about MK Ultra since I was younger and have kind of been a UFO believer after I read a few books on Roswell / UFO conspiracies, so I guess I already had a skeptical bias, but they were really nothing to me other than neat parts of history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say for sure if it was any one thing. But watching different news channels is a big part of it for me. I&#39;d watch a story on CNN, then see the same story being covered on the BBC, CTV (Canada), Al Jazeera and RT.</p>

<p>After a while, I began to realize that everybody&#39;s news is biased and has a certain amount of propaganda built into it. CNN is really bad. What truly amazes me is how many Americans still actually believe their own news is the absolute truth.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything else that woke me up, it&#39;s all the alt stuff I&#39;ve read over the years online. This kind of goes along with what I&#39;ve already mentioned about the news. There&#39;d be so many interesting (and seemingly important) stories presented online. Yet somehow, these same stories never get coverage on TV. A couple of years went by and I noticed this more and more.... there&#39;s a lot of things you never see on television. What&#39;s more, it became apparent that TV (compared to the web) is a very restricted medium.</p>

<p>Once I noticed this, I started questioning what I was seeing. I stopped being a passive receiver for the official narrative and that was it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TV is a PSYOP tool.  Back when we were transitioning from analog to digital signals, the government gave away coupons for the digital converter boxes.  But in the inner city, people didn&#39;t care enough to take their coupons to get the new Boxes.  Somehow, the government was tracking the adoption to digital signals.  The government hired contractors to literally go door to door and install those boxes for people in the inner city.  I realized that Govt brainwashing starts with the TV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook. None of the evidence presented fits together and the secrecy for &quot;privacy of the families&quot; stinks to high heaven. Watching the initial news reports made me feel like I was in the universe of <em>1984</em> or <em>V for Vendetta</em>. From that day on, I always try to look past every false appearance in everything for the truth. </p>

<p>I became full of fear as a kid after 9/11 that any building I was in could have be blown up next. I fell for everything the media spoonfed us because I didn&#39;t know any better and my parents did the same. I even had a few memorable episodes of panic/anxiety in that following year. Now that I look back and study 9/11, I&#39;m filled with anger that I was wronged and tricked into fear for so long. That&#39;s what fuels my curiosity. I refuse to take what is told to me at face value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was the ISIS beheading videos (and subsequent media response) that made me feel like I was in a dystopian movie.</p>

<p>The videos were so obviously, transparently fake (no one is killed onscreen, the acting is terrible, and the &#39;insurgent&#39; is a caricature who speaks fluent english) but for some reason, the media coverage was <em>more</em> schmaltzy and emotional than to previous (obviously fucking real) beheading videos. </p>

<p>Next was an unprecedented storm of censorship as Liveleak/Twitter began deleting the videos and banning accounts sharing them, respectively. The UK government actually threatened to prosecute their own citizens if they shared the videos, under anti-terror laws.</p>

<p>Of course, all of the oddness and inauthenticity just led me to figure out that the whole thing was a PR blitz to justify war with Syria - a conflict we&#39;ve been trying to start for a few years now with very little popular support.</p>

<p>Had those videos not been so poorly made, I probably never would have retroactively questioned other events (Sandy Hook, etc) with suspicious media coverage, strange details, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. I have been wondering how many new people have been awoken by these amusingly-dodgy &#39;ISIS&#39; &#39;beheadings&#39;.</p>

<p>I think that one important part of the waking up process is realising a false narrative for oneself, and then seeing how easily other people - including those who one previously thought of as intelligent - fall for the very same false narrative one easily saw through.</p>

<p>Then one realises just how gullible people are, and the entire false paradigm of &#39;how could the government successfully lie to so many people&#39; falls apart. </p>

<p>Which then leads to either depression/suicide/drug addiction, OR a journey of questioning <em>everything</em> one previously believed. I have personally found the latter path to be more rewarding and enjoyable.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Or both... Now this is purely anecdotal, but it seems to me like drugs are often the most attractive to the personality types that are most prone to questioning the narrative.</p>

<p>Ever sit back and wonder how many bright kids with a fire in their heart ended up killing themselves with drugs over the latter half of the 20th century? It&#39;s been a bit of a slow-motion holocaust... As I grow older, I am fairly convinced that the prudish, &quot;abstinence-only&quot; attitude towards drugs in our society is a social construct designed to push all blame on to the user, label them, jail them, etc.</p>

<p>This trap is set for most volatile, fiery, &#39;threatening&#39; personality types, and the gutless cogs who are afraid to use drugs (or otherwise challenge authority) are satisfied to collect their paycheck, eat a cheeseburger and go home to an endless stream of internet porn.</p>

<p>In a dominator culture, followers and sycophants are more valuable than personality types that rock the boat...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t look seriously into the 9/11 thing until after I had seen the following documentaries;</p>

<p><a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-century-of-the-self/">&quot;The Century of the Self”</a> by Adam Curtis (BBC documentary)  History of mass market advertising, public relations, and propaganda.  Edward Bernays (Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew) and his tremendous impact on modern society.</p>

<p><a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-money-masters/">“The Money Masters”</a> - by Bill Still (documentary) A must see. A shocking rewrite of American financial history. And his follow-up award winning documentary - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U71-KsDArFM">The Secret of OZ</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO51ahW9JlE">The concept of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; as detailed in the this documentary</a></p>

<p>History of the last 100 years started making more sense when viewed through the lenses of that information. </p>

<p>What really sealed the deal was that when I starting looking into 9/11, I found out about WTC7. I was already very familiar with what a controlled demolition looked like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 16 when 9/11 happened, so I really didn&#39;t pay much attention to the world at the time.  I remember fox did a special on the moon landing hoax a while back, I thought it was interesting, but didn&#39;t really buy it.  As I got older I started to question a lot more about what we are told.  I knew our government was fucked.  Obvious the game was rigged.  The rich play with the world the same way my brother plays monopoly, that&#39;s why I would never let him be the banker.  I think Sandy Hook was kind of the breaking point, where I decided I can&#39;t trust anything the media/government officials say.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was when Barack Obama bailed out the financial institutions. I live in Canada, and was in high school and college through the Bush era. Ontario public education has a heavy liberal bias, so the idea of the american war machine, and the military industrial complex was not foreign at all. Nevertheless, i retained faith that it was just certain individuals taking advantage of a broken system. But, after Obama&#39;s campaign, and having my expectations risen to such a level. It made it very difficult not to see the contradictions in his words and actions. It was abundantly clear there was no &quot;change&quot; coming, and i had to completely reevaluate the system i was indoctrinated into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty self explanatory really.</p>

<p>The Gospel is the truth.</p>

<p>Whether you believe it or not, Christ is the fulfillment of the Savior prophesised in the Old Testament who would pay the debt for the sins of mankind to save the world.</p>

<p>This is what the Bible points to as well as the testimonies of many people of various beliefs that have had near-death experiences.</p>

<p>Jesus is the &quot;Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the WORLD!&quot; - John 1:29</p>

<p>&quot;The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself ALL things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.&quot; - Colossians 1:15-20</p>

<p>&quot;For as in Adam ALL die, even so in Christ shall ALL be made alive.&quot; - 1 Corinthians 15:22</p>

<p>&quot;ALL people will see God’s salvation.&quot; - Luke 3:6</p>

<p>&quot;For God has bound EVERYONE over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them ALL.&quot; - Romans 11:32</p>

<p>&quot;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot; - John 3:17</p>

<p>&quot;We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of ALL people, and ESPECIALLY of those who believe.&quot; - 1 Timothy 4:10</p>

<p>Those are just a few passages from the New Testament, for more verses outlining universal salvation, including many from the Old Testament, click here - <a href="http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/universalism-is-not-in-the-bible.htm">Universalism Is Not In The Bible?</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The book of Revelation perfectly details the two evil powers that are at work today. </p>

<p>World Jewry - &quot;Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are not, but do lie; behold I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you. - Revelation 3:9</p>

<p>&amp;</p>

<p>The Catholic Church - Described as the Whore of Babylon or Mystery Babylon the Great.</p>

<p>If you study the secret societies and beliefs within the upper echelons of Catholic Church and Judeo-Freemasonry you&#39;ll find they have most of their origin in Babylon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, it was a long but steady process for me.</p>

<p>For personal events and influences, I was a peace time volunteer in the Army in the 90&#39;s, between the two &quot;wars&quot;.   During that time, I found The Punk Rock.  and after that time, I started just living a fairly &#39;counter-culteral&#39; life-style.  I also read a shit-ton of all sorts of stuff.</p>

<p>as far as social influences go, man, I cannot deny the importance of the X-Files TV show.... they hit so many things big and small, and just really had folks question things.  At the same time was the advent of this thing called the internet, so I could immedietly watch, read, or hear something, and then go clicky-clacky on the internet and come up with some answers...   Soon my life was teeming with thoughts about the bilderbergers and the NWO, and the originators of the Illuminati, and the bohemian grove, and false flags and subcultural social plants and vote rigging and media control and financial control, and the IMF and the World Bank and how they engineer modern international serf-dom.</p>

<p>Oh, and aliens.  Definitely the aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TV is a PSYOP tool.  Back when we were transitioning from analog to digital signals, the government gave away coupons for the digital converter boxes.  But in the inner city, people didn&#39;t care enough to take their coupons to get the new Boxes.  Somehow, the government was tracking the adoption to digital signals.  The government hired contractors to literally go door to door and install those boxes for people in the inner city.  I realized that Govt brainwashing starts with the TV. </p>
