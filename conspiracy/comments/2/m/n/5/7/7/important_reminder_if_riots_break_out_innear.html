       If a couple of hipster kids from black sheep holding signs that read black lives matter is your idea of a protest then okay. Where were locals when a pregnant woman was tased right outside my work? Oh yeah no one gives a shit when its their own community.

       I can't help but agree to this. People won't riot if he's indited, or at least not to the degree where the national guard is needed. All of this is obviously preparation for the worst case scenario, but the amount of work they're doing makes it seem like the higher ups already plan on letting him get off scot free.

       The people that would be making the most noise if he's indited would be the Klan. And Anon just presented some evidence that some on the force are kard karrying klanners already, trying to stoke the fires of their precious race war.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't necessitate a state of emergency, since the Klan is notoriously cowardly in person. Therefore, I think it's relatively safe to assume they're gonna let the cop off scot free and they're just getting shocktroops in place for the inevitable blowback.

       Oh yeah, it's the general consensus that he will not be indicted. But even if he is, the Hands Up, Don't Shoot coalition is still planning actions so it is still a good idea to have the national guard to help keep the peace. No matter what, the HU, DS coalition is having actions, I don't believe the Klan has planned anything but I also don't think they'd be a problem either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is, either way the protesters(not the klan)  will be in full force and I feel like that amount of people at 'ground zero' gives a good reason to use the national guard (a third party system not run by ferguson PD)

      <p>
       But here's the thing: Why do you believe that protest necessitates the national guard? Examine where that comes from. You're not the only one that thinks that, but it's a fairly new turn in the social sphere. When people were protesting WITH GUNS, no one thought the national guard needed to be there. And we've had a senator recently shot by someone that is confirmed to identify with that kind of protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself, honestly: Why do you feel it's justified to have National Guard at Ferguson to handle protestors?

       How much you want to bet that the verdict will come shortly before thanksgiving break. All serious news stories that the media wants people to ignore happen before a holiday. If the story is less serious but still somewhat embarrassing it's announced Friday afternoon.

        With the grand jury expected to deliver its decision any day, people worry that tensions could boil over — not only in Ferguson, but at demonstrations in more than 30 cities from Boston to Los Angeles organized by a group called the Ferguson National Response Network, mostly for the day after the decision is announced.

        plan to participate in vigils and protests.

        The Ferguson National Response Network lists planned community responses to the grand jury decision in big cities such as
        <strong>
         Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle
        </strong>
        . It’s also planned public gatherings — to be held the day of the announcement or the day after — in smaller cities that include

       "These people need to be brutalized."
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you fucking kidding me? You actually think the police beating "these people" senselessly will ease the situation? Far from it. It would cause more problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that low income, predominantly Black areas have higher rates of violence and crime. I agree that, in Ferguson, there are pieces of shit causing problems for the rest of the community for the completely wrong reasons. However, I do not agree that "brutalizing" these people will accomplish anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you appear (and I may be completely wrong, my apologies) eager to attach this generalization to ALL black men and women in low income areas, which frankly isn't true and isn't fair. There are a lot of fuckboys out there, and they should be dealt with, but not every Black man is a fuckboy that needs to be brutalized to teach him a lesson.

       well said.  I'm a grain of salt in the pepper shaker too, never had any problems here.  just a bunch of people trying to get by.  This race bating bullshit tribalism is one of the reasons everyone is oppressed.  rather than fight against our real enemies people act like they are going to get ahead by stepping on their brother, just because hes a different color.

       The whole point, if I could add all the other news stories that the into this (on my phone so harder to do) is that Jeremy and Michael were friends and played on the same football team. Michael and his other friend were looking for some money to buy drugs, and decided to rob this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael had lived with Jeremy, and had basically been brothers, with Jeremy's niece calling him Uncle Michael. However he still decided that they would be the ones to rob.

       No that's not your point. That's a story. Your point is obviously something to do with race. You are actually implying his skin color had something to do with him committing those murders.

         Should white people stay out of Ferguson? Are black people animals? Is it all the Jews&amp;#x27; fault? (Of course it is). This and more in /r/conspiracy.

       Racism against blacks is not the answer. Ending black-on-white violence and showing blacks that the real culprits are bankers, Jews, politicians, etc. is the appropriate response.

       Some Jews are cunts, just like everyone else can be a cunt. I think you may be meaning to call Zionists the cunts, They are the cunts. Its kind of like how you wouldn't or shouldn't take some extreme Muslims and then call all other Muslims terrorists. You are entitled to your thoughts, stick to them, I'm just trying to give another perspective.

       Really I was just using the term sarcastically, insinuating that that's how blacks are taught to view the police force. "white patriarchal" maybe I should've put the quotation marks around the patriarchal too.

       Yes, it seems that they are conflating whites and hispanics to fudge the data. That's why it's surprising, because it's BS.

       I would guess that's actually false. They include hispanics with whites in order to fudge the data. Hispanics commit a lot of crime compared to whites.

       Yet, in “The Color of Crime: Race, Crime and Justice in America,” produced by the “right-leaning” New Century Foundation in 2005, using the same FBI and Justice surveys, startling facts emerge:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against other blacks.” Forty-five percent of the victims of violent crime by blacks are white folks, 43 percent are black, 10 percent are Hispanic.
Blacks are seven times as likely as people of other races to commit murder, eight times more likely to commit robbery and three times more likely to use a gun in a crime.
“Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit violent crime against a white person than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.” (If decent black folks have trouble hailing a cab, and they do, these numbers may help explain it.)
Black-on-white rape is 115 times more common than the reverse.

       Nope, wrong, that is NOT how statistics work, this is a bullshit manipulation of data, statistics like this are complete horseshit, as you can't predict the specific violent actions of an entire ethnic group based on the acts of various individuals.

       That type of statistical reporting is so disingenuous it's absurd.

       I know how stats and data collection works.

      <p>
       This data is being presenting in a purposefully racist manner which is factually untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being black doesn't make a person more likely to commit violence crime, being of those environmental and socioeconomic circumstances which caused violence in others may also cause other similar people under similar circumstances to commit similar acts of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nothing to do with race at all, and everything to do with external factors which are not represented in this data which further makes its' statistical claims complete and utter bullshit.

       Statistical probability does not work like that.

       You don't? Its simply because they're such a small overall population (8% black males), but responsible for just as many (if not more in certain categories) of crimes committed. Statistically speaking, if whites committed the same rate of crimes (adjusted for population percentage), then the US would be a complete &amp; total lawless hell hole. See the difference? Here's just one small info graph on the so called "white on black" crime problem.

       I accept that humans are violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I offer no solutions because the solutions already exist and are already widely ignored which is why people continue to be such terrible pieces of shit.

       I can not offer solutions which will stop all human violence, nobody can.

       So essentially, this person is alleging that one act of random violence from some people years ago equates that blacks are going to be physically violent against white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not view on incident as being indicative of how people of the same skin color will behave in the future towards people of other skin color.

      <p>
       I view these attempts as racist propaganda.

       For those of us old enough to remember the race riots of the 1960's there are similarities.  I am not suggesting he is right--I actually think it is good to protest, march, and be civilly disobedient.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for a lot of people, they see a mob once in their lives--it is an experience that will set your neck hair on end when you see it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sit in the street.  Gum up the works.  Get arrested for civil disobedience.  Have a ball.  Set private property on fire...I think thats a crossed line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am hoping and praying (as much as an agnostic prays) that we get through this without damage to person or property.  I hope that the issue is reviewed in the daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear there are a lot of people on both sides with agendas other than justice.

       It's a fact that the media has pushed onto blacks the idea that "whitey" is evil. Any black uprising will necessarily target whites, especially since government employees who involve themselves in these cases will push for violence against whitey. They want their race war and they will have it one way or another.

       Good luck. Every day white men are raped by black men in prison because they've been led to believe that whitey is their oppressor. Every day a black man rapes a white woman for the same reason. Every day blacks beat and kill white people, at numbers that vastly out weigh the opposite situation (black-on-white violence is epidemic, white-on-black violence is basically non-existent). They are fomenting a race war and black fools are eating it up. Whites are responding in kind. That is why Ferguson is dangerous for whites. Fact. Sorry it doesn't fit egalitarian nonsense, but it's reality.

        In American prisons, studies by sociologists suggest that more than 90% of rapes are inter-racial and may be motivated more by a need for sexual dominance over another race than by sexual passions (Starchild 1990, p. 145). Many rapes are by blacks on whites, suggesting that it gives the lower-class black, who has felt trod upon all his life, his one chance to dominate a white person (Starchild 1990, p. 145). Consequently, the victims are almost always young white prisoners. (Scacco 1982, p. 91) has also noted a disproportionate number of black aggressors and white victims in studies of sexual assaults in jails and prisons. Even if the minority of prisoners are black, the minority of victims are white (Scacco 1982, p. 91). When 'targets' were asked to identify their aggressors at the time of their rape, most were black (80%), some were Hispanic (14%), and a few were white (6%). (Lookwood 1980, p. 28 ) At the Tennessee State Penitentiary, when asked about the races of the aggressors and victims in rape incidents, nearly all whites agreed that the aggressors were black and the victims were white (Bowker 1980, p. 8 ).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prison rape has been shown throughout this study to be racially motivated by 
predominantly black inmates specifically against white inmates who in turn are the victims.
        <strong>
         Although more studies 
need to be conducted to confirm this theory, racial hatred of whites by blacks appears to be the main force driving 
prison rape.
        </strong>
        In fact, the US Department of Justice (1991, p. 15) noted that black (57%) and Hispanic (51 %) violent 
inmates were at least four times more likely than white (11 %) violent inmates to have victimised someone of a 
different race or ethnic group. In reality, black inmates do have the power and control to have consensual sex with 
overtly homosexual whites and blacks, but they prefer to rape non-homosexual whites in order to humiliate them. In 
essence, prison rape in the United States may not be an issue of power, sex, or even homosexuality, but rather an 
issue to humiliation targeted against whites by raping them. This persistent victimisation of whites over any other 
ethnic or racial group is why conditions need to be implemented to protect whites from rape or future rapes in prison.

       Obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I infer from this data is that the rapes of new inmates who are young and white by inmates who are black is that the rape is not motivated by race, but by inner jail social status.
      </p>
      <p>
       "New Fish" is the term used to describe these prisoners who essentially become prison "bitches", which is why they are so quickly raped, to establish that they are the bitch to the other prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel all of their conclusions here about these attacks being racially motivated are bullshit which they are trying to force the data to fit.

       In other words, it doesn't really mean this but we want it to so we are going to state that the data COULD support this.

       RF jammers. Probably handheld models with a range of about 100 feet or so. They rely heavily on RF traffic themselves and these are a broad spectrum device so they'll probably stick them right on the 'front' of things or hidden around official protest areas.

       Here are some consumer models that are listed as illegal to own in the US by the FCC:

       This. If you want to capture any footage you better use a disposable camera or an 8 track camera and then digitize the footage later. There is a good chance phones and other recording devices will temporarily be disabled.

       I'm not sure. Depends on the connectivity of the device, and the vector of attack. If it simply scrambles CPUs through air waves maybe it will effect digital cameras as well as phones. Not sure.

       Agreed, let's get the criminal rioters identified and prosecuted. It's your civil service to assist police in the safeguarding of your neighborhoods and this includes photo and video identification of these rioters. Hopefully all of these people doing police/military work can safely make it home to their families after it's all said and done.

       That's my sentiments exactly. The majority of people only know what they are hearing from the media outlets and I'm here to tell you they are not only incorrect, but they are adding fuel to the fire. People are too quick to judge police as bad people, when in reality, they are just folks doing an underpaid,under-appreciated,dangerous civil service.

       Peaceful assembly, asshole. Check your Constitution while it's still at least somewhat intact. It's right there in the First Amendment. It's pretty important. Actual, certified MEDIA couldn't even record during the last go around, that's a huge problem for rights in America.

       No that's not your point. That's a story. Your point is obviously something to do with race. You are actually implying his skin color had something to do with him committing those murders.

       You are a grade A racist. Get the fuck out please. YOUR KIND is the one causing problems.
