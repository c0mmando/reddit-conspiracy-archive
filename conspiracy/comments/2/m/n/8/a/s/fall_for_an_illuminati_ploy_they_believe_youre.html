       Take, for example, Christians. Dumb enough to think that the Jewish "god" Jehovah or his "son" Jesus are real. Therefore you deserve to die, for being so foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the French revolution, Christian priests encouraged each other to just let the Jews and Freemasons and their minions, the revolutionaries, kill them. They were stupid enough to think it was their responsibility to be passive and just die without a fight, without any violence. Turn the other cheek, and all. A few of the younger priests tried to run away, which of course is the intelligent thing to do, but there were only a few of them, so they were slaughtered too. This all comes from Nesta Webster's
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/frenchrevolutio00websuoft">
        French Revolution: A Study in Democracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity was designed to make people sacrifice their lives for Jewish hegemony. Oh, how successful it has been. And still is today, considering today's Christians just can't wait to support wars for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop being stupid. Do not embrace Christianity, Leftism, necons, or any other NWO Jewish ploy. Wake the f up.

       Believe what you want, I respect that, but also understand the reason the people that didn't run when death was upon them was because they know that life for those people will be taken care of one way or another. I believe in God, I was once was Christian, but I decided to step away from religion and keep my belief while still communicating with God continuously.. because that's what I believe in. I believe he understands and listen no matter which area is right or wrong, he knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm awake and know way too much about all that is going on. I don't focus on that anymore. I let God guide me to what I need to do. Fighting isn't possible when it comes to the people we're dealing with. The people in the "Illuminati", or the NWO people, or Masonic's; all of them as a whole I'm not scared of. You know what? Because we're the ones they're scared of. They know the power good holds, and one day soon they will have their day.. and that's truly how I believe things will work out, because that's what happens to evil, they always fail, even when they think they control all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite have control (ON EARTH), and most of the reason people are scared to do anything, isn't just out of fear, it's out of faith. I believe a lot of people believe that even if the fear and evil is there, why worry all the time about it. I had a priest tell me one time, the more you talk, think, and research them, the more power we're giving them. I still care, I'll always care, because I believe in us people, and one day.. one day soon, we will be victorious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like your post says though, research some, learn what's going on, but don't let them control you, that's what they want.. Sorry about the wall of text, but this is how I feel. I truly believe in God's power, he's always helped me, every time I talk to him and ask for help, he's there. Surely if you ask these "Illuminati" fools who think they rule everything for help, they won't give you anything, but lies.

       I appreciate your comment. I did learn the hard way that focusing too much on all this negative stuff is bad for you. Had a bit of a breakdown but on the other hand I also considered it a spiritual awakening; it made me realize what's important in life and also that there is more to it than just flesh and bone.

       Well, thank you for your comment first off also. The reason you see the negative stuff is because they want you to. Satan in my opinion is one tricky fella. Tricky on EARTH, because that's where is power is. I don't know your actual spiritual belife and I accept how you feel, but in my life I've come to the realization of GOD. He's there, he accepts me, and he's saved me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can talk about how cheesy that is you atheist. I've seen too much, asked for too much, and done too much that has come out good, shit that I literally asked for in my life has happened nearly INSTANTLY, just because I have faith. Part of my path I thought was to fight the Evil, to tell the world that they're every where that there's this big plan and that they will take over soon! Well.. we all know this to be true, but that's not how we fight Evil, we simply ignore them and spread the word of the good. Because all in all, when the day ends, they fear us, the good. Be intelligent, learn about them and know what Evil they do, but don't obsess about them, that's what they want; simply smile and understand there's a bigger plan, and if they choose their side, the Evil side which for some reason they don't see, then let them. We all know you can't change people, but putting the word out, the good word, is part of my plan. I will always talk about good, about GOD, about the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Illuminati I know you're scared, but to be honest... you should be.. NWO, fear us. Good will always win. We've always been taught that, but you know what, I KNOW IT. We don't fear you, you're the ones who think they have the power, but we the people do have the power, and fear no one.

       Who the Illuminati and all their followers, they believe in Satan. But in that belief they also don't believe in God, which by my standards doesn't make sense to me..Yahweh is just as you say, a false deity, just another who believes their power is stronger than that anyone. What I mean in all that I speak of, is that God is my overall lord, and I do believe of Satan and all the evil of the world, but I don't BELIEVE in them, if that clears things up.

       He exists friend,  never doubt that. Ask for his help, thank him for things,  look for the good in people and everything. That's what I do, and that's all I see anymore is the good in everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem a tad scared or confused,  but don't be,  follow how you feel,  do what feels right,  help people in life,  and keep straight.  Life is great,  and that's thanks to God.  You need to take a day and look around at the beauty our eyes are allowed to even behold:)

       Again - too much focus on "Jewish hegemony" and "NWO Jewish ploy".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        These people don't give a fuck about Judaism
       </strong>
       - it is a tool and a shield that they use, just like Christianity, just like Communism, just like the Fed, and just like literally hundreds or thousands of other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are no more "Jewish" than you or I, they are descendants of European royalty and they use common Jews as a cover and a shield (which OPs like this play right into).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're well aware of the influence that secret societies/mysteries/occulted knowledge/astrology have on the elite, all of which predate Judaism, so why do you keep focusing on it so much?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just say "NWO ploy".  It's a lot more accurate and a lot less hostile and easy to be dismissed.

       You're probably right. Just seems like a lot of the most evil people are Jewish and always have been, and that Jews play a key role in perpetuating evil.

       Oh they do, no question.  My thing though is that I highly,
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       doubt that these people give a fuck about Judaism outside of how they can use it to control and divide the masses.  I doubt they even practice the religion.  So, knowing (or at least assuming) this, I feel like posts that focus strictly on a "Jewish conspiracy" do a disservice because they make people suspicious of all Jews in general, they make regular, innocent Jews defensive, they make one easy to discredit as an "anti-semite", and I don't even think it's accurate to describe them as Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinions.  The old Jewish guy who lives in my apartment building with a chihuahua isn't plotting world domination.  At least I don't think...

       If the purpose of Christianity is to be slaughtered by these seemingly all-powerful Jews, why and how did the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions torture and slaughter so many? Why were the Russian Orthodox able to carry out the pre-Stalin pogroms?

       Great post. I believe in God. I grew up roman Catholic. But after a ton of thinking I've come to the realization that religion is about control. To control the masses for their minds and money. Just like the elite want to do. Also with how left the Pope is leaning makes me think it even more.

       I believe in God too. I just don't believe Yawheh/Jehovah is really God. Nor Jesus, his "son".

       In Strasbourg in 1348 they rounded up 2000 jews after some admitted to poisoning the wells with bubonic plague. They were offered the chance to be baptised and spared, or burn to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most chose burning to death. The jewish parents even often insisted on their children burning, too, but many children were forcibly baptised and spared.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's not just Christians who will lay down their lives for their faith.

       Load of nonsense.  All religions are equally BS control machines for the elite, nothing more.  You sound young and like you yourself are just now waking up.  Before you start spewing stuff like this, realize that millions have walked the same path before.  Do more reading, more research, educate yourself, in 5-10 years we always look back at our former selves and laugh at how little that guy/gal knew, you are no exception (neither am I).
