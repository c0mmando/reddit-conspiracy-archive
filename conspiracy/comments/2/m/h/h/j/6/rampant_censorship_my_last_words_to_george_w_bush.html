    <div class="md"><p>I saw this link on the front page in the news subreddit.  I thought it was a very pertinent piece, when you consider the ISIS ordeal.  However, I guess any sort of link that deviates even a little from the official narrative is removed.  There is some serious censorship going on in Reddit, which is extremely disappointing considering the amount of people going on here to get news and inform themselves.  Clearly, the reddit narrative is conducive with the MSM and/or pro-government narrative, very disappointing indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, 50 years ago the warmongers&#39; mantra was, &quot;America: Love it or leave it,&quot; before 58,000 Americans had come home from Vietnam in body bags, and the government said, &quot;Whoops... I guess we goofed.&quot; Bush had his own war cry, and it looks like we&#39;re in for the really, really long haul with this one.</p>

<p>The overwhelming evidence that &quot;Dubya&quot; was a buffoon masks the subtle genius in his realization that the novel &quot;1984&quot; could serve as an operations manual rather than a cautionary tale. You yourself observe that Obama has sold America on the Bush policies in a way that their author never could have, but in his defense I would point out that before his reelection he plainly said on television that &quot;You can&#39;t change Washington from the inside.&quot; Clearly, there are greater forces than him at play in the Capitol, and I don&#39;t think that he is a very willing participant in what is unfolding on his watch.</p>

<p>Be all that as it may, the deleterious effects of &quot;the patriot act&quot; on First Amendment protections have been examined by many more capable than I, and at much greater length. David L. Hudson writing for The First Amendment Center, for example, notes that &quot;In a blog for the American Constitution Society, [Georgetown law professor David] Cole writes that the decision [Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project] means that &#39;we now inhabit a world in which it is a crime to advocate for peace if the government disapproves of the group to whom you are speaking.&#39;&quot;<sup>[1]</sup> This is far from an isolated opinion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that there is any question that the First Amendment is seriously under siege, from the conservative effort to conflate money and speech, opening the floodgates for a &quot;government by auction,&quot; to the covert subversion of social media that stifles political discourse, to the overt targeting of lawful, peaceful activists on the streets. At the rate this is progressing, the First Amendment won&#39;t even last as a cherished memory for very long, since his &quot;Ministry of Truth&quot; would be more easily implemented in the digital age than even Orwell ever imagined.</p>
