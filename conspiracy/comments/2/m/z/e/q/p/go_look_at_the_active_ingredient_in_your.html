    <div class="md"><p>Look up how to make homemade deodorant. My friend makes it all the time. It works amazingly well, you can choose your own scents so you don&#39;t smell like a bro/old timer, and it&#39;s super easy to make. You can make kinds that will go into rolling sticks, or creamier ones you can apply with your hand.</p>

<p>Deodorant freaks me out too, but you have so much more control when you make it yourself. </p>

<p>(It&#39;s also good to avoid aluminum in your food, baking powder.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals and it&#39;s really good deodorant but it includes triclosan which is toxic and may cause cancer. That&#39;s the only thing wrong with it. I contacted Arm &amp; Hammer but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s part of their mission to poison us too so I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll provide a version that is free of the poison.</p>

<p>Supposedly there are natural deodorants available out there but not in my neck of the woods. And I&#39;m not gonna rub baking soda on my pits every morning. I may actually just stop using deodorant altogether, or maybe try some coconut oil for at least <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>propylene glycol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok.. I am a chemist and I&#39;m tired of people going &quot;OMG PROPYLENE GLYCOL&quot;.  (not picking on you... just in general)</p>

<p>Propylene glycol is the non-toxic version of ethylene glycol (the one that forms crystals in your pet&#39;s kidneys and kills it).  It has a slightly lower boiling point, but because of the reduced toxicity, it has now widely displaced ethylene glycol for use in anti-freeze.</p>

<p>Propylene glycol is found in many places, including ritz crackers and children&#39;s cough syrup.</p>

<p>Because it is used in actual anti-freeze, it is also used as an anti-freeze agent in many products.  That would be why it might compose a small portion of the ingredients in a vaccine - it is used to make it stable against temperature variations!  I use it in paints that I invent for this very purpose too.</p>

<p>Just because propylene glycol is a component of automotive antifreeze does not mean that anti-freeze is propylene glycol.</p>

<p>Because you&#39;re cattle. It&#39;s the same reason why you poison your children to death when told to by men in lab coats.</p>

<p>do you understand what BO is? why it exists and why it smells the way it does? </p>

<p>do you realize that EVERYTHING is a chemical? just because something is a chemical doesnt mean it is bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few studies in recent years have theorized that aluminum-based antiperspirants may increase the risk for breast cancer. </p>

<p>According to the authors of these studies, most breast cancers develop in the upper outer part of the breast -- the area closest to the armpit, which is where antiperspirants are applied. The studies suggest that chemicals in antiperspirants, including aluminum, are absorbed into the skin, particularly when the skin is nicked during shaving. These studies claim that those chemicals may then interact with DNA and lead to cancerous changes in cells, or interfere with the action of the female hormone estrogen, which is known to influence the growth of breast cancer cells.</p>

<p>Considering that one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer at some point in her lifetime, the idea that antiperspirants might somehow contribute to the disease is a pretty serious claim.</p>

<p>Yet experts say the claims don&#39;t hold up to scrutiny. &quot;There is no convincing evidence that antiperspirant or deodorant use increases cancer risk,&quot; Ted S. Gansler, MD, MBA, director of medical content for the American Cancer Society, said in an e-mail interview.</p>

<p>Gansler says many of the studies that have been conducted were flawed, and even though a few detected chemicals from antiperspirants in breast tissue, they didn&#39;t prove that those chemicals had any effect on breast cancer risk. In fact, one well-designed study comparing hundreds of breast cancer survivors with healthy women, as well as a review of all available studies on the subject, found no evidence that antiperspirants increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>

<p>The claim that aluminum is <em>very bad shit</em> is not scientific. </p>
