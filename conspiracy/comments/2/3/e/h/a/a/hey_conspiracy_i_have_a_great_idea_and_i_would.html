        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are frequently accused of vote brigading as a subreddit, hilariously by a subreddit (conspiratard) which exists almost implicitly to vote brigade our wonderful subreddit.</p>

<p>I think that meta posts which link to neighboring subreddits undoubtedly lead a few less than honest folks to go and vote in those linked posts and even if our intent isn&#39;t to invade someone else&#39;s space it still happens.</p>

<p>In the past people created the NP link (no participation) system to politely ask people not to vote in the linked threads but literally everyone on reddit knows that all you have to do to bypass NP is to replace 2 letters in the link (change NP to WWW).  When conspiracy added NP to our CSS to try and keep conspiratard and SRD from raiding our space, conspiratard openly bragged that all they had to do is turn off CSS to keep raiding us unhindered.  And so they do.</p>

<p>In conclusion NP is nothing more than a CYA that shows the admins minimal effort has been put forth to stop the vote brigading.  Its a worthless feel good script that doesn&#39;t do anything.</p>

<p>My idea is that conspiracy takes the high road and starts using <a href="http://www.redditlog.com">www.redditlog.com</a> when linking to other subs.  With redditlogs a new URL is generated that can not be easily reverse engineered and anyone who wants to vote would be forced to find the offending comment on their own without simply replacing 2 letters of the URL.</p>

<p>If we take this high road we will not only prove to the admins that we don&#39;t want to brigade as a group, but we will prove that conspiratard is a cowardly vote brigade.  Especially since conspiratard removes redditlogs links because they &quot;don&#39;t provide context&quot; aka they can&#39;t vote brigade.</p>

<p>So what do you say conspiracy?  Are we better than them?  Are we willing to give up our own ability to post easily brigaded links as a show of our character?  We have no promises that other subs won&#39;t still link directly to us, in fact I promise you that they will.  </p>

<p>We can do the right thing and set an example for the rest of reddit, or we can keep allowing conspiratard the easy excuse that &quot;conspiracy brigades too!&quot;.</p>

<p>Please add your opinions below.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a redditlog snapshot that is relevant to this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your message. And yet we are not even in the same category as them energetically. Why continue to create unneeded enforcement in this sub? The greater majority here are respectable individuals set on a mission not even caring about them. I didn&#39;t  even know who they were until this sub started making them famous around 6 months ago. Seriously, and I&#39;m less than a year into Reddit. Rather than create and enforce new rules, let&#39;s encourage people to consciously look to the new posts and vote accordingly. I&#39;d personally be more in alignment with  a rule that requires all down votes to leave a comment for doing so over this new proposed rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real - nobody here is vote brigading. Sure, users may cross over and down-vote when a bot links to an immature, inflammatory thread posted in response by <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. But comparing those actions to the collective actions taken by a sub which exists <em>solely for the purpose of agitating and sabotaging</em> is just unacceptable.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to enforce <em>mandatory</em> posting restrictions/regulations on <em>us</em> because <em>they</em> can&#39;t act like adults? Is this a joke? You&#39;re asking us to take the higher road - to me, the very fact that this sub doesn&#39;t exist <em>just to troll others</em> is taking the higher road.</p>

Mr. Guy said that one group of people was bad, and that his group of people was good because they never engage in bad things.

    <div class="md"><p>I was blown away by how heavy their infiltration of YouTube really is.  For the heavy videos on Sandy Hoax and the Boston affair, they have a response to the top 5-10 pages of comments.  Every single time.  A pack of timing, often changing your their names, as you four see when other users would start a thread with them, and +% their name in the response.  </p>

<p>A common tactic was to claim to be from another country.  After reading a few vids with of comments, I could see their key objectives.  Waste the users time with nonsense,  racebait all Muslims - calling for their deaths (also common of conspiracy theorists.  They&#39;ve really turned up the heat past &#39;don&#39;t give a Fuck), of course slamming them for the <em>&quot;shame [they] should feel for what they are putting the families through&quot;</em> to have a so-called relative show at just the right time, and illogical justifications.  <em>&quot;The government would NEVER allow private and classified infornation online,&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;that you would be raided, and sent to prison if you posted anything classified.&quot; This was how she disassociated the mountains of clear evidence right in front of her. All I could hear was *&quot;Nu-uhh!  A cop cannot lie to you.  If you ask him if he&#39;s a police officer, he can&#39;t lie.  He has to tell you, cause if he didn&#39;t, he would have to arrest and take himself to jail for perjury.  I know...&quot;</em></p>

<p>It was however quite refreshing to see the massive majority have clued in on the truth.  A term they demonized that is now haunting them.  We need to work towards further removing the stigma of the term conspiracy.  To throw this back in your face would be absolute justice.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wS8p9po.jpg">ghost from a dead kid</a> that suffered from Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, took a Honda Civic (plate 872 YEO) which was registered to <a href="http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2_5/comments/39302/">known criminal Christopher Rodia</a>, as confirmed by Squad 272 who is at the school and calls in 872-YEO as a possible suspect vehicle which then the operator states Christopher A Rodia, including the birth date at <a href="http://66.90.101.64/10_04%20AM%20-%2010_34%20AM.mp3">2:10</a>. With no connection to the Lanza family, the car is still reported to be his mother&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>Then he allegedly carried massive weaponry on his person when he shot his way into the Sandy Hook school and proceeded to &quot;kill&quot; 26 people and then himself in a time span of less than 7 minutes with a kill ratio on 96% (26 + himself + 1 injured) for no reason whatsoever without showing up on any video or photographic evidence of him being there at all. </p></li>
<li><p>This while &quot;coincidentally&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">matching</a> the <a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CAC9C6C9CD83CDC9C7">schedule of a drill</a> &quot;to enable participants to improve their community’s mitigation and emergency operations plan specifically regarding the needs of children&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I thought I was being the good guy, showing that no kids died and they insist on saying some kid took out 26 other kids for no reason other than some mental disability? Do they want to see 26 kids dead? Why do they insist this actually happened? What kind of sadistic fuck wants to believe this?</p>

<p>Oh, and now <a href="/u/Psyforce">/u/Psyforce</a> and <a href="/u/216216">/u/216216</a> have just joined the brigade. Gotta tag &#39;em all! How they actually expect anyone to believe that some guy from <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> has any insight into Sandy Hook is beyond sad. Better bury my comments instead so they get a feeling of accomplishment from their superiors. I just laugh it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or...or....This sub could <em>ignore</em> conspiratard completely and focus on conspiracies instead (including reddit-related conspiracies like censorship).  This whole distraction reminds me of a common tactic, I think it&#39;s called &quot;divide and conquer&quot;.</p>

<p>Their subreddit is clearly designed to bully and aggravate people, so the best choice is to ignore them and move on.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately this probably won&#39;t happen because the gang war style mentality is already in full effect, but I&#39;ll still make this plea for readers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to <strong>refuse</strong> to be distracted by other subreddit drama.  Notice I said subreddit drama not subreddit conspiracies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my 2 cents anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess I would have to say that (as bad as it may sound) it&#39;s up to the people here to fight it.  You have to get out and vote more often to fight the trolls.  Regardless of if <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> brigades or not, they are 1/10th the size of this sub, they should not matter that much if you vote actively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be in a sub that was actively commented by trolls. They would spend every day arguing the same points (morning till night - not even exaggerating), and people would waste a lot of time debunking them. However, then they would come up again making the same arguments in another thread. </p>

<p>Their point is not to make their opinion known, but rather to scare away new users who aren&#39;t aware of them, and mistake them for regular users of the subreddit. They make outrageous claims each time, and lies of course travel faster than the truth. </p>

<p>Since we all want to have proper discussion and don&#39;t want to spend most of our time combating trolls, it makes sense to bar them from the conversation. If we were actively fighting them off, then our discussion in each thread gets weaker and people are less likely to engage with them all the time. The sub degrades as a result because users get upset that mods are not doing anything. None of our users are able or willing to compete with people who spent 24/7 trolling, and so they will ultimately win.</p>

<p>So yes trolls can be harmful too. </p>

<p>Probably shouldn&#39;t have done this because it&#39;s impossible to defend yourself against 30 people all trying to ridicule you, but I spent the last 2 days in there.

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to agree with you. But let me ask you....did we taunt an aimless bunch of twits mercilessly until they felt compelled to form <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> (a place they could call home ☺</p>

<p>The answer is, without prevaracation, <strong>NO</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is not just some equivalent of a clique of middle school malcontents who merely enjoy making fun of people who they deem don&#39;t conform (though certainly that&#39;s an incidental motivation for them). </p>

<p>It&#39;s same thing I have been saying this whole week!! The essence of controversy between conspiracy theorists and non (as they relate traumatic events).</p>

<p>I know I am a driving everyone crazy with this video I have been posting as of late, but it&#39;s relevant here too. I would guess 75% of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are threatened by us. It is the fact that we generally DO leave them alone that bothers them. If we leave them alone, it shows them that for us, <strong>these discussions are real</strong>  ...and not a game. We threaten them without intention because if they don&#39;t attempt to squelch us, a fear grows in them....a fear that just maybe what we are saying is true.  And that my friends, is the heart of most anti-conspiracy theorists. The fact that 9/11 or the Boston Bombing could be true (as we see it) is very disturbing to them.</p>

<p>Once again... the video:</p>

<p>This one is on 9/11, but it can be applied to a lot of different &quot;theories&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been around here a long time and have never noticed brigading coming from this sub. I&#39;ve never been approached or been asked directly to up or down vote content on the other subreddits.</p>

<p>Those users who do tend to request brigading or pitchforking aren&#39;t whom I consider part of our core group or are people I&#39;ve recognized over the years. 99% of those posts are also deleted quickly and efficiently.. indicating that the majority is doing it&#39;s  job and reporting the offending content.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be really careful about being &quot;sure&quot; about anything here. This is the internet, where everyone is anonymous and everyone seems to have multiple accounts. People from that other sub have been &quot;playing both sides&quot; for a very long time now. For all we know some of these users could have infiltrated this subreddit and gained the status of &quot;regular conspiracy poster&quot; with relative ease.</p>

<p>All that being said, I don&#39;t see the difference on using a redditlog link or an np link. This is the internet.. if someone wants to find a thread or comment it&#39;s a Boolean search away..</p>

<p>Exactly.  Then the guilt of their brigading is on that individual user because they went out of their way to find the snap shotted post and interfere without conspiracy being complicit by virtue of not having higher standards for how we allow our community to be used.</p>

<p>I could be wrong but I feel like your argument strengthened my argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know Tape, I don&#39;t follow your logic. You wouldn&#39;t be fixing the main problem. Your suggestion relies on participation. My whole point is that the majority of our users don&#39;t brigade. Those that do brigade will still do just that regardless of what link they follow or whether they follow a link at all. If it&#39;s truly brigading they most likely use pm&#39;s or an external messaging service.</p>

<p>Think gun laws...Those that are participating in illegal activity will continue to do so regardless of the height of the fence you put up.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t it pointed out recently that someone was using twitter to brigade?</p>

<p>He may be...  but as I see it at this point, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is doomed to become fettered with more rules, restrictions and everything else.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the majority of this subreddit vote brigades in other subs.  That said, there has been a time here or there in the past when I have followed a link and participated, when the link wasn&#39;t np.  I have tried to refrain from doing that in recent months.</p>

<p>Whether the link is np or redditlog I don&#39;t think matters, as long as redditlog is as reliable as np. (It <em>is</em> an external site)</p>

<p>As long as we are allowed to continue to circulate information within this sub, the externalities in other subs should be secondary.</p>

<p>We need to concentrate on keeping this sub free as possible, if that means keeping the eye of sauron away from us, (at least in the temporary) then so be it.</p>

<p>We all know that eventually we will have to jump ship just like digg, but the longer we can stay here and expose things to the world, the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my opinion, anyone is welcome to argue with it:</p>

<p>This solution is as good as the np. option: the people that often brigade the other sub from here will still look for the thread using the title, it will be just annoying. They can also look for the users&#39; comment history and easily find the respective thread if it&#39;s a recent thread.</p>

<p>I have mentioned before and I will repeat again: There is nothing, absolutely nothing worth discussing about that sub in here. They are <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1m77ns">violent people</a>, they stalk users here and their daily lives in that sub are literally to mock and call others a portmanteau of conspiracy + retards. People that post anything talking about them in here not only invites drama but also puts himself in danger.</p>

<p>There is no content worth anything that can come from that sub. The only thing we do when we mention them in here is to give them more attention which is what they want.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be trying to use hacks to avoid brigading, we should ban any talk about that sub once and for all, period. The less attention we give them the better it is for us. They cling to circlejerk attention, we have even seen how far they are willing to go in order to parade between their own peers, they go as far as using alternate accounts to derail threads, they use socket puppet accounts to brigade in favour of their own discussions in our sub (<em>there are even cases of users offering gold to themselves 30s after the comment has been posted and thanking a stranger as if it wasn&#39;t them</em>), they lie about why they were banned from here so that they feel special in their little corner and vote brigade any mod that tries to show the truth, and the recent fake r/sandyhook censorship ban that was posted in here by a member of the sub being discussed in this thread which was then openly admitted that he deliberately wanted to laugh at us and parade between his group by creating his own false content: something that most of us here know already that it is a result of the JTRIG operation - make us look so ridiculous that hardly anyone can take us serious.</p>

<p>Everytime we give them less attention they reach further lengths to get it, imagine what it might happen if we give them 0 attention. </p>

<p>That sub is cancer and bringing cancer to this sub will only spread that cancer even more, they have no intentions on having reasonable discussions, they have no interest in this sub, they only mock, insult and derail us at every turn.</p>

<p>The only time when that sub should be mentioned is when it is used as a simple &quot;in context&quot; addition to a discussion about some member or actual situation that is focused outside of that sub.</p>
