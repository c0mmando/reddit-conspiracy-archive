       So, while I'm not "new" to the world of conspiracies, I'm ostensibly not "awake."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm asking to be "awakened."
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I not know that I don't know I don know? What do I need to know? Where do I look?
      </p>
      <p>
       Help me to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       The common consensus seems to be that "awake" really refers to keen critical analysis and logic. I'm glad to hear that. By those standards, i would consider myself awake, always improving of course, but awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also changes how I view this sub reddit, too. It's nice to know that this isn't home to mindless extreme cynicism and "ilerminatee did it bro" sorts of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate the feedback.

       So mass surveillance on whole populations, with the intent to chill protest and dissent, indefinite detention and torture of prisoners at Guantanamo and other sites including torturing hunger strikers with force-feeding, wars of aggression, unjust occupations, and the use of drones, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians around the world,  mass incarceration of over 2.4 million people in the United States, mainly Black and Latino, a program with a genocidal impact against these groups, including torture, solitary confinement, and unjust executions, making abortion and birth control increasingly illegal and inaccessible, endangering women's lives, being a large contributor to climate change, sabotaging international efforts to curb greenhouse emissions and taking no real meaningful action to reverse the trajectory, torturing, intimidating and prosecuting whistleblowers while covering up and not prosecuting those responsible for the war crimes and crimes against humanity is just another day at the office.

       My premise was more about how powerful forces don't necessarily want to immediately remove all people from this world, in fact those that serve a purpose would be kept around.  I wasn't speaking specifically about military, nor am I very pro-enlistment, though offering premium healthcare to servicepeople could be a good example of what I was talking about.

       A good intro is to look a the World Trade Center building number 7 collapse. Start on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 World Trade collapsed on the afternoon of 9/11. The evidence that has been racked up points to controlled demolition. It is a good first wade into the truther movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, start with MKULTRA as it is quite good.

       being 'awake' doesnt really mean anything other than founding your views on facts. SO when the 'powers that be' tell you something that makes no sense, guess what, it's probably because it doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       being 'awake' is nothing more than critical thinking.

       Thank you. I was wondering. I hear the term "being awake" and I've always considered it to be the kind of wild BS that really boiled down to extreme cynicism rather than actual critical thinking.

       That's clarified a lot. I appreciate it.

       Question everything. Sit and think about the beliefs you have right now, and trying to question whether you should even be believing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question things that people always consider as true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people say you aren't allowed to do something, or tell you do something, try to ask yourself if that actually makes any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn the logical fallacies and make sure you are not guilty of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust no one, other than the ones that have time and time again proven to you that they are trustworthy, but nevertheless, still doubt their intentions and question them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to spend sometime time asking questions about what your beliefs are and how you came to those conclusions. Question the very things you are passionate about and find difficulty questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are doing this right, you will find yourself fighting against it because it will make you uncomfortable and uneasy.

       The hardest part is to remove yourself completely from what you understand as the core ideas of your beliefs. We are all born into a certain race, culture, societal pressures, influenced by parents/peers, education system, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you question them (and if you are doing it right, then you will have to change some), then you will be closer to understanding the truth. For me personally, I have a background in science, and so I am able to think deeply about human origins, formation of our core ideas, why we formed a society, and even go back further into question who we are, and if we even have a purpose. That I do believe really helped  me make sense of many things and to see outside of what people normally do these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't find answer for many things, but try not to pick a side if you don't have an answer. Although always make sure that you have some kind of (at least temporary) ground to stand on, or it can really throw you off balance not knowing what to hold on to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also read books. Try to learn psychology because it is about how human minds work, and that will help you understand a lot of hidden biases you might have, and other societal pressures that you might have noticed. It also helps you understand how other people work. I recently read a book called The Crowd by Gustave La Bon, and if you are living in this country, I recommend reading that book to understand how easily TPTB are able to control crowd mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will make you lose your faith in democracy perhaps, but still worth learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all I can share without sharing my own findings... which I think is better if left for you to explore on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I am being a little too rigorous here, because all this is not necessary to be awake, but still it really does help.

       Awake, sheeple, zombies, etc are just pejoratives. They are classifications people use to separate themselves from others, usually as a way to make one feel superior. It is just the same as someone saying "oh, you're just a conspiracy theorist...". There's nothing important about the terms except insofar as what the connotations of the words conjure up in your mind. A form of hypnosis or mind control, really, intentional or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, what do you need to know? Nothing. Everyone has an agenda (that's why they use those words) and one will say you are a fool for vaccinating your kid, another a fool for engaging in politics, another a fool for not listening to the pleaidians. All you need to know is what interests you. I could say you need to know logic and reason, but even these things are constructs - they have their place but also their limitations.

       Scroll through this subreddit. I still have a hard time questioning things, but I honestly believe that opening your mind to it is the first step.  Start with something you're interested in, or something you've questioned before, and go from there.

       there are a lot of real problems brought up in this sub... and there is also a lot of wacky shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a fundamental problem with pairing critical analysis with a "trust nothing" mentality.  analysis only works with good information.... with that first step, conclusions can be drawn.  If all "official" information is not trustworthy and the media (MSM) is untrustworthy, then how does one get this information?  where do we look?
      </p>
      <p>
       You find some people that get this information from internet sources... and for some entirely illogical reason choose to trust these sources as gospel.  That is no better than blindly trusting any other information source (in fact, its quite a bit worse depending on where the info originates). Of course, pointing out that obvious inconsistency is met with extreme defensiveness and hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can rule out bogus info by finding internal logical inconsistencies... not by citing some other info (that could be wrong).  even in so doing you can only ever rule things out, never confirm... unless you become an expert in a field and do your own research, or travel to relevant areas and interview your own witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       essentially those that say "trust nothing" are lying to you or themselves...  it is next to impossible to come to a conclusion about any major issue without trusting some source of information.

       I may be able to serve as a catalyst and help your ascension/waking up process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow me to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can speak personally, as I myself am awakened.
Usually when I think about the awakening process I think back to the great Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama.
While he was sitting under the Bodhi tree one of his disciples asked him if he was a God. 
He replied no.
"Are you a prophet," the disciple asks.
Buddha answers no.
Defeated, the disciple asks what are you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buddha answers, "I am awake".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Waking up" goes beyond conspiracy theories. Waking up simply means that you are snapped from illusion and thrust into reality.
It reminds me of smoking pot for the first time. That feeling. So pure, so unrefined. Limitless.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to wake up you need to discover who you are, why you are here, your purpose and how you fit into ALL of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirituality helps immensely with this immensely as it allows you to discover yourself, from the inside out, thus meaning you can discover reality itself from your outward mental projections.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you want to hear is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was in the process of waking up I was attending college in KY. Those days were tiresome. I wasn't sleeping well. I would walk around the campus and town early in the morning as if I was searching for something, or someone I used to know.
What helped me was terror.
I started by watching multi hour documentary videos on the NWO, the masons, the truth behind the economy, the petro dollar being the reason for Iraq and the middle east in general, the occult connection to the us government and governments worldwide. There is so much information on the internet that can be of assistance to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what helps most people can be traced to spiritual tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to wake up you have to do something that gets rid of your current ego. This is extremely difficult for people because they fear of letting go of who they are.
Fear helps. 
When I learned the truth about the government and how we were all born as slaves to this system matrix I was infuriated. I was appalled, confused and angry all at the same time and that information that caused it clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the "awake" consciousness you have to let go and embrace truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do this you will go through a "dark night of the soul". Don't worry, it will pass and you will become stronger than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Activate your chakra systems, after that it doesn't matter what goes on here, you will be home free.
