       For those that believe them, what makes you believe your sources over the hundreds to the contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 for example has a few claims that the buildings would not have fallen due to heat, controlled blasts etc but most engineers say that what happened could reasonably happen in a plane crash. What makes you doubt them so much?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess on a related note, just how many people do you feel actually control the world? Surely it can't be THAT closely controlled unless there's billions in on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this seems accusatory at all I just see so many stories on here that I believe but just can't accept entire governments actively hold back populations

       I think you need to look at the theories properly. Most engineers do NOT say that a 500,000 tonne steel/concrete structure like each of the twin towers could be destroyed by a hollow aluminium tube weighing 125 tonnes. It's like taking down a lamp-post with a .22 rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine it is 1945, and some conspiracist told you that 300,000 Americans have been constructing a weapon which uses atomic fission to destroy whole cities. You'd refuse to believe it, "because i'ts science-fiction, and/or somebody would have talked". History has proven time and again that people don't talk - the price is too high for them, and their families.

       The Manhattan project was vastly different in a large number of ways. Firstly, there are actually WERE leaks. Not least, the Russians had heavily infiltrated the project. There were also tens of thousands of gag orders issued against the media by the Office of Censorship, and it was largely only through patriotic compliance that the Project was not widely disseminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, how long was secrecy maintained after execution? The very next day after the bomb on Hiroshima,. there was a detailed report on the front of the NY Times. But here we are, 12 years after 9/11 and not one of the people supposedly involved has come forward to say a single thing. I'd say a better parallel is the Watergate break-in: a simple burglary which was bungled and fully exposed.

       Lots of gag orders regarding Sandy Hook:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Connecticut state legislators changed the law just before SH to allow the withholding of information regarding children's autopsies - how convenient was that!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Police reports of the event have been redacted to the extent that they are useless as records of what happened.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The names of the children have not been published anywhere in the official report by the Connecticut State Attorney.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Birth and death certificates of the child victims have been withheld from public scrutiny/verification.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Contractors who cleaned up Sandy Hook school had to sign lifelong gag orders.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demolition firm that pulled down Sandy Hook and destroyed all the unseen evidence that went with it had to sign the same punitive gag orders
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Online media shi/trolls have been vilifying anybody who dares to question the official story.

      <blockquote>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Others appear to be in line with common practice (redacting), or seem a legitimate attempt to avoid sensationalism (gag orders). The evidence
       <strong>
        for an actual conspiracy
       </strong>
       - and I don't mean gaps or inconsistencies in the official version, or things which rely heavily on a conspiratorial interpretation, like those above - seems extremely flimsy.

       In other words, I was spot on. You provide absolutely no evidence for your claim, appear to have made no attempt to prove your assertion, and cannot back up your "categorical" statement that the Post was lying. This kind of abysmal excuse for research is exactly why Sandy Hook conspiracists are a laughing stock and "vilified", and why very few people take this seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny conspiracies exist. But I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       reject the idea that Sandy Hook was one, and view its proponents in the same light as the shape-shifting reptilian crowd (but less entertaining). It's funny you demand "something of value" when you offer nothing except paranoid assumptions and unsubstantiated allegations.

       The death certificates are not in the public domain - FACT. You are asking me to prove a negative - how do you want me to do that? I have made the assertion for you disprove, and you can't. Now stop wittering and go and get them for me, will you? Otherwise, shut up.

       Submit an FOIA request, like the Post did, and you'll get them. If not, then you might have a leg to stand on. That's how you prove a negative. It's really quite simple.

       If you are successful I will make a post on this subreddit publicly admitting to being "ignorant". That must an incentive for someone like you, surely?

       The official narrative of Sandy Hook is the "extraordinary claim" - it is not evidence of anything apart from the fact people lie, and endlessly parroting those lies doesn't make it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can provide a copy of the official death certificate (from the State of Connecticut) of one of the Sandy Hook children (let us say, Caroline Previdi), I will happily  credit you for doing that in a post on this sub, and I would also acknowledge that my theory (that no death certificate exists) is thereby disproven. I would also promise not to repeat the claim that no death certificates exist using this or any other username.

       Aha! This is new. Generalize the whole sub as a bunch of 'sad people' who want nothing but to 'feel better' by 'deluding themselves'. The truth is, the truth is not easy to swallow. You take what is actually a genuine effort by many to dig a little deeper into the facts of the socio-economic-political motivations that drive the most powerful entities in this world and categorize it as an easy way out. It doesn't actually feel that good knowing that the mainstream of information and media is completely void of any real integrity and relevance. And here you are dropping shitty little comments about people you clearly think are of little intelligence, and you're calling the whole sub sad!? are you serious? What are you doing here? Grow up.

       Do some more in-depth research and judge for yourself. You are definitely right not to just accept these claims at face value. I have approached this topic as a skeptic as well, and after several years of careful study I am convinced that all of the conspiracy theories you listed are in fact true.

       This has a lot of good, verifiable information in it that helps give some perspective on how our country was founded and what special interested were involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also never forget the fact that one of the twin towers survived a more intense, hotter, and longer burning fire than happened on 9/11 with no structural damage whatsoever. It is almost impossible for a steel framed tower to fall from a fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, I urge you to remain skeptical but continue researching. You may be surprised at what you discover.

       Edit: I know this is long, but also has a lot of verifiable information. This movie was my major wake-up call, it turned me on to how the world really works and why things are the way they are today.

       I'm open minded about it all but just find some of it too far fetched. The illuminati especially. I just don't understand why they would put their symbols everywhere if they intended to remain secret?

      <p>
       Some of the theories seem like trying to prove 'I know more than you, the world is holding me down, my faults are caused by someone else'

       I know a lot of shit is real like the banking scandal, police brutality, police getting away with all kinds of abuse, judges kids for money scandals. I just can't believe that theres a group that rule the world.

       The illuminati is like the fan-fiction of conspiracies.  There is no valid reason to believe (or automatically discount) anything you hear about illuminati.  It's just a label people apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just because they don't call themselves illuminati and hide symbols in pop music doesn't mean power and control are not natural human desires.

       In the US. There might be a whole lot more in Israel, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere too. It'd be much easier to keep it secret when the people involved have no feeling of doing something wrong, and that's more likely when bad happens to people you could care less about.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand I think there must be a lot more people in the US, native citizens, that after 911 happened realized they had been used to lay down the foundation, to prepare things with some completely different reason than the real thing. Like the drill that was going at the same time, I don't think anyone that had part in it had any knowledge of 911 before.

       No offense but it's much easier to accept these theories because they fit in nicely with preconceived opinions, than to get into the thousands of details and nuances involved in gathering the truth about a certain subject.

       The 'it's a need for people to make sense of the world and know there is somebody in control and not just chaos argument' just doesn't cut it, sorry. This get's sported so much and yet it's such a massive generalization and insult to people's cognitive/psychological abilities, and yet it's so readily accepted as the cause of people's interest. At the end of the day, people tend to live scientifically to some extent. That is, trying to ascertain truth via the testing of hypothesis and relating data to outcomes etc. Ie, human's have a natural gravitation to want to understand the world. We see it everywhere in academia, science, everything. Assimilating yourself with your environment is just a natural habit of humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, when people point out the completely obvious and numerous holes with 'official doctrine', they are labelled as psychologically deficient or deluded somehow? This is simply investigation based on intuition that the 'mainstream' hypothesis is so far away from explaining what the hell is going on that people start digging a little deeper. let's not forget that the majority of people allow media sources and pre-established institutions to dictate truth and reality to them, hence they do not slip out of the net of being people that 'wish to make a sense of the world'. It seems that many actually allow others to be in control and make the big decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, whilst the universe is chaotic, the push for control and habituation in nature and society is an equally evident force in my opinion. the world isn't purely chaotic, we have institutions everywhere that are the very evidence of this. People do make decisions to go to war, people do conspire and fix Libor rates for profit. Politicians do lie. People do want more power. It seems to me that most people actually live on the easy side of life by ignoring the spectrum of evil that our kind of society can produce, and hence stay away from the confrontations of the darkest sides of life. The darkest is out there somewhere. Where would it be? probably within minds and motivations of the most powerful and power-hungry people in the world. Looking into this is not easy, and is actually quite challenging. Reading newspapers and watching TV and ignoring the imperialistic forces in our world is much easier.
      </p>

       Edit: 'psychological' rather than 'psychic'.

       For sure, but what is the truth? This is more of a scientific investigation than a faith based excursion anyway, there's so much evidence to show that 9/11 happened in a way which is completely in conflict with the official story. But, people have faith in their government or the forces behind the government not to lie to them and to protect them. Is this the truth or is this just faith? There's  a fine line between the state and the church. But this isn't the state or the church, this is just independent investigation. But the point you made seems to be a way of discounting whatever conclusions people come to because they're just looking for explanations to fit their world view or something, which is as if they're not capable of coming to valid conclusions.

       It adds nothing to your otherwise fine post and makes you sound like a nut job.  You should consider removing it if you actually want to be taken seriously.

       I see what you mean, but I won't change it. Iv'e been reading too much Carl Jung. I mean 'psychological'. Those things which concern the psyche. Check the definition, it doesn't necessarily mean clairvoyance and things like that. But I see what your saying. Anyway the message is clear, if people want to jump on the nut job train then so be it.

       That's fine if you want to completely ignore how people are going to interpret your post (ie: communicate appropriately).

       It's the same reason you should avoid calling a black person niggardly, you are more likely to be misinterpreted than not

       Right, I'll change it, no problem. I'll surrender the true significance of my choice of words for the sake of not alienating people. But just for the sake of argument, i'm not trying to support mystical phenomena. In using the word psyche, I am suggesting that the ability to deal with these issues effectively sometimes takes more than simply logical ability, in the sense that you need to be able to deal with the personal and emotional ramifications as well as pure reason. Even the most rational people have problems actually considering this stuff because of factors to do with their psyche, their whole being, their identity, etc etc, rather than reason alone, which I attribute to the mind. It's all a matter of semantics. But anyway, peace.

       I think this is always the best option when sharing your ideas is the goal.    I understand (only after explanation) that you meant differently, but I'm glad you agree the language hinders proper interpretation.

       a group could take over a country, then the world (see illegal finance - the one and only group that is above dictators.  They finance dictators.with interest on planes theyfsj never possibly pay back).  Read the Protocols.  Some claim it a hoax, however if it were a hoax, we wouldnt see the exaxt same steps covered and followed to a T.  If it were fake, their public actions would have soon diverged.  What would it take for them to do something it, and how would countries behave if they were owned entirely.

       Keep in mind that whenever you hear yourself saying "I simply can't believe in these conspiracy theories" or perhaps "I refuse to believe in this conspiracy theory"....what is operating here is not logic not critical thinking, it's 100% emotion.

       Take 5 minutes and try as hard ad you can to believe the 9/11 conspiracy. That it was a charade foisted on the American people to make it easier to increase military spending, invade Afghanistan and Iraq, and increase the surveillance state. And it wouldn't have worked if people didn't die (like Pearl Harbor).

       with compartmentalization, security clearances, secret societies and a pyramidal power structure where the bottom layer is us, the 7billion and the capstone is 1, 13 or 300 it would be very easy. the only question might be how many layers would it require? i think we see most of the layers in our society readily enough -- not that many.
