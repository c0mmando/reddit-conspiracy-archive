         The timing of troops pulling out of Afghanistan and Iraq seems to have coincided with this new war front in Easter Europe with Russia.

         The US economy with its hegemony on the petrodollar could be coming to an end if China and Russia become stronger and more independent.

       The U.S. is only a war machine at this point. By the time the citizens understand this and attempt to actually stop it, the whole thing will be privatized. That's when American citizens will start to see their military in action first hand.

       What people also fail to realize is that even if the one world government stops all war between countries, war will not go away.

      <p>
       The military industrial complex is too big and powerful to willingly dismantle itself once it is no longer needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the last "enemy" is destroyed, the elite and state will redirect the war machine internally to quell dissidents, which it will call "terrorists".

       Its interesting also that there is a data protection company named Iron Mountain.

       That was a little off topic though...Main Point: It's not over until the fat lady sings...the fact that we are sitting here talking about this at all should tell you that. Keep pushing..its not over..There is still a possibility to save this world.

       The word privatize assumes they would be unable to collect taxes and make arrests, and therefore, oppress the citizenry.

       AFRICOM is already in full gear, doing the exact same shit as they've done in Afghanistan. I just watched a documentary on it, lemme dig and figure that out. He was on the ground in Africa, and it was a few years old at least.

       The shared belief that the currency has value. I do some work, which my employer sees as valuable, and gives me its equivalent in money, which we both see as valuable. I take it to the store and exchange it for milk, which I see as valuable.

        The federal reserve creates 60-85 billion new dollars every month devaluing the dollars that you see having value.

      <p>
       Yeah, it's called inflation and it's happening at
       <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=us+inflation+rate">
        about 1.5% per year
       </a>
       . That's not actually that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say $60-85 billion like it's a lot, and to a normal person it is, but not compared to the total amount of money there is. Currently the
       <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/current/default.htm">
        M2 money supply of the US (cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.) is about $10 trillion
       </a>
       , and there's still a lot of stuff that that doesn't measure. So per year, that's only a
       <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=85+billion+*+12+%2F+2+trillion">
        0.5%
       </a>
       increase in the total money supply.

        How can you accurately determine how much value they actually have?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can't do it with 100% accuracy. You can't really do that with anything. That's fine though. The US dollar is quite stable, so it's pretty easy to get an accurate estimate.

      <p>
       What do you mean "when they stop"? When you can't exchange dollars for goods and services? What makes you think that will happen (anytime soon)? What makes you think it will go quickly?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I agree we can look around and see all sorts of similar monetary systems that are doing fine
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not just "fine", but fine
       <em>
        without wars
       </em>
       . Your whole argument was that the entire economy is based around war. Clearly, and you seem to agree, there are other economies very similar to ours that are fine,
       <em>
        and they're not at war
       </em>
       .

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but can you show me an old one?

      <p>
       Again, not totally sure what you mean? An old money system? Like bartering, which would be completely impractical in our economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also curious what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , personally, think would be a better alternative to what we have now.

       The entire Iraq/Aghanistan war has only ever been for the US to control oil (and thus control China's economy) and control the Soviet Union's former territories to ensure Russia remains in a weakened state. But now China is building thorium power plants and Russia is starting to absorb Crimea and Ukraine the US needs to change tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "new" upcoming war is just a continuation of the only war the US has ever been in. It needs to ensure it stays the world's only true superpower whatever the cost.

       From what I have read in the past and what is happening now, I think we are seeing the squaring off and separation of BRICS powers from OPEC countries and the EU banking bloc. Call me crazy, but it kinda seems like everyone is trying to see who's got who's back just before the financial collapse of the dollar and a resulting worldwide resource war.
