    <div class="md"><p>The lable &quot;terrorist&quot; is somewhat subjective. Depending on which side you are on. However, the definition is someone whom uses violence or threat of violence to achieve some political or idealogical goals. The definition can, therefore, be applied to many people or groups. Concerning the media&#39;s portrail, there are definately some that just want to kill or to gain/remove power, but some are fighting for what they actually beleive is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically terrorist groups are depicted as militant guerrillas whom are anti-government, ideological, often religious, and independent. That&#39;s what I would call a traditional sense. These groups do exist and have been involved in violence targeted against innocents or military targets, this much is true.</p>

<p>I believe that in many cases what is attributed to &quot;terrorists&quot; is in fact the work of: (fill in the blank with your choice) the US military / NATO, private military contractors, various intelligence organizations, etc. There are probably also other instances where traditional terrorist groups may be funded and/or directed by any of the aforementioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A terrorist doesn&#39;t have to be a militant group. I would say it is in it&#39;s most basic form, a man (or woman) with an ideology that he will try and enforce on others through terror and violence. Take Timothy McVeigh he wasn&#39;t part of a group or religious. </p>

<p>As for more government involvements? I don&#39;t think they happen very often and only happen against enemies of the government. I honestly can&#39;t believe that they would be used against their own people but maybe that&#39;s the point. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The disgruntled individuals who take action on their own, or in small groups, because they hate the existing power structure and want to replace it with another tyrannical power structure of their own choosing.

<li><p>The government sponsored, government financed terrorists who have the training of the military and as much weapons and explosives as they could ever need, as well as key enablers in the police, bureaucracy and government. This type is more dangerous because they are used to destabilize societies and overthrow regimes.</p></li>

<p>People do things....sometimes they are sponsored, sometimes it&#39;s by their own choice. They may or may not kill people, just scare them. But these people are terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember terrorists were originally defined as state employees.  Later, they changed
the perception of the meaning of the word yet these so called terrorists are still
agents of the state.  So in this sense these terrorists are real but they aren&#39;t 
who we think they are.  I&#39;m thinking of fbi agents or cia agents and of course many
contract workers in the employ of the state.</p>

<p>A quick Google search tells me that the word was originally used in the French Revolution to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin">Jacobins</a>, the radical government <em>rebels</em> famous for the Reign of Terror.</p>
