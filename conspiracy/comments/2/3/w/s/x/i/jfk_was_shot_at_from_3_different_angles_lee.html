<p>the way JFK&#39;s head jolted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think being shot in the head causes the head to violently jolt from the force of the impact, you watch too many movies. </p>

<p>Here are 5 links to what being shot in the head looks like in the real world: </p>

<p>JFK&#39;s jolt is similar to the 2nd video. Note the arms moving briefly, <a href="http://prof77.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/jfk_headshot.gif">just like JFK&#39;s do</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am unimpressed with the videos. They do nothing to discredit the obvious act of physics that propel JFK&#39;S head backwards as he is shot from the front. #1 man&#39;s knees buckle and he falls in the direction away from the shot, #2: man falls away from the shot fired and then is shot while laying on the floor, #3 man leaning body weight into the shot slouches in chair, #4 man leaning body weight into the shot&#39;s head moves backward and he crumples to the ground. I didn&#39;t watch #5 because I didn&#39;t want to log in. In the case of JFK he was shot from the front with a frangible bullet sending his head violently backward. Just as one would expect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His head actually snapped forward on impact. It&#39;s tough to see in full speed, but you can&#39;t miss it frame by frame. </p>

<p>The rearward motion didn&#39;t start until 2 frames after the initial impact. </p>

<p>Also, the direction of spray from the shot is entirely in front of the head, with no debris at all visible behind. The 3 amateur films of the headshot all show the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frames 312 to 313 seem to show some forward motion, but their is distortion and motion blur. In the analysis I looked at their were lines designating landmarks within each frame, however it ignored other landmarks that did not align. The standard explanation is that there were two shot (one from behind and one from the front) that hit almost at the same time (several witnesses reported two shot sounding very close together). Another explanation that I see in viewing the two frames is that JFK&#39;s head leaning forward and turned slightly left was swiveled by the front shot, which turned it causing foreshortening in the view and pulling it slightly forward as the neck stiffened (you can do it yourself; turn your head slightly left, chin down and pretend you are shot through the right temple. Your head turns slightly pulling it forward before being blasted backward).</p>

<p>As far as the brain matter, the motorcycle cop behind and to the left reported being sprayed by blood and brain matter, so I would suggest the video did not capture all the spray, only that reflected due to the lighting. Though I agree with you that the spray is generally problematic.</p>

<p>One question, what three films?   </p>

<p>Bobby Hargis was the motorcycle cop, and yes, he did say he was hit with spray, but consider the elements. The motorcade was moving forward at 10mph into a 20mph headwind. Anything lightweight (like blood droplets or tiny fragments of brain) would be blown backwards and Hargis would end up riding right through them. In most interviews I&#39;ve seen he says just that, &quot;I rode right through it&quot;. </p>

<p>The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films. The 2 less famous ones were from the opposite side and further away but both show the forward head snap and the cloud of debris blown exclusively forward. Also, all 3 films and the Moorman Polaroid show the rear of the head stayed completely intact. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try only responding in 1 thread from now on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your responses, though both sides of the debate tend to twist the &quot;facts&quot; to their view. Ultimately people see different aspects of the film and assign meaning to those parts (head moving forward, head moving back, Connally&#39;s hat, positions in the car, etc.). I can&#39;t see anything in the Nix film (except JFK&#39;s head going backward). The Muchmore (I had not seen other than the still) film shows a more hazy blood halo than Zapruder. I&#39;m not sure the back of the head being intact at that point is relevant (from the view point of a frontal shot). With regard to the head shot blood the argument would be that the blood halo was due to the initial impact not the exit. </p>

<p>Here is the snap forward and spray from Zapruder.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/qkvOlQn">http://imgur.com/qkvOlQn</a></p>

<p>To me, the fact that the snap forward is definitely there, combined with the blood spray in front of the head in all 3 films, combined with the rear of the head staying completely intact cinches that the shot came from behind.</p>

<p>Edit: And thanks for being respectful.  I&#39;ve gotten into these conversations way too many times, and they always end up devolving into a shit flinging contest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Parkland bullet is the one thing that seems to garner the most attention aside from the head snap.  Here, I&#39;ll do my best point by point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bullet found at Parkland was nearly pristine, just slightly flattened with minimal loss of volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say it was <a href="http://imgur.com/IRwmUYp">more than slightly flattened</a>.  You&#39;d have trouble doing that much damage with a hammer.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t severely deformed though, agreed.</p>

<p>The thing is, it was a full metal jacketed round, designed for maximum penetration.  In one of the documentaries that came out for the 50th, a bullet from the same lot was fired nose first through 36 inches of pine board and came out looking brand new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI could not duplicate this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBIs test sucked.  They fired a bullet at a goat carcass at maximum velocity.  The bullet that hit Connally&#39;s wrist wouldn&#39;t have been going nearly as fast.</p>

<p>Here are the numbers.  The Carcano round would have left the rifle at ~2200fps.  It would have lost some velocity before hitting JFK, then passed through his body completely without ever striking any bone, then started to tumble before passing part way through Connally before hitting anything solid.  The first hard thing it came in contact with was his rib, which it likely struck sideways causing the flattening out you see in the image.  By the time it hit his dense wrist bone, it would have been slowed down to ~900fps (based on estimates from John Lattimer and Martin Fackler, 2 ballistics experts).</p>

<p>They fired a reduced velocity Carcano round through the wrist of a cadaver at ~1100fps as a test.  Their bullet did <em>more</em> damage to the cadaver&#39;s wrist and came out looking <a href="http://imgur.com/f2sHC2v"><em>less</em> deformed</a> than CE399.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Connally&#39;s personal doctor said that the magic bullet could not be the bullet that shattered all the bones that the magic bullet had to have shattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Connally&#39;s doctor was not a ballistics expert.</p>

<p>The Discovery Channel did a test using ballistics gel dummies and bones to simulate the damage to CE399.  Their test bullet came out looking very close to what CE399 did after shattering 2 ribs instead of one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, it was a full metal jacketed round, designed for maximum penetration. In one of the documentaries that came out for the 50th, a bullet from the same lot was fired nose first through 36 inches of pine board and came out looking brand new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pine board is not bone. As it goes through pine, it slows slowly and uniformly, not the sudden deceleration of striking a bone; this keeps a staight trajectory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They fired a reduced velocity Carcano round through the wrist of a cadaver at ~1100fps as a test. Their bullet did more damage to the cadaver&#39;s wrist and came out looking less deformed[2]   than CE399.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, because it was fired at a reduced velocity. A bullet with velocity enough to shatter three bones has the velocity to become massively deformed, as all the tests show. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Connally&#39;s doctor was not a ballistics expert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you a ballistics expert? If not I will take the word of the actual doctor who examined Connally over you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Discovery Channel did a test using ballistics gel dummies and bones to simulate the damage to CE399. Their test bullet came out looking very close to what CE399 did after shattering 2 ribs instead of one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad you brought up that Discovery channel rubbish. It&#39;s obvious that you think it recreated the magic bullet shot. The reality is that it proves that the magic bullet is impossible.</p>

<p>Please look at this still frame from that show:</p>

<p>Notice that the bullet hits Kennedy in the back where it should, and it hits Connelly where it should. Then look at where the bullet exits Kennedy&#39;s body. The official theory said it exited Kennedy&#39;s neck as all the photos show. In the recreation their bullet exits Kennedy at the sternum. This is where the bullet would exit Kennedy from a shot from the book depository. Their recreation inadvertently proves that the official theory is impossible. And of course they declined to comment on this proof.</p>

<p>Any chance you will comment on this proof?</p>

<p>And it was deformed almost exactly like the rounds fired into cotton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, this argument never made much sense to me.</p>

<p>If you are a conspirator, and you&#39;re planting a bullet that supposedly went through at least one man, would you just fire it into cotton?  Why not shoot a round into a dog or a cadaver to get an appropriate level of deformity?</p>

<p>The whole &quot;planted bullet&quot; argument seems silly beyond belief.  The bullet was found while Kennedy and Connally were still in the trauma rooms at Parkland being worked on.  What if you just planted proof of a 4th shot?  What if the bullet gets lost?</p>

<p>Either way, the condition of CE399 has been proven as more than plausible given the path it took and the speed it would have been going when it hit Connally&#39;s wrist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it goes through pine, it slows slowly and uniformly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of like passing all the way through one man and partway through another while going end-over-end.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You must have missed the image I posted of the Fackler bullet.  Here, I&#39;ll post it again:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/f2sHC2v.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/f2sHC2v.jpg</a></p>

<p>That bullet shattered 2 wrist bones in a cadaver and looks as though it&#39;s never been fired.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not some unqualified yahoo that came up with this test either.  Fackler was the head of the International Wound Ballistics Association.  By the time CE399 struck Connally&#39;s rib it would have been slowed significantly.  It still had enough momentum to break bones, but not enough to deform itself, just like their test bullet shows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, but Larry Sturdivan and Martin Fackler are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cyril Wecht is a ballistics expert?  Hmmmm....I thought he was a pathologist.  Not even close to the same thing.</p>

<p>The Discovery Channel has their Kennedy dummy sitting too upright.  He was leaning forward far more than their recreation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number of bullets found is irrelevant being that the neck would was described by doctors as a would of entrance, the doctors also describe the wound in JFK&#39;s back as a shallow wound that they could probe with their finger, bullet fragments were found in Connally&#39;s chest and wrist making it unlikely that the &quot;pristine&quot; bullet caused the wounds, bullet fragments were not recovered from JFK&#39;s head or a intact bullet found anywhere else...unfortunately JFK&#39;s brain was lost and the path of the bullet not traced. </p>

<p>No one knows the proper position of the occupants of the limo (the FBI came up with two different conflicting versions), only an approximation that fans out to a large cone which would include the Dal-Tex building for the origin of the shots (if one was even going to entertain the absurd single bullet excuse).

</blockquote>

<p>JFKs arm was perched on the side of the car when he was hit in the back. When his body was returned to a normal position, the muscles of his back closed over the wound. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not my opinion, that&#39;s the opinion of every forensic pathologist that&#39;s studied the case. </p>

<p>If both the back wound and neck wound were entry wounds, where are the corresponding exit wounds? If the bullets didn&#39;t exit, where were they? What kind of ammunition were they shooting the president with that couldn&#39;t penetrate the soft tissue of a neck, or penetrate a back more than a couple inches without ever hitting bone? </p>

<p>Sit Kennedy in the limo properly, and the line from his neck wound through his back wound is a dead straight line back to the 6th floor window of the depository. Laser recreations in Dealey Plaza confirmed it. I can find the recreation if you&#39;re actually interested in seeing it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>bullet fragments were found in Connally&#39;s chest and wrist making it unlikely that the &quot;pristine&quot; bullet caused the wounds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it unlikely? The bullet lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 grains of weight, and the material in Connally was estimated to weigh no more than a postage stamp, just a few very tiny flakes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>unfortunately JFK&#39;s brain was lost and the path of the bullet not traced. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Kennedy family didn&#39;t return the brain to the Archives in 1966. It wasn&#39;t lost. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one knows the proper position of the occupants of the limo (the FBI came up with two different conflicting versions)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern technology has done far better and more accurate work than the fbi ever did. Dale Myers animation is a great place to start. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(if one was even going to entertain the absurd single bullet excuse)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kennedy and Connally react simultaneously in the Zapruder film. It&#39;s not a stretch at all. The same laser recreation in Dealey Plaza confirmed that the bullet exiting JFKs neck would have hut Connally exactly where his entry wound was. </p>

<p>Here is a simple logic exercise. The entry wound in Connallys back was elliptical, meaning it hit something before it hit him and had begun to tumble. What could it possibly have hit if not Kennedy? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A &quot;neuro-muscular reaction&quot; is a grasping at straws explanation to a head blown back and to the left by a gun shot from the front.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about the snap forward on initial impact? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not particularly interested in after the fact forensic pathologists. I think the doctors initial response is important. I am not a forensic pathologist, but I would assume the back bullet stayed in his back and the throat wound somewhere in the throat or back. According to the doctors the autopsy was rushed and no very complete.</p>

<p>Though I don&#39;t acknowledge that the &quot;proper position&quot; can be known from the given information, the only thing that a laser pointer will tell you is that given the &quot;proper position&quot; the Depository shot is possible. However other shots are possible the exact positions of the wounds are not known and add to the problem with positioning the bodies. If the bodies are moved slightly one direction or the other it changes the cone of possible origins.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I find the estimates of the residue in Connally unconvincing. I call it unlikely due to the extent of the damage. </p>

<p>Sorry for the poor wording; the brain is reported to be kept/lost by the Kennedy family. However, the wound was not traced...which again, is unfortunate. </p>

<p>The Dale Myers animation, at the end of the day, is based on assumptions.  Again the positions of the woulds and the positions of the bodies are conjecture. I have not seen photos of Connally&#39;s back wound.</p>

<p>The movement can be caused by braking or head turn as the bullet hits the right temple. </p>
