Thus its going to take the United States Citizens realization that the Government is bought and payed for by corporate fat-cats who control it at will to further financial institutions and their own greedy pocketbooks to overcome any perceived notion of change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand what you are even saying, but I&#39;m surprised by your unwarranted hostility.  I&#39;m just pointing out the simple truth, that democracy is a facade.  That is to say, that the voter does not have actual say in implementation.  And obviously there are numerous elements in which this is true, so I will only start listing them if you ask.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You are not included,&quot; That pretty much sums your life.</p>

<p>If you phrased that, &quot;You do not wish to be included,&quot; then that would be correct.  But I am forced into the laws of this society not by my own free will.  If the government offered nothing to me and I could keep the extra 20% of my paycheck each month, that would be blissful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically ironically, the government of every country with a sizable army justifies having that army in place by saying, &quot;If we don&#39;t have an army, someone will invade us.&quot;</p>

<p>I suppose you could have meant that the US military industrial complex prevents smaller countries from going to war with each other because they&#39;re afraid the US will come down on them like a ton of bricks. If that is the case, I think you should realise that the US would never get involved in a war they have no incentive to be involved in. Simply being a formidable figure on the horizon would not prevent either Russia or China from going to war with whomever they choose, especially considering that both Russia and China have a stronger military force than the United States, in terms of sheer numbers.</p>

<p>Well if history has taught us anything it&#39;s that the army with the most numbers always win</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the US has over twice the population of Russia.</p>

<p>Secondly, I don&#39;t care how many people a nation can recruit against us. Take a billion Chinese people and give them all AK-74s and they will still lose to one B-52.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t WW1 where two side line up and bum-rush each other.</p>

<p>China has no real navy to speak of, their air force is second rate at best and their ground forces are ill-equipped. China is not a country that has the experience in warfare that the US has nor do they have the kind of technology and force projection we have.</p>

<p>NOW if you&#39;re talking about a Vietnam situation where the US wins every single battle and US troops have a kill ratio of 20 to 1 but still get kicked out then we might have a conversation.</p>

<p>But either way a war with the US would absolutely leave China devastated. They would lose their biggest customer and be forced to conscript and pour hundreds of billions into their military. If you deny that you&#39;re just delusional.</p>

<p>However. I feel like this conversation is turning into you defending the US Army&#39;s ability to wage war. Using terms like &quot;we&quot; when speaking about the US Army, you&#39;re obviously not on the same page as me when it comes to where this discussion is going.</p>

<p>Taking pride in your country&#39;s army&#39;s ability to decimate human life is not something I&#39;m prepared to put up with for this discussion to continue. Therefore, I shall now cease to participate. Have a good day further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, we have foreign policy errors, but compared to us what Russia did in Chechnya and Georgia... Moreover,&#39;you say corrupt, and America is not all that corrupt. Jingoistic? Maybe at times. Corrupt? You use that word but not sure you understand what it means. Russia is literally an oligarchy and Petro state. In china families associated with the ruling class steal billions. India half the civil service is corrupt... Even Southern European counties are more corrupt than the US like Greece were no one paid taxes...</p>

<p>Also if you look in the US, compared to much of the world we have a lot of agency, freedom of speech, rule of law, etc... We are not the best, Northern European countries definately are better in that regard,
But we are far from the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Keep in mind that when smaller nations have terribly corrupt governments, those governments take money from the USA to screw their own people.</p>

<p>Much of the USA&#39;s government AND CORPORATE corruption is attacking people in other nations around the world.  Or protecting US corporations / banksters from terrible crimes against humanity (Jeff Immelt and Fukushima, for example).</p>

<p>Americans are largely unaware of the terrible effect our government has on the world, so we see it more favorably.</p>

<p>The elites of the world are the computer operator. They are the corrupt.</p>
