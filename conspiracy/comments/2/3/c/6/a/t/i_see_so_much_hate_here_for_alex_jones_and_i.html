        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How many of you here would not be here if it weren&#39;t for him? I know I wouldn&#39;t, he was absolutely instrumental in waking me up to this whole &quot;other-world&quot; where everything seems to be flipped on its axis. I get the desire to distance the &quot;truth movement&quot; from him, he is an emotionally explosive person who is often wrong about things, and seems to have a really tough time admitting he does not know all the facts or that he was wrong about something. He is very angry, but if you lived and breathed this stuff every day, would you not be angry as well? I mean, you probably do, are you NOT angry?</p>

<p>We all know that a great deal of what he talks about is true. The idea that he is an &quot;agent&quot; or something might make you feel as if you are more in the know, or have moved up a level in your knowledge or something and now know more than him, but even if he <em>is</em> which I sincerely doubt, I&#39;m not sure as to who he would be an agent FOR. Israel? The lizard people? I get it, you wish there was a better spokesperson, some perfect leader to go up against this incredible tide of terribleness coming at us, to &quot;wake up&quot; the people who refuse to see, or the people who might be turned off by the tone of his rhetoric. I listen to his podcast, and I agree with himabout 50% of the time. </p>

<p>I believe he is at core a good man, trying his best and is very very frustrated with world events. He fearmongers yes (fearmongering sells, that&#39;s why the state does it 24/7, and it gets people to pay attention). Look at the Info Wars coverage of the BLM event, it was excellent and they did it better than anyone. To throw the whole Info Wars gang under the bus and say &quot;fuck Alex Jones&quot; seems to be trendy but I for one think it&#39;s misguided. I think many new spokespeople and leaders will emerge, but I don&#39;t get why so many on here are so, so angry with him. </p>

<p>What, you&#39;re mad because he sells stuff? He clearly funnels the cash back into his operation, trying to make it look more legitimate and &quot;CNNish&quot; and hire on more reporters. He&#39;s not just in it for the money. Hell, I doubt this man has any time to even spend any of the money he makes, he has a morning AND night show every day of the week, except for saturday and then only morning on sunday. </p>

<p>Who is Ron Paul? Oh right...a crazy old lunatic that nobody voted for because&quot; he will never win.&quot; Americans KNOW the truth. They&#39;re just too apathetic and lazy to stand up to the machine that keeps them fat, dumb, and &#39;happy&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be wrong but Alex Jones has been on my radar well before Ron Paul. I know Ron Paul was certainly active before I was even born, I just mean Jones was popular first, but maybe that&#39;s just my perception of it. But your right, absolutely Ron Paul is a better spokesperson. My only gripe with Ron Paul, is that as a leader, rather THE leader, he just seems weak. He seems like...  someone who has been fighting a losing battle, his whole life, which he has.  We need someone who exudes strength and vitality, someone with the appeal of say, Adam Kokesh immediately comes to mind. I personally think his personality appeal is even greater than Rand Paul, although overall I like Rand more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only recently stumbled on Alex Jones and InfoWars. Ive been a CoastToCoast insider for quite some time now though.</p>

<p>I did not need Alex Jones to prove to me that we are all fucked. If you have the gift of owning your own mind and thoughts and have not been brainwashed by liberal college professors and distorted political schools of thought its obvious that even since before 9/11 our constitutional rights have been being modified to the point of being taken away. </p>

<p>Alex Jones just has the resources and the voice to broadcast what so many of us already see and know. I dont agree with EVERYTHING the guy says, but who on this earth is right all the time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For myself, I cannot remember what program/station I first heard him on. He was in their face and rabid! It had to have been after Waco and Oklahoma and prior to 9/11. </p>

<p>I was an MSM/a.m radio news Junkie when Ruby Ridge and Waco hit. It was all we had. When Oklahoma happened I walked away. </p>

<p>9/11 meant I missed my mothers funeral. I witnessed my father fighting these asshats to his grave.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not wise to ignore a siren call. At times you&#39;re best served to run another direction than the crowd.</p>

<p>Michael Ruppert must have become bone weary. Like myself. He cautioned or pleads for the children, as do I, in his suicide note. My 9 grandsons will never know the simplest freedoms!</p>

<p>(At seven years of age I faced a returning Vietnam vet, with my sisters bloody face, into my shoulder, asking for help and he spoke chilling words: You&#39;re on your own kid!)</p>

<p>I lost that baby sister and my two nieces to the sex ring in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Such is the battle. </p>

<p>Alex, Kokesh, Ruppert, Bill Cooper, Ron Paul...</p>

<p>No man will carry or guide my tribe but each one of them spoke truth to power, that still impacts the lives of those around me.</p>

<p>In your youth your voice is the same as your elders that you despise now, but will become!</p>

<p>Look to yourself first and be that one person, every damned day that you breathe, to speak up, to take charge.</p>

<p>This one person is you and you need not ask my permission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. I honor your life. The earth is a sacred temple, at the core of it we all realize this. It&#39;s our job to prevent the utter desecration and shaming of life. I hope to effect some manner of change in my life. One important part of this is to always speak my mind, whether it be against the current of mainstream, or alternative sources. Any man who speaks truth to power for the simple reason that the power structure is corrupt, illegitimate, I admire. I don&#39;t seek to follow any man, but I admire each in their own path and struggle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the bashers don&#39;t really know a thing about him. They just parrot what they&#39;ve been told by others that don&#39;t know anything either-but have an agenda to keep the status quo. He&#39;s right about more things than any other mainstream media in the entire nation. For years these dirtbags have just recited press releases anyway.  </p>

<p>Alex Jones scares lots of people because they aren&#39;t used to hearing truth and passion. Plus he&#39;s more liberal than Obama liberals and they hate being reminded that they stand for absolutely nothing and will sell out for anyone- even a grinning jug eared nobody who talks a good game but totally fails to walk it. Here&#39;s a great Esquire piece by a well known reporter who is fairly well respected.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the MSM tries to make everything &quot;nice&quot; and have &quot;reasonable debate&quot; about things like the disarmament of the American citizenry. The bundy ranch situation proved that when it comes down to it, there is no civil debate, there is the feds with assault rifles in your damn face. Alex realizes this, and he doesn&#39;t play their &quot;nice talk&quot; game, he realizes the gun grabbing, frontal assault nature of it. He only looks crazy because they have the power, and the platform he is on has been tailored to be that way but he refuses to play their game.</p>

<p>Edit - he also looks crazy cause he is kind of crazy. But I like that in him. He needs to be, to do what he does. And the world we live in, beneath the facade, is completely crazy. He realizes this.</p>

<p>I cannot really criticize anything Jones said on CNN because it&#39;s nothing more or less than I&#39;ve screamed at my TV at home watching their daily idiocy. It was quite refreshing to see other people care enough about the BS they shovel to also get upset. </p>

<p>This is why those not upset by the MSMs insanity frighten me...because if you&#39;re not pissed off by how hard they&#39;re manipulating you and those around you, we&#39;re done for. Their mission is complete, the hypnosis secure. </p>

Most of the stuff &amp; &#39;predictions&#39; he has are only about 5% accurate at best, and he never stops crowing about when he is right that 5% of the time. He also has promoted some dodgy investment &quot;guru&#39;s&quot;. He is also anti abortion, anti gay etc. </p>

<p>He just seems to do more harm than good when it comes to legitimate, un-sensationalised conspiracy research. </p>

<p>Things he is good at: </p>

<p>Promoting American businesses
Attracting loudmouth loonies
Giving people anxiety
Giving himself a sore throat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, if you&#39;re looking for a perfect leader, good luck bud. He&#39;s a man who has done more for the cause than you or I could even hope too. I agree with your criticisms, up to a point. I don&#39;t feel as though he is anti-gay, he&#39;s just more of a traditionalist who has no problem with gay people but balks at gay pride parades where penises are literally helicoptering in his face. That&#39;s his opinion, I respect it. He doesn&#39;t agree with abortion as he believes it&#39;s part of a depopulation agenda, and nothing to do with a womans choice. That&#39;s his opinion, it&#39;s not mine but I respect it. </p>

<p>No, not all of his predictions come true, and a lot of it is overblown or sensationalized but in all truth the, the reality of our world and the situation we find ourselves is incredibly, incredibly sensational. I mean,   you might say &quot;oh my god he&#39;s so crazy yelling FEMA camps&quot; but we can all see this IS THE TREND we are going. If fear mongering is what i takes to get people to OPEN THEIR MOTHER LOVING EYES and see the beast in front of them, then fear mongering it is. Crazy times call for crazy measures, and at least he is doing something, whereas the armchair elites here at r/conspiracy can only sit and badmouth him because Alex Jones is &quot;so mainstream man&quot;. </p>

<p>You want a better leader? Do you know how discouraging it is to people who want to step up and be that leader, to look at how much disrespect Alex Jones gets, someone who has dedicated his entire life to uncovering this agenda? You can say he is only 5% accurate at best about what he&#39;s saying but you know that&#39;s not true. The sheer amount of things that he has been talking about, like Echelon, false flags, hell the man predicted 911. But beyond that he is one of the ONLY people in the world with an audience his size talking about the TRULY important hard core politcal realities. He&#39;s literally building a news empire, and he&#39;s hiring on legit people. Have you listened to David Knight? It almost seems like David Knight was hired on specifically because Alex realizes his personality is crazy, and Knight is there to balance him out.</p>

<p>Hell, even Alex regularly admits he cant even listen to himself talk half the time. He knows who he is. I&#39;ve listened to the infowars podcast for years now, and I feel as though I&#39;ve gotten to know him and appreciate him quite a bit. I take big breaks from it where it&#39;s like, I can&#39;t live in the shadow world right now and take all this in. But then I go back because this is the important stuff, and at least he talks about stuff with passion. We should be passionate about eugenics, about false flags, about having this social engineering WAR conducted against us. We shouldn&#39;t let division tactics split us off. If you dont want Alex Jones to be the face of &quot;truth&quot; I understand that I respect it and I even agree with it. But dont attack the man, respect what he has done, because it&#39;s a fucking lot, like him or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has done a lot, but he&#39;s fucked up a lot too. Take the piers Morgan interview for example. When he ran out of steam he just ranted on and looked like a fuckin idiot. </p>

<p>As for our &quot;leader&quot;, if i had to choose one, it wouldn&#39;t be AJ, personally I&#39;d choose Jesse Ventura. At least he can debate properly, has Government experience &amp; and has views which are pretty fair (he&#39;s pro gun, socially liberal etc) </p>

<p>And as an Australian, I find it fucking retarded how Americans relate socialism to communism. We&#39;ve had socialism here for a good 70+ years and we have great hospitals, social welfare programs, good economy etc. the politicians and warmongers have brainwashed the shit out of you people. We clearly are NOT communist. </p>

<p>dont be a fuckhead. i dont pretend to be perfect, so dont try and use that as an argument. you know what? AJ is no fucking better than the MSM. he uses the same bullshit fear tactics because you and the lowest common denominator lap up all his bullshit that he spews out. fuck him, he did better work in his old days and on the JFK 50th special (yes i do still occasionally listen to him, you can sometimes find a small piece of gold in the outhouse toilet hole)
i was trying to be nice about it, but fuck it, i cant do it. he&#39;s too much of an embarrassment to me, and anyone with half a brain thinks the same. 
i hope you keep listening to his inane shit-talk, because you obviously dont like doing your own homework and like to be told what to think, instead of using your own critical thinking. </p>

<p>yep, good one. creating anxiety &amp; fear only has a place to get people to not really listen/learn anything other than what he wants them to learn. it makes you complacent and unwilling to research more, because youve had a gutfull of fear. that tactic is only used by the lowest of the low. i will give him this: he has brought attention to the cause, but only to look like a bumbling loudmouth loonie and paint us like that too.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to insult you by implying that you are not perfect. No one is. It was a rhetorical statement. </p>

<p>To be clear, the anxiety and fear is not generated by Alex. He is not the one doing false flags, putting poison in the water, setting up prison camps, ETC ETC ETC. He&#39;s just the one exposing it. And if you can figure out a way to expose that without generating fear, it&#39;s a free country and you can do it in your own way and see if you generate a following. Most people are sheep, and need to be screamed at at this point, they are so domesticated they have lost even their survival instinct. Overweight, domesticated man children.</p>
