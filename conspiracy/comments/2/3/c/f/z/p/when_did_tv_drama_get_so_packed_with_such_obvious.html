       It's insane, but this mentality still persists in people, that they aren't being socially conditioned and programmed while watching television PROGRAMMING.

       Very interesting. I think maybe people have just heard that term so much they forget what it means. Sure the term doesn't necessarily mean programming people, but it certainly appears that this is what is happening.

       Programming just means determining which TV shows (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program">
        television programs
       </a>
       ) your station will play and their schedule. This usage is actually the original meaning of the word 'programming' and the notions of computer programming and psychological programming are based on it. For example, computer programming determines the sequence of actions a computer takes in much the same way television programming determines the sequence of shows that are broadcast. Psychological programming similarly influences or determines the sequence of actions a person takes in their life (they 'get with the program' - does society have positive or negative connotations of this phrase?).
      </p>
      <p>
       The double-meaning is deliciously ironic, of course, and the propaganda has gotten more blatant in recent years making it all the more poignant.

       It does mean programming people, programming their hearts and minds.

      <p>
       Conditioning them to behave in certain ways.

       Television is designed to make money.  There is plenty of evidence for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you have actual evidence there is a conspiracy to program peoples' behaviour you shouldn't make the claim.  It could be argued that the kind of programming you describe could be an emergent property of the modern television industry but haven't made that argument and I'm not going to do it for you.

       No shit.  What I'm saying is that you can't just make the claim without supporting evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that we're all being programmed is a completely anodyne statement - we're programmed by the color of the rooms we're in when we make decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be interesting would be either of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a cabal of old Jewish men who secretly control our behavior through mind-ops inserted into broadcast tv, aided by the masons, the illuminati, and the Koch brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       Based entirely on free market principles broadcast television has developed an emergent property whereby certain values are reinforced while others discouraged.  These values tend to support or maintain the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a good case could be made for the latter.  The former is laughable.

       And just who do you think owns those companies?
But seriously, as someone who hasn't owned a TV in around 8 years,
It's obvious, in your face propaganda. All the NCIS, Homeland, newsroom,
all of it. Anyone who doesn't see it needs to unplug (their head from their asses) for a while.

       In all seriousness, one reason this happens is that there becomes a sort of quid pro quo between the Hollywood people and the government people.  For example, "If you want to use the government helicopters, you need to give us script approval."  I know a guy who used to work in public relations for the Marines.  He had script approval on some big movies and TV shows because these entertainment companies wanted to be able to use military equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in a more everyday sense, relationships form between the people making the entertainment and the government/military consultants.  These relationships create a situation where the entertainment's need for access to government officials causes certain things to be sanitized.  It's usually not blatant propaganda because in a democracy, people will call bullshit when it's really obvious.  So it has to be more subtle.  It's more like "we aren't going to put actual blatant propaganda out there, but the programming is always going to paint the government/military in a positive light as the "good guys."
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing you have to realize about our society is that in the end, this actually happens because the mass public as a whole does not really want to see our military or our government portrayed negatively.  What this means is that if you make a show or a movie that criticizes our own government or military, it will not have a lot of financial success.  If you want to make money with entertainment in the US, you have to ultimately show "our side" as being victorious and generally ethical.  Sure, you can show some corrupt individuals within our system, but only if you portray most people as being the "good guys" against the bad foreign guys.

       Except that nobody calls it television programming. They are television programs, yes. But nobody calls it programming, especially industry professionals. The term simply doesn't exist in reference to TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree with your larger statement, that TV is just numbing the minds of the masses or even guiding their ways of thinking. You've definitely read too much into the word.

       Just continue to not watch it, that's the best we can do.

       I love how many people have commented on this that seem to think you just released a peer reviewed study that proves TV programs you. You even used a double negative, why are so many people taking this as fact. Its a funny coincidence that I am pretty sure is not 100% intentional.

       You pick the channel and accept the programming. If you don't think that what you watch on television (from the news, to the shows, to the advertisements) affects you than you are the ignorant one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you are very aware of what you're watching and can take things with a grain (or truckload) of salt but most people watching television just let it wash over them. The news tells them x, and the believe x is a fact because the man on TV said it. The advertisement tells them they are fat/ugly/whatever and that they need a product to "fix" that, and they go get it. The TV drama shows the FBI agent blatantly breaking the law and making immoral choices... But to PROTECT us and keep us safe... People believe that too.

       Everything you take in has an effect on your perception, and it is NOT a coincidence that there is so little thought-provoking television and so MUCH mind-numbing, fear-inducing, drivel.

       +1 I'm pretty sure a 'program of events' was used in theatre, long before tv too. It now has a double meaning  but not an intentional one.

       You sir, are correct... What do you usually get when you go to a theater or many events? ... A Program. That booklet you receive when you walk in to an event is a "program". A listing of the evenings events... hence when television first started they co-oped the term from the entertainment of the day... Programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that being said... television is definitely used to socially "program" the masses by injecting certain ideas/influences/intentions into the masses. It's been the perfect dumbing down tool.  Just by the very action of sitting there only watching TV while you could be learning to say or do something amazing! At the very minimal TV has been distracting the masses to sit sedate instead of actively taking part in reality as an actor... Or maybe that is the only act for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of TV is now used to "program" us.

       And it's people like you that blindly accept everything, which is how BP got to where they are, how our country is now an Oligarchy, why our food supply is fucked up beyond belief and at the same time destroying our land, and our political system is just a fucking joke while innocent citizens are monitored. I'll say it again:

       Haven't watched Agents, but just watched Winter Soldier and could draw a metric fuckton of analogies of warnings AGAINST more control, more security, less liberty and that the system of those in control- SHIELD and the US Government had become compromised by the very thing we've always fought against.

       The series starts with everyone being all about joyously goosestepping to the tune of governmental secrecy and control. But over this first season the characters become more and more disillusioned with the situation and their organization. It eventually ties in with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. A film that was expressly explained by the filmmakers to be a condemnation of the NSA and Obama's secret kill lists. Thusly the whole idea of governmental organization and secret control is brought into question and is exposed as dangerous.

       My only problem with it was that the VP got dragged away at the end. Bull fucking shit would that ever happen. But the rest of the movie was pretty golden and fairly obvious in terms of the parallels between the conduct of military and military intelligence in the US.

       Spoilet alert: in the movie, Captain America tells everyone to stand up for themselves, that he may or may not be able to succeed alone, but that he will die trying and that he bets there are others like him out there. E.g. He doesn't pretend to be a hero, he asks the real heroes ( the normal people who died trying to help Captain America succeed in taking down HYDRA) to risk their lives to fight the system they previously worked to create.

       No, no they are not.
This latest round of propaganda ( captain america, shield) Is
timed to coincide with the bundy ranch issue, to help root out those with anti-government sentiments. This crap will help embolden those with 
libertarian leanings to speak out, or even act, to help facilitate
a full scale crackdown on "domestic terrorists".

       But think about it. If someone were to say this is actually happening people would say no its not, you just saw it on that movie. Sometimes i feel the government has movies made to cover up things that have actually happened. If there's a movie, then people can write it off as fiction.

       Is this really a new development in television though?  Shows have been adding to social and political commentary for decades.  The best example I can think of is Star Trek, starting with the original series.  Gene Roddenberry started out strong and never eased up.  And the new movies have followed in the same spirit.  You can't tell me that you didn't see parallels to 9-11 and the government response when you watched Into Darkness.

       That movie made the pro-military state propaganda incredibly obvious to me. I was laughing through most of the movie because of how ridiculous it was. There have been a lot of movies like that recently. Surprisingly the movie 2 Guns gave a semi-accurate account of how the CIA is involved in drug trafficking.

       It's because television / Hollywood is highly risk adverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you tend to get batches of the same type of film / TV show in a period of time, be it detective shows, vampire films, or the seemingly endless conversions to the big screen of sub-par "young adult" fiction.

       It's funny that they're always super reluctant to use regular US citizens as terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't really work because as shitty as life can be in America, it's generally pretty fucking awesome on the day to day for the average American, so why would they be inclined to go out committing acts of terrorism?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why their patsies always have some military history, some bent or grudge against the power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arab terrorist is no longer working because everybody knows it's fucking bullshit, any legit arab terrorists were probably funded by the US as they were originally, and more than likely incensed into becoming a "terrorist" because of how the US bombs the piss out of their country and destroys their livelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrorism is MANUFACTURED.

       Everybody is starting to realize these world governments are under the control of a secret government who is playing a game, pitting the countries against each other in a set up to bring in the new world order of one world government.

       A lot of them probably still aren't really happy about all the war crimes and stuff either. I'm going to just guess that most citizens of the entire middle eastern region now have known someone that we managed to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       War crimes over there started way back too.. The first one I can think of off the top of my head was when we caused the overthrow of the Iranian government.. Then Reagan's guys paid Iran to keep the US hostages longer to secure the win over Carter.. Then Gulf war 1 you have 2 large scale attacks where the US troops engaged a retreating force that was completely out of combat over a long time span until they completely annihilated the opposing vehicles and killed or caused all people to flee, some of which were unarmed women, children and other citizens..  Then the same general a couple days later orders his own troops to advance around and flank a retreating convoy of Iraqi troops, and the claim is that the Iraqis fire on them first, but no damage or injury is inflected at all. They proceed to order us troops to box in the retreating iraqis, then destroy and kill all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both groups were retreating to comply with United States cease fire agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have Bush 2 Gulf war, tortures, the civilians killed, contractor military guys killing people.. Indefinite detentions, violations of Geneva conventions.. All that continued under Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very hard to even guess what my opinion of the United States would be if I was from anywhere there. I would imagine most people in the middle east hate our country but probably do understand that it isn't necessarily that the people who live here have a damn thing to do with any of this. It sucks because I'd love to like be able to visit places outside the United States and meet people and learn about their countries and expose my kids to that, but our government makes it top dangerous for me to do that in a lot of places.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I could lie and say I'm Canadian, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder how hard it is to emigrate to BC if you're a computer programmer. I'd seriously consider the move. Fresh seafood, costal mild climate, close to Seattle and Whistler.. I bet they have good tech jobs there and I freelance anyway mostly.

       The clash of civilizations is real, it's not a fake conflict, and nowhere in anything I've said have I implied that is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufactured is not fake, it means that it is the direct results of reasons which were intended to turn those people into terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I chose manufactured because the process in which these people become terrorists fits the definition of manufactured, people purposely set out to cause instability so as to foster the rise of terrorists which they could then fund and use.

       Have you ever read a history book? Generally speaking every single discussion* they ever had required a "note taker" and it's our custom to speak about these decisions a couple decades after. Obviously the whole truth isn't out there, and certainly not everyone tells the truth. But the motives behind everything I mentioned were clear as day.

       These men aren't all powerful, they don't take orders from some homogenous group that always retains the same position. And most importantly the information our leaders are given is often woefully inaccurate. The president more than anyone has the information that he is presented to him manipulated. Although some certainly have been more savvy than others.

       post-9/11 they don't use americans because there are too many obvious enemies.  In the 90s though the cold war was over and we didn't really have anyone.  Look at The Rock and Under Siege for example.  Both used domestic terrorists.

       Sadly I'm back and forth between this concept and a not necesarrily "secret cabal" but certainly amounts of wealth and common interest that coalesce into a repressive system just by sheer organization and amount of interest in maintaining control by whatever means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which may seem like a conspiracy or cabal, because it is, but it is less demon worship illuminati and more buried in paper work, planned and carried out baby step by baby step in front of our faces, in an era when there was much more ability to control media and prevent alternative media to some degree.

       That is more like what is going on then baby sacrificing hood wearing red robbed ritual having society pitted against another society for control of humanity and all its resources. There is basically 2 or 3 groups of very wealthy people that get together and decide how things should go, and often times they are at odds with the other groups, who have there own idea of how the world should work.

       The idea of Terrorism is just modern day McCarthyism- trying to scare people and make everyone suspicious of their neighbor- not only that but the stereotyped 'terrorist' is such a vague idea; yet we invade other countries on the entire notion that 'terrorists come from this country'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they aren't a breeding ground for such ideals and fucked up things happen (because we sold them weapons..), but it's such a false pretense to justify invading another country over.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't be able to say you're 'fighting Terror' by invading a middle eastern country. That's like saying you're 'fighting AIDS' by invading Africa..

       It's not about glorifying it or standing against it. It's about conditioning people to accept these conversations about torture as normal. It's never the overt statement, the message is in the subtext, the assumptions. Every time we debate the efficacy of torture we lend it legitimacy, and that is utterly insane.

       I bet if someone brought up the West Wing you would then say that that is about showing government as benign and benevolent in order to trick us into trusting it. Portray it realistically and you're being conditioned. Portraying it in an aspiring way and it's propaganda. Ignore it completely and it's curiously absent from public discourse.

       The West Wing was on TV at a time when they wanted the people to think that government was benevolent, we are now in an era where the opposite is being pushed.  I'm not sure if you've seen my threads on this before, but they are now starting to foment the "American Spring" in which people will be so upset with government corruption that they will demand a new system and then in comes world government.  Just saying, there's a reason for everything, its

       Nope.  Anything on television is propaganda.  You must not understand the concept of propaganda and/or are completely under its influence if you don't think every bit of media you ingest is propaganda.  Here you go, a little reading material for you to carouse whilst the commercials are on:

       FIXED: every minute of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, the Drudge Report, Huffington Post, or anything else that deals with current events is propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't with the media it is with supply and demand.  When we get straight up news we are bored.  We have to read what happened, analyze it, and draw conclusions of our own.  The text is dry and has no flare so we skip it and move on.  People do not buy or read anything like that, even with the option.  People buy something where someone tells them what to think based on a single event that can be tied to others to support their dialog, whether or not they are actually connected.

       Well, what you wrote is hateful ABSURD drivel. And yes you moron, you are a real person, and as a real person, we are all held accountable to some extent to what we said. 
You don't have anything against gay people huh? WELLLLL maybe you should take your own advice and realize that homosexuals are "real people" as well.  Next time you are spewing you're uneducated fucking brain farts you had while playing mine craft with your gay hating friends, realize what you said is 1000000000% more offensive and damaging to the "REAL PEOPLE" that are actually gay and have to suffer all this misinformation and hate from bigots like you. If you really don't have anything against gay people, read a fucking book on zoology and see that homosexuality is a part of nature dickhead. Don't just write 'what you feel to be true' lol, its incredible to me you criticize me for being 'hateful' when you don't understand how incredibly stupid and insensitive your childish words are.

       I've been saying this for years and sparked many arguments on this subject. And I always start
       <em>
        I have nothing against homosexuals
       </em>
       , but I am against the Gay Propaganda thats washing all over the media influencing
       <em>
        confused
       </em>
       young men. Its bad enough theres chemicals and estrogen hormones in everything we eat now, which to me, I would say effects the chemistry of an embryo still in utero.

       I don't know, I could go on this subject for awhile.

       I genuinely do not understand your point of view, could you help me understand why it makes a difference if there are more gay characters? I fail to see how confused young men would be swayed by television, and even if they were I am of the belief that if it weren't for TV it would be something else, or nothing at all, since it's not really a matter of choice.

       You don't mind if there are gay characters. You just mind those gay characters influencing normal society. ie being gay is not normal and shouldn't be accepted in normal, polite society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to put forth that there is some gay agenda in media to make all the normal hetrosexuals love taking it up the ass then that's your own little crazy red wagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that there is some sort of agenda to get people to be gay or even less sinister to just accept gay people. The question is then a pretty big so fucking what?

       Then you don't understand the great influence Television has on the masses. Whether it be patriotism, trending items, opinions or views, and general subliminal messages. And I'm not being insulting, just expressing. For instance if you still don't get the concept, think of school shootings, and the youth of today being more aggressive/homicidal. The media continuously portrays every single one of them and confused/angry youth and see this as a way to act out. Perpetuating the problem.

       I believe there are many different types of homosexuality, and have been generously informed whenever talking about this subject. Some times people are just gay. Sometimes a man just loves a man, and a woman loves a woman. Sexual preference has nothing to do with it. A lot of stigma that people view with homosexuality steams from the church which has done horrible things around the world, not just to the gay community.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am proposing now is the influx of chemicals and media influence creating homosexuals.

       Mostly its repressed gays are confused by their own sexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       *the anti-homo agenda maintains that its possible to turn a homo into a hetero, so they will also believe that all these gays are going to confuse heteros into homos. The fact is nobody is scared of being straight. Only those shamed and fearful of their own sexuality are going be confused.

       I think he is operating from a paradigm where he believes that for some it is a choice and that this influences it. I don't know how to feel about it because I know a lot of straight people that tested out their sexuality with the same gender, or gays that participated and enjoyed a lot of straight sex. I honestly believe that most people have bi-sexual tendencies for the most part and then change that based other life-factors.

       Well, to those it does influence what's so bad about sex with men? I bet dudes give better blowjobs anyway. Besides, after sex you'd both just go play GTA or something. Man, I'm starting to wish I were gayer. Might go watch some TV now, I'm feeling a bit confused.

       I guarantee I can out shoot, out fish, out whatever most guys that care to try, and at the end of the day I'll be going home to my bf. Being gay != feminimity any more than being straight = masculinity. Anyone thinking otherwise would likely be surprised how many gay dudes they interact with on a daily basis.

       Just curious about your theory, wouldn't the amount of estrogen or whatever required to change a basic biological drive also effect other traits, making gays girlish, small, and weak? It doesn't seem like they would be "manly" at all.

       Right. That's the problem with the theory. If it was because of a chemical influence the end result would be determined en utero. Ok, it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be plausible, all of us will tell you it isn't a choice. But you have
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of folks eating the same food, water, etc and watching the same TV. Yet we are still a minority. Not as low a minority as some like to pretend, but minority none the less. It just doesn't fit unless you are suggesting we are singled out prior to birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, the fact that gays have been prevelant enough in history to be mentioned in the oldest parts of the bible, Greek/Roman culture, etc. We have been around since the beginning. This suggests a genetic difference, not the introduction of chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason we are noticed so much today is because of our fight for equal rights. There are of course more of us, because there's more of

      <p>
       Hormonal chemistry influencing sexuality is a perfectly reasonable point of view. Talking about Gay Propaganda that's washing all over the media and it influencing confused young men means that you have a significant issue with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is approximately 4.4% of regular characters on TV that are gay.
       <a href="https://www.glaad.org/publications/whereweareontv12">
        https://www.glaad.org/publications/whereweareontv12
       </a>
       So its actually a fairly realistic depiction of real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that showing these characters to confused young men (which is interesting and telling that you don't seem to care about confused young women) is somehow a bad idea means you believe that these confused young men can decide to love the cock and that their choice to do so is somehow undesirable from a societal perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please don't retreat from your implications. Scientific inquiry into why someone is black or gay or a psychopath is beneficial. That was not the main thrust of what you said though. Proudly follow through with that and say that you believe that having more gay people is just undesirable.

       Well I'm not a woman and can't really speak on there behalf, but I'm sure there's tons to say. Its bad enough that we demoralize and sexual women everyday in every form, and their introduced to this stuff at an early age. I don't care for those intense feminists that are all like
       <em>
        'Men are fucking pigs'
       </em>
       , but their point of view has validity. Its a different view of thinking.

       Yes reply to the parenthetical off-handed comment instead of addressing the rest of why you're a bigot. Apparently you believe that ignoring points as well as ignoring gay people will make both go away.

       No I don't. Actually I predict there will be an influx of homosexuals in the future. And I expressed the reasons why, but instead of looking at the information logically, all you see me typing is Faggot this and Faggot that. How about you go back through the comments and do some research.

       Lol, okay. I think we're on different pages. I never watched All in the Family but referring to black people as darkies, and as I can see now that you genuinely have a problem with gays, I would say you just stem from cultural reasoning. Thats just the way you were raised, the point of view instilled in you while you were young, that black and gays weren't right.

       Don't you know, homosexuality is one of the major politically correct litmus tests to prove that you're "one of us" along with your views on capital punishment and abortion and woman's rights. It's like when you were in school and didn't wear the right clothes. The other kids picked on you, right? Well, the kids are still picking on anyone who stands out, only now it is about key social issues that identify the purity or impurity of your social and cultural opinions.

       Makes sense right? Just look into all the estrogen being dumped into waterways and being fed to animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like theres a little bit of mercury in fish. Not enough to effect us. But if we consume mass amounts of fish, the mercury levels build up and can harm us. Not only do fish contain mercury, they are LOADED with estrogen.

       I do believe there is something behind what you are saying, and allow me to present my evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soy. Soy is in so much shit it's absurd. It's in so much shit because we subsidize it and corn both for billions every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do this because the corn rapes the land of its' nutrients, and the soy gives it back, they cycle these crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soy contains phyto-estrogen which bind to your estrogen receptors.

       This is just one way that mens hormones are being "secretly" manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say "secretly" because people can become informed on this if they choose to. I'm talking about it, but for some reason I get attacked with hostility for suggesting that there's a conspiracy to mess with male hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's always a card for everything on reddit, so whenever you try talking about an issue like this you're a "mens' rights" douche.

       What about it? If you're showing me "statistics by year" then you should have noticed the data is all over the place as a whole, none of the methologies or even reported Q/A is the same in any study. Add to it the fact that none of those surveys can be conducted without people SELF identifying as gay or engaging in gay sex means we do not know if or at what rate homosexuality is increasing. I am interested in learning more if you do have something besides that wiki link.

       Because equal signs bro, it's okay to be gay, we're serial guys, YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPRODUCE, IN FACT, WE'D PREFER IT IF YOU DIDN'T, SO PLEASE, BE GAY.
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be have not been making women "liberated bitches that don't need men" and making men "effeminate drama queens who don't need women" so that we'll reproduce more.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been systematically pitting men and women against each other for decades now, and the main goal of it, which has largely been accomplished, is to completely take power away from the average man in terms of his ability to protect women, because remember they don't need us anymore and they think they don't need our protection anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using societal programming to encourage people to live lives of active self-absorption and brazen recklessness so that they will die quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live fast die young as they say, because they truly want this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local towns mourn when 3 kids die because they were drunk driving and crashed into a freaking pipeline ( which exploded ). The powers that be celebrate the end of another "worthless feeder".
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - The gay propaganda is a part of their plan to destroy the family unit not only through gays but through their pitting of men and women against each other.

       Yes, some people are gay. Last I checked the figures estimate less than 5% of all people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems odd that such a small minority is being treated as if it's a majority, like everybody has a gay friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say "treated as if" I'm not referencing to equality, I believe everybody deserves the same rights and protections afforded to their fellow human beings, a view which is reflected in the Bill of Rights.

       Which is why television is showing healthy examples of gay couples raising children? Oh yeah, that's just tearing families apart isn't it /s

       Seriously, you don't think that maybe the increase in homosexuality displayed on TV is because a previously oppressed minority is FINALLY gaining mainstream acceptance? TV is reflecting real life. Gay families are being given more agency, couples are able to marry, and fewer people are forced to live in the closet as a result. As a result, gay people are more visible and accepted into society than ever before.

       No, I think that the increase in homosexuality displayed on TV is what has caused gays to gain mainstream acceptance.

       It all started with the Metro movement, did you not understand it's purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       They had to make it acceptable first for men to APPEAR to be gay, because even the appearance of being gay is enough to get you mocked by those who would do such mocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the metro movement started in the late eighties and gained the appearance of homosexuality societal acceptance by the late nineties.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: I am not homophobic, though I do not view homosexuality as morally correct, I know that it is more complex than an issue of morals, as there are biological reasons that also drive sexual desire, and that there are many people who have gender identity issues because of their genetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life sure is easy for a "normal" person without these issues, which is why I view everybody as their own individual case, we truly are all special snowflakes, though that certainly doesn't mean we don't all share similarities and common problems with similar solutions.

       You are homophobic. Your qualifying statement after saying you're not homophobic is itself homophobic. And the fact that you believe it is morally wrong is quite obviously informing your view about this "conspiracy."

       Do you ever think an aggressive push for acceptance might be to stop gay kids getting thrown out of their homes by their parents? To prevent them committing suicide when their peers mock them ceaselessly?

       "They" are basically the power structure, the same people who are engineering the campaign to disarm American citizens through things like MAIG and the Brady Campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       They created this culture by the same means which they use to do anything, controlling just about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       They controlled all of the racist KKK folks and Southern Baptists and everybody else they know who is opposed to homosexuality, and through them they established rituals like "smear the queer".
      </p>
      <p>
       Who in the fuck made "smear the queer"? It's a game where everybody tries to tackle the person with the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first obvious psychological effect is associating being queer with being bad, as if you are the queer you get tackled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second effect is that it trains people that it's okay to use violence against queers, as the object it to tackle the queer.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one way they create the culture of hate towards gays, super insidiously through playground games.

       No, but that peoples behaviors are being influenced to be more "homosexual" as with the whole metro-sexual movement, which also helped to influence their opinions towards homosexual appearances and behaviors being more socially acceptable.

       In terms of human sexual reproduction, yes, as males can not reproduce with other males.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that way, it is unnatural for a male to sexually prefer a female, as the purpose of sex is reproduction, they are your reproductive organs.

       I did not say that, you are purposely taking me out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       To cause men and women to drift apart, they do many things, which is why I stated the "independent woman who doesn't need a man financially and can thus live on her own and be a bitch and fuck whoever", as if the friction between men and women wasn't bad enough when it was mostly the men being assholes and fucking whoever.

       Protect them from MEN, the people who run the planet and always have and always will.

       Who got women to smoke? It was Edward Bernays, a MAN, who helped engineer the campaign which made it socially acceptable for women to smoke, by playing off their emotions in using the cigarette as a symbol of "independence" and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       So apparently women do need Men to protect them, otherwise other men will come up and take advantage of them or just straight up rape or murder them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women are not psychologically inferior, but about half of all women are weaker than half of all men, and that's unfortunately just enough to allow the men to make the women second class citizens by using violence to control them, which is why the planet is the way it is to today. It's not right, and I'm not defending it, just stating to you how it is since you seem not to understand.

       Homosex is natural because homosexuals are driven toward it at the onset of puberty, just like heterosexuals. That is all we know. That's nature, that brains make us want sex. Adolescent cavemen did not naturally sense that their load of semen is for making babies. Kids just wanted to fuck, just like today, and something in the gay brain is a little different. You say it's unnatural, science does not.

       You can't compare killing someone to fucking who you please. I'm saying homosexuality normalized isn't bad for society, and it's on you to prove that it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       harmful because gay sex is a consensual, nonviolent activity.

       So, if I understand better, you're saying TPTB push for division among people by accentuating the stereotypes in each group that rustle the jimmies of the others? Like a complicated divide and conquer strategy?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, I can buy into that idea. Take gays, since somehow that became a topic ITT. I feel like the rights war is damaged by the same stereotypes used on TV to support us. Yes, to your average person a lisping "fabulous" bright colored guy dancing around sassing everyone is uncomfortable. I wouldn't want that for my kid. Unfortunately, most don't realize, or choose not to realize, that most of us aren't like that. Most of us aren't all that distinquishable from anyone else. But until that becomes a realization people will see gay as a threat to normal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, TV definitely serves to perpetuate the very issues they claim to fight. And I can easily believe TPTB like that just fine. If you won't stand at my back because I'm gay, and I won't back you because you're a "bigot", both of us are alone, and they win.

       Exactly, their divide and conquer strategy is very complex and it does pit every group against each other in every way that it can.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are MASTER propagandists, they have fucking laws on the shit, so I think it's safe to assume that the people engineering the divide and conquer strategy are equally as good at propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of you are as you say, normal people you wouldn't know were gay unless you asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a threat to life, but it's being controlled so as to control the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have an active agenda to keep the population low, as that ensures there are less people to take care of and less people which can fuck up their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense for them to not only actively encourage people towards homosexuality through media propaganda, but also through biological means like through hormones.

       I wouldn't believe that were it not for their use of soy in so many products, as soy contains phyto-estrogen which binds to your estrogen receptors.

       Uh did you watch the rest of the movie? It had the 2 minute cartoon you refer to which 'explained' things, and then over the next two hours was some of the most blatant pro-CIA anti-Iranian propaganda I've ever seen. It was horrifically inaccurate and made to look like the CIA were heroes, when in reality it was actually the Canadian government who saved them.

       I wouldn't fundraise for Obama or make a movie with State Department and CIA support to demonize Iran and lionize the CIA. The movie was publicly lauded by many people in the US gov, Michelle Obama even announced its Best Picture win at the Oscars, in a masterful propaganda act, with soldiers standing behind her in uniform. Much of the movie was literally filmed at the State Department.

       I just figured it was because, well, pirates being in the msm and the accounts of the real phillips. "Lets get Tom Hanks to inaccurately portray this douche bag and prop him up as a national hero". Then the public would be behind america in the future if anything crazy happens on the 7 seas. "You hear about that ship that sunk?" "Yeah, it was a pirate ship but murica went in there and pewpewpew freedom" "fuck yeah!" When in actuality it was some merchant vessle that belonged to china or some shit and the U.S. sunk it to spark a war or something.

       They didn't become pirates because they loved gold doubloons.  They were starved out by the European and Asian fishermen after the collapse of their country.  Turned out that piracy was much more profitable than fishing.  Doubt they covered that in the movie.

       Edit:  Not sure why the down votes.  I'm not saying piracy is right, I'm saying history has 2 sides.  Would be much more interested in a movie that showed the point of view of the bad guys.  If you only look at history from the point of view of the side that you support, you are short changing your education.

       I am not sure if it is common knowledge.  A lot of people that I know, don't know the history of them.  Don't know the history of any pirates AFAIK.

       More and more people are becoming aware of how the system actually works, in no small part due to the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means the controllers need to increase the propaganda from media they still control such as the TV.

       I expect we will reach a breaking point quite soon, maybe only months away.

       I've seen all episodes of the two seasons of The Newsroom and completely disagree with including it on this list. The main character, Will McAvoy (played by Jeff Daniels) consistently bashes on American politics and the political system. Yeah, they mock Occupy a little bit, but they are
       <strong>
        certainly
       </strong>
       not using this show as pro-America, pro-CIA, pro-NSA propaganda.

       It's liberal propoganda. NBC only fucked over zimmerman and edited a tape to make him sound like a racist because some intern made a mistake. It wasn't a well orchestrated conspiracy by Ryan Julison and his media contacts.

       When Journalists fuck up, it's because the intelligence agency purposefully mislead them and not because they blindly followed a few pieces of "evidence" (twitter post, interview which was edited incorrectly, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalists are "good guys" who want to report the "hard stories" and not in the pockets of governments and politicians.

       It's an idealistic show about how the media can and should be doing a better job. The show doesn't say that every media organization acts the way they do, it is saying the opposite: this is how the media should act. It's basically shitting on every news channel out there right now.

       I mean cmon guys, Jack Bauer from 24 was the litmus test on how much the American people will accept in the name of defending against terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The character breaks laws, tortures and executes people in the name of "good" and people eat it up.  This programming then creates the sense of familiarity for people exposed to these concepts for the first time.  So when things like the Senate Intelligence Committee report comes out saying what the CIA actually did, people just end up saying "meh, it was done to protect against terrorism".  These are the exact desired programmed responses.

       You have no idea how a TV show is written do you? It is not written by the government. And there aren't people going over the script trying to pump it full of propoganda. Seriously, none of these comments would exist if everyone actually had a clue how these tv shows were made.

       Writers have bosses going eight levels up. Decisions at the top are not made by ordinary media moguls taking instructions from the CIA about "what to put in the show" but certainly feel certain ways about painting issues as acceptable for debate, through artificial dialogue affirming generic opinions, and happy endings (or in the absence of a happy ending, characters we rooted for who broke all the rules end up vindicated). Within that mold you can put whatever content you want, whatever sells.

       Did I ever say anything was written by the government?  Are you going to tell me that people's beliefs and perceptions don't influence their writing?  Or that you can't hire specific writers with a similar belief, perception bias to write a show?

       Watched/watch all 3, and that's part of their allure: they're so over the top propagandistic it almost becomes comedy, you just have to keep watching to see if it keeps outdoing itself. 
NCIS is another great example of this. 24 also (but I really liked that show 'back then' so I give it a minor pass).

       Spotting the prop-memes BECOMES the entertainment the more you pickup on them.

       Here's a way to really catch them: LISTEN to the cable news, don't watch it. Take away the blond bombshells with the legs and all the moving squiggly scrolling shit on the screen and just have the audio, you'll pickup so much more of the programming you won't believe it. It's crazy. Every 10 seconds you'll catch yourself going "did they really SAY that and get away with it?".

       You're right. Although the adaption of these kinds of shows have not been all at once, there is definitely a pattern of "bad ass government agents" who always find the terrorist or bad guy. Just a reinforcement that government is here to protect you and that they sometimes have to bend the rules of the constitution to get the job done. It's propaganda, plain and simple.

       My friend,  this has been happening for a very very long time. Ibwould say it started in radio, but the first orators were propaganda machines. In early tv history, the tube was filled to the brim with Pro-US propaganda. Leave it to Beaver, My 3 Sons, Davy Crocket. Hell just about 99% of TV back then was funded by companies that had a vested interest into the idea of the "American Dream"
      </p>
      <p>
       Have Gun Will Travel, Perry Mason and a few others were, well not Anti-American per se, but not really supporting the cause. For Mason, it was showing that the police were not all powerful and the innocent had an advocate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of drama packed into a show is kicked up a notch,  but there were shows like Dragnet, Cowboy G-Men, US Marshalls, Annie Oakley, thay were proponents of the concept, follow the rules and you won't get into trouble, and that the Law was apart of but above, the masses.

       99% of TV is unwachable. The "reality TV" craze ruined almost every channel on every network. Never mind the fact that 1/3 of the programming is commercials. If I pay a monthly cable bill why are there commercials? Sure, I understand commercials on the free local channels. They're to pay for the channel (because it's free, duh). But, why on the paid channels? Then you watch a TV show and the show it self is filled with ad's. So people who don't own a TiVo (DVR) are forced to watch commercials only so they can watch more commercials. All the major news networks all carry absolutely no news. Every time there is a riot in another country it receives zero coverage. Wouldn't want to give the slaves any ideas now would we? All we're left with is shows like the Voice and Real Housewives of OC. The golden age of TV my ass.

       It doesn't work quite like that. You're paying the cable company to upkeep and maintain the cable connection in your area not the networks to play TV. The networks get their money from ads. This is why you still pay a premium for HBO, SHOTIME, STARZ, etc which don't have ads and not for things like A&amp;E, AMC, ESPN, etc which do have ads.

       TV shows like those I avoid like the plague.
It's best to just torrent your favorite shows/movies
you skip all the bullshit and can watch them whenever you'd like
but I'm sure you all know this already.

       I don't know what a TORrent is, but then again maybe I do......
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, torrents are completely legal, as I'm sure you all know the legality comes to the content being torrented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern technology makes this legality retarded though because if you pay for DVR and can DVR the show, then shouldn't you just be able to download and watch the show under the same merits?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know why I have to be saying this, holy fuck, why are all these companies STILL not putting their shows up for direct download as soon as they're released?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that the advertising companies have their financial model in that tight of a vice to the point where they can't do without?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because of the studios?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is the asshole that is making it so I can't direct download DRM free episodes of shows on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to buy your physical discs in physical boxes, fuck you, it's all digital, give me the digital content you fucking assholes.

       You don't seem to understand torrenting. Just because it's called filesharing doesn't make it legal, same way calling theft a "5-finger discount" doesn't change the sticker price. "Sharing" recorded movies on videotapes is illegal as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       To help you understand how IP (intellectual property) works, think about a Pharma company who just patented a new drug. Now, you could save a lot of money (and not support some big corporation
       <em>
        gag
       </em>
       ) by going around the corner to your local alleyway chemist. No one would argue he didn't steal the formula, but you, the local alley patron, are also guilty of benefiting from someone else's property without paying.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to your point about IP addresses, in case you've never used a torrent before, you can see all of your seeds AND peers.

       I don't know about you, but I am turned off by superhero movies. All such movies are archetypal good versus evil, but how can we be sure that Super Fucking Man can't turn against us in a jiffy? Virtuous fee bee eye a gents safeguarding us against dangerous sand niggers, Brave police keeping us safe from criminals. It's all a crock of rotten shit.

       Not to be vague, but its called television "programming" for a reason. Everything on tv or film or whatever media you'd like to examine will have the same/similar affect on the developing mind. Disney has been doing it to girls via princesses for a very long time. More specifically if you look into the media that was build up around the Man of Steel Superman movie that came out last year you'd get a better idea of how blatant it could be. The National Guard did a lot of work with archetype programming with that movie, Christ imagery and soldiers etc. They had a recruitment program built up around it that you can find on the business end of a Google search.
Ive got kids and I tell them as soon as they can understand that TV is fake and that everything on it is fake to an extent. They arent swayed by advertisers or anything. Tell your friends kids. Tell your kids. Tell kids on the streets, who cares. The old folks were right; tv rots your brain. Specifically the frontal lobe of the pituitary gland. Its an imagination stealing machine. Adios.

       Well you can't really tell the story of Superman without getting into Christ imagery -- what's your issue with that? You think its some kind of anti-atheist propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would hope I don't have to explicitly tell my kids that TV is fake...I mean I don't know of any 6 year olds who think it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, I get your stuff with princesses I suppose, but in recent years they have been trying to show girls who are much more self confident and independent. Again, I don't understand where there is pro-government propaganda coming from the latest Marvel movies, and if you continue to be vague I'm just going to assume there isn't any.

       You can do the Superman story without any of that imagery, John Byrnes did it in the 80's. I would hope that you'd let a kid know that tv is fake. All preschool shows are aimed at interacting with the kids because the kids have no orientation for reasoning that they arent being addressed by the shows characters.

       I believe big corporations are doing terrible things to the environment. But, their message is that we (the common people) must accept a lower standard of living to save the Earth. Meanwhile, the big corporations and wealthy should be free to take more and more. The overall message is one of class warfare. The world is not overpopulated. The populations are being starved of resources, because the resources are being stolen.

       Yes, humans are so evil, so now, the last family on the ark, and the hope of all humanity will be crushed as Noah wants to kill two twin newborn girls. So, Noah figures, he'll give us a second chance.

       This scene from the Newsroom is the funniest shit I have ever seen. It's such blatant propaganda. I love how the extrajudicial murder of an accused criminal brings about racial harmony on the airplane. The warm look in the eye as the black pilot and the white pilot shake hands, united by their shared joy in our government killing people without a trial.

       Does she really learn how bad hacking is? I mean...she was hired to hack in the name of S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than against it. Then again, I can't stand the character as a whole, she's a fence sitter with no clear direction nor purpose. That and she's not that good on the whole acting front. Her hacking skills are the least of her problems.

      </p>
      <p>
       ..."Here’s where it started to raise a few hackles in the real world: When Skye’s beau throws out the names of Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, they aren’t labeled misguided (as he has been, and the Rising Tide continually are) and Skye’s final condemnation for him is saved for the revelation that he was motivated by profit, rather than transparency."

       Seems to me they are making a distinction between Snowden and Skye's beau. The most recent episodes(including TWS) all end with people realizing that just as much as Hydra has to be defeated, SHIELD has to end, as well, because freedom isn't a tool for control.

       Well stated. I like SHIELD because it actually shows there are good guys AND bad guys in the organization, the bad guys have been hiding until forced into the light. The bad guys want to "kill a few million" so the remainder can live in peace. Sounds alarmingly similar to current events, doesn't it?

       Hmm. I've given up watching it now. There is one scene where she stands in front of a "wall of valour"  at shield HQ and, with inspiring music in the background, she confesses to feeling like a dirty hacker next to a wall of brave Americans that sacrificed their life for god and country. She then pleads forgiveness and wants to become part of shield .

       The most recent reveal is that she was standing next to a evil double agent at the time who likely had a hand in taking down some of those agents. Apparently if you go back and look at his expression now, knowing that he is an evil traitor, it's quite revealing. I'm just saying there was more to this scene than people might have realized.

       So they started airing it after 9/11? They obviously shot it beforehand, probably early 2001. Did Hollywood know shit was going down? If so, that's some damned social conditioning if I ever seen it.

       It's really bad, yes. And it has gotten worse, yes. I notice things in TV shows as seemingly innocuous as Parks and Rec, Modern Family and other prime time sitcoms. This is why I barely watch TV anymore. We got rid of cable 4 years ago, before we were even awake, but I've never been happier without it now that I am!

       Definitely in Almost Human. Theyre basically showing us what life will be life in the short future and preparing us mentally for how we will be enslaved under mass surveillance and police states. Almost every damn "drama" show on is about cops in some way or another and im fucking sick of seeing the good cop/bad guy, cops always win shit. How about shows that make us feel good or expand our ways of thinking. Gawd forbid we put things on tv that are beneficial to us.

       Yeah, I cord-cut close to 10 years ago because I thought it was bad back then. Whenever I catch a glimpse of TV at a relative's house or in public I'm always shocked. They experienced the slow progression but for me it is so blatant.

       I've never had a cord. I've been pretty proud to have no televisions in my home since I was 17.
For a while I'd listen to the radio but my blood pressure was suffering so I canned that too.

       It's not about when it started getting so packed with propaganda, it's about when you started noticing it more and more.  Even before TV, the majority of movies/cartoons people would see in the theater were almost pure government propaganda.  WWII-era Donald Duck cartoons come to mind as an obvious example.

       Television/movies have deep roots in propaganda, so it's certainly not a new phenomenon

       Actually, it's a clever storytelling technique.  At first, you naturally root for the main character: She has good intentions; she's a cop trying to prevent "terrorists" from changing history.  Then as the show progresses you realize she's a corporate cop fighting to maintain the corporate status quo, partly for selfish reasons: she doesn't want her own family to be erased when history changes.  And you realize "Am I rooting for the villain?"

       You put in words what I felt. You know, last night I was watching Dark Knight rising, and I was just really enjoying the beatings Bat Fucking Man was getting from the guy in the mask, whatever his name is. Actually, what I would really like to see is that guy tag team with the Joker and beat the living shit out of that snotty Batman, after which they take turns sodomizing him Pulp Fiction style and finally douse him in gasoline and light the fucker up.

       It is a little weird when you find yourself sympathising with the cause of the supposed "Bad Guys". The show explores some interesting and sometimes frightening ideas. In one ep we find out that in the future people that can't pay their debts are sentenced to slave labour. They get a control chip implanted in their heads and becomes empty drones stuck in tiny cubicles of opaque plastic sheeting along with thousands of others where they make electronic components for their corporate overlords. Chilling to say the least.

       Continuumm is a great show. Remember all the Hunt For Red October-type movies in the 80s and 90s? This is simply the natural progression and cheaper to produce.  Cut the cord, watch what you want and forget about the rest. Adversaries change every once in a while, it will be another group in a few years.

       Have you seen much of the show? As the story develops it becomes much less black and white, and it really starts to question the role corporations have in government and could have in the future. Good show for the most part.

       I can't speak to the other shows listed, but the Marvel properties seem more about good story telling rather than some sort of "rah rah Go American Government!" Agents of Shield and The Winter Soldier have completely contradictory messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       WS is about an outsider looking at a big government agency and seeing all the problems that come with that much power with so little over sight and transparency. But fails to acknowledge that real good can come about when large organizations don't abuse their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       AoS is about showing a group of idealists who can really accomplish good with the right resources and influence. But it fails to show (until recently in the show) what happens when less reputable people get control of an agency with that much power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marvel seems to have a great grasp on using fiction to show the truth, and they're doing it in a way that doesn't dumb down the complexity of these very real socio-political issues. This is a step in the right direction for American entertainment.

       American TV is very much here in the UK and very popular too. You naturally watch a few episodes to see what the fuss is about, hoping to be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, I can pick and choose programmes from BBC and ITV which (on average) are less in your face.

       TV hasn't become like this, this is always what it has been. It is a convenient way of creating a national identity, pushing certain agendas, and making outside forms of thought seem foreign or weird. You see it in modern shows but if you rewatch old shows and think about political/cooperate/social context of that time period you will see just as much.

       I've been noticing it for years. It isn't just tv of course, forgive my tin foil hat, but I was particularly suspicious about the amount of White West vs brown Arab/Persian films that came out during the Afghan and Iraq wars: 300, Troy, Alexander, Kingdom of Heaven, etc.

       I've actually been planning on writing an analysis of how different films and TV shows are clearly shifting the zeitgeist - either maliciously or subconsciously - to make certain things the new status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       Person of Interest, a show ostensibly about the dangers of government surveillance, still has the subtext that it's okay to watch everyone as long as you're the protagonists. Also, being a murderous vigilante is fine. The only outspoken anti-surveillance activists are terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the most recent episode of NCIS, as in many other episodes, a suspect is roughed up in the interrogation room and everyone is fine with it, as "clearly he did it". I bet they'd feel a little less chummy about it if it turned out that the suspect didn't do it and Gibbs et al were fired over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuum, while trying to present things in shades of grey, has the only anti-government activists in the show equated with terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Dark Knight, Batman has built an extremely invasive mass surveillance system. Morgan Freeman speaks out about it, but it's still seen as fine that Batman uses it only that one time. It's fine as long as he uses it to capture a criminal, or stop a terrorist. Just like it's completely fine that he goes around punching people at night and the police practically hires him for it.

       Absolutely. THIS is exactly what I'm talking about. Please do write more about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deliberate creation of a frame in which we view the world. Implicit values are transferred and imposed. Broad ones such as America is great, war is strength, consuming is living etc. impacting our everyday behaviours in small but real ways and from a very early age. Advertising exists as a multi-billion dollar industry because it works. What's the difference between the TV programmes and advertising anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       This sounds cliche but, as a Brit, watching American TV, it comes over  loud and clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This frame or narrative also supplants and crowds out a more humane, more equal alternative which we don't see as much anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's deliberate and corrosive.

       If I recall correctly, it is not viewed as ok that batman uses his surveillance system that way. Morgan Freeman's character voices his disapproval of the plan, and it clearly pains Wayne to do it. We are meant to feel that he has committed a sin.

       The point is that it establishes that protagonists can do whatever they want and get away with it. Nobody actually forces Batman to deal with the repercussions of what he did. In fact, there were no repercussion whatsoever.

       Well, Continuum has gotten a lot more gray recently. Glimpses we get of Kira's memories in CPS are of things like her superiors ordering her to abandon a child in a fire to save two executives, or them remote controlling her to murder an informant.

       I've checked out Continuum and I have to say I find the message a little confusing.  It started out as a bunch of psychopaths murdering thousands for no reason, but as the series progressed they're being portrayed more and more sympathetically and their actions more justified.  Not the arc I was expecting.

       That's kind of the point.  Early on the terrorists are clearly the villains, and it's true, a lot of them are bad dudes, the heroine is shown to be in the right.  Very early on in the first season though they start to show cracks in that, they show that the corporations running the show while they were good for the supposed heroine, things weren't so good for a lot of people.

       They show how the terrorists got to where they are, that though they do terrible things they used to just be regular people who had horrible things done to them.  The terrorists are shown to not even be a homogenized group, they all are working towards one goal but for different reasons.  Kellog just wants power, Kagame wants a better world for all, Garza originally appeared to be out for revenge but now seems to be showing deeper motives.  The big bad turns out to be an old man who made a lot of mistakes in his quest to build a better world and now wants to fix his mistakes (though lately it seems there may be more to it than that).  Even Theseus when you see his actions taking place seems a lot more sympathetic.

       I’m actually impressed with the fact that the show keeps getting made, for a while I thought that showing terrorists as anything other than comic book villains had passed into the unacceptable realm.

       I feel Continuum has a lot of interesting topics especially the tidbits here &amp; there about the power structure in the future &amp; the use of technology. It seems the majority for the use of control, CMR implants that can take over control of the individual or delete their memories, truth drugs, 3D video recorders with projection technology to recreate a scene, the prosecution of individuals due to having certain books, the disgusting power of the minions of the empire &amp; their worship.

       You know the world is fucked when a time traveling device to stop it before it happens is the only way to kill the beast. If we had to deal with such a beast we'd be fucked, because I don't even believe time travel is possible.

       in series one we knew of some real programs, whispers of more widespread surveillance, then "trapwire" etc but during this last season Snowden came out and actually proved all our suspicions correct and to be fair to the POI scriptwriters they have incorporated some of that. but there is no way of getting around it, if the system/s continue to exist in the show then the show is promoting universal surveillance as useful and effective, whether they mean to or not.

       secondly the violence is reaching a comicbook / cartoon level where he throws himself thro a window and lands on a car (and man) dusts himself off with a wisecrack and walks away, a 100lb hotchic or 2 clearing a bar full of hardened street thugs etc and hasn't everyone on the show been shot 2 or 3 times by now? oh and "privacy terrorists"...

       I see what youre saying, and i agree mass surveillance is the primary constant, but the show seems to go as far to even separate the surveillance systems at play - The Machine (the "good machine): the one Harold created, has 2 functions relevant (terrorists {what ever that may mean}] &amp; irrelevant [everything else] and then the newer machine Samaritan - which seems to be more of an evil "death star" type of entity.
      </p>

       Obviously i watch &amp; enjoy the show, I dont buy the sales pitch...im merely entertained - without offending myself.

       It's that new propaganda law in action (or rather, dispensing with the law that
       <em>

       You people are talking about an active conspiracy of "literal brainwashing."  Who is in charge of the brainwashing?
      </p>
      <p>
       For it to be brainwashing, some group has to be behind it.  That leaves lizard people or the government/Obama (which means fascism).  If there is no group behind it, then it is exactly what I said it was: people screenwriting based on the creative process and shit they think people might watch (so they get paid).

       So I guess your answer to the question is you don't see what OP is talking about. That's fine, your argument is rational to you.  To most of the rest of us, responding in this tread, your argument is the same bullshit we hear from people who are asleep.  Not saying you are wrong, just saying you are taking a complex situation and saying that the most shallow and surface argument is the correct one.

       You do realize the people who write the episodes aren't in control of the studios, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just regular people (well, as regular as you can be in Hollywood) who screenwrite for a living.  They write what they know.  Writers draw off of current events, their childhood, stories they've heard, their personal points of view, and basically anything else you can suggest as to how people get creative ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       These writers don't go to classes in DC, and listen to speeches from political elites about what they can and cannot put in their scripts.  They simply write.  Some movies/tv shows/books have more political bias to them, and that is because the writers have an active interest in politics and that's what they draw their creativity from.  They write what they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, maybe some writers are pro-government and they let their views permeate in their work; but they aren't instructed to by some NWO government to create a script that praises Obama or praises torture, or praises big government.

       I am going to focus on television for this response, but it works for movies just as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most TV shows are pitched by individuals to studios.  Those individuals then typically serve as a show-runner, and hire additional writers to lighten the work-load.  The story of the show goes through those writers (with approval of the show-runner).  The studio may say "no" to some of the ideas the writers want to use, but they do not dictate what the writers write about.

       Coming from a person who literally uses HIMYM to feel hope, I can understand how you might not be willing to suspect there are things in shows and movies that might be insulting garbage to most people.

      <p>
       And a human who is putting their voice into whatever they are working on has boss, who has a boss, until one important human doesn't really like what they hear and that is where bias starts, not at the very bottom where working people are just working the way their boss wants. They are tought to make "what sells" and you can do that with a lot of extra garbage added as subtext.

       W t fffffffffff. So, writers have a boss who does.. what? Pays them to cook up organic blockbusters with their friends? And that hot script goes up to another exec who gets a hard on and it's go? Hah. Are you still in school??

       No way does your average writer get to do whatever they want and just serve it up---the moment anyone gets their first job they learn that, and anyone with ears has heard that from professionals themselves whenever they're on the topic of "creative control" in their industry.

       So you agree there are undertones, but it's not an attempt at brainwashing? A little contradictory, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       you are confused. I noticed it drastically ramped up after the new avengers movie and previously other movies which depict the US in disaster and ruins due to outside threats. So yes it's writers jumping on the more recent patriot bandwagon but it still brainwashes, even if unintentionally and it's still getting more intense, and it still makes anyone aware of it uneasy for these reasons. Lizard people no, but writers trying to make a hit in the current climate still has the same effect and influence, escalating things continuously.

       I was at a friends house and his girlfriend had House M.D. on (s2e11 Need To Know). There's a point where the patient becomes violent and smashes a window with her IV stand (a one time outburst after a week in the hospital).

       Suddenly they are certain cocaine is definitely the cause of this woman's horrendously dramatic doctor-baffling symptoms. So certain that they decide to highly illegally break into her house and search through all of her belongings. (Cam: "I'll go look for her stash." House: "Take Foreman.  There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.")

       But it's totally justified when they illegally search her car and find a legally obtained bottle of Ritalin prescribed to her kid. House busts in on the patient and her family and rips apart the Hippocratic Oath, with no actual proof that she had been taking it. (House: "Cocaine with a PG rating." and, House: "Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system.")

       The whole episode the mother is shamed by everyone around her and treated as less of a person. Yes I had to look it up lol.

       House is also the best diagnostician in the world and needs to break in so the patient doesn't hide anything. He also doesn't care about rules and lawsuits. Him and cuddy discuss that his recklessness is a cost benefit overall for the hostilities hospital

       Anyone following resurrection?  Plenty of propaganda in that one too.  Everyone expected to let the police enter their home without a warrant.  Told they HAVE to.  And immediately questioned about gun ownership and location of such guns.  Then making gun owners look like unstable Nutjobs that just can't wait to break the law.

       TV, like the internet can be a valuable resource or a great way to keep people docile and numb.
Obviously, most of what's out there is garbage meant to distract people from issues that really matter (reality tv, disney channel filth, award shows, etc) or propaganda (like the shows you mentioned) to coerce people to accept a corrupt/illegitimate/police state world.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand we have Cosmos, a hugely popular show which encourages people to question authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is to choose your entertainment wisely. Recognize the trash out there and keep it away from your kids.

       God, this has been going on so long you couldn't imagine.  I remember in the 1990s watching an episode of the hit show ER with a friend.  Only episode I ever saw.  The show had three subplots, each one of them blatant propaganda of a political nature.  One subplot had to do with an anti-gun message, the next had to do with the government's power to regulate things like cigarettes, but the main story was the kicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main story had to do with hospital wanting to detain a person on psychiatric grounds but "their hands were tied" because of constitutional reasons.  So they were forced to let this obviously self-destructive woman go.  Later she returned to the hospital on a slab.  That damn constitution, always getting in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question of "WHEN" I would say for many, many decades.

       Well, first of all, I don't "see things like this wherever I look". I see what is there. You've obviously never known about the Disney WWII and income tax propaganda?... If you knew about those things you would probably be more inclined to see the kind of subtle innuendo shown in OSO that would lead small children to grow up thinking a society where they're being spied upon night and day is okay. It's not okay in real life. And as far as I'm concerned, it's not okay for my child to watch a cartoon that acts like it is not only okay, but perfectly normal.

       I'm well aware of it. Perhaps you're not aware that rarely has any media-related company or person been inclined to propagandize the way it was done during the war due to the later years of McCarthyism that specifically went after Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       To argue that those same things are happening nearly 70 years after that war occurred is ridiculous to me.

       I literally haven't watched any TV in the last 3 years just because of this, other then Gold Rush, or Bering Sea Gold. It is clearly propaganda. My question is, has it always been this nakedly obvious, or did this just happen recently?

       Sorry for not knowing his name by heart... On other news, I read this quote by him:
       <em>
        “I’m reading every script, every story, and giving notes and re-writes,” Whedon says.
       </em>
      </p>

       You can check it out here:

       Sounds to me like he's pretty much the greenlight guy, which does make him a showrunner of sorts.

       Not so much a plot as the creation of a frame in which we view the world. Not literally, but implicit values are transferred and imposed. Broad ones such as America is great, war is strength, consuming is living etc. impacting our everyday behaviours in small but real ways and from a very early age. Advertising exists as a multi- billion dollar industry because it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sounds cliche but, as a Brit, watching American TV, it comes over  loud and clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This frame or narrative also supplants and crowds out a more humane, more equal alternative which we don't see as much anymore.

       I understand where you're coming from but where I separate from this particular view is that it seems, in threads such as this one, some find it impossible to accept that not everything is put out to control or mold the viewer.

       As a fan of film and TV, I would like to think that there are artists out there interested in, and passionate about, creating and telling stories for like-minded individuals. Not as a fractured messenger for the ideologies of the powerful.

       Thanks, I see where you're coming from too . I don't think it's always intentional it centrally controlled, it's just the dominant culture which is then replicated in tv, film etc. And it's the cumulative impact they have which is so harmful/effective.
      </p>

       Advertising though is a different story, those are carefully crafted narratives designed to appeal to a target audience. Some tv programmes, through product placement etc, are blurring the lines between programming and commercials.

       The media we consume shapes the way we view the world, sure. I'll give you that. But this sort of thinking implies a much greater level of governmental control and organization than actually exists.

      <p>
       It makes me very sad to think that our television programming gives the world that sort of opinion of us.

       For fuck's sake people, it's fiction. All that "propaganda" is less about political brainwashing and much more about attracting viewers.

       I don't want to watch a cop perfectly follow procedure and file a ton of paperwork, that's what I want from real life. I want my fiction full of shit blowing up and people breaking the rules. It's more exciting than real life, and that's all it's intended to be.

       You're missing the point. There are elements of strong propaganda in it. I know the plot develops but the context is set early on. The "American dream gone bad" message is strong. Do you agree with the American dream it portrays?

       Actually, it totally trashes the idea of the american dream in the first episode(which you would have known if you watched it), it's all about the man verse a power he can't hope to control, heck that's the whole story line. Tesseract anyone?

       I haven't watched any of these shows, but I have seen the famous Jeff Daniels' speech from The Newsroom, and it gave me the impression that it was a very "power to the people" kind of show.

       Im gonna play devils advocate.I do think there are obvious propaganda in shows but I also think that are truth in these as well dropped in at certain times like the agents of Shield the characters just found out since its inception long ago thr SHIELD has been invaded with corruptness long ago and it runs deep i other places.Its actually from the fall out of Captain America movie.,
      </p>

       I agree with a lot of shows the general themes are propaganda like but there are truth bombs inserted in some way. Just my take

       Isn't the current arc of Agents of SHIELD about the big CIA-like agency getting infiltrated by neo-Nazis, failing to detect it, and then being forcibly dismantled? I feel like that's 100% what it's about. How is this "obvious propaganda" for the government?

       Most citizens want to watch and read nationalistic propaganda. LIFE magazine turned against the war in Vietnam and quickly went out of business. US News &amp; World Report delivered  less than nationalistic news and went out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       TIME literally said it was part of the establishment last year. It continues to roll.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can accuse the media of this, that, and the other. At the end of the day, their biggest goal is making enough money to feed their family. The percentage of the public that is educated enough to recognize propaganda is quite small. Michael Ruppert was one of the best investigative journalists. I think financial problems had a lot to do with his end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I helped sponsor a 9/11 production several years ago. I got back a fraction of my "investment." The public wants to be entertained and they think the government is here to "keep us safe."

       This is the first part of a six part series. I think you tube recently made them break it apart due to its length. The subject is democide or death by government. Over the past century, official estimates for death by government run up to 170 million victims. The first thing a genocidal government does is disarm the public.

       It's been like that pretty much since the invention of television right?.... I thought everyone knew that.
But don't you find it more watchable when the propaganda is really obvious? It's hilarious to me.

       Entertainment is often inspired by our fears. This is a storytelling tactic that goes back hundreds of years, at least. When people feared the plague, it was vampires. More recently, when people began to fear man-made sicknesses, we saw a resurgence in zombie popularity. Now, with people fearing "big brother" stuff, we see entertainment that plays off of those fears.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's generally just how storytelling goes.

       Though I cannot find specific examples from these shows, i think this one is not really a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything has a message in it, all games, TV shows, stories and music. It's not for brainwashing purposes, it's because human beings have been attaching themselves (and been influenced by) powerful narratives for years. Sadly we are influenced by these things incredibly easily if we attach ourselves to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it can be abused. I just don't think that this one is as evil as it seems. It's more that film is responding to what we respond to. In that order first. It's tailored to us.

       I think maybe some of us should take off our tin foil hats.  I don't watch the Newsroom, and I'm not a fan of crime drama, but Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is harmless.

       This post is stupid. These are fictional television programs that provide entertainment (at least as far as Homeland and Newsroom, that shield show is just garbage). Nobody is pretending they are non fiction or even based on true events.
Newsrooms is written by Aaron Sorkin who wears his political views on his sleeve and makes his shows from that view and Homeland is based on an Israeli book, take from  that what you will.
I am far more concerned with the propaganda in actual "news" shows both local and national.

       I haven't actually watched it but I heard that in Homeland the good guys are the agents in Homeland Security and the bad guys are the equivalent of Occupy Wall Street.

       Also, I remember someone linking something about how the Simpsons featured some propaganda from the FBI or some other agency. I always thought the episode about Doomsday Preppers featured alot of right wing propaganda.

       Eh, I personally like Homeland. Sure, I see it for what it is and yes, Mandy Patinkin couldn't look more like every rabbinical caracture that was ever drawn, but if you're not so indoctrinated that you cannot see past the obvious propaganda angles, it can be entertaining. Not to mention, I've had a little crush on Claire Daines for a while now. I'll still watch the show even though I know it has absolutely zero basis in reality, and I'm not sorry for it. Downvote away.

       Anyone ever think that maybe you guys are reading a little too far into these works of ... fiction.  Then again, I suppose there isn't much of a line between fact and fiction for most of you. As made evident by the majority of your fear mongering and rampant racism.

       I know, right. I think it's true for any movie of the 21st century, especially recently. Just examples of two totally different movies - "Elysium" and "The place beyond the pines" - both are full of multiculti propaganda, where the whites are bad guys and the blacks/crossbreeds play the victim card.

       See thats the point of view people don't get. I really don't have anything against the gay community. I have family members and friends who are gay. I was bored one day and thought why something is. Just so happened to be homosexuality.

       Television is designed to make money.  There is plenty of evidence for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you have actual evidence there is a conspiracy to program peoples' behaviour you shouldn't make the claim.  It could be argued that the kind of programming you describe could be an emergent property of the modern television industry but haven't made that argument and I'm not going to do it for you.

       FIXED: every minute of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, the Drudge Report, Huffington Post, or anything else that deals with current events is propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't with the media it is with supply and demand.  When we get straight up news we are bored.  We have to read what happened, analyze it, and draw conclusions of our own.  The text is dry and has no flare so we skip it and move on.  People do not buy or read anything like that, even with the option.  People buy something where someone tells them what to think based on a single event that can be tied to others to support their dialog, whether or not they are actually connected.

       It's not about glorifying it or standing against it. It's about conditioning people to accept these conversations about torture as normal. It's never the overt statement, the message is in the subtext, the assumptions. Every time we debate the efficacy of torture we lend it legitimacy, and that is utterly insane.
