       Most American oil comes from the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska/Canada, and South America. The US has reason to invest in Israeli security because of a historical alliance and vested political interest in protecting a pro-American democracy in the Middle_east. This can all be explained with basic international politics, no need to bring conspiracies, spy agencies, or oil into it.

       Incredibly relevant as it directly addresses the motivation in your speculation. If the US doesn't have an "addiction" to Middle Eastern oil then there's nothing to back anything else you've said. Maybe in the 70's Middle Eastern oil was a huge thing, but we've moved so much of our production to the west because it's cheaper and more politically acceptable that a cutoff of ME supply wouldn't cause half the trouble that it did decades ago.

       Israel is run by politicians looking out for their political future and the votes of their constituents, just like any other democracy. The fact that the military can committed crimes in Gaza and that certain politicians have pushed illegal actions does not condemn all Israelis or even all Israeli politicians in the same way the the invasion of Iraq was not a condemnation of every American and American Politician. This post is nothing more than baseless speculation.

       The OP's theory is implausible. But your first argument is false. Where we in the US get this or that barrel of oil on any given day is irrelevant. Oil is a global commodity and controlling the production of it is seen as a vital Anglo-American interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not now going to argue that we invaded the middle east because the Bush junta loves democracy are you? No, the geopolitics of the M.E. has been about controlling oil fields for 100 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel largely owes its existence to Western desires to maintain a foothold in the region. The OP's theory may be somewhat implausible, but it's not unthinkable. Israel has benefited greatly from oil geopolitics in the region.

       oil companies are owned by banks.  and banks don't care what they invest in so long as it makes money.  when solar makes money, banks would invest in solar.  that leaves Israel w/ a sudden downgrade in "strategic value" that does not effect the banks (the owners of the oil companies) in the same way.

       No if there was investment in solar it would make them money. Oil however already has the infrastructure, demand and they can charge more for it.

       You can't run 99% of the cars in the world on Solar. You can't just about any ocean industry on solar. One day we will when Oil is $4 a litre but until then. You companies are going to keep going like they are now.

       Do you realize that you insist that solar does AND does not make money in the same post?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, solar is just barely starting to make money.  But not because the lack of "infrastructure". And it's not because of any lack of tech.  All it would take is for Congress to shift oil subsidies to solar subsidies (not including the cost of middle east wars for oil - in the TRILLION$ -- direct oil subsidies are in the BILLION$ per year).  Even w/o formal subsidies, the oil industry would collapse.
       <strong>
        The oil industry has always always been artificially supported.
       </strong>
       Why?  (Hence my "conspiracy theory".)

       Sorry, I was saying that compared to oil. Solar makes nothing but it will one day soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again compared to Oil, solar has relatively limited infrastructure which includes "tech" whatever that's even supposed to mean, that's a more vague term than infrastructure.

       I think the American government shouldn't be subsidising these companies for environmental reasons, BUT I understand the economic reasons why they do it. Dropping the cost of fuel, (pardon the pun) fuels the economy. I don't think it is a conspiracy. (At least that part of it.)

       It isn't the physical oil NEARLY as much as it is the petrol-dollar. We need the spice to flow...but only to float the USD. Not so we can drive to the mines.

       Exactly, even Iraqi oil is mostly sold to Chinese companies, the difference is before the oil was being sold for Euros not Dollars. This would also explain why France was so against the war.

       regardless, it seems that Israel stands to lose a lot of "strategic value" on the day renewable energy becomes the norm. and unlike saudi arabia, it's not like they Israel has a lot of extra land for solar panels.

       The problem with alternative energy sources is that they are not as cheap as conventional sources. To use them, we must sacrifice our standard of living, because they need to be subsidized. When the government stops pouring tax money into them, they fail. The only reason we keep using convention sources of power is because they are
       <em>
        cheap
       </em>
       . The cultural Marxists in charge in Washington are attempting to force us to use more expensive, less efficient sources of energy because it suits their social engineering agenda, but they are crippling the economy in the process while doing absolutely nothing for the environment -- when we shut down a clean-burning coal-fired power plant, China builds ten dirty-burning new ones.

       Do you have any idea how many problems go away for Israel if they didn't need to a steady supply of oil from a marketplace full of enemies that don't want to do business with them? If anything, Israel is more  incentivized to get off oil than the U.S.
