    <div class="md"><p>You need to strike a balance. It isn&#39;t healthy for anyone to become obsessed with a single issue or topic. When you first realize that everything you were ever taught to believe about society, culture, and history is to some degree incorrect that can be jarring, and shocking, and can cause you to become focused on that. But you need to step back and view yourself in context: these things you are discovering were true before you knew they were true and that didn&#39;t lessen the value of your life, or your pursuits, passions, loves, or friendships. Once you get comfortable with the idea that these things were going on your whole life, and indeed long before you were born, you can start to viewing them as just one more facet of reality. Once you internalize that you can continue researching, and doing what you can to change things and educate others, but you can do so as part of an integrated part of a larger whole life. When you strike that balance you are easily able to context switch and communicate at the right level with the audience you are speaking to or with. For example, you might have candid conversations about control systems and corruption with another &quot;awake&quot; friend but you may limit your discussion with a family member or loved one to dropping &quot;seeds of doubt&quot; in their mind to germinate later. For example, a simple remark about corruption or lies while watching or discussing political coverage. That person may mull it over and then engage you on their own terms with questions later. Dialogue is opened up and you both benefit.</p>

<p>It is important that you be able to integrate this information and contextualize it. It is very important to be a well adjusted and well rounded person when being a member of the &quot;conspiracy community.&quot; It is important because each of us is a sort of ambassador to the wider culture. Whenever we speak as individuals the larger culture and community is judged. Whether you like this or not is wholly beside the point. It is a fact. People are more likely to listen and engage your ideas if they are presented by a well rounded, grounded, and well adjusted person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s not just important for your social and personal happiness. If you don&#39;t learn to step back and analyse what you are learning critically, you run the risk of soaking up misinformation or disinformation as fact and becoming a literal conspiracy nut. It&#39;s easy to crawl far down the rabbit hole - I&#39;ve spent many nights staring into a screen clicking deeper and deeper - and come out the next day no more sure of anything, just more troubled and with more questions. To put it bluntly: this is heavy shit. You have to be careful you don&#39;t start subscribing to &#39;conspiracy&#39; as an idea and believing everything because it subconsciously makes you feel intellectually superior to other people who aren&#39;t &#39;in the know&#39;. Don&#39;t use words like &#39;sheeple&#39; and &#39;Illuminati&#39; because we&#39;re past that (not directed at you - just general advice) as a collective. Stick to things you can really back up with evidence or sound reasoning, and don&#39;t rant at people.</p>

<p>TL; DR - Keep yourself in check. You&#39;re not smarter than everyone else because you read something on the internet so don&#39;t act like you are. And not every conspiracy is true; as a general rule, use your head (and research both sides).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all really great advice.  Another thing to add is be careful about personalizing the conspiracy.  What I mean, is if you start to feel &quot;paranoid&quot; or thinking &quot;they&#39;re coming to get me&quot;, then you&#39;ve personalized it and you need to get a reality check from a trusted friend.</p>

I also find that, having sat with what I feel is a more clear (albeit sadder and darker) reality of things, I enjoy my own personal life moments with friends and family so much more.

    <div class="md"><p>Sooth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m out of the evangelical stage. I like the phrasing too. I&#39;ll probably nick it because it describes perfectly what I went through during my own little apocalypse. Years later I would look back on how I spoke and behave and wince that I was such a tool. A morally justified tool, but a tool none the less.</p>

<p>Now I ca hear people talk about things that are blatantly wrong and find myself uninterested in chiming in or telling them that their facts aren&#39;t straight. I pick my battles now. Haranguing people over things they don&#39;t fully understand just makes them hostile to you. Be a better person and others will seek you out. They&#39;ll also take you more seriously if you&#39;re calm about your discussions.</p>

<p>I can only say this as a person who&#39;s been in this area of thought for six years now. Year one and two were just horrible psychologically. You have to get through that period, though. There&#39;s no way around it. And when you come out the other side you&#39;re the better for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most girls could not give a shit about conspiracy.  A good description I&#39;ve heard about the difference in how men and women think in this regards is that woman are generally more preoccupied with tasks at hand.  How am I going to feed my kids?  Men are more innately tuned to scan for attacking armies.  It&#39;s why we make great partners.  Women keep us grounded when our heads are in the clouds.</p>

<p>You need to be able to compartmentalize your conceptualization, so that it doesn&#39;t run your life- (unless that&#39;s the life you choose to live).  Don&#39;t dwell in these topics.  How often to complete idiots argue stupid shit with you online?  Some people just don&#39;t want to think critically.  Don&#39;t force the issue- you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>When you first start exploring these concepts, it&#39;s like a bad drug trip.  It opens your eyes and shifts your perspective into this reality tunnel, but it can be unnerving and depressing.  There is much more to life than political agendas and new world order.  It&#39;s a real thing, but there are multiple perspectives on it, even as it exists.  What can be really interesting is listening to those who acknowledge, but promote it.  There is a method to the madness.</p>

<p>So be flexible with your attitude and don&#39;t dwell/ruminate.  If your loved ones don&#39;t want to talk about it, be careful how you approach it.  Girlfriends might feign interest and might learn from you over time, but the best thing you can teach is critical thinking.  Don&#39;t shove fear down anyone&#39;s throat.  Nobody wants to be around that guy.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I have these days, is being forced to listen to people discuss bullshit.  I know on Passover and Easter, that people are going to want to jabber on about THE PLANE.  I don&#39;t care how many stupid facts you have about the plane from CNN, you don&#39;t know anything, because it&#39;s all just managed information.  Disinfo actually makes people stupid, because they believe something that is wrong vs believing nothing at all or acknowledging that they don&#39;t know.  Listening to nonsense is trying because it can make you stupid.  So I&#39;ve found, rather than share your opinion- just pipe up here and there, and falsify untruths, point out inconsistencies and share facts.  Don&#39;t share your opinion, because you will be labeled.</p>

<p>edit:  I realize that i assumed you are a straight male.  That&#39;s the vast majority of people on this sub.  not being exclusionary, just speaking in general terms</p>

<p>i think its hard to find anyone of either sex you can really talk to in real life about these topics in depth but oh what a joy it is when you do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AP exam scores are a mixed bag from year to year- it depends on how much the kids are willing to study but the kids are doing very well this year and I expect good scores from my current students. </p>

<p>Teaching this course can be contradictory but this is how I see it. These kids want to go to college and have wanted to go for a long time, before I was their teacher. By helping them pass the exam and get college credit, they can reduce their tuition debt loads. I also teach a college transition class and have assignment where kids have to figure out the cheapest ways to get a degree at the schools they want to go to. This helps us explore CLEP exams and alternative ways to reach our goals with as little debt as possible.</p>

<p>Kids get to hear multiple points of view in class. While yes, they have to know a lot of Keynesian crap to pass the exam, a lot of my students think its garbage. As we are getting ready for the exams in May, many are questioning why the AP exam asks trivial questions about the format of congressional organization but doesn&#39;t ask students to contemplate the bigger, more important issues.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m telling a bunch of lies to my students. I let them know, this is what the AP exam wants you to answer, this is what I think, this is what this media organization is reporting, this is some history and now what do you think? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I know my days in public Ed are limited because the hypocrisy of the system is getting to be too great to bear. But I like being that person who will say something at meetings or in class when I know no one else will. </p>

<p>This week, My students had a retirement specialist lecture to them in their calculus class about how gold is stupid to invest in and people need to buy more stocks and bonds to be secure in their retirement. None of my students bought the message and asked him some super tough question about current events that he couldn&#39;t answer. I wasn&#39;t there for the presentation but heard about it through my students. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see how you teaching these classes can be seriously conflicting. From one perspective you are indoctrinating kids by teaching the AP exam, and from another perspective you are telling them thoughts that go against what the majority of academics think on the subject, which I imagine is generally frowned upon by your peers. You should be careful what you teach your students, your are in a position of tremendous influence and if you feed these young minds misinformation you risk severely screwing up their worldview and outlook on life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I try to be careful with what I teach the kids and I encourage them to question everything. I just want the kids to pass the AP exam so they can relieve themselves of some of that terrible tuition debt while understanding that this monetary system is on its way out.</p>

<p>I received the coolest email from a student yesterday who had an interesting encounter with her bank. She gave me permission to share her story- the video she refers to is &quot;Mike Maloney&#39;s Hidden Secrets of Money part 4&quot; which I showed to all my econ students.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Mrs.Y,</p>

<p>I just got out of a meeting with my bank agent because I had deposited about $300 in my checking account and for some reason it didn&#39;t show up on my account anymore and it showed that a second account was opened in my name so I figured
my account had been compromised so I made an appointment to find out what was going on. Yesturday I made sure I read over all of my mail from Bank of America to make sure I wasn&#39;t the one making the mistake.</p>

<p>So I went to the bank and I explained what was going on and that I wanted my money back and they tried to come up with some BULL that my dad had opened it and I got my dad on the phone all pissed saying that he didn&#39;t and then the bank agent apologized saying &quot;oh no sorry ma&#39;am I believe something that you bought from a store was possibly compromised and that&#39;s why your account has been frozen.&quot; (Yet I haven&#39;t used my account for anything in months) so he starts pulling a bunch of crap and I finally just say &quot;I know how the bank system works...&quot; and I went on explaining to him how the video said it worked and his eyes got wide and he asked me how I old I was and I told him 18.</p>

<p>He started smiling and giggling saying that he was at work, but if he were anywhere else he would have laughed his ass off in amazement. So he immediately returned my money (+ the money from the past month of paychecks) and cancelled that second account and gave me a new temporary card.</p>

<p>New found respect for my (super limited) Econ knowledge. I just wanted to share my experience with you!</p>

<p>Have a nice day!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some guys aren&#39;t interested in girls who think, period.  That&#39;s where the whole dumb blonde thing comes from.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s intimidating to talk to conspiracy theorists with foundational knowledge, in general, if you don&#39;t come from that perspective.  As with any political ideologue, we tend to have a strong grasp of a certain set of facts that make it very hard to argue.  And we&#39;re argumentative by nature.  If you don&#39;t agree with me, most of the time I assume it&#39;s because you&#39;re being ignorant.  </p>

<p>Most people just don&#39;t care about the issues that we&#39;re passionate about.  It&#39;s too removed.  First off, you have to care enough about what seem to be somewhat abstract political philosophical concepts (they aren&#39;t abstract, but they seem to be), and then you have break the mold of the people around you believe in.  I&#39;m a social liberal.  I listen to NPR and watch NBC- I KNOW the republicans are wrong, but figuring out that the democrats are wrong too is a sensitive process.  Not many people are going to be comfortable going down that path.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s going to be difficult to find ANYONE to talk with you at your level on these topics.  It takes years of studying this stuff to really understand.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s important in finding a significant other, is having similar values.  Beliefs are kindof inconsequential.  You need to respect your partner&#39;s beliefs, but you don&#39;t need to share them.  My girlfriend and I have different religions and political philosophies.  She doesn&#39;t want to hear about 9/11 being an inside job- I don&#39;t really have any interest in trying to convince her of that.  But she is getting better at determining whether a news story is bullshit, because we talk enough about that logical process and I think she&#39;s more tuned in to that sort of thing now.</p>

<p>no. but as above, it isn&#39;t what a man is generally looking for from a woman. i&#39;m always amazed by how many married couples seem to not even be friends, hardly communicating, let alone debating partners. you need a bit of luck and be looking in the right places. only one or two women i&#39;ve met could handle this stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people never want to believe/hear that people are corrupt or will go to great lengths and do stuff for money/power, most people want to believe in the good in people. You can never change their opinion or world view, just don&#39;t fight with them on it, give your point of view and nothing more, make a solid argument and come prepared with facts. Most people come with yeah i heard it on fox news or 60 minutes said its true, or i just read on yahoo news. Those sources have zero critical thinking content. Just keep being a critical thinker and enjoy the people around you.</p>

I constantly have to question if what I am saying/rules I am enforcing are good for the people and taxpayers of the district.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. My last relationship ended as I would talk about how misled we have been (particularly 9/11 and Sandy Hoax). She ended it as I was scarring her, and displayed weakness as I would let it consume me at time. </p>

<p>It is interesting, that with another girl I have a fling with, her father is into conspiracy related subjects (though not that of government topics), which she actually finds comfort in.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will bite my tongue. For in the end, it doesn&#39;t matter what I believe in. I am powerless against what has already happened. Personal bonds are more important to me than some conspiracy, and I will not allow them to interfere with my interactions with others again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The statement made by another user and yours literally fits the description of where I am at with all of this. Towards the end of junior year and senior year, I really got into the conspiracy thinking and still am (a year later), but I&#39;m slowly starting to realize the need to tone things back. I need to start giving facts rather than opinions. I also realize that connections with other people are way more important. I probably could try to change the government, but how many others have been burned in the process. Journalists and activists a like have been labeled as terrorist for simply informing people about the truth. </p>

<p>I would love to have the idea I could do something, but the chances are so slim and in the end will it even be worth it? Fucking up my life for nothing more than an attempt at change. The odds aren&#39;t in my favor. I need to just keep a level head, focus on people with the same critical thinking skills, calmly explaining situations, and try to share facts. I haven&#39;t been a very social person for a while, and Id like to be that kid again. 
I think what would have the largest impact on my friends perspective would come from them looking for my opinion. If I&#39;m quiet about a topic I used to be enthusiastic about, it would drive their curiosity more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this must be a very common problem for many of us. It&#39;s not just conspiracies, though. As an atheist, I cannot truly respect someone who believes in a magical creator, who is all-powerful yet allows unnecessary suffering. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind spirituality, I just have no truck with people praying to <em>something</em> that exhibits the behaviours of an evil psychopath, in the hope that this thing will assist them to, say, pass a geography exam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is possible that humans are innately superstitious - all cultures have their own supernatural belief systems.</p>

<p>Part of the human brain is attracted to a &quot;theory of everything&quot; that appears to answer the big questions, and an omnipotent but undetectable deity fits the bill nicely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying negative stuff about women in this age group is foolish. As a 27 year old professional female, I take offense to that when plenty of men in that age group are living at home obsessing over football and video games.  Men and women both have their own bread and circuses. Let&#39;s not divide and conquer the sexes. </p>
