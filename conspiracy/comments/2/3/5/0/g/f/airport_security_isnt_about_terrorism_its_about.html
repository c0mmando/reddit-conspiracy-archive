        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was at the airport this weekend, and this revelation dawned on me. I haven&#39;t done much research on this, and I&#39;m still forming my thoughts. I would like to start am open discussion on this topic. To the best of my knowledge air ports aren&#39;t the target of to many attacks, all I can think of, off the top of my head, is 9/11 and maybe a handful of hijackings spaced years apart.   </p>

<p>so why all the security, paramilitary patrol officers, full body scanners, ect... i believe its just to a-customize us to a near martial law style of life. one day its just airports, maybe in 10 or 15 years with technological advances there will be full car scanners on interstates checking every ones ID&#39;s looking for weapons and drugs. </p>

<p>by then it&#39;ll all feel normal people will think  &#39;of course you cant bring guns on an interstate, do you want a repeat of what happened in 2017&#39; or we might say &#39;why would you let a passenger ride with you without bringing an ID, didn&#39;t you know the highway patrol wouldn&#39;t let you past security&#39;    the water is beginning to boil, and we wont even feel the heat until its to late.  </p>

<p>sorry to sound so paranoid, and not bring any substance with my thoughts. This is where I potentially see the united states heading, with further travel restrictions, and heightened internal security. </p>

Watch it expand...we already have the VIPR teams on trains and other transportation, soon they&#39;ll have guns, and then maybe they&#39;ll even be at roadside checkpoints. It will happen so gradually that the majority of Americans won&#39;t even bat an eye, because they&#39;ll hype some random incident in the media to make you think that you&#39;ll be better off with them unconstitutionally prying into every aspect of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your point is more salient. Once citizens accept that it&#39;s OK for a TSA agent to fondle their wife and kids in an &quot;official manner&quot;, &quot;for 9/11&quot;, they&#39;ll submit to almost anything.</p>

<p>Much easier when ~35% of citizens work for state/Fed govt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think it was more about selling those fucking machines to the government. Kind of like pork barrel spending in budget bills. That and they had to look like they were doing <em>something</em> about 9/11 even if they knew it wouldn&#39;t be terribly effective.</p>

<p>That being said, the main <em>new</em> thing they can control with the new machines is money smuggling, which could defeat metal detectors but not the x-ray machines. </p>

<p>Think about it, they were already controlling the movement of people pre-9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thoughts! </p>

<p>Most people are unknowingly programmed emotionally with the &quot;fear gene&quot; and believe big brother will always be there when in fact the public can take tare of itself. </p>

<p>Sponsored black projects have been testing and studying the human mind for a long time understand how to control the masses through conditioning the human while sprinkling a hint of fear through the mass media news loop with endless distractions.</p>

<p>Just look at how many people in prisons within the US. Look at the attack on Whistle blowers that try to expose any inside hidden agendas. The news makes these people look like extremists when in fact they are trying to inform the public.</p>

<p>Conditioning (programming) for the &quot;hypothetical fear&quot; is the magic tool.</p>

<p>I watched Hawaii 5-0 last night. I realized its ok to show the police shooting and killing the bad actor on TV but its NOT ok to see a naked person or hear any bad language on TV.</p>

<p>That is programming! </p>

<p>The security measure aren&#39;t meant to protect us but to train us and scare us.</p>

<p>Just look at how illogical they are.  And they vary from airport to airport but they won&#39;t tell us exactly what the rules are (for security reasons).</p>

<p>I remember going through Houston or somewhere and there being a sign that said &#39;please put your ticket and wallet in the bin . . .&#39; yet when I got up there they demanded my ticket and wallet.  I was selected for extra screening because I followed the sign.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fact is that there are over 100 handguns confiscated at airport security daily in the usa alone. i am fine going through a securtiy checkpoint that causes zero nuisance at all to have the security that people cant bring guns and bpmbs on planes, the threat is real, by saying that  a few succesful terrorists hijackings in the past ten years as well as many failed attempts is not worth placing preventative security measures  is paranoid and not even logical. would you feel better if noone had to wait in line and everyone could just immediately board without being checked?</p>

It could be everything from terrorist plans, to a bad childhood, to hate, confusion or ignorance. there is always the possibility of a person to snap and do something bad and we protect that possibility by securing entrances to areas where there are large groups of people and potential for large casualties... pretty basic stuff, not really conspiracy just the most appropriate action given the world we live in</p>

<p>This is getting a little crazy if you ask me.  There are plenty of things to worry about with our government but this random thought is just that...a thought.  Because like you, the last few times I have been to the airport (2010,12, and beginning of 13) it was not militarized.  Took about 10 minutes to go through security and that was because I refused the scanner so they had to do a pat down.  I dont like the TSA as much as the next guy but this post I think it too sensationalized and extrapolating much too far with very little to go on.  </p>
