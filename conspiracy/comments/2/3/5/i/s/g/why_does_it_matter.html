       I've always been a tad confused about something with regards to conspiracy theories and those who are intensely concerned with them. Why exactly does it matter to you, or in the long run at all? If the United States/Western World at large is controlled by a global conspiracy, and always has been, why is it of any real concern? All that means is that the standard previous behavior of human beings is still prevailing today - its in our nature to exist in totalitarian systems (dictatorship, monarchy, tribal chiefdom, etc.) --- so what exactly is the big deal if we haven't advanced beyond that? Are you mad at being lied to and told that you have "freedom" and "a vote" ? Leaders have always lied to their subjects. All in all, being concerned with conspiracy theories, to me, simply seems like an escapist delusion - one dedicated to the fantasy notion that if we aren't already "free" then somehow doing something differently will magically erase the human drive to power and create a "free" society..... As people who regularly browse this reddit, maybe you can give me an answer to this; Why does it matter if your being spied on and lied to? Is something about your life uncomfortable and miserable that you need to blame the government for your failings? What is it that makes you so concerned?

       Human beings have potential. The human race has so much potential. Look at technological advances and see just what we can do.

      <p>
       To know that our potential is intentionally being held back due to the interests of a handful of sociopaths is enraging.

       I'd like to believe that things can be changed if enough awareness is reached. I believe that the internet is the best tool in history to provide such an event.

       It matters because if enough of us truly try we can change tomorrow today.

       Simply put this:
"Give me liberty or give me death."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is human nature to want to be free from being oppressed and being able to express one's own true self. No one wants to be a slave willingly and knowingly. We are the ones that know, and therefore, it leaves us wanting our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>

       Many conspiracy theories have proven to be conspiracy facts.
We're dealing here with the flow of information.
Knowledge is power.
Most nations put a significant amount of their resources into intelligence gathering.
Most people don't want to bother with such things, until of course, they get screwed by the con.

       So, you are actively choosing to believe in subjective, non-verifiable, cultural notion like "justice".... a notion, mind you, created by a group of people who were using it for the sake of controlling others; namely, governments and religious institutions....and on top of that, this notion is making you miserable with your living conditions? Those that are otherwise extremely comfortable? So in short, you are choosing to be irked/miserable/upset?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you wanting to rebel simply for the sake of rebellion? Because the feelings doing so gives you are better than the feelings watching a 50 inch HD TV and eating doritos gives you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, there is no form of society in which people could truly be "free". Merely entering into a relationship with another person robs you of freedoms, it is necessary to do things one does not wish to do in order to survive in this world. If you're never going to be a politician, political leader, or multinational corporate CEO, why do the actions of such people have such bearing on your life?

       Yes, because I have the right to choice &amp; belief. I'd hardly say miserable describes my argument, I choose to be "upset" because I can think for myself that illegal wars, drone strikes &amp; tax dollars going to oppressors is against

       As opposed to doing so while acting as though they have superior morality like some people, if you define rebellion as showing interest, then yes. :)

       Taking serious time to consider
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       opinions is frankly a waste of time and resources. In the day and age that we are in, with widespread access to the publishing technology known as the internet, its very easy to come up with opinions whether based in reality or not. We live in an era where the truth is subjective, so seeking it out is sort of pointless and archaic. You can't find the complete and unadulterated truth when the world is full of competing interests manufacturing evidence to support their points in an effort to be right. Pragmatics are all that's left and in my opinion, it is entirely not pragmatic to concern one's self with any aspect of government other than those that
       <strong>
        directly
       </strong>
       effect one's self (i.e. knowing if something you are doing or want to do is illegal or not).

       I mean, if we're talking pragmatic considerations, we should consider any actions whether legal or illegal, said legality is decided upon by the very Government you are referring to, so if I decide what's legal, &amp; they disagree, that's a conflict that involves both parties.

       Never being certain of anything must cause some measure of anxiety. In any regards, your explanation to my question seems the most reasonable, you are simply curious, when it comes down to it. I'm still concerned about those who focus themselves on conspiracy theories for the sake of preparing for a rebellion or some sorts, those who actively pursue and insist upon things being revealed to them because they are seeking some knowledge to use as leverage against a perceived enemy. In regards to those people, my question is, why have they dedicated so much time to a philosophical disagreement that they are ruining their own happiness because of it?

       I'll put it this way, I'm actually calmed by my uncertainty, couldn't explain why without walls of irrelevant text. My curiosity is what drives me, &amp; although I usually keep any devils advocate arguments to myself, I'll say that perhaps participating in a revolution, &amp; using the means as you describe them, perhaps this dedication
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       what brings them happiness. I think of myself as a Libertarian, so I can honestly say I do sympathise with the Patriot movements cause, despite the stigma, like I said, fuck the status quo.

       Most of our lives are much more than HD TV and Doritos. I sincerely hope that your life isn't such. It's clean air not filled with soot, water not tainted with benzene and plastics, a beautiful sky not clouded with haze and pollution, wholesome foods grown from the earth, full of minerals--and not full of poisons. Are you yourself happy and fulfilled by HDTV and Doritos? I expect not. Then why expect others to be?

       GMO foods are not any more dangerous than regular plants, neither are the majority of pharmaceutical drugs. "Full of minerals -- and not full of poisons" ... You sound like one of those people who has some notion of "natural" as better and safer. I hate to break it to you, but many minerals ARE poisons. Uranium is NATURAL. So is cyanide. At least half of wild berries in existence will KILL YOU. My air is clean and my water isn't tainted, if yours is, I suggest you look into moving to a place where you can be the luddite you always wanted to be, where there's no plastics factories or oil refineries and everyone uses horses to get around.... I hear there's a lot of those places in Pennsylvania.

       Not true. Lack of research does not mean it is good for you. GMO foods are invasive. The fact that don't let you choose whether you want GMO or not, shows that they already know what people would pick. Pharm drugs are usually more dangerous than we understand now.

       Hahahaha! I've worked in behavioral health all my life and the reason there are more cases of depression and autism is because up until about the past 20 years, almost everyone was hateful and adverse to psychiatric/psychological treatment. We still have this same problem today - people weren't diagnosed with autism before because their parents just called them a retard and beat them... and they weren't diagnosed with depression before because they were too afraid to admit what they were dealing with. That's like saying agencies that report on murder rates cause the numbers of murders to go up because before they started recording it there weren't any recorded murders.

       FYI, the smog factor in most places in the US has been decreasing due to state laws an initiatives to reduce emissions. Also, global warming isn't a thing - its climate change and the government you think is conspiring to cause it is the source of laws trying to slow it down - we don't live in China. As for the ozone layer - that's 100% the fault of developing countries - CFCs, the cause of that, have been banned in all of Europe, the US, Canada and Mexico -- its the Chinese government and other stupid developing nations that aren't giving a fuck.

       In large enough amounts that are actually dangerous for you? Your arguments don't seem really that strong here. You claim nature is harmful but those claims are based on people creating these harmful things from nature, and not things naturally found as harmful in nature.

       First of all... most of the things about global warming and effects of smog are highly debatable. Secondly, it is not 100% the fault of the developing countries - we had our share of destroying the planet and we didn't give a shit. Now they feel like its their turn, and we are all of sudden telling them not to do the same things we did... even though our economy highly benefited from it and that's what made us developed. So obviously they don't want to listen to us. It is our fault for not having studied it before we used it when we did in the past, and not all on them.

       The government would have no interest in putting people who do nothing  against it into FEMA/concentration camps. If REX 84 were to be enacted as a real thing, then only people who are running around on conspiracy websites talking about rebellion are going to end up in FEMA camps, not people who mind their own business and go on with their life. Here's a prime example; the Stasi didn't torture or arrest people in East germany who didn't go out to protests or try to escape over the wall - everyone who appreciated what they had and didn't try to attack the government was left alone.

       My last sentence is complete fact; I am an avid collector of East German memorabilia and have studied East germany at the university level. The very fact that you said "Russian or German" history when referring to East Germany leads me to believe you aren't very well informed on the subject of East German politics, culture and history. The Stasi utilized a combination of spying, imprisonment, and what was known as the zersetzung (german for "decomposition") technique to target those deemed as subversives; and such people all did something that made them get labeled as subversives - they watched western media, communicated with western foreigners, actively spoke against the government, plotted to escape, assisted escapees, etc. --- Governments never have an interest in randomly declaring people who have not done something against their interest subversives - for example, everyone on the FBI ADEX list had done something to get on there - it may have been small, like protesting certain government actions - but they still did something to get on there. People who have no problem with a government do not get targeted unless that government is based on racism.

       You said, "Everyone who appreciated what they had and didn't try to attack the government was left alone." This isn't true - but by your definition, you deem it true, you apparently believe that East Germans watching western media or questioning the wrongs of their government was considered "attacking the government?" Who do you think the "government" is comprised of? They are not all elite oligarchs as you seem to assume.

       You don't need to be part of the ruling class to live life comfortably; you simply need to not antagonize/attack the ruling class. We don't live in serfdom times, we live in modern times where its actually a lot easier and cheaper to make human beings comfortable. Like in East Germany, those who were supportive of the system were provided with comfort, despite not actually being part of the ruling class (i.e. not being in political positions, high ranking party positions, or high ranking positions in the NVA and Stasi).

       If you were a run-of-the-mill citizen in the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik), who did their job and never made much of a fuss, you were rewarded. You were given a decent salary (which could buy you whatever you wanted including soft drinks and alcohol), a free home, free water, free electric. You were free to go to clubs and party with friends, and you were protected from injury by free state healthcare. It was those who were so bad at their jobs that in a capitalist system they'd be fired - who were assigned to the dilapidated homes that had rats and had to use a hose to get their clean water inside.... but even they were able to get food and healthcare, they just had dirtier, older homes.

       That's true, and my question might have been worded inappropriately in that case. I am not really asking why people are curious, I fully understand curiosity, as I said in conversing with Canadian_POG up above; its those who have a rebellion outlook when it comes to this stuff that I'm actually confused about. I'm trying to ask if there's any group of people who are as intensely concerned as some of the people here are that aren't actively experiencing paranoia and/or delusion.... and if so, what is making them get to the point that they are at, why are they so focused on a philosophical position that they are willing to risk themselves and their comforts for it?

       I actually said that as someone whose main perspective of conspiracy theorists is via my work in the behavioral health field. The majority of people I have met concerned with this stuff were psychotic or experiencing paranoid personality disorder. Also, if you really studied psychology, you need to go back to school - because your understanding of projection is archaic and Freudian -- Freud's theories have been discredited by nearly every contemporary school of thought - the real route of projection is the false-consensus tendency -- its not a denial of a trait in one's self but a conscious recognition of a trait in one's self that is assumed to be true about others.

       Are you being serious? They can catalog every thing a man did. Look up how they found out info and tried to get mlk2 to kill himself. What is stopping them from doing it now or crew in the future? It has even come out that Barack was u under survielance pre-election. What if they treated him like hoover did to candidates? Are you really so blind?

       In response to some of the "why does a slave want to be free" responses to what I said, I'd like to say this. The majority of serfs had no intentions of "being free", it wasn't until the bourgeois/trader class decided they wanted to live like kings that serfdom began to end. A slave, historically, has been someone who was denied the basic needs of life; that is forced to work with no benefit from said work. Regardless of whether or not we are spied on, or our government is controlled by a shadow government - we, unlike slaves, are comfortable, provided we take a measure of what we have. Even the poorest of people in this country, speaking as someone whose been there and who has worked to help such people, have access to food (foodstamps and food pantries), shelter (homeless shelters, work programs, etc.), clean water (basically free at any public water fountain), some degree of medical care (mandatory emergency room treatment, medicaid, medicare). So, I ask again, considering you have everything to make your life comfortable and the opportunity to find even more things to satiate your desires for entertainment and comfort; why does it matter what our leaders do?

       Does a bird in a cage that has food and water, still want its freedom?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are like lab rats that get treats for doing its job. We are still owned by them. We live to make them more profit. We consume things that are dangerous to our health, because it brings them profit. We don't have any real choices anymore concerning real matters that effect our lives. We don't even have our privacy. You might be alright with living like that, but I still like my freedom a lot more. Many people have died because of their drugs, their wars for power/greed, etc. Don't their lives matter?

      <p>
       Who speaks for those that get killed overseas? In Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, etc? Can we be so selfish to not care about the innocent people and children who have no say?

       Who speaks the countries where we have replaced leaders with terrorists? Our taxes fund all of their missions.

       Human beings are meant to be free and are meant to create. Anyone who limits our potential and reduces us to machines that work to make them more money, is going to be our enemy.

       Not really man. They attack off the grid people. They don't allow communal gardens. They don't allow owning land without paying property tax. You are part of the system, whether you want to be or not.

       Tax slavery and wage slavery are two different concepts. You do have the opportunity, however, to rise above both of them. You have the opportunity to become wealthy enough to pay someone to get you every tax loophole available to the point where you barely pay anything or are refunded everything that you do pay. Just look at GE. Genetically modified organisms are just as natural as anything that isn't - we've been manipulating the genetics of plants since the dawn of agriculture through selective breeding. The only reason any GMO is bad is because of particular bad business practices. Monsanto is not a good company, that doesn't mean GMOs are all bad; Genentech makes wonderful GMO foods that are actually BETTER for you than organics. Also, organic farming has a greater impact ecologically - it requires more land for the same food yield, and uses plant based pesticides that encourage the evolution of more virulent pests (i.e. excessive pyrethin use leading to pyrethin-resistant bugs).

       So your solution is to chase your way through the system, so that you can continue to cheat the system and the hard working people like the rich already do? Do you really think I would side that? I do have a heart you know and I am not a psychopath. Besides this "become rich so you can do things" is what makes the world how it is now. It is not working above the system, it is doing what everyone else is already trying to do.

       Not true. There is only certain extent to which we can modify things naturally. GM allows you even greater freedom to switch things around, and we can't claim that the effects are going to be the same in the end. We don't have the research to make that claim.

       I do hate monsanto but that's not my only thing against GM products. First, things have to be well researched before it is used publicly - that's just basic scientific approach to new found things. Secondly, people should be given the choice. Label it. It isn't ask for much. Why worry so much if it is good for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a difference between what is "good for you" and what is "good for profit". There is a big difference between the two. Even though there is a lot of common ground, that doesn't mean it is the same exact goal.

       GM pesticides cause other plants to die and prevent all sorts of animals from eating it. That to me is scarier than regular pesticides and their harm. Regular evolution along with pesticides is expected because that's how nature works. They adapt to pressures of the environment.

       The proposed GMO labeling laws do not stipulate that GMO foods can have the company label for which company performed the modifications - and the organic food lobby wants it that way. Its in the interest of those who make money off organic foods to encourage people to blanket-boycott all GMOs without any consideration for the fact that different companies produce different products. Also, organic farming, even ignoring pesticides has a greater ecologically impact - it destroys more wild habitats by requiring more land for lesser yields.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frankly rather idiotic, the levels at which people ignore the fact that organic food producers are themselves linked to and operating with multinational corporations and running their own special interest lobby, just like Monsanto does.

       Yet, this is the first time I am hearing this argument. If instead of arguing against GMO labeling completely, they could have made it known that they just want to put in more detail than just a label - then that would be great. I have no issue against it. Make that known, instead of fighting against GMO labels completely. However, this doesn't seem like what they are arguing against publicly at all. So do you mind citing this claim of yours?

      <p>
       The ecologically impact of using old farming methods is not going to be anything beyond controllable. Secondly, there is enough yield to feed people and the idea of this "over populated" planet thing is not really based on facts.

       Then fight that part. Make it known that you want to put more information in, rather than take all information out. People won't fight that. I find it hard to believe that since you are the only person who has argued that before.

       Never being certain of anything must cause some measure of anxiety. In any regards, your explanation to my question seems the most reasonable, you are simply curious, when it comes down to it. I'm still concerned about those who focus themselves on conspiracy theories for the sake of preparing for a rebellion or some sorts, those who actively pursue and insist upon things being revealed to them because they are seeking some knowledge to use as leverage against a perceived enemy. In regards to those people, my question is, why have they dedicated so much time to a philosophical disagreement that they are ruining their own happiness because of it?
