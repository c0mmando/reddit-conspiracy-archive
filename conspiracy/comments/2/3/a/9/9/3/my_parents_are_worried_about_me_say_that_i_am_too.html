        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have had enough of being called a conspiracy theorist. My parents believe that the things I am worried about are nothing more than that. But I don&#39;t believe they are. </p>

<p>Our democracy and individual rights are heavily under fire. Our governments (I am Canadian) have decreed it &quot;okay&quot; to lie to us regularly and distort the information they do give to us. Hiding from transparency which is our only way to hold them accountable. </p>

<p>Corporations have won the ability to all but fix our elections through corporate sponsorships and have no accountability because of censored media coverage through a conflict of interest. </p>

<p>The government also believes that collateral damage during wartime is just a side effect.  They believe that they can use the cover of national security to destroy our right to privacy.</p>

<p>These our not conspiracies and are an abysmal representation of the way that I and all other youth believe. I have lost faith in the older generations ability stand up and say enough. This is OUR world not theirs. We are the ones who have the longest to live and the most to lose.</p>

<p>I no longer accept the slaughter of innocents in the middle east or anywhere. If it was not for our governments atrocious actions they would not want us to die. If it was not for Israel&#39;s smothering of poor people and disrespect for others cultures and beliefs they would not want them dead as well. </p>

<p>I no longer believe in the invisible lines old men drew in the sand to divide us. Whether you are American, Russian, Brazilian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Iraqi etc.. it does not matter. You are my brother of humanity and I want no harm to ever come to you. Our interests our the same: live peacefully and sustainably, have a family, a good job. As such we should work together at all times and never be at odds.</p>

<p>I wish to abolish the conflict of interest that all our news stations suffer from. I believe in a fully informed public. For when people are fully informed I do believe in their ability to not panic and make the best available decision. I believe that coorporations and governments must become fully transparent as to show us the true nature of their decisions and unearth their conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>I believe that the cost of education be lowered so that all people have the same chance at education without mortgaging their future.</p>

<p>I believe we are not given adequate options to live sustainably and are purposely given such few options to further feed a small group whose intention is to continue their profit at whatever cost to the environment or our personal health.  This creates my belief that it is them (anyone with a net-worth of over 30 million)who should surrender a third of their wealth to combat the problems of the earth ie: sustainable energy and transportation, starvation etc...If they do not like it they should have done something before the world reached where it is now. I make 50k a year and will never be able to afford a home in my hometown of Vancouver, yet i survive comfortably. Anyone who has 30 million can surely survive off of 20 million. 
The times have changed and I will no longer stand for it. My name is Travis Alexander, I will not hide who I am and I no longer accept the world we live in. Whether your left-wing, right-wing or right in the middle these our things we all can agree on.</p>

<p>I have made many mistakes in my life. Though it is my belief that it is not out mistakes but how we learn and recover that defines us</p>

<p>I have never seriously used a hashtag but I will now. My belief is every decision on this earth should be made FOR HUMANITY. If you support this then join the fight by posting or upvoting articles of humanity working together, sustainable technology, censorship and corruption. Post them to social media as well. Be it pictures, articles  or whatever with a tag #4humanity. We will let them know that the days of suffering and destruction are coming to an end because we will it and the governments will be reminded of who they serve</p>

<h1>4humanity</h1>

<p>Edit: I recommend as many as possible screen shot this. So if something does happen to me for stating this we can all say this is where it started. Better to be safe than sorry. /s</p>

<p><sup>Holy</sup> shit the above was a soft jest at what we have all been talking about. Jesus should definitely have put /s</p>

<p>Edit 2: I did the hashtag idea as a way we could all show how we are all for the same movement. TBH I dont really know how to do that. I guess dont put a hashtag and just write 4humanity. If you have any other ideas for us to show we all want this kind of progress pm me. Ill post them.</p>

<p>TO THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO JUST INSULT MOVE ON. </p>

<p>If you have constructive criticism on something I said or a way to approach it please post it.</p>

He&#39;s young, passionate about the truth and all you people come in here and start slamming him. Nahh... This kids good. Fresh and alive and looking critically at the world we left him.

    <div class="md"><p>I think my biggest criticism is that he&#39;s a big picture person with far too many pictures. I was the same way, and it quickly turns into an exercise in futility. I&#39;m all for passion but it needs to be concentrated. There&#39;s no construction to what he&#39;s saying, just criticism and utopian fantasy. Most of the people here probably don&#39;t know their neighbors names but then they hit the internet and they&#39;re suddenly humanists. I hate that shit. Like I said, talk is cheap, and the internet can be a great way to organize but rhetoric seems to be the only endgame and i&#39;m sick of talking, so I&#39;m just done with this sub. And I&#39;ll admit I was probably a little harsh about this particular post, it&#39;s probably related to everything I&#39;ve seen here building up to it.</p>

<p>Also, hashtags. Fuck them up the ass they&#39;re worthless. </p>

But the two-hundred-million they spent to implement the tax was already spent. An additional 1 billion was apparently needed to reverse it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably more that they are your parents than it is a generational thing.  Yeah, the generation gap has something to do with it, but probably not as much as you might think.  Depending on your parents&#39; ages, they probably witnessed many troubling events:  JFK, Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, Nixon/Watergate, and obviously 9/11.</p>

<p>Waking up friends and family is the hardest thing to do.  You have to remember these people know you.  They either know first hand or heard of all the dumb things you thought, said, and did as a child/teenager.  (We all did some pretty dumb things as kids, so it&#39;s nothing new.)</p>

<p>I have found that if you are really interested in waking up your friends and family, you must lead by example.  Live your life by the values you believe in.  State your thoughts, principles, and beliefs clearly and only if asked.  Trust me in time they will ask.</p>

<p>I had to change my frame of mind from trying to force people to wake up, to planting seeds.  Well placed words, intent, and actions work best on those closest to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the mistake (at the time - Boston) of being a bit too forward with friends and family about what I believe. Nobody could grasp the concept that possibly, in this case the reporting on the Boston Bombing was all over the place with a lot of details not being looked at.</p>

<p>It was people blissfully watching the MSM and taking in what was happening at the Bombing. Everyone I worked with, my family and friends - the only time they learned something new about the Boston Bombing it was from the news. They wouldn&#39;t assess the information they were getting and instead just take it on board.. It&#39;s quite sad really.</p>

<p>When I commented to my father about the NSA leaks about surveillance (I had just watched the entire 30c3 keynote on NSA security). He didn&#39;t really listen to what I was saying and laughed it off saying &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not a paranoid schizophrenic&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Falling on what? If the upper floors are supported by the 50+ floors below it which are unaffected structurally by either the fire or the plane then how does everything disintegrate.</p>

<p>Physics would suggest the remaining steel would support and bear the increased load, if a failure was to occur it would take place in the form of a partial collapse (segments/upper floors/walls falling to ground level). It would not be pretty, likely damage surrounding structure and the debris would cover a larger area - which I guess is why controlled demolition is so popular.</p>

<p>A large quantity of the structure would still be standing following this scenario...</p>

The same pattern holds true with conspiracy deniers. It&#39;s about intellectual courage and discipline. One has to want to know the truth more than one wants to maintain a pleasant state of mind in order to cross the barrier and see the world closer to it how it actually is. Along with the fear of an unpleasant reality comes the itch of not knowing the truth, only having incomplete evidence that indicates that the authorities are deceiving us.

<p>This tweet should have been investigated. Where did the information come from, someone had to be aware of the drill.</p>

<p>Then you look at the shreds of &#39;information&#39; that the guys case was built on.. The hysteria happening after the bombing; The hijacking etc...</p>

<p>Not forgetting the 5+ bombs that the Tsarnaev&#39;s had on them when they fled Boston. They stated that they were heading to Manhattan. The media covered it and then dropped it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally resonate with the feelings and beliefs you keep which made you feel inspired to write this post and I agree on pretty much every point so I&#39;m mostly writing this to respond to the title rather than the content.</p>

<p>Each generation and phase of humanity has its own themes and each individual has their own internal understanding of how society is organized. Fundamentally, our parents grew up in an entirely different world and only the most lucid of their generation will be able to adopt the themes and sense of adventure/new territory that our generation has chosen and/or has been forced to adopt. The rate we&#39;re being ushered through these changes at this point is frankly too much for many humans to handle. It is not easy to be able to handle ideas that range outside of one&#39;s practical and immediate experience, so to expect your parents to understand is pushing it. </p>

<p>I am in the same position. My parents were at the tail end of the boomers and even though they put flowers in their hair and smoked dope when they were younger and consider themselves fantastically informed and liberal and smarter than most of their peers(and they are), it is still impossible for them to really grasp how the structures they take for granted are corrupt, outdated and crumbling before us. In the states we are still sheltered from the upheaval so it is hard to see unless you look and are willing to turn off both fox news AND npr. When I start talking to them about peak oil and stuff they go silent. I can see the internal struggle on their faces when they try to understand the world our generation is inheriting and the changes we will have to make. It is just not kosher or germane to their internal organization of the world. It is a shame they won&#39;t be able to totally share our world with us, but that is just how it is. </p>

<p>Help them get situated for the future as much as they and you are capable and interested, because that is all you can do for them at this point. I am going to help mine build a food forest and improve their diets as much as they will entertain me and care to, and beyond that all I can do is tip my hat to them and wish them luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, who is this dog that is so insightful? I feel soooo old (2.7 time OP), but I have seen what may be the greatest covert op of &quot;tin hatting&quot; anyone who disagrees with the approved story get spun over and over again into whistle-blowing.  This has to be a time when we all work on pulling together, not apart.  I have made many younger friends during the last 3-4 years putting our feets in the streets.  See, Billionaire Peterson spends large to try to bring out a generational conflict in the US. The end result sought is a divide and conquer to cut social programs while keeping all the goodies for the 1% types. I&#39;m going to urge us all not to play that game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the &quot;boomers&quot; had any more control over the crash than the mills have over finding a job or paying off their student loans. They told us that NAFTA and globalization would float all our boats. What really happened was that the international capitalists were free to ship our manufacturing over to the places where they pay $10 a month rather than $10 an hour and don&#39;t have all them pesky building standards for their factories (think Pakistan). So bye-bye American manufacturing pie, and we become a &quot;service&quot; economy like <a href="http://imgur.com/CIzUSyg">this</a></p>

<p>But wait, has Wall Street got a deal for us to maintain a middle class life style.  See, they bought a bunch of pols from both parties so that they don&#39;t actually represent <strong>us</strong> anymore and got all nicely deregulated (think Glass-Steagall). They have also defanged the SEC and anybody that would try to stop them or can even understand their deliberately convoluted derivatives. Oh, and they have nicely corporatized the media so we get fluff instead of news (Is Kim really prego, OMG). So, they de-couple the mortgage loan makers from the mortgage loan risk takers and then look around for marks to sell their crap to, and then bet against their own clients. Now the hedge boys are going around and buying up the foreclosures to turn them into rentals.  <strong>Their</strong> house always wins.</p>

<p>As long as the boomers can use their homes like ATMs, like a frog in slowly boiling water, the pitchforks are quiet. They get the media to talk smack on them welfare cheats and monger up the fear of <a href="http://imgur.com/g6DaEBe">&quot;yellow cake&quot;</a> and voila, social programs including tuition, etc. are cut and the savings goes to Halliburton and crew in no bid contracts in places that you can&#39;t even find without a Google. Trillions of dollars, but damn those folk who want social security or a reasonably priced edumacation, amirite?</p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more. It&#39;s 2007-8 and the party&#39;s over. Our best-politicians-money-can-buy decide to help the <del>under water homeowners</del> banksters with another couple Trillion of our dollars, some of which is recycled back to them as Citizens United campaign contributions. Ahhh, the circle of crony-life. We now have the highest concentration of wealth in the US since the 1920s. America is richer with all the paper money the Fed is printing every month, but the regular folk are poorer. You really think that is because of the folk? They could have bailed us, but no, no, we&#39;ve made poor life choices. BTW around 16% of computer programming college degrees are unemployed. We make poor choices, but they deserve their ever expanding wealth? Come on, talk to the boomers, focus on the real issues a small bite at a time, and we can have a long-overdue conversation.</p>

<p>TL;DR It&#39;s not about age, we need to all pull together to beat the forces of evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree that whistleblowers get stuffed away, snuffed, discredited and so on. Probably more now than ever. And I agree with everything you say about the financial industry and how other aspects of society are wrapped up in it. </p>

<p>I am quite aware that generational squabbles are a distraction, but the boomers as a whole were naive to think globalization as envisioned by large governments and corporations wanting power like that would be a good thing. Plus, they were the ones in charge of those processes and the ones pushing the paper in all the offices and participating in those types of jobs. I am not blaming them because that is what their generation was supposed to do because I deeply believe in a teleological order to the world. Again, I am not <em>blaming</em> them and even if I was, at this point that sort of anger would be misplaced and a waste of time. But, a lot of their ideals did indirectly allow these sorts of corruptions and inequalities to develop. This is more a function of basic human ignorance than a generational thing because human ignorance is not bound by any rubric we might use to categorize ourselves. The reason I described the differences in our generations was to respond to the title of the post rather than to start an argument over whose fault it is. I hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>There is just as much ignorance and poor decision making going on now and in all the generations between. Most people are not directly responsible or ultimately intend to support such corruption, but by accepting and wanting the american dream or something like it, they tacitly accept all the bullshit that comes along with it. When we decide we want a mortgage for a big house, two new cars per family per every few years, big shopping malls, lots of toys etc we are nonverbally saying we also want a giant military to help subsidize the oil that such stuff requires. In a sense, those thieves <em>do</em> deserve what their greed earns them if the rest of the population is too lazy or unwilling to pull together to inform themselves and then change and redefine how life should be lived. Every individual is as powerful and important as the next UNLESS people are willing to waive their individual sovereignty which we see happen in a variety of ways all the time. At this point it will take a lot of force and anguish to reverse that sort of psychic momentum at work in our society, but it is a choice we have always had available.</p>

<p>tldr: I agree with you and I hope that is clear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also went out against Vietnam in my day, so the issues haven&#39;t really changed much.

    <div class="md"><p>Holy cow man, break that up into paragraphs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our democracy and individual rights are heavily under fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Name three things that you <em>personally</em> had the right to do (and actually did) twenty years ago that you can&#39;t do now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is OUR world not theirs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This world is for the older generations exactly as much as it is for the younger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I no longer accept the slaughter of innocents in the middle east or anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone does. It&#39;s the non-innocents people are worried about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I no longer believe in the invisible lines old men drew in the sand to divide us. Whether you are American, Russian, Brazilian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Iraqi etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have a point, but keep in mind that national divisions are not a new thing. They&#39;ve been around for thousands of years. And they&#39;re not just &quot;invisible lines old men drew&quot;. They&#39;re so much more complicated than that, with hundreds of years of history and culture behind them. For the most part, they&#39;re not there &quot;to divide us&quot; they&#39;re there because we were already divided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that coorporations and governments must become fully transparent as to show us the true nature of their decisions and unearth their conflicts of interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you have a point, but what about things like military tactics that rely on secrecy and surprise, or trade secrets that would ruin a business if they got out, allowing others to copy them with no effort on their part. (Note that I&#39;m not defending <em>all</em> such secrecy, I&#39;m just saying that sometimes it can be useful and beneficial.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This creates my belief that it is them (anyone with a net-worth of over 30 million)who should surrender a third of their wealth to combat the problems of the earth ie: sustainable energy and transportation, starvation etc...If they do not like it they should have done something before the world reached where it is now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Most</em> of those people have nothing to do with &quot;where the world is now&quot;. You make it sound like all the problems in the world are 100% the fault of rich people, and 0% caused by any poor person. That&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: I recommend as many as possible screen shot this. So if something does happen to me for stating this we can all say this is where it started.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh come on, get over yourself. Nobody&#39;s going to get you because you posted a rant on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit 2: this has now been removed from the front page of reddit. I hope all of you will help in assisting me messaging admins and mods to restore it so all can see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now this post has 86 points. That&#39;s not near enough to reach the front page of reddit itself. And it&#39;s still on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. In fact, I found it at #2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My suggestion would be to get out of this circlejerk. You know what the problem is about this place? The automatic assumption of a conspiracy clouds views and makes a lot of the people here absolutely blind for evidence, because if the government says so it must be lie (which is just as bad an assumption as &quot;if the government says it then it&#39;s true&quot;). That&#39;s for starters. I like this place for certain kinds of information that get posted here before anywhere else. </p>

<p>But that being said, finding a place of belonging and identity-building here is an awful awful idea. The amount of positive reinforcement of positions (aka circlejerk) is unhealthy and the historical and current understanding of how the world is and how we got here is primitive and biased, so there&#39;s that for a recommendation. People that make this a group of belonging have the same issue that all closed groups have and an &quot;Other&quot; is too quickly drawn (the &quot;Sheep&quot;).</p>

<p>That first. Second, you NEED to know the history of the fight against the system and that will open your eyes. You speak of &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re right wing or left wing&quot; but it does matter. It is a philosophical position that is radically different and the left has 300 years of history of rational, brave and committed fight to the system. And your cultural biases make you &quot;tag&quot; all the &quot;left&quot; as this massive strawman that the United States cultured has made of it, related to the Soviet Union specifically (which has nothing to do with leftist ideals and philosophy) and clouds the vision.</p>

<p>There are fights currently going on, locally to you, in your real life, and you have direct access to them. So get out, understand them, and join them. Stop fucking around in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> permanently reinforcing your views.</p>

<p>Get out of Twitter, Facebook, stop playing that game, don&#39;t embrace the fucking hashtag and the reduction of content to one empty little meaningless piece of shit concept as &quot;4humanity&quot;. Be complex. Be aware. Be active. Don&#39;t reduce. Absorb, and expand, explain.</p>

<p>No, your mistakes are so prevalent that it was easy to find just reading along. I can go back and correct everything, if you like. I noticed you used &quot;over&quot; when you should have used &quot;more than&quot; earlier, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of us get caught up sometimes. Don&#39;t let this shit ruin your day to day life though. Once you face the truth and start taking the steps you need to be prepared, you will not only feel better but you will feel empowered and in control.</p>

<p>These are the steps I have taken and continue to take to prepare myself and my family for the worst case scenario. I hope it never comes, but if it does, I know that me and my family will be much further ahead of the curve than the people that laughed at the idea that America could ever collapse:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your family and loved ones aware of how you feel and why. Explain to them why you are stressed and why you are taking the steps you are.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit your exposure to the dollar. The QE bubble has to pop sooner or later. Buy real estate, buy bitcoins, exchange dollars for other currencies and/or gold. Anything. Just don&#39;t be left hanging with all your money in dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>BUY A RIFLE. Do not wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Have food and water on hand. God forbid there is ever a shortage.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak out. If ALL of us continue to SPEAK up about and call out the FUCKING FRAUDULENT pieces of shit that are destroying this country, there will be too many to round up just based on internet chatter. OBAMA IS A PSYCHOPATH MURDERER, there I said it.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept death and pray to God. Don&#39;t be afraid to die standing up for what you believe in. They can take your life but not your soul. Whether you believe in God or Blind Chance, we all must come to terms with the fact that some things are simply out of our hands. Say a prayer to Jesus Christ or The Spaghetti Monster, tell your family and friends you love them and have fun and enjoy life while you have it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, remember that knowing the truth is half the battle. Remember that when a Whistleblower comes out and gives up their life to tell you something &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;tinfoil fedora conspiritarded&quot; that they know that&#39;s how the public will react. They know that they will be called a pyscho and a &quot;conspiritard&quot; and BE KILLED but they still speak the truth. And for that, you have to hear them out and listen to their stories and take them seriously. Because if you don&#39;t, you won&#39;t be prepared for the moment their words come true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t spying on YOU specifically.  Casting a wide net to take all the information is stupid, I agree.  But they aren&#39;t sitting down at a computer and going &quot;We need to do something about that kid sitting at Starbucks.&quot;  Now, are there specific people that they ARE looking at?  I&#39;m sure there are.  But just because you make up a fancy hashtag and claim you might be killed... not going to happen.  Are there people out there that will kill to keep secrets?  Sure.  But you have nothing that they want, are interested in, and can justify for them to come out and cut the brake lines on your car for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When america makes it&#39;s full transition to totalitarianism political dissidents will be in trouble... This is not theory, this is what happens historically..</p>

<p>Soviet Union From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>China from 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.</p>

<p>Cambodia From 1975 to 1977, one million </p>

<p>And on and on.....Why do you think they want all your info?. Why do they want access to those who supported Ron Paul&#39;s campaign? <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/ron-paul-group-to-defy-irs/article/2547261">http://washingtonexaminer.com/ron-paul-group-to-defy-irs/article/2547261</a></p>

<p>They are making their list of political dissidents. They want to know who opposes their divine power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For Pete&#39;s sake... nobody is going to start rounding up people in the US and exterminating them.  Our political system and society wouldn&#39;t allow for it to even get CLOSE to happening.  They aren&#39;t going to kill you if you supported Ron Paul.  All you&#39;re doing is proving my point that the people who think that the government is out to get them are almost ALL just trying to make themselves feel more important to feel better about themselves.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>Constitutional rights have been reduced to a loose guideline from the Law of the Land it once was.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TS4uk">http://imgur.com/a/TS4uk</a></p>

<p>Two thirds of America has been reduced to a constitution free zone. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security_technology-and-liberty/are-you-living-constitution-free-zone">https://www.aclu.org/national-security_technology-and-liberty/are-you-living-constitution-free-zone</a></p>

<p>Our once great democratic republic is now an Oligarchy. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/major-study-finds-that-the-us-is-an-oligarchy-2014-4">http://www.businessinsider.com/major-study-finds-that-the-us-is-an-oligarchy-2014-4</a></p>

<p>Every part of our country is now pay to play (bribery). And of course those who have rigged the economic system are the only ones who can afford to be represented. </p>

<p>The whole country is spied on in violation of the 4th.</p>

<p>I feel these things. I feel them at my business. I feel them when I go to the store. I feel them when I have to pay in hundreds for taxes at the end of the year while the biggest corporations pay zero.  </p>

<p>If you want to know how bad the police state has gotten just look here, or try to video record a cop <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/">/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/</a></p>

<p>America is no more. It is very sad and some can see through the illusion hiding our country&#39;s systematic destruction.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t stand for something you will fall for anything.</p>

<p>And again, history shows what happens to political dissidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the world has been led to the slaughter house by corporations. They deny any accountability, as they poison our water and air. They buy off our government, so they con continue to cut corners with safety and EPA standards. I am an American. I see the sickness that plagues this country everywhere. It&#39;s greed. It&#39;s corporations restructuring this great nation to benefit them, to make them rich. Can&#39;t say a single founding father would agree with that. Our elected representatives don&#39;t represent us. It does not matter who we elect, because everyone has a price tag, since money is speech. The interests of the general population are not represented.
     I feel disheartened knowing that there is no &quot;proper channel&quot; to change anything. I want to run away from it all, to a simple life. But there is no such thing anymore. There is no escaping this reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot more people who think like this than you think. People are waking up across the world to realise the things you have said, but also to realise that our daily lives are skewed by media propaganda, by the depressing &quot;economic crises&quot;, and yet all of the above are in plain sight. Imagine what they aren&#39;t telling us.</p>

<p>That being said, you sound not at all hopeful that how you think is recognised by anyone else. Trust me. I felt like this too at the start of my awakening. What else matters other than the beauty of the earth and the love mankind has for one another? Why should we need to make sense of these things, such as tax and government, Wall Street, terrorism? These are all here to cloud our minds from what is <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>For starters I&#39;d recommend reading up on Alan Watts - I&#39;m reading the Wisdom of Insecurity right now and it&#39;s helped me a lot. People have been thinking these things for years, but it seems only now a lot of us are beginning to wake from the depressed and ignorant societal slumber we&#39;ve been living in.</p>

<p>Good luck on your journey. There are a lot of us with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your cause was putting an end to violence and corruption then you are right, NO ONE would down vote you (and this post would be unnecessary). This is not the case. You don&#39;t really cite any actual injustices, so you are essentially saying &quot;I am standing up for everything good and reject all bad things.&quot; You have no cause and no adversity so you are manufacturing it. How fucking dare you complain about making 50,000 in your early twenties. How noble and oppressed you are. You have been working for what? maybe 5 years and you can&#39;t afford a house yet. Better destroy society and start from scratch because I don&#39;t want to live in a world where such atrocities can be allowed. Get off of reddit for a while and gain some personal perspective. BTW if the &quot;oppressors&quot; are actually taking out activists, you are in no danger what so ever. In fact you aren&#39;t even on the list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the same boat; I come from a military family and both of my parents worked for a federal prison. I can&#39;t get them to talk about or even try to watch a doc on 9/11. I love my parents and want to share with them what I believe to get their input; but their response is always &quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;
So they may believe to a certain extent but they are right. How does someone go up against the Rothschilds when so much of the population is disaffected or unintelligable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to insult you, just want to give you some perspective. </p>

<p>if your parents and loved one&#39;s are worrying that you&#39;re obsessing about this stuff (and from your post, it sounds like you are,) then you need to let it go and take a step back. atrocities, coverups, lies from the government, etc. come and go with each generation. what you have to understand is that there&#39;s not much you can do about it. why spend so much time getting so upset over something you have no control over? it&#39;s unhealthy. just enjoy the fact that you&#39;re pretty well-off, and move on. there&#39;s much more positive and constructive things you could be spending your time focusing on. there are people above you with more power than you, and yes they abuse that power. however, your fundamental human rights are still there. be glad you live in a country that has these. </p>

<p>YOU by yourself are not going to make any difference. Come to terms with that, and move on. You bring up a lot of good points, but this reddit post and you getting pissy and bitching to your parents won&#39;t solve anything. I agree with you. If you want to do something about it, get elected into local office, start a protest, go to the streets, go viral.</p>

<p>Democracy and freedom aren&#39;t really at stake. I mean, you&#39;re right, the democratic system is a bit of a joke these days but you can only solve that by going to the polls, to the streets and volunteering to support politicians who give a fuck. As far as freedom goes, I don&#39;t see any rights being taken away. All in all, it sounds like you&#39;re exaggerating a problem that has existed for decades now and spending too much time worrying about it. Go watch American History X. Different social issues, but the message is the same, &quot;Life is too short to be pissed off all the time.&quot;</p>

<p>also, it sounds like you&#39;re just bitching about highly editorialized articles that you&#39;ve read online. get off the computer and go smell the fucking roses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get something straight, you and everybody else has no right to say what someone with 30 million does with it, he earned it fair and square and you didn&#39;t...too bad!</p>

<p>Who are you to say &quot;Anyone who has 30 million can surely survive off of 20 million&quot; , how would you like it if I said &quot;Anyone who has $50,000 surely can survive off $20,000...if they live within their means and move the hell out of Vancouver!&quot;</p>

<p>Your whining about making $50,000 a year well guess what some people make less than $20 or even 10k and they get by, they just choose to live in a different place.</p>

<p>I can assure you decent used houses can be bought in Saskatchewan for $80k in a small town as my mother bought one a few years ago, so whats you excuse? let me guess...&quot;Vancouver is my hometown&quot; ?</p>

<p>My mother has lived all across Canada in many cities and was born in Ottawa but when it came to buying a house they bought where they could AFFORD it! She was not entitled to live in Ottawa and my mother just retired and most of here life probably made less than 30k a year doing cleaning work and you want to know why? Because she spent her money raising three kids and giving them an education.</p>

<p>I work hard and work 2 jobs and even work weekends, I lived in Vancouver from 2000-2002 and when I seen that house mortgages were out of my reach what did I do? I moved to Alberta where things are more affordable but I didn&#39;t come whine on Reddit like I was fricken entitled to live in Vancouver...perhaps I should have came and complained and whine about not being able to afford to live in my real home town of Ottawa?</p>

<p>Some of your comments I do agree with but for you to think you have the right to say what a person does with their earnings is a laugh, they worked hard or they created thier own companies or they were educated and made that money the same way you could have so quit your damn whining and get to work and find a better job or move somewhere you can afford!</p>

<p>You said it yourself &quot;I survive comfortably&quot;...if so then what the hell are you whining about others wealth for? Your like the guy that whines to me about me being able to afford a few more toys yet he forgets I work two jobs usually 5 a.m till 7 p.m and I usually I&#39;m working weekends while others are sitting back playing their fricking Xbox or whatever time wasting shit they do while I was raised to be a real man and work and quit whining about the other guys wage, dad always taught me if I worked hard I would be rewarded and I have been.</p>

<p>Oh my words are not an insult, hopefully it will wake you up to the fricken real world, I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s and have worked hard and get sick of hearing over entitled whiners crying about others success...even you making 50k a year you should shut your piehole!</p>

<p>I lived on the streets virtually homeless for two years because I couldn&#39;t find the right job and many other stupid choices when I was young, have you ever been homeless or just always had this sort of <em>entitlement</em> complex?</p>

<p>Btw I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s and suspect you must be pretty young to still not have a clue about how this thing called LIFE  works, get used to it...its a long road ahead!</p>

<p>I disagree. Yes there are problems and yes we face a potentially turbulent century ahead.

A golden age lies in wait for us on the other size, and I&#39;m not talking about no Rapture. Brother, there&#39;s so much good still in the world, and LIFE IS WORTH LIVING.</p>

<p>I too Hope for the best, but I also know this shite has been left festering unchallenged for far too long.
Honestly, I don&#39;t think it can get anything but ugly if/when it hits maximum density and pops.</p>

<p>Best thing people can do is to circle the wagons with their neighbors and or family, and work together when the time comes.
But I think people should start working that topic into their conversations, with friends, family and neighbors, sooner than later.</p>

<p>Just remember, even if you don&#39;t particularly like your neighbors or family...  funny how those thoughts will seem so trivial when faced with a common crisis/enemy etc.</p>

<p>The thing that has me worried most, is how all of these &quot;things&quot; that are happening now, are happening without much subterfuge anymore, almost blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>My guess is the time is short, and they don&#39;t care, because they think they&#39;ve won.  I hate that smug, obnoxious, winner type of attitude. Especially when they are rubbing it in my face before it has begun let alone after it&#39;s finished.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to Hope, Love and Peace, may they win the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that. I do not force my views on other people. But we are in dire need of uniting to fight the real issues. I honestly have no fucking clue what to do though I know it starts with recognizing we are all humans. Whether your right wing or left wing, right now there are bigger issues. They need to be solved immediately.  The only way to do that imo is a show of force, united as one. This wouldnshow the governments we are not fucking around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>:: MY FIRST BIG GOLDEN BOOK OF ANGRY PARANOID MANIFESTO ::</p>

<p>&quot;Lol, kidding, guys! Sheesh! Can&#39;t take a little joshing?&quot;</p>

<p>You have some really good points here, but the way you convey them is not nearly as constructive as it could be. For one thing, if you take a stand, then stick by it. Your backpeddaling is ridiculous. For another, you don&#39;t speak for &quot;all&quot; youth. No one does or can speak for &quot;all&quot; of any group. And, it&#39;s deeply offensive to say that the world doesn&#39;t belong to any particular people who are still alive, no matter how old they are. Believe me, it won&#39;t be very long before little shits younger than you are saying the same thing to your face; you don&#39;t understand now, but you will soon enough, I promise.</p>

<p>Work on it. You&#39;ve got a lot of great things to say, honestly. But you&#39;ve got to sort it out so that it&#39;s clearer and, frankly, not as crazy-sounding. Keep at it, because some of this really does need to be said.</p>

Sometimes is better to sit back and reflect on all the information you have collected and come back when the mind is calm. I like to switch from Reddit to Podcasts to escape the negativity minded people on Reddit. They are out there to spoil any good information. </p>

<p>Also remember that there are many people before us that know the same information and are trying to make an effort on making change happen. Do ever let it get to you when people just dont understand and want to place a label on your thoughts and actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Canadian, I just wanted to give my two cents. </p>

<p>I agree that we have serious corruption and problems in Canada. That being said, sensationalizing them doesn&#39;t help. </p>

<p>For a party that ran on transparency, the CPC could of done a lot better job following though. I think a governing party has too much incentive to focus on maintaining power than creating effective policy. (See: &quot;Fair&quot; Elections Act) Staying a majority Government might be worth going back on a few promises if they can get away with it. </p>

<p>I like the spirit, but you can&#39;t say right/left doesn&#39;t matter then suggest a wage ceiling. That is a highly partisan position. I agree that we all can acknoledge the problems, but ( I think it&#39;s ) the solutions are what most of us disagree on. </p>

<p>As far as your parent&#39;s go. Assuming your 23, I don&#39;t see why it matters what they think. I mean you should love them and stuff, but at this age you should be able to disagree without it causing resentment. If you are discussing these issues, it might be a good idea to avoid &quot;buzzwords&quot; like NWO, Fascism, ect... because sometimes they turn off the listener. </p>

<p>Pointing out conflict of interest, lack of transparency and mismanagement is easy if you have decent evidence supporting it. In my experience it&#39;s better for frame discussions that way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to lead you &quot;down the rabbit hole&quot;. I&#39;m still learning more myself. I just wanted to share my perspective because I feel it might be useful to you. It&#39;s encouraging to see other Canadians focused on these issues. </p>

<p>Communication is key. How you express something, isn&#39;t always how it&#39;s interpreted. As per usual; actions speak louder than words. (Words still matter though.) </p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem travis, my name is bobby nice to meet you. Now most the people in this sub are of a hive mind. They want to hear how right they are and be in a repiticous circle jerk. Personally I would rather us all not have any type of affiliation to politics or religion.</p>

<p>I am 35 myself served in the military and seen the worse parts of this planet. I have noticed something too. No matter what you belive or want or even think you me and half the world can&#39;t stop shit from happening. Some people just want to watch the world burn. They will do anything to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Everyone in the world came to the party to late. We don&#39;t stand a chance because it has too much momentum now. Best thing you can do is raise your kids to be free thinkers. Not conformist teach them how to interpet words in the instructions a teacher gives for an assignment and really fuck with them. Do the work but when they want a report about some famous person then don&#39;t highlight on the nice shit.</p>

<p>Really go for the throat you know. Also teach them never to accept anything at face value. Always question authority but do so respectfully. Teach them how to research things as well. Teach them to share knowledge and help others. Do not teach them to be a cynical son of a bitch like most the people in here that just want to downvote you and pick apart your whole wall of txt. </p>

<p>Teach them to be happy also. That is the best advise i can give.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows. Trying to be supportive is pretentious, apparently.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wrap my mind around why so many people come into this subreddit just to shit on people. I mean, I don&#39;t necessarily care about, say, &quot;Mad Men,&quot; but I don&#39;t go into posts about &quot;Mad Men&quot; to downvote everything and call people morons. I would have to be paid or be getting something in return to go in and actively piss all over things that I don&#39;t care about; otherwise, I&#39;d just leave &quot;Mad Men&quot; alone and go about my day.</p>

<p>The people who do that in here are either a) lonelier and lamer than they accuse us of being, b) psychotic, or c) getting paid/have some ulterior motive. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let it bring you down. If you&#39;re getting this much attention, obviously you&#39;re doing something right. The nameless, background-less trolls on here are just white noise. </p>

<p>Edit: Clarity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a plan that&#39;s an idea. It&#39;s like saying &quot;I think we should get the Chinese to fix the environment because they broke it&quot;. I respond by saying &quot;great that is a good idea now how are you going to get them to do it, once they agree how will they go about doing it and then once that is done how will we maintain and regulate our clean environment&quot;. And you respond with &quot; I am not here to be insulted and have no interest arguing with you unless you have another solution. Don&#39;t just shoot down my ideas.&quot; Putting aside the Nazi-esque &quot;the ends justify the means mentality&quot; you have adopted How will you get the rich to do it, How will They do it, and once its done whats to stop you from taking on their roles as tyrants? You are clearly not bound by a strict moral code if you think the ends justify the means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that. I do not force my views on other people. But we are in dire need of uniting to fight the real issues. I honestly have no fucking clue what to do though I know it starts with recognizing we are all humans. Whether your right wing or left wing, right now there are bigger issues. They need to be solved immediately.  The only way to do that imo is a show of force, united as one. This wouldnshow the governments we are not fucking around.</p>
