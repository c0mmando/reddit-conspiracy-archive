        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a few motto&#39;s;</p>

<ol>
<li> Keep the faith.</li>
<li>To thine own self be true.</li>
<li> May truth prevail.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m tired.  I&#39;m getting old.  I&#39;ve been around the block a few hundred times.  Last time I voted was for Ross Perot.  I supported Ron Paul.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned.</p>

<p>The game is fixed.
Many more are becoming awake, talking about my old fart friends.
We all talk about it now.
Customers talk about it every day...regular folks.  &quot;Everyday&quot; folks.</p>

<p>They are more aware than you think.
They talk about corruption and some are quite aware.
They reject MSM and look elsewhere.  Fact.</p>

<p>My hopes and prayers now go out to the younger generations.
I did my time.  The time is now yours.</p>

<p>Stand up and be counted.  Stand up for what&#39;s right.
Be strong and &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;.</p>

<p>Our country is going down the tubes.
Take it back for your parents and your grandparents, and for your own kids.</p>

<p>Please, put down your phones and get involved in your communities and home towns.  </p>

<p>Best. xo</p>

Couldn&#39;t agree with you more. I too have similar values as what you expressed. My family and I are generational homesteaders dedicated to serving our community. There are lots of us out her in reddit land and beyond. Just know that those of us who are doing instead of talking about doing are in alignment with your message. The old paradigm is crumbling and the new is become more a reality than ever before. There are many awakening to the values of the great grandparents. We must cherish the wisdom of the old ways and bridge the gap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s the thing.</p>

<p>And a current example. </p>

<p>Ukraine. It is pretty obvious to anyone paying attention, that what is going on in Ukraine is the same thing thats being going on in Syria - and for that, the rest of the middle east, and africa. The &quot;west&quot;, meaning central bankers in the USA and Israel, have financed a revolution in their country to bring them in line with the global conspiracy that I call &quot;debt slavery&quot;.</p>

<p>We know its wrong. We know that &quot;our&quot; government is behind almost all of the bullshit conflict that is happening in the world. We know that its all for the bankers, so they can enslave more people to debt.</p>

<p>But we have a powerful weapon.</p>

<p>DONT ACCEPT DEBT.</p>

<p>Burn your credit cards. 
Stop getting loans for your cars.
Stop getting &quot;equity&quot; loans on your property.
STOP PLAYING THE GAME.</p>

<p>You voted for Ross Perot.. So did I, and it was what they did to him that convinced me that this system is run by mobsters. You cant fix it, unless you want to kill all the mobsters.</p>

<p>The better choice. IMHO is STOP PLAYING THE GAME.
This will kill the system faster than armed revolution.</p>

<p>Stop getting loans. Stop participating. Your participation makes what they do possible. Stop it. Its better than a vote in a rigged election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect you and what you&#39;re saying but I hate when older people say this. Its like you&#39;re giving up and passing us the torch. Thats not what we need. I&#39;ve heard people from ages 40-75 say something similar if not the same thing. A lot of the older people also seem to have completely given up hope of any change at all. What we need is a united front. Young and Old. Truth seekers. Reformers.</p>

<p>Some of us may know how deep the corruption goes, but many of us are just trying to get a good education, good jobs and stay afloat (which no one can be blamed for). They&#39;re not worried about setting things right because talking out will land them in hot water at work, at school and in their social lives. </p>

<p>If we can make it the norm again for people to voice their problems with each other and with corruption we stand a chance for real change in our lifetimes. We have to be vocal and unafraid. We need to listen to each other and learn. Don&#39;t pass the torch, but do help light fires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After passing through the point of education and amazement  to attempting to educate others, to looking for a solution to fix government , to just wanting to take a break and enjoy the sights and sounds of life again i am convinced of one thing.</p>

<p>Absolutely  nothing will change unless we personally run for congress and senate (and president - maybe all three at once).</p>

<p>Cheering for the other guy and hoping one &quot;gets it&quot;and does right just isnt enough.</p>

<p>Gotta get elected and look the monsters in the eye and say  no  to them and form something else to resist them and bring back common sense.</p>

<p>Its the only answer.</p>

<p>I also think there is a huge group of people who if offered a choice other than 
1. Uninhibited corporate profit cheerleaders and
2. Uninhibited social experimenter cheerleaders</p>

<p>Would actually vote for you as they voted for the very first time in a long time.
I think there is a huge silent group of people who would vote for anyone who simply would   attempt to bring balanced restrictions of common sense to corporate monopolies and common sense fairness and income growth to people without a ton of wealth. You dont need to run on anything else and people would actually appreciate it if you DIDNT make so many of the hot point argument issues which are used to keep the populace divided  even a part of your campaign.</p>

<p>They - the monsters -  of course would try to fix the vote but the response would be so overwhelming that the fix would be so obvious that it would test the monsters and be very difficult for them.</p>

<p>We have seen such resistance on recent corporate brainwashings from the common person who is now educated in  the tricks of the corporate media that even without msm media coverage (in fact maybe becuase of it) campaigns of like minded people  would gain traction.</p>

<p>Getting educated and &quot;calling your congressman&quot; is no longer enough. Its time to BE the Congressmen and Senator.</p>

<p>Personally running for office is the only real way for things to change.
There are about 200,000 readers of r/conspiracy. Thats larger than the grassroots campaigns of most elected officialz by far. In fact we have probably helped get elected a few people who turned out to be not what people expected.</p>

<p>Among thst 200,000 there are more than enough to run for all the important offices and cross support everyone who is running in offices.</p>

<p>I think the new candidate credibility will be  a link to a long running account on r/conspiracy and their lack of prior participation in politics under any prior party or umbrella. I know those are candidates i would trust and vote and rally for. (i think Elizabeth Warren&#39;s success proved that and that it is not only possible but almost a sure thing.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I  hear you, sorry, i was in a weird mood yesterday and was almost unintentionally, just being a dick. </p>

<p>Back to &#39;losing the ph&#39;s etc&#39; ,, I agree, however it&#39;s <em>much easier said than done</em> and therein lies &#39;the rub&#39;! ... but</p>

<p>I think the transition away from our phones and fb etc will be an organic one, in fact it&#39;s already begun, as some people like yourself for example, are beginning to limit your use as you become aware of how much that use really is! And most of it&#39;s irrelevant bullshit. On a Ph</p>

<p>Redditing and similar fora excepted. becoz ,, what we are doing here is sharing our thoughts and ideas, we&#39;re not just circlejerking, here on, what is, imo, a forum where, esp in certain subreddits, quality conversations can and do occur, on a fairly regular basis, (far more so than say on fb or any other &#39;commoner&#39;s forum&#39; that I know of!) and this exchanging of &#39;ideas&#39; with random people from all over the world where we all can learn from each other things we may not be able to learn elsewhere. 
e.g.
a redditor was trying to remember the russian word they had been taught to  mean &#39;go away, piss off&#39; type thing, and a few people chirped in with &#39;half right&#39; comments, <em>and then</em> .... the Russians appeared! And were to be making this confusion disappearsky in the way only a russian can! And in the process a whole discussion about the various ways you <em>could</em> say &quot;go away/piss off/fuck off retard&quot; in Russian was unique and most enlightening!</p>

<p>Now where else are you going to come across that kind of shit, and it happens here <em>all the fuckin time</em>, shit, so much so often does some obscure question get answered by a master of that particular esoteric craft/language/country/yes he actually has two penii,  etc etc! that there really should be a name for it! maybe something like a &quot;nifty&quot; ... hmmm sounds good, like &quot;bro that guy&#39;s post was so completely nifty it was sick!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, this place can be cool as, so thanks for the input new internet friend, I appreciate the feedback, always.</p>
