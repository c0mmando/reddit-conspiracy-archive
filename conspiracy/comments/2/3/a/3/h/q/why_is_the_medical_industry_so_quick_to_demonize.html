        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/16/even-casually-smoking-marijuana-can-change-your-brain-study-says/?tid=pm_national_pop">article</a> states that it <em>could</em> change brain chemistry. Yes, this is something that should be studied long-term.</p>

<p>But when you apply the same argument to Anti-depressants/SSRI&#39;s it is different. It&#39;s perfectly OK put kids and babies on these without knowing the long-term effects.</p>

<p><strong>SSRI&#39;s CHANGE BRAIN CHEMISTRY!!</strong></p>

<p>Doctors have no problem prescribing SSRI&#39;s to pregnant women and children.</p>

<p>Known side effects for SSRI&#39;s/Anti-depressants:</p>

<ul>
<li>   nausea/vomiting</li>
<li>   drowsiness or somnolence</li>
<li>   headache (very common as a short-term side effect)</li>
<li>   bruxism</li>
<li>   extremely vivid or strange dreams</li>
<li>   dizziness</li>
<li>   mydriasis (pupil dilation)</li>
<li>   changes in appetite</li>
<li>   insomnia and/or changes in sleep</li>
<li>   excessive diarrhea</li>
<li>   weight loss/gain</li>
<li>   increased risk of bone fractures by 1.7 fold</li>
<li>   changes in sexual behavior </li>
<li>   increased feelings of depression and anxiety (which may sometimes provoke panic attacks)</li>
<li>   mania</li>
<li>   tremors</li>
<li>   autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, increased or reduced sweating</li>
<li>   akathisia</li>
<li>   suicidal ideation (thoughts of suicide)</li>
<li>   photosensitivity</li>
<li>   paresthesia</li>
<li>   cognitive disorders</li>
<li>   Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion</li>
</ul>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget how quickly the MSM is point out the every time someone goes postal at a school or military base it&#39;s always blamed on &quot;anti-depressants&quot;.</p>

<p>Why is there no war on SSRIs? There should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, the USA drug companies spend 20% on marketing and only 10% on R&amp;D, they also invent &#39;new&#39; drugs that they bribe Dr&#39;s to sell because old drugs have lost their patent exclusivity , the new drugs do not need to be better than the old ones just better than a placebo.</p>

<p>In Australia people on a pension can get drugs for $6 but the taxpayers fund it, the media trains us to look down upon the poor so we are distracted from the wealthy (who can buy advertising).</p>

<p>The TPP or unilateral FTA (Free trade agreement: Free corporate take over?) will force the AU taxpayer to pay more for longer while still being told to hate the poor.</p>

<p>Many of our politicians have admitted smoking weed but none are able to advocate it, left or right WHY? Stoners can&#39;t buy advertising but USA drug companies can buy AU politicians.</p>

<p>Australians pay money to (our politicians), the people who want to punish cancer sufferers for having the audacity to feel pain.My vote means little because in a two party system where both parties are paid for it sadly doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>How do you know? And even if they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll gain that capability if left alone... what gives us the right to harm or kill them in the meantime? Oh, and if being unable to feel pain is all it takes to render someone a non-human / non-person, does that mean we all stop being people - and thus lose all attendant rights - any time we go in for surgery or fall asleep? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly! Babies, even in the embryonic stage, are tiny people. Sure they&#39;re still developing, but so what? You don&#39;t get a free pass on punching a pregnant woman in the stomach, miscarriages are still sad, and you don&#39;t drink or smoke while pregnant due to developmental harm to the child, as you yourself point out. Nor (to bring things back around to the main topic) do you take antidepressants while pregnant, and for the same reason as above. </p>

<p>If babies aren&#39;t people - yes, even at such an early stage - then why bother with these laws and precautionary measures? </p>

<p>We bother with them because pregnancy = baby = person, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Have a good night.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t answer my question, but as to the issue of wanted vs. unwanted children, sex is a procreative act. Yeah, it&#39;s fun, but it&#39;s not designed without a purpose, so if you don&#39;t want kids, use protection or give up said kid(s) for adoption. You may not want them (and that&#39;s fine), but there are plenty of people who do, and even if their weren&#39;t, killing them isn&#39;t the answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Damaging a fetus -&gt; a damaged person is eventually produced if said fetus successfully develops into a person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, which is why we should leave that person alone to develop in peace and safety, whether that means not forcing the in utero consumption of antidepressants and other drugs or simply not butchering them via abortion. After all, a person&#39;s a person, no matter how small. Dr. Seuss ftw.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really don&#39;t want to derail this whole thing into another pro/anti abortion article; I think it&#39;s safe to say we know each others&#39; position on the issue at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To expand on the other comments here, it is a lot harder to patent marijuana and its derivatives than some specific compound. Also, if they legalize marijuana wholesale, that is dangerous to some existing power structures because marijuana can aid in creative pursuits which are dangerous to the status quo by definition. And if a substance with psychedelic properties is legalized, that opens the floor for discussion of mushrooms, lsd etc which are even more dangerous than marijuana because of their creative aspect. </p>

<p>SSRIs and anti-anxieties and such placate us through ruining our brain chemistry and forming a dependency. Imagine if people were getting blasts of insights and energized curiosity from their daily soma instead of it knocking them into a state of drowsy subservience. Marijuana and the other substances I mentioned are the opposite of addicting--the tolerance and mental exhaustion which develops from frequent use takes away the beneficial effects and the substances themselves impart a knowledge of the state such that the less you use them the more profound an impact they have. How do you make money on a drug that eventually elevates the user to a better place where they no longer want to consume it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wanna know what&#39;s really wild? Marijuana alleviates - or in some cases entirely cures - every single one of the side-effects suffered through the use of antidepressants... while it simultaneously serves as its own antidepressant.</p>

<p>You can get an ounce - which is maybe a month&#39;s worth? IDK - of non-addictive, side-effect free medicine for a few hundred bucks. Cheetos, Mountain Dew, and Netflix might run you another hundred.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a 30 day supply of the <em>generic</em> version of your average antidepressant costs roughly $1,000 USD, complete with a plethora of damaging and dangerous side-effects at no extra charge!</p>

<p>You do the math.</p>

<p>I have <em>never</em> seen anyone other than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <em>blame</em> it on SSRIs. Sometimes the MSM will mention that they were on them, but they don&#39;t blame them for it.</p>

<p>I think people are having a problem separating correlation from causation. A common line of thinking I&#39;ve seen here is that since a shooter was on antidepressants, then that must be the cause of the shooting. Taking into account the thousands of people who are on SSRIs that <em>aren&#39;t</em> shooting people, I think the more likely explanation is that the shooter already had mental problems or violent tendencies, and was given SSRIs to treat it. Unfortunately, they were one of the <em>very, very rare</em> cases where it didn&#39;t help, and may have made it worse.</p>

<p>I think we should be looking at the widespread negligent prescribing of them, not how they work.  <a href="http://alphachoices.com/repository/assets/pdf/EmperorsNewDrugs.pdf">The idea that SSRI&#39;s help depressed people by boosting serotonin has already been disproven.</a>  </p>

<p>But yet the doctors keep pushing it on the masses when they don&#39;t even understand how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/psychiatry-prozac-ssri-mental-health-theory-discredited.html">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/psychiatry-prozac-ssri-mental-health-theory-discredited.html</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;A new generation of antidepressants—the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.s), including Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil—was developed to target it. The ability to claim that the drugs targeted a specific chemical imbalance was a marketing boon as well, assuring consumers that the drugs had a scientific basis. By the mid-nineties, antidepressants were the best-selling class of prescription medications in the country. Psychiatry appeared to have found magic bullets of its own.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The serotonin-imbalance theory, however, has turned out to be just as inaccurate as Schildkraut’s. While S.S.R.I.s surely alter serotonin metabolism, those changes do not explain why the drugs work, nor do they explain why they have proven to be no more effective than placebos in clinical trials. Within a decade of Prozac’s approval by the F.D.A. in 1987, scientists had concluded that serotonin was only a finger pointing at one’s mood—that the causes of depression and the effects of the drugs were far more complex than the chemical-imbalance theory implied...&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Despite their continued failure to understand how psychiatric drugs work, doctors continue to tell patients that their troubles are the result of chemical imbalances in their brains. As Frank Ayd pointed out, this explanation helps reassure patients even as it encourages them to take their medicine, and it fits in perfectly with our expectation that doctors will seek out and destroy the chemical villains responsible for all of our suffering, both physical and mental. The theory may not work as science, but it is a devastatingly effective myth.&quot;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>that are extremely rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I myself was put on Zoloft about 10 years ago.  I only took it for about 3 months before the side-effects got to me.  </p>

<p>I can personally attest to experiencing these side-effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>nausea/vomiting</li>
<li>headache </li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>changes in appetite</li>
<li>insomnia and/or changes in sleep</li>
<li>weight loss/gain</li>
<li>changes in sexual behavior</li>
<li>increased feelings of depression and anxiety </li>
<li>mania</li>
<li>tremors</li>
<li>photosensitivity</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess I must been a rarity to experience all those at once.     </p>

<p>It was at that point where I realized there was no happiness inside those pills.  They just made me feeling emotionally gray.  I was never sad, nor happy either.   That&#39;s no way to live.</p>

<p>Mood stabilizers have shown promise in <strong>severe</strong> clinical depression, but they should not be prescribed to the masses as a panacea.  Doctors should know better.</p>

<p>If not, then based on what biomarker were you diagnosed?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean you personally, but if they are prescribing a drug that changes brain chemistry, as <a href="/u/AnSq">/u/AnSq</a> pointed out, don&#39;t they need a baseline value first?</p>

<p>Many other medications are tracked via blood testing or other methods to verify their efficacy and that dosages are correct,
why doesn&#39;t this happen with SSRIs?</p>

<p>I call this diagnosis by treatment. </p>

<p>Nope.  I went into see my doctor about hay fever allergies I was experiencing and mentioned I was stressed out due to year end finals.  She recommended I take some Zoloft to help with my test anxieties.<br/>
There was no blood work or anything.  I don&#39;t think I ever had clinical anxiety.  They were just passing them out like candy.</p>

<p>This is my main issue with all this.  They just put anyone on it for any reason.  Got some test anxiety?  Take an SSRI.  Not feeling happy enough?  Take an SSRI.  Feeling sad today?  Take an SSRI.  Bummed out your cat died?  Take an SSRI.  Didn&#39;t win last night&#39;s lottery?  Take an SSRI.  Oh, your team didn&#39;t make the playoffs?  Take an SSRI...</p>

<p>I have a friend who was diagnosed with severe manic depression.  She would go from thinking she was God, to hiding under the covers all day.  She is now on Depakote and doing really well.  I think there are people who do need these, only when clinically diagnosed.  The problem is the doctors who prescribe it to anyone for any reason.</p>

<p>Human&#39;s are meant to have emotional highs and lows.  Trying to force the brain to be &quot;happy&quot; 24/7 is not the solution for the masses.</p>

<p>Just hang around a VA hospital for a couple of hours, or listen to the stories of someone who has. People on large doses of these drugs hear voices, see things, try to injure or kill themselves and others... it&#39;s no joke. </p>

<p>Antidepressants might help some people sometimes, but the damage they do is just as bad as the good, if not worse.</p>

<p>Never in the msm. This last one on the military base, it was the commanding officer who blurted out what the shooter was taking. But in the msm any reference to what the shooter was taking is always suppressed. Big-pharma is the number one advertiser for big-media. Thus you never hear about the dangers of SSRIs - ever. And you never will. If they started telling the truth about it they&#39;s be committing suicide - they&#39;d either go bankrupt or be sued into oblivion. </p>
