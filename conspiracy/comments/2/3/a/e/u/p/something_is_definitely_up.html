       I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and put this information out there for someone who may be looking for it. I go to Appalachian State University.  There's no military bases around here and I've never seen a military plane fly anywhere near here.  Well, I was in my apartment and heard "VRRROOOOOOOMMMMM......VRRROOOOOMMMMMMM" somewhere outside.  As I thought "What the fuck is that?" I walked outside on my balcony and saw roughly ten C-130s flying about 500-1000 feet over my apartment.  I'm dreadfully sorry, honestly I am, because I didn't get any pictures or video.  I had just gotten back from
       <em>
        Advanced Nutrition
       </em>
       class and I wasn't even in my apartment for five minutes, so I just tossed my phone and backpack on the couch and was getting ready to make lunch.  When I made it outside, I was so shocked by what I was seeing, by the time the 30 second window was over, I realized I didn't get it on video and I'm kicking myself in the ass because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It could totally be some type of training, but I've never seen that around here, ever.  Believe me or not, I won't benefit either way, I'm just putting this information out there in the air.

       I saw three helos within a ten minute window of the planes, but none of them appeared to be associated with any branch of the military.

       It might be difficult to really distinguish the two from the ground while they are in flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially its the same airplane, just one has been outfitted with firepower and countermeasures and the other is not.

       Its been almost ten years since I was on a military air base, hard to recall the exact differences besides the gun barrels protruding from the sides.

       Ayeee! Fellow ASU employee:) I'm here year-round and I've never seen that many, flying that low.  I've seen the occasional helicopter and there were a few planes that flew over a playoff football game but I've never seen anything like this.  The amount (between 9 and 11), frequency, and altitude was just very out of place:/ I'm not saying it's definitely a conspiracy or anything, it was just something I don't see everyday.

       I used to live about five miles from a National Guard base and still live in the area just a different town.  The amount of Blackhawk type helicopters that are flying over has definitely increased in the last two years.  I even noticed it before I became aware of this stuff.  Its very eery to say the least.

       I live near an Air National Guard base, and maybe once or twice a week I'd hear a jet doing a fly-by. You could tell it's not a commercial jet because it's much louder (I'm also near a small airport).
      </p>
      <p>
       These past couple months, I hear them several times a day now. A definite increase in activity. Also more high altitude fly-overs. I mainly notice them at night, might be commercial flights, but they aren't going or coming from the direction of the airport, so I dunno. Makes me wonder if they are surveillance flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, it's probably just training, but the fact that they're training at an increased level with air assets suggests they are dusting off the cobwebs in preparation to deal with the threat of an actual modern army, and not just Arabs with AK-47s.

        Since 1974, Robin Sage, the culmination exercise for the SFQC, has been the litmus test for Soldiers striving to earn the coveted Green Beret. (Prior to 1974, similar exercises were held under the name Devil's Arrow, Swift Strike, and Guerrilla USA.)[8] It is during Robin Sage, held in 15 rural North Carolina counties, that Soldiers must put all of the skills they have learned throughout the SFQC to the test in an unconventional-warfare training exercise. The exercise, broken into two phases, puts students on their first SFODA. The SFODA is trained, advised and mentored throughout the entire exercise from mission receipt through planning and infiltration. During the first week, the students are taught the necessary skills to survive and succeed in a UW environment utilizing the small group instruction teaching methodology. The remaining three weeks focus on their planning and application during Robin Sage. The students are placed into an environment of political instability characterized by armed conflict that forces Soldiers to exercise both individual and collective problem solving. A key to the success of the Robin Sage training is its real-world feel that is established by the use of guerrilla forces. The SFODA must assess the combat effectiveness of the G-forces, and then train them in basic individual tasks from each of the MOSs as well as collective tasks in basic small-unit tactics, while remaining responsive to asymmetrical challenges. Just as language plays a key role in all other phases of the pipeline, language skills will be put to the test during Robin Sage. During this training, the SFODA must demonstrate its knowledge of UW doctrine and operational techniques.

       I wouldn't panic. Two years ago, my friend and I found dozens of military vehicles, including personell vehicles and tanks, just chilling in a secluded empty lot on the outskirts of our town (our town was the county seat). Being young and voracious readers of infowars at the time, we fully shit ourselves and prepared to bug out if anything went down. Nothing ever did. Turns out the National Guard was doing some training that weekend. So don't panic.

       I live in the midwest, seeing a lot of chinook helicopters, increased police presence all over the city, have spotted 2 drones flying overhead in the past 6 months. (so much so, that I now keep my camera, a high quality super zoom cam, near the front door), is it training? maybe, maybe not, it's not like they are forthcoming with information pertaining to the topic. Not to mention the recent 'confiscation' of apache helicopters from all US governors, the increase of arms purchases from a wide variety of odd government offices ie. postal service and the oceanic division. Just all taken together, seems a bit odd on face value, and each sector involved is less than forthcoming with actual evidence based information for the public...

       Went to a football camp at App State a couple years ago, got to be the team that "broke in" the new field you guys got. Really, really nice area, ever been to trashcan falls?

       Anyway, that's interesting, although I believe it may intensify in the coming months.

       Same exact thing happened here a few weeks ago. And I'm halfway across the country from you. 
I was driving and about 10 C-130's were headed northbound at about 1000ft about me. They came over the mountains to the south, then lowered altitude and flew in formation above the city. 
We do have a very active military base to the south of us, about 200 miles.
