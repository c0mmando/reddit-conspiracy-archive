    <div class="md"><p>No, all races are effectively bleeding the system, skin color does not mean you are more of a burden to the system, that kind of thinking is backwards.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I was also very, very excited for the potential, but unfortunately any potential for good lasting change was squashed once this guy was exposed as an obvious racist. People hear the media spin about an outlaw cattle rancher and they could either feel like he is a revolutionary or a criminal, but now, regardless of how the spin is worked he is a blatantly bigoted racist. So now, anyone who supports Clive Bundy and decides to up and join the militia down in Bunkerville will be joining a glorified clan rally</p>
