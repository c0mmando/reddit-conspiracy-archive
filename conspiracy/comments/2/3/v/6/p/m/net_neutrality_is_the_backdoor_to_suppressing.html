<p>That&#39;s not an issue. Servers will host what we tell them to host. Browsers will act like we force them to. It&#39;s still just a computer, and it can be programmed to do anything.</p>

<p>We can still get communications out of monitored nodes. Domain name registration might be an issue, but only for a moment. Rogue DNS hosting will always exist. Plus, there are alternatives to using the DNS structure that currently exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst part is that kids who are growing up now will not know any difference from a free internet if there are changes made, so they&#39;ll get used to it and it&#39;ll become a &#39;good old days&#39; type scenario to them.</p>

<p>IMO It&#39;s really only going to have a profound effect on the generation who lived through the infancy of the internet when many didn&#39;t even know what to do with it, and it certainly wasn&#39;t as easy to access, download, upload or even share basic information.</p>

<p>I know for a fact my parents wouldn&#39;t even notice if the internet was turned on it&#39;s head. The service provider might inform them of changes via post or talk them through it on the phone, they wouldn&#39;t question any changes and instead would just work with it.</p>

<p>When we use the internet we are allowed all the communication we want within certain bounds.  We are allowed all the information we want within certain bounds. We are allowed all the choice we desire within certain bounds.  We are given all the space we need to complain within its bounds.  Notice a pattern?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Net neutrality is good! The FCC wants to  grant the ISP free reign over what comes to the end user. They will claim it&#39;s all for commercial reasons however in reality they want to eliminate the giant world wide communication platform accessible and editable by all. An example would be if reddit was cut to an x amount of subreddits and users were not allowed to create any content. Essential they want to be the only ones able to add content to the net. They want to turn the public internet into glorified cable television and news print </p>
