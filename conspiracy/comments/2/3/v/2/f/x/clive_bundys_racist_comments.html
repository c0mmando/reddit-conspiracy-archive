Obviously it wouldn&#39;t have happened without all those people rallied to his side, and now (conveniently) every major news outlet has published stories that paint Bundy as a raging racist. 
Like I said, I don&#39;t know the guy, so he may very well be an ignorant white supremacist, but does anyone know how to confirm for sure that he said what the New York Times reports? I don&#39;t trust the Times, and calling a rancher racist has got to be the easiest way to remove any public support he might have had previously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still can&#39;t understand this sub&#39;s support for this Bundy ranch guy.</p>

<p>Do some users here support him for being rich and being able to organise a massive influx of armed citizens to the ranch?</p>

<p>Do some users support him just because the fed didnt like him?</p>

<p>Was he actively trying to campaign against the government trying to liberate unfortunate people?</p>

<p>Did he do ANYTHING to help the poor and unfortunate?</p>

<p>No, he was trying to earn money and refused to give a part of the millions of dollars he earned by grazing on <strong>public land</strong>.</p>

<p>With the influence of the local sheriff, kind words from a governor, and the maximum coverage given by Russia Today, why should I feel empathetic to this millionaire rancher?</p>

<p>One &quot;thug with influence trying to earn more money&quot; against another &quot;thug with influence trying to earn more money&quot; is what I&#39;m seeing here.</p>

<p>I&#39;d appreciate legitimate arguments here in this thread and respectfully want to direct racist, adhominem, post-history-invoking args, doxxing, death threats etc in my PM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t followed this thoroughly but I&#39;ll give my rough interpretation.</p>

<p>How was his wealth gauged? His property is worth a bit but any old pioneer family in any western state that kept their land whose grand kids didn&#39;t chop it up for a quick buck to go live in the city has a decent amount of equity. He has cows but again not physical money and is there any reports on his calving season? The trucks and equipment any ranch has is decent equity but not necessarily money in the bank. In my experience most mid size ranchers are not rich in the sense you think unless he has oil or gas that is being worked on his property. Why is he considered rich?</p>

<p>Nevada high desert is not like Wyoming or Montana land. This is scorched earth desert and what little water he has access to is highly coveted in Nevada. Remember Nevada ranchers have not been friendly to the government ever, look up the three bombs that were set off in the Forest Service and BLM buildings in Carson City in 1995. Or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_war">range wars</a> in general. </p>

<p>In the late 80&#39;s the USFWS designated a turtle in Nevada endangered. Then in 89&#39; they designated the turtle threatened. The feds designated hundreds of thousands of acres to this turtle and started buying ancient homestead grazing rights on BLM land from the ranchers to further protect this turtle while in the background they were selling this land to the Chinese and other interests. Ranchers were not impressed with this fake conservation plan. He argues the feds are land grabbing and not protecting this turtle like they said and I believe that. So he did what he&#39;s done for a hundred years, he grazed his cattle in this scorched desert. He refused to pay these fee&#39;s that he always paid before because he feels they are not utilizing the money properly and I believe that. Now the feds are using the turtle, the fees, and these so called racist comments from an old crusty rancher against him to get his land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing wrong with people&#39;s perception of the situation.  Is the land in question is NOT public land. It is federal land. Federal land is PRIVATE. The federal reserve bank is a private banking cartel. Their banks are on federal private property. If you are protesting on federal property don&#39;t have any plans for next 15 years.</p>

<p>The second thing is the ties to china in this whole mess. China is coming to the USA, whole cities. Have you ever seen how many people live in major Chinese cities? Idaho has sold 50 square miles to China for $800 billion. To build a city to be owned, governed and policed by china. </p>

<p>Weather or not you support this Bundy guy is up to you. Just remember if it wasn&#39;t for the Internet freedoms we have the feds would have rolled this guy for sure.</p>

<p>So in a sense it&#39;s &quot;private&quot; to the federal government because they can do whatever the fuck they want with it, but we can&#39;t (well not without their authorization). </p>

<p>You should care. Because without those cows in the picture, this would&#39;ve been a non-event. You can deny it all you like, it&#39;s no matter to me. But this is the bottom line. I personally cared about his cows and their well-being. That&#39;s why I was pissed. Everybody had their own reasons for being there.</p>

<p>Many of those women and men would not have shown up in force to fight the feds if this issue was simply over land ownership and rich people. Sorry bud, but this just wouldn&#39;t have gained any spark at all without those images of cattle being stolen and tortured in the middle of a bunch of rednecks and jackboots fighting over desert land. People care more about the animals -  that&#39;s why this was all over cattle and turtles, not people and money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad that people care about animals, but my question is one that focused more on media and public opinion, rather than the reasons people showed up. We all come from different regions and idealogies, it&#39;s unrealistic to expect that we will all care equally about each issue. It may be more important and more effective to find common ground between us than to demand that we all care about things.</p>

Many records show that several groups of slaves <em>did not</em> want to leave the plantations they lived upon as slaves. And those &quot;slaves&quot; were usually paid in the north. Some were educated and led good lives, until they were removed from their land to be &quot;set free.&quot;</p>

<p>No, let&#39;s forget truth and say that all black people hated slavery, not one supported it at all, and slavery that involves farm work and paid wages is far worse than incarcerating black males and making them build highways for less than competitor&#39;s in the area.</p>

<p>A black male born in 1991 has a 29% chance of spending time in prison at some point in his life.[5]
Nearly one in three African American males aged 20–29 are under some form of criminal justice supervision whether imprisoned, jailed, on parole or probation.
One out of nine African American men will be incarcerated between the ages of 20 and 34.
Black males ages 30 to 34 have the highest incarceration rate of any race/ethnicity.

This prick got open use of land that IS NOT HIS, and was charged much, much less than what any private land owner would have charged him. And yet he still feels he doesn&#39;t need to pay. He feels he should be able to use public resources for his own gain for no personal cost. So, do I get to shoot up the neighborhood if the local bus service changes its rates? The guy is a fucking leech and deserves to be put in jail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you ignored my initial point, the controversy surrounding the word Negro. I&#39;m taking that as acquiescence. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect a cattle rancher to be eloquent with his use of hyperbole, but how does his examination of African-Americans status in the US make him a racist? Even if he did truly believe in the literal manifestation of his statement, I don&#39;t see how that means he hates black people. (if he truly believes that they&#39;re quality of life would be better under slavery, thats ignorance, not racism)</p>

<p>He believes that negroes are highly discriminated against by the system, to the point where it simply becomes a modern and accepted form of oppression. I don&#39;t think I need to mention incarceration rates among young black males, as well as the massive income inequality between blacks and other demographics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grazing fees for scorched earth that the BLM wants to sell to China with a disguised motive of protecting a turtle that&#39;s not endangered. He always paid his &quot;welfare fees&quot; as you put it up until the BLM started buying ancient grazing rights from ranchers under the false pretext of protecting turtles, then never protecting the turtles and selling the land. No that is not the definition of a welfare recipient. That is the definition of someone not putting up with over reaching fed bullshit.</p>

<p>He recieves no welfare check. Why you insist on labeling him a welfare recipient is beyond me. Not even my friend who is a Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management professor, who is very liberal, calls him that. Where did you learn this from? I&#39;m curious.</p>

<p>Was this the comment that caused you to label me a racist? See how I put whites in with blacks and brought the point together that both abuse the system and the system promotes the abuse. The guy is right that blacks and whites have forgotten what work is. Good old fashioned hard days work with an ice cold beer at the end of the day. He drives the point home by explaining that he does not want to attach himself to the teat of the system or obey unjust laws that are thinly veiled real estate takeovers. He tried to explain in his old fashioned ways that we depend to much on the system and not enough of ourselves. Why can&#39;t you understand that? Why try to label me a racist because I agree with his out of context quote? </p>

<p>No, US laws say you have the right to do any thing, EXCEPT where the laws defined what and how Government can regulate.</p>

<p>If you think you know the &quot;correct&quot; opinion, I guess you could logically stand behind limiting allowable speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just gave an example to better illustrate my opinion. You fell back on something like &quot;You&#39;re being emotional, so your point is moot. I&#39;m not emotional, so I&#39;m right&quot; kinda argument, which can be argued as in itself an emotional response.</p>

<p>I did not mean to say hate speech should be violently curtailed and silenced. You speak what most would perceive as hate speech, and I call you out on your racist, bigoted and ass-backwards opinion. Just as you have the right to your racist opinions, we have the right to insult and mock you for it.</p>

<p>We are both exercising our right to free speech here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making stuff up. I haven&#39;t said anything remotely racist.  I have at no point said &quot;I&#39;m right&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re argument was based completely on emotion.</p>

<p>It seems like you don&#39;t have anything to say, but you&#39;re more then welcome to continue exercising you&#39;re free speech. And just as in your emotionally charged hypothetical example, I don&#39;t really care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a 2 day old account somehow makes my points invalid? You can keep using your account for years and have people analyse behavioral patterns when you accidentally step on the wrong toe, to feel validated by virtue of account age. I&#39;d rather be called a shill.</p>

<p>It was you who brought up increasingly off topic points in this thread and now its so offtopic, its a general discussion on who&#39;s more wrong. I tried answering you, but now I feel I&#39;ve replied you enough.</p>
