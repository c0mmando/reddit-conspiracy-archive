    <div class="md"><p>There is no longer doubt that the chemtrails are happening.</p>

<p>Aluminum Oxide and Barium salts are sprayed regularly into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a very long list of highly relevant articles, powerful in themselves showing  the use of chemicals for adjusting the albedo of the earth, for signaling and communications beyond the horizon and for other purposes..</p>

<p>This link below should rate highly on <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a>, but  there&#39;s a rule that says nothing from this sub is ever allowed there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1znsw5/what_hard_evidence_can_i_use_to_show_chemtrails/cfvftzg">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1znsw5/what_hard_evidence_can_i_use_to_show_chemtrails/cfvftzg</a></p>

<p>Chemtrails were recently discussed at the U.N. by Rosalind Peterson.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5is16A8pfw&amp;amp;feature=share">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5is16A8pfw&amp;amp;feature=share</a></p>

<p>IPCC warns not to stop chemtrails, aka ‘solar radiation management’
<a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/11/12/ipcc-warns-not-to-stop-chemtrails-aka-solar-radiation-management/">http://nsnbc.me/2013/11/12/ipcc-warns-not-to-stop-chemtrails-aka-solar-radiation-management/</a></p>

<p>The reason they are important is that what goes up must come down .</p>

<p>When the Barium salts come down they are suspected of causing extra cases of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chronic barium intoxication disrupts sulphated proteoglycan synthesis: a hypothesis for the origins of multiple sclerosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from the use of Ba as an atmospheric aerosol spray for enhancing/refracting the signalling of radio/radar waves along military jet flight paths</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082100">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082100</a></p>

<p>The reason it is bad when Aluminum Oxide comes down is that it migrates to the human pituitary gland where it is suspected of being a cause of  Alzheimer&#39;s Disease.</p>

<p>One important piece of evidence that this is the case is that Alzheimer&#39;s Disease has recently become the third most common killer in the U.S. behind only cancer and heart disease.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/alzheimers-research_n_4905465.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/alzheimers-research_n_4905465.html</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>Oh, and for  making the world a very very dismal ugly  place where the sky is obscured by a filthy looking grey/brown haze with greasy looking sun dogs.</p>

<p>It is idiotic because the aluminum is supposed to help stop global warming by doing the very thing that causes warming. It coats the sky with a warming chemical. </p>

<p>Aluminum oxide is not particularly reflective and the particles are not oriented in any particular direction so that it just ends up being metal powder heating up in the sun light </p>

<p>Rather than reflecting heat away as it is meant to do, aluminum oxide  traps it.</p>

<p>Rather than mitigating warming it traps heat in the same way they say they claim to be avoiding.</p>

<p>They say they  don&#39;t want the sky coated with life giving (for plants) co2 so they are &#39;fixing&#39; that problem by coating the sky with a life killing coating of aluminum oxide and barium.</p>

<p>I think it not bad, it&#39;s insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading on here a couple days ago about how to spot the difference between contrails and chemtrails. The way it was explained was that contrails form farther behind a plane due to heat from the exhaust causing water vapors to form and quickly disappearing, where chemtrails are closer to the wings due to the sprayers location on the wings and last for hours as they spread out across the sky. I am no expert but it seems logcal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah sorry I misread what you were saying. Yes, I agree. It&#39;s frustrating that people won&#39;t believe anything regarding chemtrails yet I&#39;ve seen many news reports and articles recently about how scientists want to use geoengineering to control the weather and block the sun. I&#39;m like, HELLO THEY ARE ALREADY DOING THAT!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geoengineering is called geoengineering by all but the scientifically illiterate. &#39;Chemtrails&#39; is used specifically to describe the long white clouds, as in &quot;Look up, they&#39;re spraying again today&quot;. Chemtrail believers want you to make the connection because it gives their claims some credibility. They&#39;ll show you evidence for geoengineering and then claim it proves chemtrails are real. But if you read the evidence they offer, it actually disproves their claim. Solar radiation management is done at 80,000 feet, miles above where ordinary aircraft can flay. The so-called &#39;chemtrails&#39; they insist you stare at are in the 23-40,000 feet range and have nothing to do with geoengineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My stock answer:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy into chemtrails. People say they&#39;ve only been happening in the last 20 years but I remember them from my childhood, and there are plenty of pictures on the Internet of <a href="http://depletedcranium.com/the-realities-of-contrails/">World War II bombers</a> turning the sky white with persistent contrails over France and Germany. Back in 1944 these contrails were a serious problem for strategic air command. They pointed like huge arrows in the sky at the incoming bombers.</p>

<p>In the past 30 years there has been an <a href="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/59/543t.jpg">explosion</a> in budget passenger and freight air traffic with 7  to 12 percent year-on increases. Where once there might have been one or two contrails there are now dozens which merge to cover the whole sky in a persistent artificial cloud. This alone is a very bad thing. The reduction in sunlight reaching the ground is having an effect on plants and the cloud is  trapping the heat and upsetting weather patterns. If you understand anything about chaos theory you will realise that even the slightest tinkering with the weather can lead to devastating and unpredictable results. </p>

<p>There is a simple scientific explanation for the trails you see criss-crossing the skies. They are plumes of ice which are left when a jetliner burns fuel in a cold wet atmosphere. A large 20 mile long contrail may contain several thousand tons of ice and there isn&#39;t a plane ever built that could carry that amount of any substance to that height in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. </p>

<p>Water is an amazing substance with some unique properties which defy logic. It is important to realise that water does not freeze at zero centigrade. It will freeze at any temperature from zero degrees down to minus 48 (zero degrees is defined as the point where pure frozen water melts, not freezes). Suspended in air it can co-exist as vapour, liquid, and solid simultaneously. Liquid water droplets, ice crystals, and invisible water vapour (cold steam) are found together in clouds where the temperature is minus 40 (centigrade or Fahrenheit; it&#39;s the temperature where they both agree). Even clear air will contain a lot of sub-zero water vapour. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>What nobody in the chemtrails camp seems able to do is to explain why and how they are happening. Just that &quot;they are&quot; and that it should be &quot;obvious&quot; to anybody who needs to &quot;look up&quot; in the sky (And if you don&#39;t see what they are seeing you are &quot;sheeple&quot; that needs to &quot;wake up&quot;,  or you are stupid, or you are a government shill). If it&#39;s being done for rainmaking then &quot;they&quot; picked a peculiar time and place to do it earlier last year. After the wettest winter on record in Southern England, why would anybody want to make more rain when the rivers and reservoirs were already bursting their banks? If it&#39;s for some form of nefarious mind or population control then &quot;they&quot; are doing it to themselves and their families as much as to us. Where is the logic in that? Could it be a benign program to combat global warming? Probably not because that kind of seeding needs to take place in the stratosphere, way above the height that commercial airliners fly at except over the poles, where it starts at 30,000 feet. The theory that it is used in conjunction with HAARP to create tornadoes and earthquakes is interesting, but again there is no solid evidence – just speculation.</p>

<p>&#39;How?&#39; also goes unanswered. If commercial jetliners are being loaded up with toxic chemicals to spray behind them as they fly then it involves a conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of  people worldwide who own, fly, refuel, maintain, and design aeroplanes. With all those people and all this time do you think that not one person would stand up and blow the whistle? How many tons of chemicals would it take to create a 20 mile long trail across the sky? Where is it stored on the aircraft, and how is it dispersed? How is it replenished? Who pays for it? Who decides what days are going to be &#39;Spray Days&#39;? Are the pilots in on the plot, or is the spraying done automatically or controlled remotely? How do crews account for the weight discrepancy when takeoff weight is such an issue that easyJet are disciplining pilots who land with more than 100 kilos of fuel above their emergency minimum? And possibly the most basic question: Why not just do the spraying at night when nobody can see it? </p>

<p>If you are an evil government wanting to dump a chemical agent to the population there are far easier, cheaper, and more precise ways of doing it; the Syrians just weld a calor gas cylinder to the front of an artillery rocket and fill it with sarin. If you are pumping chemicals into the jet stream at 30,000 feet over Europe, which country, approximately, do you think they will come down to earth in?</p>

<p>And who are the &quot;they&quot; that are doing it? The illuminati? The lizard people? Reverse vampires? The questions go on and on and never lead to any answers – just more questions.</p>

<p>All of these conspiracy theories could be true, but there&#39;s actually no evidence to support any of them. What evidence is offered can often be traced in a big circle straight back to where it originated in the mind of a another conspiracy theorist, quoted and repeated until it takes on a life of its own. No matter how many times they get debunked, some myths just refused to die, such as the &#39;secret&#39; photos of <a href="http://metabunk.org/threads/debunked-chemtrail-plane-interior-ballast-barrels.661/">chemical tanks</a>  on board aircraft. Just because there&#39;s 100, or 1000 people claiming the same thing over and over doesn&#39;t make it the truth.</p>

<p>Nobody is doubting that <a href="http://englishrussia.com/2013/05/13/moving-clouds-away/">geo-engineering</a> is taking place. The Americans used it during the Vietnam war to extend the monsoons and flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  The Chinese use it extensively to control rainfall and it was used during the Beijing Olympics to target rain on the capital to help clear the smog. But it was done with specially modified aircraft, rockets and artillery, not commercial airliners flying at 39,000 feet in clear blue skies. There are numerous patents for different uses and methods of geoengineering, but no evidence for most of these ideas being taken beyond a proof of concept. Recent research into using a reflective heat shield to combat global warming, for instance, suggests that it may actually make things worse.</p>

<p>Chemtrail believers claim that raised levels of aluminium and barium are evidence for artificial spraying, but these are chemicals naturally found in the environment and their raised levels can be explained by mining and <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nKulgztuzL8C&amp;amp;pg=PA408&amp;amp;lpg=PA408&amp;amp;dq=barium+in+atmosphere+explained+by+fossil+fuels&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=QRZQafAhXq&amp;amp;sig=f1_YmX9r_sJap1jvBvdLlMjrM84&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Cq1kUvrFIYPA0QWftYGwBA&amp;amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=barium%20in%20atmosphere%20explained%20by%20fossil%20fuels&amp;amp;f=false">fossil fuel burning</a>. Nobody has ever presented a sample of a &#39;chemtrail&#39; taken directly from behind an alleged spraying aircraft – or if they have they quietly forgot about it when the results came back as &quot;water with a tiny amount of soot&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to amaze and scare your chemtrail believing friends by predicting &quot;spray days&quot; then  get hold of the weather forecast for your area. The &quot;persistent chemtrails&quot; will appear like magic just ahead of an approaching cold front. The more you know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say geo engineering is taking place at 80,000 feet but somehow you claim there is a 39,000 feet magical barrier in which chemtrails can not penetrate and you claim that spraying is impossible to occur below that level. That is bullshit and you know it is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SRM will need to take place at about 80,000 feet. Airliners cruise at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. Contrails occur at 23,000 and above. Airliners cannot fly higher than about 50,000 feet. So it&#39;s obvious that specialised aircraft such as modified U-2 spyplanes will be needed to carry out SRM spraying if and when it moves past the experimental stage. Equally obvious is that the contrails at 23,000+ feet cannot be part of SRM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I say to you, why can chemicals sprayed at 80,000 not penetrate this magical barrier and reach the ground?  Chemtrails can be sprayed at any altitude.</p>

<p>I spayed chemicals on weeds today and was only at an altitude of 3 feet above the ground. Your accurate scientific proof is nothing more than bullshit disinformation. </p>

<p>Just yesterday chemtrails coated the skys in the eastern US to intensify a storm front and our local forums took note of the occurrence. </p>

<p>We are talking about two different species, contrails and chemtrails are different in appearance. Americans are noticing the difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the <a href="http://www.skyderalert.com/research/index/">research</a> on SRM Like I have done. That is a site highly critical of geoengineering (like me) but doesn&#39;t try to conflate it with chemtrails (like you). The point of injecting the reflector at such a high altitude is that it will stay up there. </p>

<p>Your bit of gardening proves the very point I am making. If you want to poison something you do it locally, as the US and UK governments have both done in experiments, by aerial spraying at very low altitude or dispersal from vehicles or in the case of one UK dispersion experiment, from a ship anchored just offshore.</p>

<p>And you are confusing cause with effect. Storm fronts are a natural occurrence and the conditions which favour contrails often precede a cold front. Americans are being TOLD there&#39;s a difference between contrails and chemtrails, but they are not buying it because it&#39;s just too improbable.</p>

<p>edit: Your comment: &quot;Your accurate scientific proof is nothing more than bullshit disinformation.&quot; is going into my memoirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, well I will look into it. Good luck with your conceptualize of this occurrence, whatever it may be. For now we part and I suppose we agree to disagree.</p>
