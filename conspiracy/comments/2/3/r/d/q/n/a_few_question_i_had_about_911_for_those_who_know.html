       I believe, or more accurately theorize, that our Government knew about 9/11 ahead of time and allowed and possibly supported it's occurrence. I'm also on the fringe of believing that al-qaeda was assisted by out Government in order to allow this event to occur through funds and other methods such as confusing our jets, ignoring warnings, wiring them funds and using the group as a scapegoat for invading Afghanistan/Iraq propaganda videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to ask a few question and hear what your opinion is. I've been conflicted when it comes to 9/11. At first I believed it was simply the U.S. using the attack to further their own goals. While that's a fact, there are so many inconsistencies that it seems much deeper. I'd like to hear from both sides, because like I said I'm in the middle when it comes to this. I try and believe my Government is not as evil as everybody makes it out to be; that it wouldn't sacrifice lives needlessly. That illusion was shattered after we ended up in a perpetual war with half a million dead civilians for nothing. That's off point though.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The drills. The fact that the attacks were carried out the same day as those numerous drills indicates inside knowledge about the inner workings of the air force. It can't be a coincidence that all of those air-forces were distracted the very day of the attack. The attackers had to have known they had a window of opportunity. It doesn't make any sense that after the first plane hit the building that we wouldn't prevent any more off course flights from crashing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bush would not join the commission report on 9/11 by himself. He told them that the only way was that he and Cheney were in the same room, right next to each other. This conveys that Cheney had information about 9/11 that was not known, and that he and Bush had something to hide and needed to appear together to collaborate their lies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bush continued reading to children for forty minutes after the attack, which is against standard procedure. He also didn't seem fazed at all, as if he expected the event. Why would a president place reading as more imperative than an attack?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why the hell was thermite found at ground zero by multiple different researchers? Why would that show up?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How was there hardly any debris at the crash site in Pennsylvania? The commission asserted the plane was not shot down, however it seemed as if it were shot with a missile in the air; the hypothesis that the passengers themselves brought the plane down is unfounded.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How many rights have we lost post-9/11 years? It seems like a shit ton was taken away after the event and it seems we're more complacent than ever. I know we lost habeas corpus, the right to free speech, the right to bear arms (In NY anyway), and there are others I can't think of.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is it just me or has propaganda since 9/11 increased exponentially over the Internet, television and particularly the media? 9/11 didn't our Government sign into law something which took control of what the media and press could say about the Government? I thought I read that but cannot recall the source.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you have sensible answers to these questions I will believe you. I'd just like for some legitimate answers.

       Check this video out. Ruppert goes into some of the details early on in the video.
Another thing to remember about Ruppert is that he bases everything he says in that book on real, verifiable news stories. He doesn't touch the demolition of the towers, he doesn't touch what hit the pentagon. Everything in his book is tracable back to the source and would be admissable in a court of law.

       He actually committed suicide just last week and it appears to be a legitimate suicide. There's confirmation from his close friends including a note left by him and an e-mail.
Vice did a doc on him called "Apocolypse Man" too and he looks pretty rough in it.

       I always keep an open mind. I'm even open to the idea that the secretive groups who rule the world do so to protect humanity, rather than benefit for their own good. Or even that our Government has all these new anti-terrorism laws to legitimately try and protect people by bypassing laws for faster prosecutions.

      <p>
       Open to doesn't mean I believe it.

         Yes, it very well can. If the possibility exists then by definition it is possible, no matter how slim it might be. The problem is not that it might have been a coincidence, even for my standards that could very well pass without any questions raised, the problem is
         <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/">
          the sheer number of coincidences and firsts on that day.

         regarding the events surrounding the handling of Flight 93 situation. Further, the Commission itself -

         - not only excluded the report of

         If the commission report's purpose was to write a report based on the witnesses' reports then certainly to exclude and manipulate a report from one person is already evidence enough of fraud.

         Not only your rights but the citizens' lifes in wars started with the excuse of terrorism and the innocents in the other countries that had nothing to do with 9/11 or anything USA related. The conspiracy theory tells that 9/11 was false flag which the objective was to strike fear into the people and gain support towards wars, something that everyone can easily see if he just stops with their fanatic patriotic faith. It's not just that they refuse to listen, it's that they are afraid of even considering that their own country would do such thing, despite the existence of a multitude of evidence proving this.

         It hasn't much, people (debunkers) are just simply copy-pasting everything they find in the first page of a google search and spamming everywhere they stalk. They are not interested in discussion, they are not interested in using reasoning, all they care is dump spam and reject everything that is being said. Regarding the other part of your question: the one thing that I am aware of that can be related to that is the JTRIG operation.

       Other than all this, try to be objective and use clear reasoning and backup your claims and avoid dismissing without corroboration.

       I'm looking for the answers I haven't found. I've researched these points myself, and a lot of it doesn't have conclusive evidence to back the claims up. I found a lot of it to be inconclusive, so I came here to ask people who I assumed would be very knowledgeable about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really so offensive for me to want to hear the opinions of other people? The websites and video that try and prove 9/11 was an inside job are just as biased and sensationalist as the mainstream media. They all have agendas. I came here for your answers; what the problem? You'll discuss and upvote an absolutely false story about Nine-trillion missing from the Federal Reserve but you won't discuss this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't his subreddit all about asking questions and having those questions answered for not only myself, but anybody who views these answers? It's easy to submit a shitty image or video that has no value whatsoever. It's better and more useful, in my mind, to have a real discussion on matters that are important.
      </p>

       If you don't find this important or worth discussing, what do you find worthy? Why don't you tell me, I'd like to discuss it.

       After seeing this video, it changed my view of the events that happened on that day. It's a long video, about 4 hours but definitely worth the watch. it's an alternative theory (nuclear demolition), but in my mind has a lot of supporting evidence. Give it a watch if you care to seek the truth.

       The MSM is a tool of propaganda. Useless. Look how they handled Turkeys false flag planning: ignored. NOT mentioned SPECIFICALLY on any MSM netowrk. Not one. All they reported was: Turkey shut down Youtube..  (No one asks why? Reporting is dead to MSM? -It's controlled. Period).

       Opinions are shit, and the fact that soo many people had the opinion that the govt would never pull a false flag, or torture people, proves it.

      <p>
       They didn't. Not even slightly. Controlled demolitions start from the bottom, not the top. Controlled demolitions also don't allow that much debris to fly that far from the building. The only similarity between the Twin Towers and a controlled demolition was that they collapsed at all.

      <p>
       This might come as a surprise to you, but the forces and interactions caused by wind are very different than those caused by a fully-loaded airliner traveling at top speed.

       Don't forget about WTC 7 which had a simple office fire yet collapsed in free fall. That's more damning evidence than the other WTC building honestly. Pretty sure building 7 contained important documents as well but I'm not positive on that one.

       I see the problem here is that you accept that the wings and giant engines disappeared. That's where we're having a problem, because of course there was no trace of the wings or engines anywhere outside or inside the pentagon for that matter.

       No it doesn't. The hole was wider than the fuselage. On wing dug into the ground, the other broke on impact. It didn't punch a plane shaped hole the building.

       I always keep an open mind. I'm even open to the idea that the secretive groups who rule the world do so to protect humanity, rather than benefit for their own good. Or even that our Government has all these new anti-terrorism laws to legitimately try and protect people by bypassing laws for faster prosecutions.

       Open to doesn't mean I believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit when wrong if there is compelling evidence, or an argument, that is without a doubt true.
