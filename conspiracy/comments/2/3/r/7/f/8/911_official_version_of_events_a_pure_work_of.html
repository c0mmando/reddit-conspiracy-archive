        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>-------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE AIRPORTS</strong></p>

<p>19 alleged terrorists (<em>to be referred just as terrorists from now on</em>) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.</p>

<p>Of those 3, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">one of the recordings</a> (<em>which will be named Dulles from now on</em>) that was only <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5485376/ns/us_news-security/t/sept-panelcriticizes-dullessecurity-screeners/">released in 2004</a> poses a serious problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (<em>including the Pentagons&#39;</em>) only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the <em>Dulles</em> was recording at +12FPS(<em>if I am not mistaken</em>) and has no timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">Dulles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNVWpjOjLe0">Portland, Maine</a></em>) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.</p>

<p>The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">constant tracking via CCTV of the navy yard shooting</a> using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.</p>

<p>Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE HIJACKS</strong></p>

<p>Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them -<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;t=46">7500</a></em>- is the code for <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=57d_1392620694">hijacking</a> and it takes 3s to input and send.</p>

<p>Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.</p>

<p>The alleged Flight11&#39;s FDR shows that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;t=251">the airplane was too high</a> to have struck the lamp posts.</p>

<p>Todd Beamer, one of Flight93&#39;s passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (<em>at <a href="http://htmlimg2.scribdassets.com/1bfw9rs1dse6sz3/images/25-a00d283656.jpg">9:43 AM</a></em>) when in fact this event had already happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">~20 minutes earlier</a>.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE CRASHES</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>TWIN TOWERS</em>--------------------------------</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/Videoimpactmontagelarge.jpg">Flight11</a> and <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/salter/podimages/4flashes.jpg">Flight175</a> produced a bright flash before they crashed into the towers. To this day they have never explained what caused this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Static discharge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would hardly be visible in daylight</li>
<li>It would produce a white/blueish color, not orange</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reflection:</p>

<ul>
<li>As the <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/salter/podimages/4flashes.jpg">image posted before</a> shows the flash seen from multiple vantage points, the idea of it being a reflection is not possible because reflections can only be seen from one vantage point</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Colision sparks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Much like with the static discharge, these would hardly be visible in daylight</li>
<li>It would have to occur on the entire length of the airplane that hits the facade: the wings would have to produce those as well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>-------------------------<em>THE PENTAGON</em>-------------------------------</p>

<p>Only 2 cameras recorded an object crashing into the Pentagon, one recorded only a flash.</p>

<p>The 2 cameras that recorded the object show a <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/pentani.jpg">white smoke</a> coming from the object that the Flight77 could not have produced:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Engine damage from lamp-posts impact: Not possible, airplane engine smoke produces a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE">thin and dark smoke</a></p></li>
<li><p>Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn&#39;t catch fire when the airplane exploded, the <a href="http://www.cryptogon.com/docs/Introducing%20the%20amazing%20Penta-Lawn%202000!%20%289-11%29_files/Pentagon_lawn.jpg">lawn has no jetfuel burn marks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Contrails: Not possible seen that the humidity levels were not enough, corroborated by the lack of those on both airplanes that crashed into the twin towers</p></li>
<li><p>Condensation: Not possible, same reason as contrails</p></li>
<li><p>Rocket/missile-like smoke: Strongly resembles the smoke produced by <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/US_Navy_020207-N-0000R-001_Standard_missile_launch_from_FFG_48.jpg">missiles/rockets</a> and <strong>might explain</strong> why Pentagon personel stated that they noticed the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Even+before+stepping+outside+I+could+smell+the+cordite">smell of cordite</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These 2 cameras have all frames perfectly synchronized -<em>including the moment of the high speed explosion</em>- except the one where the object enters the frame. According to the cameras, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7mDXHn_byA&amp;t=1134">the airplane existed in 2 different places in the same moment of time.</a></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>THE PENNSYLVANIA</em>---------------------------</p>

<p>Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/attack/docs/debrisfields.png">engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site</a>. This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason. </p>

<p>The engine that was buried under the ground was <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Flight93Engine.jpg">compressed along it&#39;s length under</a>  ~3 and half feet of dirt. This engine had a <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/thrust-reverser/thrust-reverser3.jpg">clam shell</a> of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.</p>

<p>There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/images/columns/kovach051012b.gif">flying on the opposite direction</a> and not the one officially told. This also fits <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7508/1605/1600/pm-map-flight-paths.png">Val MacClatchey&#39;s testimony of the plane path</a>.</p>

<p>Val MacClatchey&#39;s famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7508/1605/1600/plume-comparison3.0.jpg">is consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.</a> When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">another witness</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast with Flight 93, here is an airplane crash of a Boeing 737-200 of 17,November 2013 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUV3xRIraU">nose dived</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan_Airlines_Flight_363#Crash">70º</a> and still had plenty of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509388/Video-shows-Boeing-737-plane-crash-Russia-killing-50-people.html">easily identifiable airplane parts</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/">both engines were found in the same location.</a></p>

<p>Here you can see more airplane crashes comparisons with Flight 93 and see how unique Flight 93 was. <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html">http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html</a></p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE CALLS</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Todd Beamer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flight 93 hijack occured at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></li>
<li>Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></li>
<li>Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></li>
<li>Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_ME83nFczBk/UK9vUHoEglI/AAAAAAAAAKE/mcoNOAidgDg/s1600/airfone93.png">3925 seconds</a>. It last 45 minutes <strong>after</strong> the plane had already crashed.</li>
<li>Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: &quot;<em><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.</a></em>&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Jeremy Glick:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call starts at 9:37</li>
<li>Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</li>
<li>Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <strong>after</strong> the plane had already crashed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above</a>, seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------<strong>THE TOWERS&#39; COLLAPSES</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>SOUTH TOWER</em>--------------------------------</p>

<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">this was the expected movement of the top</a> if it was simply collapsing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>

<p>-------------------------<em>NORTH TOWER</em>--------------------------------</p>

<p>A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the debris fall occuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;t=26">on the right face of the building</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact <del>93%</del> 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within <strong>12s</strong>, the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">NIST file NCSTAR1 section 2.9</a></p>

<p>If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that -<em>according to NIST</em>- all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).</p>

<p>Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.</p>

<p>2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in <strong>0.029s</strong></p>

<p>29/<strong>1000ths</strong> of a second.</p>

<p>According to NIST, each floor -<em>composed by concrete and steel</em>- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.</p>

<p>Despite the top being only <strong>~16%</strong> of the building (<em>weaker and lighter</em>), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining <strong>~<del>93%</del> 83%</strong> perfectly intact structure (<em>stronger as well</em>) defying yet again another law of physics -<em>Newton&#39;s third law</em>- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the <del>93%</del> 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.</p>

<p>A better explanation of the laws of physics violation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;t=2329">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;t=2329</a></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>TOWER SEVEN</em>--------------------------------</p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/2011/images/11-09-07/WTC7-engulfed-in-debris_LG.jpg">debris from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://s6.postimg.org/i8z9a8zr5/WTC7_Gash_Top_Close_An.png">top to bottom gash</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://www.911myths.com/assets/images/db_images/db_Magnum11.jpg">large quantities of smoke</a>, there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of <a href="http://www.rense.com/general65/WTC7_sw_after_1.jpg">sooth in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jk5o-zmvMiM/0.jpg">fires that were already extinct</a>.</p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://thingseverybodyshouldknow.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wtc-nist-wtc7.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/wp_wtc29.jpg">normal office fires</a> (<em>or just plain office fires</em>) and <a href="http://www.cpflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Windsor-Tower-Madrid-Spain.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (<em>or <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/docs/mandarin/beijing_torch.jpg">infernos</a></em>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was apointed as the collapse failure initiation</a>. This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>CONTINUATION</strong></p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536</a></p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occured right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (<em>hit directly by the towers&#39; debris</em>), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>To end this list I would like to make a question which isn&#39;t meant to seek an answer but purely to make you ponder:</p>

<p><strong>If you weren&#39;t aware of which buildings collapsed that day; Which one of these two buildings turned into a pile of ruble: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CXyRBH9.jpg">WTC5</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">WTC7</a>?</strong></p>

<p><sup>PS: For any debunker that tries to answer/debunk the question even though I clearly stated that I am not looking for an answer but to make people ponder:</sup></p>

<p><sup>Remember that NIST has already stated that the structural damage was irrelevant and that the building would still have collapsed without any damage:<a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21ubl5/people_trying_to_debunk_911/cggtw3u">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21ubl5/people_trying_to_debunk_911/cggtw3u</a>.</sup></p>

<p><sup>The argument of pointing out how much smoke there was on the other side is also irrelevant for 1 reason: smoke is not fire. For both pictures I only show the actual fires in both buildings and not the smoke coming out from either one.</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>With regards to the WTC collapse, you state that under half (33% and ~16%) of the floors cause the remaining floors to collapse and that this is an impossibility. This is the bit of your post I have trouble with</p>

<p>You seem to be forgetting that the floors collapsed in a cascade fashion rather than simultaneously. For a cascade to happen, I would suggest that only one floor needs to fail.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a column that is 100 levels tall. Each level weighs a metric tonne and is a metre high.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the structural integrity of level 80 is compromised. In an instant, there is a mass 21 tonnes (21000 kg) in free fall. After falling for 1m, this mass impacts onto level 79 with a kinetic energy of 205800J. Not all energy is conserved as it will be converted into heat which will affect the integrity of level 79 and the end result is the failure of level 79 pretty quickly. </p>

<p>We now have a mass of 22 tonnes falling and impacting level 78. Even if we imagine the mass had come to a complete top and a freefall of only 1m occurs, 78 would encounter an impact producing 215600J. However, I would imagine that levels 79 to 100 would not stop completely freefalling and so the energy would be higher. Again, some energy will be converted into heat, affect level 78 and fall again. Repeat until levels 2-80 have failed </p>

<p>By the time levels 2-100 have collapsed, even if they only impacted level 1 as if they freefell 1m, the energy produced would be 1455300J. Once floor 1 collapses, levels 2-99 are still falling. Once the mass of levels 2-80 is at ground level, levels 81-100 would the give way due to the shockwave going back up through the tower.</p>

<p>I have not looked into your other claims and I don&#39;t want to get into a slanging match about it. I just wanted to postulate a theory as to why tall buildings <em>could</em> collapse at near freefall speed when only 1 level is compromised. In the WTC collapse, looking at the TV images, it would appear that the structural integrity of multiple floors was compromised so the collapse was only a matter of time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been already ruled out that the pancake hypotesis (the cascade you mention) was not possible because it did not present the <a href="http://www.pandoleon.com/twg/images/pancake.jpg">same result as all pancake collapses do</a>, it also fails to account for the destruction of the core columns and fails to account for the already mentioned:</p>

<p>&quot;A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symetrically, it can be clearly identified a <strong>concentrated destruction almost as fast as the debris fall occuring on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;amp;t=26">right face of the building</a></strong>.</p>

<p>You are also implying that the debris of the destroyed floors are able to destroy even more structurally intact floors and at an accelerated rate than the intact structure was capable at the beginning.</p>

<p>You have also used hypotetic values without any math behind it as means to prove your point while completely ignoring wether the building was capable of withstanding the mass of 21tonnes that free-fall for 1m. For example:</p>

<p>Here you have an entire building that was demolished half of its height and despite falling for far more than 1m it still did not turn into a pile of rubble <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbzAu47AsQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbzAu47AsQ</a></p>

<p>Here you have another building that was pre-weakened for demolition purposes and fell 2 stories, did not turn into a pile of rubble <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDuUR7l3bgc&amp;amp;t=183">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDuUR7l3bgc&amp;amp;t=183</a></p>

<p>This is the problem with imagined mathematics as means to prove a point: unless they are factual then they are not relevant as they will most of the times induce in error/be flawed in the core.</p>

<p>Also, the math has been done already and it has been concluded that even if one floor collapsed it would not progress further, let alone the entire depth of the building. Something that NIST never did but only said that &quot;Global collapse was inevitable&quot; without any mathematics proving such claim.</p>

<p>The study is mentioned in this lecture, I am sorry but I don&#39;t have the time to seek the correct moment as it is discussed but it is from this moment forwards in which it is also addressed the issues with the bazant theory and related conflicts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=1715">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=1715</a></p>

<p>Giving a link to an image that just says &quot;Pancake collapse&quot; as proof of what all pancake collapses look like this is not evidence. Give a link to research and reports about pancake collapses and this might hold more weight. As such I think I can safely ignore this</p>

<p>You are assuming that for a building to collapse it <strong>must</strong> fall straight down. I would suggest playing Jenga and checking whether any blocks end up in the opposite direction to the falling direction  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No mathematics behind it? It&#39;s the energy equation:</p>

<p><em>Potential Energy (Joules) = Mass (kg) x Acceleration (m/s<sup>2)</sup> x Height (m)</em></p>

<p>And of course it&#39;s hypothetical - it&#39;s an example. That&#39;s what <em>&quot;For example&quot;</em> means. I chose simple values so that you could do the maths yourself. There are plenty of examples on the web where you can plug your own values in</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist but even I know that a falling body will exert energy onto anything it impacts. Considering the towers just had a big metal tube filled with a flammable liquid fly into them at a few hundred mph then I would suspect that the structural integrity <strong>was</strong> compromised of all floors surrounding said impact. Also, what about the flame retardant covering on the trusses? That was missing on many of the recovered trusses due to it being blown on by the explosion. Any fire (and I do seem to remember there being a few flames) would have affected the trusses. Therefore, less energy would be required to collapse the floors</p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t want to get into a slanging match over this. You can believe whatever you want regarding the collapse of the towers. However, you seem to have made your mind up and are unwilling to accept that anyone else having a differing opinion to you may have a point. It smacks of &quot;La la la! I can&#39;t hear you!&quot;</p>

<p>And, with that, adios. I can&#39;t be bothered to waste anymore of my time on this</p>

<p>PS - a link to a YouTube video of a lecture hosted by a student group affiliated with Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth does not nothing to further your argument when Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth came out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Imd5i7IGo#t=1433">this earth shattering evidence</a></p>

<p>And you are not understanding the pretty obvious thing about this building collapse - who said that the floors failed in numerical order? The energy from the collapsing floors would have been transmitted through the entire building causing other structural failures. Also, you have a lot of air being pushed sideways thus pushing debris to the side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...I have also explained why your imagined mathematic example is flawed and provided examples corroborating this...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you haven&#39;t. You have provided a couple of videos of controlled demolitions that went wrong. If you can prove that my imagined mathematic example is flawed then I suspect we would need to re-write the energy equations and you&#39;d be up for a Nobel Prize for Physics. As such, you&#39;re taking a hypothetical example, ignoring the accepted method for calculating potential energy and saying &quot;Nope. It doesn&#39;t work like that&quot; because it doesn&#39;t fit with your way of thinking. You show me <strong>your</strong> working out as to why my maths is wrong and I&#39;ll accept it. However, I&#39;m not willing to be disproved with videos and a yar-boo-sucks attitude</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...I have also provided one of many images that exemplifies what a pancake collapse looks like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, again, an image is not proof. I&#39;ve just done a quick search for images of pancake collapses and you&#39;re quite right - they do all look similar to the one you posted earlier. However, in <em>every</em> one of those images, the building in question is, at most, 10 stories high and, thus, will have a lower mass crushing lower floors.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember seeing a building the size of WTC collapsing after being hit with a (recently) fuelled plane before so all the images you speak of are a moot point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you feel that you wasted your time by ignoring every counter-point I made that disproved and refuted your logic then perhaps you shouldn&#39;t have started it and so uninformed in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve not refuted a single thing. You&#39;ve picked out convenient images, ignored energy equations when they suit you and said &quot;Look at me! I can prove it all but the shills aren&#39;t letting me! Sheeple need to wake up to this because I know I am right!&quot; when, in reality, you&#39;ve proved nothing. You&#39;ve cobbled together videos and reports that suit your agenda and you&#39;ve dug in for the long haul. It&#39;s a shame - I sspect if you put as much effort into your life as you have getting all these links together then you&#39;d have a whale of a time and realise that you can&#39;t do a damn thing about anything you are not directly involved with</p>

<p>I notice you didn&#39;t comment on the amazing example given by Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth. Ha. And you thought my maths was flawed. Their example is worse than the one I saw with paper trays </p>

<p>I was commenting on your apparent inability to accept that there may be another point of view</p>

<p>What comments are those then? The one about David Icke&#39;s list of paedophiles, satanists etc? I think you may have missed the attempt at humour there. Or was it the comments on this very sub where I was discussing the pros and cons of taking photographs from a window after being told to stay away from them by armed personnel? I thought I had a fairly valid argument there against someone, who, again, failed to accept a different point of view.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not bothered to look at your comment history as it&#39;s not relevant to this discussion. I couldn&#39;t care less what sub-reddits you subscribe to or what comments you have made elsewhere as the discussion is taking place <strong>here</strong>, on <strong>this one</strong>. The fact that you looked at mine would suggest to me that you were looking for a reason not to discuss this any further and it looks like you found it. I wonder what would you have done if I had no comment history. Claim that I was a sleeper account to go against 9/11 theories? New account? That I&#39;d created this account specifically to have a go at you? What if I had a huge comment history but this was my first on this sub? Wonder aloud why I all of a sudden piped up and accused me of being a shill after orders from above?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, I think you&#39;ll find that they are a lot more abusive and snarky. I will listen to both sides of an argument (hence I follow this and <em>the other one</em>). In this instance, I was merely putting forward a <em>possible</em>  explanation.</p>

<p>Just because I follow a sub that is the antithesis of this one doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t enter into discussion here. If you&#39;re trying to say that I can&#39;t then, surely, that&#39;s a strike against the right to free speech which, I believe, is something this sub takes very seriously. It also means that I would be denied hearing alternatives to the accepted norm. I&#39;m not trying to belittle your beliefs but I am merely positing that there may be an explanation for how the buildings collapsed as they did.</p>

<p>Either way, I hope you find what you look for. If you&#39;re right about all this then good for you. However, I suspect that even if a full, independently commissioned enquiry finds that the official version is the real version, then you still won&#39;t accept their findings because it doesn&#39;t suit your agenda that you have worked so hard towards</p>

<p>Ah yes.... the truther &quot;agenda&quot;:  To make no money and be criticized by an ignorant public.  To spread &quot;lies&quot; and &quot;deception&quot; for no real reason at all, just for the lulz.  <em>What a noble &amp; worthwhile agenda to work so hard towards</em>...</p>

<p>I see people throw out this accusation all the time - that truthers have an &quot;agenda&quot;.  Yet, I&#39;ve never seen anyone back that claim up with any reasonable explanation of just what that &quot;agenda&quot; might be.  It&#39;s always the same general, vague accusation. </p>

<p>All I see when someone throws out the &quot;agenda&quot; accusation, is someone who actually means to say: &quot;I&#39;m really butthurt that you believe something which I neither believe nor understand, so you must have some sort of sinister agenda&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pathetic, really.</p>

<p>Certainly the U.S. government had no agenda on 9/11.... you know, even though the event led us into 2 lengthy &amp; costly wars (costly to us, the taxpayer, but extremely profitable for the government/war contractors/petroleum industry/etc).  Even though it led to the passage of the PATRIOT Act and all kinds of new legislation, and has served as the justification for the creation of new bureaucracies such as DHS &amp; TSA, and paved the way for agencies like the NSA to unconstitutionally spy on the entire globe.  <em>Surely</em> that wasn&#39;t all part of an <em>agenda</em>... </p>

<p>No sir!  It&#39;s the truther that has the agenda!  The agenda to gain absolutely nothing and to be labeled a &quot;tin-foil hat wearing nutter&quot;.    </p>

<p>Makes <em>total</em> sense...</p>

<p><em>What&#39;s on the agenda for today, boys??  I made $0 yesterday exploiting the &quot;truth movement&quot; for personal gain, and was ridiculed on four separate occasions... I think today I&#39;ll aim for double that!!</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, over a decade later, corporations like Halliburton are still raking in millions of dollars in profit from the wars that their ex-CEO helped launch while holding the office of Vice President.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s the truthers who have the obvious &quot;agenda&quot;.  Obviously.    /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of what you&#39;re sayinbg seems to make sense, but I still don&#39;t see how a pancake collapse could accelerate, especially near freefall speed. It seems to me that it would slow down as the floors met, and that by the end we&#39;d have a fairly slow collapse with the floors layered on top of eachother. I&#39;m also having trouble understanding how the acceleration would be so constant. Shouldn&#39;t there be stutters or stages in the collapse if the floors keep colliding?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is some simple numbers for everyone to bite into and fact check me if you want, tempered glass melts at 1328 degrees( if a building like WTC1,2,7 etc is exposed to great amounts of heat, the glass melts and releases the heat. So its very simple idea that hot fires will ventiliate a building on its own except for the concrete and steel. Steel does lose its strength by about 50  percent at 1200 degrees but even then it&#39;s engineered load is 1/3rd to 1/2 of what it is actually carrying. Then you have structural steel which actually melts at 2650-2850 degrees. It can be seen pouring out of the towers on that day. The shills will shout but but but the jet fuel. Maximum jet egts are 1800&#39;s and that is with a jet engine ramped up at full speed. Did anyone notice all the jet engines that at full speed go well above natural atmospheric conditions parked at every structural support? I didn&#39;t. The amazing part is that there have not been enough people together to cause an outrage and protest to demand that these war criminals in office were brought to justice. </p>

<p>in your video the tower rotate because of the structure weaking in the thiner part<br/>
the structure below  bend and break there is a linear and rotation motion<br/>
the bigger rotation happen when the tower touch the ground
  then the linear motion transform in rotation </p>

<p>Anyone can clearly see in the video that the top section rotates all the way from start to end, there is no linear motion. The top rotates on top of the background structurally intact supports towards the section that provides no resistance, once it reaches the ground level it still continues rotating until it loses the energy acquired before touching the ground.</p>

<p>This is physics, this is what should have happened with the WTC and this top didn&#39;t stop in the slightest by air and it is far smaller than the WTC top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that you don&#39;t need to endlessly debate the minutiae of the day when the accepted/unargued facts indicate a conspiracy in themselves.</p>

<p>9/10 - D Rumsfeld announces $2,300,000,000,000 black hole in pentagon budget and an accompanying investigation.</p>

<p>9/11 - Budget dept. hit by &quot;plane&quot; budget back-ups held in WTC building (can&#39;t remember which one)</p>

<p>After 9/11 - The wars, oli piplines, mining rights, opium crops, domestic &quot;security&quot; contracts, patriot act and on and on.</p>

<p>My point is that you don&#39;t even need to argue about the mechanics of the day, that it might in fact be a waste of time, you can let people believe the official story and still make compelling arguements which point to a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Personaly if find the offical version ludicrous, WTC7 was the smoking gun for me.</p>

<p>Edit - $2.3 trillion in 2001 would now be worth about $3.2 trillion, adjusted for inflation. So if you pinched $2.3 trillion in &#39;01 and replaced it in &#39;14 (was probably returned earlier this is just anecdotal and maybe the return was adjusted itself) you could net yourself $900,000,000 in theory.</p>

<p>I said this because of exactly what you are doing, diverting the disscusion away from the profiteers and benificiaries and into esoteric disscussions about things like ground effect and endless arguments about NIST models ect. </p>

<p>If you are not a shill or some guy who gets his kicks from antagonising people you should read into the nature of denial and attempt to take an objective view of your beliefs and the reasons you argue for the offical story so hard, with this in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FFS, I addressed one part of it that is often challenged as being the most seemingly difficult part. You can&#39;t refute the ground effect part by the way - it&#39;s a very reasonable explanation for that part, unless you want to go against all that aerodynamic information.</p>

<p>Put a plane into a circular path and reduce power to the engines, and you&#39;ll get a steadily descending spiral turn thanks to gravity, a force frequently ignored by theorists for that day, I notice.</p>

<p>It seems there&#39;s a definite push to make all the plane manoeuvres as inhumanly difficult as possible for some reason, to the extent that some of you don&#39;t even seem to believe they were possible.</p>

<p>I suppose that aspect of the proposed explanation for the plan falls apart otherwise, so I can understand your defensiveness.</p>

<p>You are comitted to repeat the same error again. We all know the pontential energy equation very well, what you failed to show was that your values were realistic/factual and possible according to the capabilities of the building being discussed.</p>

<p>I have told you that it is wrong to use imagined numbers and I have showed why your logic is fallacious by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzss1c">showing 2 buildings disproving your logic behind the imagined values</a>.</p>

<p>Something that even you have admitted to have done &quot;<em>probably</em>&quot; incorrectly in a later comment:</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to change Unicorn&#39;s mind, just trying to give a different opinion as to how the towers could have collapsed (<strong>albeit with some well intentioned but probably dodgy maths</strong>).&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/ch037bl">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/ch037bl</a></p>

<p>So far you have provided nothing that proves your point.</p>

<p>I have also said that the top did not have enough energy to continue collapsing, which I also provided the studies corroborating my claim:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzss1c">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzss1c</a></p>

<p>And again, for the second time, I used one image of an example of how pancake collapses look like, if you feel that it is not a good representation then you should have provided an image of confirmed pancake collapse that looks nothing like the one I used. Instead you chose to just deny without corroboration, exactly like a religious person does (or creationist).</p>

<hr/>

<p>As I said in the other comment; I have provided the facts and studies corroborating my claims that disprove yours, you have failed to provide any for yours and you continue ignoring that fact while trying to maintain your logic fallacy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big difference between commenting on that sub and being part of that sub. I clearly said:</p>

<p>&quot;Your comment history, on the other hand, shows that you derailing this discussion was something to be expected (but I still gave you the benefit of the doubt) seen that so far every other member of <strong>the certain sub that you are part of</strong> conducts these discussions int the same way you just did.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzuqfe">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzuqfe</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzuqfe">You use logic fallacies, you use unnecessary mocking tone (childish arguments) to prove your points, you also make claims non-stop without ever providing anything to corroborate them, you deny everything without presenting a valid justification</a> and you insist on trying to derail multiple discussions throughout this entire thread.</p>

<p>You are literally proving for a second time what I mentioned before: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23r7f8/911_official_version_of_events_a_pure_work_of/cgzuqfe">&quot;you derailing this discussion was something to be expected&quot;</a></p>

<p>Your opinion becomes useless if you cannot provide corroboration, especially when it is refuted with claims provided with facts and evidence. The fact that you continue insisting on your already refuted opinion shows that you are not interested in any reasonable discussion and that you are in fact interested in doing exactly what I said in the other comment: &quot;spam and derail the thread with logical fallacies and willful ignorance&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the second time that I am forced to show you your own mistakes and I would appreciate it if you would stop wasting my and others&#39; time with your biased monologue that is so typical in the members of that other sub that you are part of.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. Subscribing to it just adds it to my article list and i can just ignore the vast majority of it as a lot of it is pointy-fingered snide remarks.

<p>Posting to a sub takes even more effort as you need to go back and reply as you&#39;re the one who opened it up for discussion</p>

<p>I subscribe to many subreddits. I comment very little as I&#39;m generally not interested in the comments. I <em>will</em> comment if I think I have something to add and, in this instance, I thought I did. Obviously you think differently and that&#39;s tickety boo for you.</p>

What do I care that someone who has spent waaay too long on this subject thinks I deserve that exrta itty-bitty mouse click on that oh so sad down arrow. OH THE SHAME!. How will I live with the stigma of a downvote? I shall have to retire to my chamber and write my memoirs whilst smoking a slim cheroot and sipping on the finest whiskey money can buy</p>

<p>You need to get out and broaden your horizons. Take up a hobby away from the screen. In over a year, my comment history amounts to 3 pages. I gave up on yours when I reached page 31 and I was only 2 months into it. Life is too short to waste it on the likes of you and reddit</p>

<p>I will defend your right to free speech and thought as long as you defend my right to think you&#39;re a loon</p>

<p>Tootle-pip</p>

<p>PS - is the ban in the post? If so, I shall await it with unbated breath as, again, it&#39;s not worth worrying about</p>

<p>I don&#39;t downvote or upvote anyone. The only thing I downvote are threads that promote here drama about that other sub and even then I remove my vote after ~24h.</p>

<p>The rest of your comment speaks for itself, you first tried to pin your uncorroborated opinion based on flawed logic, then you start using a childish tone when facing corroborated counter-arguments, then you start dancing around words while continuously ignoring the fact that your opinion had no merit and now you have engaged in a personal spat about your personal feelings and delusions surrounding your imagination world.</p>

<p>All of this could have been avoided if you had provided facts and/or evidence for your empty claims or if you had conceded that your logic was weak and flawed to begin with, but you decided to keep your illusive pride over reason and insist on defending it and derailing discussions with ad hominem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because the title of this thread describes exactly your development in this thread:</p>

<p>A post from a 9/11 conspiracy blog.  Hmmm...not a great start.  I don&#39;t see Gordon Ross&#39;s credentials listed anywhere.  Has his rebuttal to Bazant been peer reviewed?  Has it been published anywhere other than a 9/11 conspiracy blog?</p>

<p>Better than trying to fish 1 or 2 members in r/physics that don&#39;t rustle their jimmies over a sensitive subject that is 9/11 and attract denials and rejections over ignorance and voting brigades is to actually look for those that have already done so outside of reddit.</p>

<p>I am very confident because I have researched it and I have concluded the obvious: The towers couldn&#39;t have collapsed and even if they had due to some impossible scenario, all 3 would not have turned into piles of rubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, i know full well it happens in the wild as well. But the physics and askscience communities are pretty easy going. Just ask someone to put aside bias and look at the equations themselves, the observed results. You do well ignoring people being argumentative for the sake of it, and yeah, you&#39;ll likely get snide comments, but there&#39;ll be some gold amongst the crap. </p>

<p>Everyone is different. Even as infrastructure engineer i research and design solutions that i know in my gut seem correct, then reach out to the community for verification. It challenges my research and its veracity. If i don&#39;t, i get a nagging feeling that i cant be rid of until I&#39;ve received feedback.</p>

<p>Would it offend you if I were to ask someone to cast more than my layman&#39;s eye over the science you&#39;ve suggested and sourced? I&#39;m not out to be bitter or spiteful. I just need more info. Further to that, if someone replied and gave solid evidence to the contrary, could you accept that? Would you reconsider? Not that that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do. I just don&#39;t understand the math and need a third party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any thread related to 9/11 that shows any small hint related to a conspiracy theory will be downvoted until it disappears from the queue by every debunker that sees it, especially debunkers that use sock-puppet accounts for multiple votes.</p>

<p>I just presented to you 3 links leading to explanations by scientists as to why the physics were not possible, one is even a teacher literally teaching the physics, I don&#39;t see any worthwile valid reason to waste time looking for validation in other subs within reddit.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand math and you need a third party then you are out of luck, reason being that any third party you chose will always be a debunker and every debunker will reject and deny everything the conspiracy theory explains. And they will do so without ever rebutting that the physics are not possible by using imaginary scenarios that fail to stand in reality and NIST&#39;s models which its data was never released to the public for scrutiny, aka they used false data so that the models would look like the real scenario by means of using weaker strength values in order for it to fall at the slightest failure point.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the math you can learn the math that we use to prove our points, the same math in the links I posted, and see for yourself if it is correct or not. This way you don&#39;t depend in any parties, you use your own knowledge to reach your conclusion, the same thing that everyone that doesn&#39;t believe in the official version does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read what I wrote? I <em>will</em> listen to reasoned arguments with an open mind and, if they are convincing, I will change my opinion on something. I agree - a lot of 9/11 is extremely dodgy - but that is _<em>not _</em> what I was discussing. I was only talking about the WTC towers falling and a possible way in which they could pancake. </p>

<p>My beef is with people (and I am including anyone here, not one side of an argument or the other) who are unwilling to enter into discussion, or even entertain the notion that there could be a different reason for something occurring. </p>

<p>Even though I subscribe to &quot;that other sub&quot;, I&#39;m not the ass hat who will rubbish anything that is not to my way of thinking. I think alot of them are just as close minded as some people on this sub. However, I&#39;m guessing that that is the same in any sub and is just something we&#39;ve all got to accept. Let&#39;s face it - if everyone always agreed with everyone else all the time, it would be A - boring and B - really boring. For instance, do you believe every theory that passes through this sub? I&#39;m fairly confident (hopefully) that you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think I&#39;ll leave it at that now. I&#39;m sorry if I offended anyone with my comments - that was never my intention. I just wanted to give my opinion on how I thought the towers collapsed and it seemed to cascade from there (sorry for the pun) </p>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t the same exact ground. The engines on a 757 are mounted more than 40 feet apart. The exact angle of the crash, as well as the multitude of complex and unpredictable physical interactions that occur in a crash, will greatly influence what the exact outcome is. It&#39;s not nearly as simple as you&#39;re making it out to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://media.hamptonroads.com/media/content/pilotonline/2007/09/0908crashb500x350.jpg">Oh</a> <a href="http://wcsi.whiterivernews.com/ArticlePublisher/WS/SystemFiles/ArticleFiles/Images/3afe1e9f-5d6d-4cf8-b84d-27b40743d5d0.jpg">really</a>?</p>

<p>You act like all plane crashes are the same. They&#39;re not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An object that is in motion will not change its velocity <strong>unless an external force acts upon it</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which it did, namely resistance from the lower part of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Third law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is true only as long as the structure being acted upon remains intact and is not itself moving. The added load from the movement of the upper portion was enough to break the lower portion, causing it to fall, so it was no longer resisting as much. The effect only compounded as it went down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact 93% 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>defying yet again another law of physics -Newton&#39;s third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the 93% 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absolutely false and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of basic physics.</p>

<p>Go read the stuff <a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/911NutPhysics.HTM">here</a> about static and dynamic loads. I really have never seen a better explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction</p>

<p>I will assume that you are not doing this on purpose: The two airplanes that hit the twin towers were not 230 miles away, they were well close to ground level when they crashed and anyone could clearly see that there were no contrails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh  really ?</p>

<p>You act like all plane crashes are the same. They&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Once again I will assume that you are not doing this on purpose. I clearly stated &quot;jet crash&quot; to which you try to disprove by using the example of a crash of a <a href="http://cdn-www.airliners.net/aviation-photos/middle/4/3/0/1128034.jpg">WW2 Fighter</a> plane <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/node/324491">crash</a> which is absolutely nothing like a commercial jet.</p>

<p>The second picture you showed is also from a crash of yet <a href="http://wcsi.whiterivernews.com/templates/localnews_temp.asp?id=7587">another single engine plane</a>, again not at all the same or close to a commercial jet.</p>

<p>I act like the crashes of airplanes of the same category are the same because they are, unless you try to deceive and use examples of airplanes that have no comparison other than the capability of flying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is true only as long as the structure being acted upon remains intact and is not itself moving.

</blockquote>

<p>I will not argue with you about the physics that had to be violated for the collapse to have occured as it was portrayed, it would be the same as trying to explain science to a creationist. If you truly believe in what you said then that is your choice. I prefer to use actual math and physics calculations to backup my claims instead of just empty claims, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely false and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of basic physics.</p>

<p>Go read the stuff here about static and dynamic loads. I really have never seen a better explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the same that I said above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did you expect? Gravity pulls down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing. Just like NIST when explaining that the towers turned into a pile of rubble because &quot;<em>Global collapse was inevitable</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>Please do not confuse my reply with a request for the continuation of... whatever you are trying to do here, I have absolutely no interest in wasting time with someone that belongs in a sub where people are comitted to derail threads and spread false propaganda in here, especially when I assume that you are not doing it on purpose for the sake of correcting your &quot;mistakes&quot;.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;d spend less time in that other sub that you are part of then maybe you would not lie to make your points (a strong trend that is present among your fellow peers from that sub, lying and deceiving, as you can see the AnSq -another member part of that sub- just 2 replies above using examples of ww2 fighter airplanes to debunk a jet airliner crash).

I am trying to have a reasonable discussion and offer a friendly suggestion on one point that I think was inaccurate. I guess I should have just stroked your ego and moved on. </p></li>
<li><p>I honestly am curious what sub I am apart of in your mind. The only subs I actually frequent are this and r/guns and I don&#39;t think there is a ton of overlap between the two. If anything r/guns people are somewhat conspiracy minded due to constant attacks on the 2nd amendment and our general distrust of the government. </p></li>

<p>Here&#39;s how I imagine it went down: Pilots don&#39;t realize anything is wrong at first, pilots notice something is happening and are confused, pilots are responding to the more immediate threat on their life, pilots are dead.</p>

<p>At no point was it reasonable to deal with the transponder. You&#39;re only supposed to do that once you&#39;re not in mortal danger. 7500 seems to be designed for the more typical &quot;hold the plane for ransom&quot; type hijacking than the &quot;murder the pilots and crash into a building&quot; type of 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will assume that you are not doing this on purpose: The two airplanes that hit the twin towers were not 230 miles away, they were well close to ground level when they crashed and anyone could clearly see that there were no contrails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were 230 miles away from the Pentagon. You claim that the lack of contrails in New York means there couldn&#39;t be any in Virginia. That&#39;s absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I act like the crashes of airplanes of the same category are the same because they are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, admittedly that probably wasn&#39;t a very good example, but don&#39;t try to pretend that every single airliner crash is exactly the same every time.</p>

<p>Pilots are well trained to do what they do. Do you really think they were so &#39;overwhelmed&#39; with what was happening that they forgot all of their training and didn&#39;t think to squawk 7500? On all 4 flights?? Not likely. It&#39;s muscle memory, almost instinctive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not taking sides here, I have read both arguments and the official story has too many holes to be trusted, but I&#39;m not convinced it was a government Op either.</p>

<p>My point in posting, however, is that it&#39;s been shown that pilots become too comfortable in the cockpit due to automation, so when something goes wrong they do not act quickly enough or do not act properly- such as the recent Asiana flight.</p>

<p>You continued inability to answer this one, simple question which I have now put to you multiple times is just insulting.</p>
