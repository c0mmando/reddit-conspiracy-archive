<p>So, you&#39;d allow doxxing if your hands were not tied? You don&#39;t see it as an invasion of privacy of someone IRL? I love conspiracy theories and speculation, but real life consequences for potentially innocent common people is a big no. I&#39;m hoping it was a wording mistake from your side. I also hope mods take a stronger stance on stopping posting personally identifiable info of people here. Please remember it could always be you or me or our friends and family in the wrong place at the wrong time and our photos and addresses might be discussed here.</p>

<p>People should have their anonymous usernames protected on this site but if you are a witness to an incident or otherwise become of public interest, etc., that&#39;s life.   </p>

<p>There is a tort for revealing private information or for defaming people but in this country we&#39;ve always had the ability to discuss publicly available information.  <strong>This is curtailing our abilities to share information while at the same time the government and corporations are expanding their ability to spy on us!</strong>  And they don&#39;t limit themselves to public information . . . they get private information that would be a tort if revealed by private parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a piece I find to be  important that I have two versions of.</p>

<p>One gives accounting numbers that trace the document without actual attribution as to who was requesting software.</p>

<p>The one that gives the actual source and the exact organization involved in this highly inflammatory event cannot be posted (in my own opinion) because they doxxed themselves right on the page in question.</p>

<p>The generic version that is postable is here,</p>

<p>see under &#39;synopsis&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/51066167/Online-Persona-Management">http://www.scribd.com/doc/51066167/Online-Persona-Management</a></p>

<p>but it would be more valuable as a piece of information in the version where they actually identified  themselves, you know, name, organization (Air Force), address, phone numbers, contacts right on the page.</p>

<p>Would it be considered doxxing if they do it themselves?</p>

<p>One salient factor is that someone commenting reprimanded the poster for posting the contact info and advised him to remove it. It&#39;s still there after months have passed.</p>

<p>Posting this version would definitely cause some folks some hassle but their hands are not clean and they implicated themselves online.</p>

<p>Their thin cover story will be that the software request  pertains to the use of persona management tools to be used in Afghanistan but I find that to be transparent disinformation.</p>

<p>Just FYI, I have no immediate inclination to post the doxxed version. I wouldn&#39;t want to be &#39;that guy&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious as to the applicability of the &#39;doxxing;&#39; definition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not <em>legally responsible</em>, but that&#39;s a very low bar to clear.  They can choose to do more than that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it would be better if the issue stayed between just you and John Doe.  But it&#39;s not just you, it&#39;s every knucklehead on the Internet who wants to mess with someone&#39;s personal life, against John Doe.  It&#39;s not practical for the victim to pursue every person who acted on their information, and they may not be able to repair the damage fully even if they do.  It might even go on indefinitely - the Internet never forgets!</p>

<p>So when you frame it that way, you can see why the admins might prefer to cut off the lynch mobs at the source.  Even if it&#39;s not the ideal moral solution, it&#39;s a lot more practical.</p>

<p>My main point was how difficult the victim will find it to hold accountable a large number of anonymous harassers, which is why your suggestion makes a good ideal but poor practice.</p>

<p>Another analogy might help.  Why do you lock up your valuables?  Surely if someone robs you, you can have them arrested and recover the loss.  So ideally, there would be no need to add additional hassle from locks and safes.  But nonetheless, you lock stuff up because you prefer to not have your stuff stolen in the first place.  Similarly, most Redditors prefer to not be doxxed in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a HUGE red flag with discrepancies in the town&#39;s assessment database and the state&#39;s public lottery winnings list that basically proves the entire town doesn&#39;t exist and all the homes were given to crisis actors and their families, but no one can post it on here because it counts as doxxing. At least 5 people have been shadowbanned for posting this evidence, even heavily redacted ones. There&#39;s evidence that a bunch of crisis actors were paid by &quot;winning&quot; significant amounts of money from the lottery, but anyone who posts the proof (literally copy-pasted from the state lottery commission site) gets shadowbanned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, I saw a regular user here get threatened by a guy named FexFexFex that he was going to doxx him right in front of a mod. I reported him and the mod deleted the comment and warned him he would be banned if he did it again. Fex did it again and harassed the guy for hours until finally the regular deleted his account. I remember all of this because I was actually pretty fond of the guys contributions here. It was at that time that I pretty much quite coming to this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. Even if I have seen something I still take it with a grain of salt. Something something history is written by the victor.</p>

<p>With 9/11, I cant prove either way if it was false flag or genuine; however I dont see why I should trust the government. Within the past few decades, its become pretty apparent that the US is the bad guy.  For me, I believe 9/11 was false flag because the US government says it wasnt. And they had alot to gain from it, just way too convient for them. And the whole fact that the official account says wtc7 was demo&#39;d the day of, which is impossible considering controlled demos take more than a week to set up, thats what convinced me. What is the official rebuttal for wtc7? Its confirmed by officials that it was &#39;pulled&#39; for safety reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait is there a new new rule? What the hell. Doxxing? Is that like when someone Google&#39;s you and finds out your telephone number and they do a reverse look up? Someone help me better understand. Can I still say that Sandy Hook was just a bunch of people at the wrong place at the right time? That there are wars in other countries whose casualties are hundreds of children that were going to grow up and fight to free their countries from their corrupt governments. Any death is awful but how are we going to let the &quot;tragedy&quot; of it all stop us from asking why some of these white ass parents of these white ass kids get all this money? That&#39;s where the gotdamn federal reserve&#39;s missing 9 trillion dollars went. Shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doxxing is essentially following an only account(s) and finding information about said person and for the most part putting up personal information up. For example someone would try find out where I live what I do for work etc etc. UD &quot;Doxing is a technique of tracing someone or gather information about an individual using sources on the internet. Its name is derived from “Documents” or “Docx”. Doxing method is based purely on the ability of the hacker to recognize valuable information about his target and use this information to his benefit. It is also based around the idea that, “The more you know about your target, the easier it will be to find his or her flaws” &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, I saw a regular user here get threatened by a guy named FexFexFex that he was going to doxx him right in front of a mod. I reported him and the mod deleted the comment and warned him he would be banned if he did it again. Fex did it again and harassed the guy for hours until finally the regular deleted his account. I remember all of this because I was actually pretty fond of the guys contributions here. It was at that time that I pretty much quite coming to this sub.</p>
