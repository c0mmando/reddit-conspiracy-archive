       Every thread is now filled with top-comments discrediting, dismissing and marginalizing the various theories. The same goes for it's content. Free and open discussion gets deceived, misdirected, stultified and opressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious for me that COINTELPRO has now a full grip on the opinion making of this subreddit and reddit in general (
       <a href="/r/technolgy">
        /r/technolgy
       </a>
       good example). Call me crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can pretty much see the same pattern every time a subreddit or forum goes main stream or partially main stream. Content just gets kinda unclear and blurry, the "public opinon makers" change it all and change our perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories are theories and don't always make perfect sense, they are fun and they are interesting, but the same feeling isn't present here anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best example is when "posters" dicredit the theory of the CIA killing Aaron Schwartz "because there is no source. And this is one of the top posts? Conspiracies tend to keep their shit secret, like the CIA, FBI or NSA is handling business. Why should there be any proof or sources of it existant? Also a conspiracy-theory is something that makes sense without needing proof, although there is often a lot of proof and indication, it just has to make sense in this universe. And i am obviously not talking about the weird shit like Aliens or Lizards.

       Here's one of your recent comments:

      <p>
       "Well, doomsdayers are just a very narrow definition of what i said. I have experienced that more and more people get suspicious of the government. Conspiracy people (of whom i sympathize with on a certain degree), social critiques, satire and alternative critique opinions are become more frequent and normal."
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently you were never a conspiracy theorist to begin with so why should we care if you're unsubbing?

       Yeah, posers coming around saying things suck when they haven't been around long enough to know what the changes have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of us that have been around long enough know that sometimes things are good, sometimes they're bad. Right now things are so so. Ruppert got shot so people are bummed about that. News headlines are becoming more and more like the headlines in r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think things were worse when some mods were in control. Right now things are bad with everything down voted to hell and the idea that r/conspiracy may have a "do not post keyword list" or that maybe reddit at the top has one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is coming and posting yet another lame ass post we all have to wade through isn't helping things.

       Exactly. I completely agree. If you're bored just go, don't post these long polemics encouraging others to go. It is super suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you waste your time coming back to a sub you don't like, and then post to a sub you don't like, to tell the people that use the sub you don't like it, and they shouldn't like it too. Odd use of your time.

       Completely disagree, people should know what they are dealing with and in the end everyone has to use their own brains and decide for themselves anyways. I am just a tiny influence in the vast ocean of this community.

       Too many posts have suspiciously called on users of this sub to leave or go to another (already set up) sub. If I was the government and I was scared of r/conspiracy's 200,000 users coming together to scrutinise their behaviour, this post is the kind of thing I'd do. Just saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reverse, if I was bored of a sub and the behaviour of its users, I would just go, I wouldn't go back to that sub and post a long story about why I don't like the people on the sub (the very same people who will read my post!).

       You make way to many assumptions and forget there are always 2 sides to a coin. I'm neither a government shill, nor do i oppose or want to hurt this movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is simply, that being suspicious and criticial about governments and NGO's should be a movement of the whole society and not of a single monopoled subreddit or of some weirdos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would prefer to have hundreds of cells and a broad acceptance and understanding in our entire society,  then one or a couple big one sources that easily get infilitrated and diverted by COINTELPRO's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it should fragment until it is present in the middle of the world society. Until everyone at least knows or aknowledges the possibilities of these conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your opinion makes perfect sense, but not if you think long term and in the grand scheme of things. The movement has to get mainstream, but not monopolized and therefor controllable.

       How you know what is bullshit and what not? And i am speaking very narrowly. If a theory gets publicly discredited, because of lack of sources or proof, there is a factor of serious disturbance which didn't cash in to find truth.

       Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       But isn't part of the nature of conspiracy theories a degree of uncertainty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies are tried to kept secret, which means you don't know the agenda so you have to fill the blankets and the unknown by yourself. That's how you create these theories!
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to find truth, you have to believe in it. Many inventors, scientists and other great humans in history only succeeded by following their 6th sense and strong will. While the dumb masses, the skeptics and the critics spat on them.

       Yeah there definitely is a need for balance when it comes to skepticism.
Too little and you'll always be wrong, too much and you'll never be right.

       I think the real problem with this sub is not knowing who is being honest and who is here to stir the pot. Due to the nature of Reddit this community is attached to another much larger one and as a result we have to deal with a lot more people who are on a totally different page than if this was a site dedicated to alternative news/skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that respect I understand your frustration completely, but so far my response has been to try even harder to make my judgement based on credible evidence and call people out when they are being dishonest in their argument. If all the good people go this community really will be dead -_-

       No reason to nurture a dead horse. Just get on and join smaller, less frequented forums or subs. For example
       <a href="/r/conspiracyv2">
        /r/conspiracyv2
       </a>
       is small, but frequrented with dedicated users. It's highly unlikely COINTELPRO shills subvert it. And there are many other..
