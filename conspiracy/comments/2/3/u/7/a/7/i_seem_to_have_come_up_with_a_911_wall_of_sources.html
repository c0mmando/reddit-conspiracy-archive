<p>A measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.[70] —Allen M.

<p>Former white house anti terrorism czar (i hate that they actually use the word czar) and &quot;close friend&quot;of former CIA director George Tenet alleges that the CIA covered some shit up. From the article: In the interview for the documentary, Clarke offers an incendiary theory that, if true, would rewrite the history of the 9/11 attacks, suggesting that the CIA intentionally withheld information from the White House and FBI in 2000 and 2001 that two Saudi-born terrorists were on U.S. soil—terrorists who went on to become suicide hijackers on 9/11. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/11/september-11th-anniversary-richard-clarke-s-explosive-cia-cover-up-charge.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/11/september-11th-anniversary-richard-clarke-s-explosive-cia-cover-up-charge.html</a></p>

<p>Weird coincidences/super creepy Bush reading a book called &quot;My pet goat while having kids chant &quot;plane must kite hit steel&quot;...on 9/11. Documented fact. In my opinion, they flaunt it like this not cause they actually believe it, but to leave their mark in the history books, as a sign to the rest of the elite, as a warning to other world powers, to scare those of us who have eyes to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No and that is exactly the point. One of your &quot;sources not even the shills can respond to&quot; has been proven wrong without a problem and you could have done that yourself with minimal research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So one picture out of a couple dozen unrelated sources turns out to be wrong, and that discredits the whole thing?  What fucking planet are you from man? That is patently absurd, the kind of insulting, ridiculous claim a shill would make to try and discourage me from this line of questioning.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what you believe.  Read through the links for yourself, make up your own mind. This community would be a hell of a lot better without people like you jumping down peoples throats any time someone tries to put together some original research.  Get your own sources if you want, theres plenty out there for you to find :).  Just takes a little work</p>

<p>It discredits your claim that you present &quot;sources not even the shills can respond to&quot;.</p>

<p>You opened a thread, boasting that you had &quot;sources not even the shills can respond to&quot; and within a short time, one was easily and utterly debunked.</p>

<p>And yet you don&#39;t even question yourself if any of the others are valid. You just assume that they are until someone else does the work YOU should have done which is to research the claim to see if it has any merit.</p>

<p>I can just as easily post all the sources from the wikipedia article about 9/11 and proclaim I have &quot;sources not even the truthers can respond to&quot; and claim to be right until each and every single one has been debunked.</p>

<p>Like you? </p>

<p>Next time when you want to discuss a link you found somewhere else and whose content you don&#39;t understand, just post it and ask &quot;what do you think about it?&quot; or &quot;can someone explain this to me, please?&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t pretend that you know anything about the topic and that you somehow presented something &quot;not even the shills can respond to&quot;.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head with the shill statement ..they pick 1 thing out of the many that you say and start banging their head against that ..then the personal insults come .. and finally the smug exit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that kind comment.  Really, really appreciated.  We are representing truth and goodness here and need to stick together.  This snowden leak proves 100 percent to me that at least some of these people are paid to do this.  It&#39;s only logical, I mean NPR is running stories about how Putin has his own army online to promote him, it makes sense that our government does the same thing.  And 9/11 really gets them in a tizzy, lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re not getting responses from so-called &quot;shills&quot; because your presentation is all over the place. You have a lot of information unrelated to 9/11. The motives that you put forth do not require an event anywhere near the impact and scale of 9/11 to achieve. Then there&#39;s complete nonsense like President Bush in the classroom and the occult.</p>

<p>Remove the unrelated information, ridiculous motives and nonsense and you&#39;re left with a couple of arguments that have been rebutted, re-rebutted, re-re-rebutted and so on. Get focused, stay on topic and bring something new to the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a thesis, it&#39;s just a random collection of sources I threw together because I thought some people here would find them interesting to look through.  You want a coherent essay, check this out:</p>

<p>&quot;Gorton holds a Bachelor&#39;s in Electrical Engineering from Yale University, a Master&#39;s in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University,[4] and an MBA from Harvard University.&quot;</p>

<p>Scroll down, ignore Gawker and read his second paper about the Bush family, then get back to me.  I know i&#39;m all over the place with this, that would be because I have a life, job and family and can&#39;t waste too much time with this shit.  But here&#39;s a guy with three degrees from yale, harvard and stanford, so fuck my opinion, listen to his :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s real but it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with 911. Regardless, of if it&#39;s involved or not, you&#39;re just going to turn off a lot of people who would otherwise read your links. The stuff about money and building demolition is going to get people on the fence to pick a side, not stuff that&#39;s already really far on one side of the fence.</p>

<p>Give them enough info to come to a not so far fetched conclusion, then let then follow the rabbit hole if they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!  It&#39;s amazing how you can do nothing but post a bunch of links for people to research, and still everybody jumps down your throat.  One more proof for 9/11 is how hard they work to combat anyone with a shred of evidence online.  Seriously I get so much hate mail, I dont even mind :)  Makes me even more sure that this stuff is at least somewhat true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posts like this are great for people new to the conspiracy world. That&#39;s why you get so much pushback. It seems like the number one goal is to prevent new people from getting any real substance from a place like this. The vote gaming is a dead giveaway. </p>

<p>There are many here who appreciate this stuff. Many don&#39;t vote and the ones who do only get one vote apiece. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No and that is exactly the point. One of your &quot;sources not even the shills can respond to&quot; has been proven wrong without a problem and you could have done that yourself with minimal research.</p>

<p>You obviously have not done even some basic verification of your sources so what makes you think that any of them are reliable?</p>
