        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-04-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Grandest_Inquisitor.html">Grandest_Inquisitor</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I got banned from <a href="/r/NoLibsWatch">/r/NoLibsWatch</a> for debating the Holocaust.  </p>

<p>It was a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/23ph91/the_most_quintessential_rconspiratard_post_ever/">thread</a> complaining about a conspiratard post (of course), calling 9/11 &quot;truthseekers&quot; &quot;idiots.&quot;  One user tried to make the distinction that questioning 9/11 was okay, but questioning things like the Holocaust, global warming, or vaccines was &quot;denialism.&quot;  I pointed out the error in this logic and was being totally respectful in a very long debate (even though my debating opponent got heated and advocated genocide against Germans and started quoting Hebrew scripture about Justice and hunting Nazis, etc.).</p>

<p>Yet I was told I didn&#39;t fit the image they wanted for that sub and was banned.  </p>

<p>I was just told via PM that the Holocaust should not be a topic up for discussion.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted over there for a while and actually enjoyed the work of <a href="/u/TheGhostofDusty">/u/TheGhostofDusty</a>, although I am flabbergasted at the amount of material and time he&#39;s spent over the years monitoring the conspiratard/NoLibs crew.    </p>

<p>So it got me wondering if <a href="/r/NoLibsWatch">/r/NoLibsWatch</a> is yet another controlled opposition game?  Is this simply another wrinkle in the way reddit is controlled?  By pretending to take on the conspiratard crew they attract sympathetic people from this sub but then they subtly reinforce one of the primary agendas of the conspiratard crew . . . taking the Holocaust off the table for discussion.  </p>

<p>Is the Holocaust still on the table for discussion in this sub or will the conspiratard crew succeed in taking it off the table here as well?</p>

<p>I understand the rhetorical game NoLibsWatch is playing against the Conspiratard/NoLibs crew by accusing them of being the real racists and &quot;Nazis.&quot;  Check out the stickied post there where they compare the NoLibs crew to National Socialist Germany.  I think this is okay to a certain extent, but when taken too far it ends up furthering the very propaganda NoLibs/Conspiratard is pushing.  We&#39;ve had decades of propaganda against Germany and they have become a cartoonish example of evil and the conspiratard crew uses this as its main weapon against their enemies (like this sub).  The Allies committed similar crimes and injustices and it just reinforces these unjust taboos.</p>

<p>Plus, it&#39;s intellectually dishonest to ban people for this reason.  To ban thoughtful discussion because it makes others look bad.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s not going to be effective.  NoLibsWatch is never going to convince the other side that they are kosher.  They will always be accused of being antisemitic no matter what.  Might as well stand up for the right thing and try to change this unjust taboo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other side doesn&#39;t matter, but the new comers do. </p>

<p>I do understand their point in not feeding all these ideas at once, because people will be less willing to listen. </p>

<p>If we approach new comers with the idea of &quot;accept all these truths or reject them all&quot; then we would not be able to get people to listen. So since their sub is about something rather specific that is the works of conspiratards, and wants to avoid topics that cause people to reject them right away, I can understand their position. I do agree that open discussion about everything is the best, but I also understand their point to not repel people right away from hearing their point. It is better to have people believe some of the truths, than none. </p>

<p>Especially since these conspiratards are attacking them with the anti-semitic accusation, and since <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a> main motive has nothing to do with holocaust, then makes little sense for them to debate that point strongly and risk losing supporters and destroying the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comments.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand the rhetorical strategy of throwing accusations of racism back at the conspiratard crew (hey, I do this too because it happens to be accurate).  And I understand not wanting to alienate people by discussing the Holocaust (I don&#39;t do it in polite company IRL either because of this reason).  </p>

<p>But I do think think the Holocaust subject is directly on point to the main purpose of NoLibsWatch.  They focus on the false cries of anti-semitism from conspiratard.  Dusty himself the other day <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23m2at/uswiss_confederate_accuses_rconspiracy_mods_of/cgyyeav?context=3">responded</a> to a comment of mine showing three full pages (!) of links he compiled showing the conspiratards fascination with alleging antisemitism and promoting a Jewish nationalist agenda.  </p>

<p>Equating questioning the Holocaust with antisemitism is at the core of this attack by conspiratard against this sub and NoLibsWatch.  And I understand it&#39;s a Herculean effort to try and change this taboo.  But I guess I differ on strategy.  It is something that needs to be attacked straight on--there is no other way.  And subs like these are the best places to be unapologetically honest . . . because it&#39;s the right thing to do.  This is where taboos change.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying I know for sure NoLibsWatch is actually working with NoLibs/Conspiratard, but it just hit me how this apparent rhetorical strategy actually gives away most of the store to the NoLibs/Conspiratard crew!  And the controlled opposition game is a common game, imo.  It&#39;s very convincing to have two groups appear to be locked in a fierce battle as they subtly sneak certain assumptions by you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Controlled opposition might exist commonly but I am just arguing against this being one. </p>

<p>Compared to all the other forms of arguments that are accused of anti-semitism, questioning holocaust is considered a whole level worse. So just because people are arguing against accusations of anti-semitism, doesn&#39;t mean they are often ready to tackle the bad connotation with the term &quot;holocaust denier&quot;. It is something that has strong emotional attachments and depth. The horror of the holocaust is etched into the minds of the people, and so it is just not something they are going to argue is not anti-semitic as compared to other arguments that get accused of it. Most people will listen to arguments that claim that speaking against Israeli government&#39;s murderous acts is not anti-semitism, but none of them will find it similarly easy to question the holocaust. </p>

<p>We need to sometimes pick our battles. If people aren&#39;t going to question the holocaust events, then there is no point in going that direction because frankly it is only going to alienate ourselves from them, and destroy any other progress we could have had in other directions. Instead of arguing against holocaust (which hardly anyone is going to listen to), we can place emphasis on zionists using holocaust as an excuse to do harm. </p>

<p>I am all in support of questioning everything, but if questioning something publicaly is doing more bad than good overall, then what&#39;s the point? You are not convincing anyone else because no one is ready to listen to it. All you end up doing is giving them more strong arguments for their accusations that we are anti-semites and preventing any kind of success from our other attempts to convince people. We can&#39;t battle on all fronts and convince people about the whole truth about everything, and frankly it is not necessary. It is more important that people put an end to all the harm that is being done now, rather than understand in full depth the events of the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I disagree with you on strategy.  I think sometimes you have to be willing to shock people to change taboos.  Just think about how shocking it was 20 years ago to see a gay kiss on t.v. and now it would hardly raise an eyebrow.  Change is not going to happen overnight.  And many people won&#39;t change their point of view on a first viewing but by challenging their assumptions it may click for them down the line.  I know this happened with me on 9/11.  I was very opposed to the idea it was a false flag attack and reacted with hostility to people making this case.  But after being exposed to this for a while I eventually got past the conditioning and looked into the details.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a reasonable point you make that you don&#39;t want to challenge people on this issue and would rather focus on Israel or Zionism.</p>

<p>The problem is when they ban people like me.  So it becomes less of an issue about strategy and an issue of picking sides.  They are actively helping the enemies of the truth, the conspiratards, and hurting their putative allies, all in the name of appearing more likeable.  </p>

<p>But sometimes one cannot pick one&#39;s allies.  You have to go to war with the army you have, in the words of Rumsfeld.  It&#39;s better to stick to one&#39;s principles and ones true allies rather than playing these cute games.  The same thing happened during the Occupy protests.  Protesters turned on one another and tried to kick out the wrong types of protestors (e.g. homeless people or drug addicts or anarchists).  We also see this in the conspiracy sub.  There is an large push for users to turn on one another because they are &quot;making the sub look bad.&quot;  This is a classic divide and conquer strategy used by enemies to get allies to turn on one another.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean but the priority should be kept on convincing more people, rather than feeling like we all have a freedom to say whatever we want. If we don&#39;t strategize then we are at a disadvantage. Truth is definitely hard to swallow, and so we should keep in mind to start small and help people build their way up, rather than convince them of all things (including arguing against the most strongly rooted beliefs). </p>

<p>I am all for joining people together, and I even started the sub <a href="/r/UnitedWeStand">/r/UnitedWeStand</a>  to do this. However, if we divide people over things that don&#39;t really matter, rather than get more people on our team and fight on issues of the present, then what&#39;s the point? Here is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/23uro2/new_york_times_admits_it_pushed_fabricated/">an example</a> that I just saw now. People who argued against NYTimes got heard, but when some tried to tell people the whole story about how NYTimes is a Jewish company and does propaganda for Israel, they got downvoted. So it is more important to state things in a manner that people can digest, than throw all of the truth at them because they are not ready for it and will just immediately reject it. It is not necessary for people to believe all of the conspiracies and see the whole depth of everything, in order to fight those who are conspiring against the people. </p>

<p>Divide and conquer is exactly what they are doing. So unless people can learn to see past differences, our arguments are only going to increase the division. So for now we need to unify with people on the ideas that everyone can believe, and use that strength to do good. Occupy movement failed because there was a lot of division, and so we have to first get people all on the same team to fight first. It is not important to convince them of truth they are not ready to listen, but more important that we fight against the enemy. </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think a ban was necessary, but perhaps you can talk to them to get unbanned. We are all on the same side, even though we have different strategies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between encouraging allies to use a different strategy and kicking them out and siding with the enemy to try to enforce your preferred strategy.</p>

<p>And I disagree that being able to talk about the Holocaust is no big deal.  The conspiratard and like minded trolls main weapon is the allegation of antisemitism and &quot;racism.&quot;  By agreeing with them that it&#39;s a problem and enforcing a similar taboo you only aid their side.  </p>

<p>Also, I saw that post about the NY Times.  Do you think posts like that should be censored?  I don&#39;t.  It&#39;s a valid argument and I happen to largely agree with it.  The New York Times has traditionally been a Jewish oriented newspaper and of course this is gong to lead to biases.  I myself did my own research on how the paper engaged in propaganda during WWI (which is an interesting history that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere, involving people that were later spies for the U.S. government).  In fact, that comment seems to be following your recommendation.  It is focusing on the New York Time&#39;s support of Zionism and pro war policies.  It has one reference to being Jewish owned and I don&#39;t see why this fact is not relevant or is somehow bigoted to point out.</p>

<p>Furthermore, pointing to voting patters means nothing!  This sub is heavily rigged.  In fact, that is precisely the comment that would have had 10 upvotes a year ago, now there is a push to get these types of comments out of this sub so we have a bunch of shill accounts downvoting it to hell (and who knows what other type of chicanery that is involved by the mods or admins).  <strong>The fact that comment is downvoted to hell tells me it is an incredibly effective comment!</strong>  And again, I differ with you on strategy.  Sometimes a confrontational or provocative or honest approach works very well.  Much better than pulling punches.  Of course that comment is being very respectful and is supported by facts and is well argued.  It&#39;s a good comment!  (except the references to Mondoweiss who I think is controlled opposition--which I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to admit to you . . . but you know, in the spirit of honesty . . . ).  </p>

<p>So yeah, good for you being focused on the divide and conquer strategies and thinking about how to stay unified . . . the only problem is the enemies are thinking about this too and often control the opposition to prevent a unified front.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should be able to click on my user profile and see the comments.  It was all a back and forth between me and <a href="/u/Aatxe">/u/Aatxe</a>.  </p>

<p>The mod that told me of the ban, <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a>, made one comment before banning me (I will try to screenshot the PMs).  Here&#39;s his comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Questioning the Holocaust does not make one a racist.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess it makes you either a racist, or an idiot.</p>

<p>&quot;9/11&quot;</p>

<p>Questioning 9/11 is a completely different kind of analogy, as &quot;questioning 9/11&quot; means questioning the official story as to what happened, not questioning how many people died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cojoco seems to be a mod at anti-SRS and is heavily focused on rooting out bigotry (and I don&#39;t like bigotry either but asking questions about a historical event is not bigotry--plus I don&#39;t agree in that type of censorship).  He made a recent <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/23p5pk/i_felt_this_comment_needed_more_attention_i_think/cgzqgg1">comment</a> at antisrs that they are trying to weed out &quot;anti-semitic&quot; hangers on at NoLibsWatch.  </p>

<p>So he&#39;s equating questioning the Holocaust with antisemitism which is one of the main agenda items of the conspiratards/NoLibs crew.  </p>

<p>Like I said, I like TheGhostofDusty and PMed with him before and enjoyed his work and actually thought we were pretty closely aligned (even though I&#39;m not a libertarian and more leftist).  We shared our past experience on other political boards and I&#39;m quite impressed with his thoroughness in monitoring the conspiratards.  </p>

<p>But giving them the ability to make the Holocaust taboo is a major victory for them and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this sub is next.  I am highly suspicious of reddit and it&#39;s impossible to know who is really running the show or if people are who they claim to be, which ironically is the same point cujoco makes <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensorship/comments/23td8g/exmod_davidreiss666_and_topmod_qgyh2_discuss/">here</a> on Reddit Censorship where he sort of defends DavidReiss666.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you.  Thanks for supporting my point.  There is no reason NLW can&#39;t have revisionist inquiry on its sub because it doesn&#39;t mean everyone on that sub supports that position.

<p>One of the goals (if not <strong>THE</strong> main goal) of the conspiratard/NoLibs crew is to label any subject about Jews or Israel that they don&#39;t like as &quot;antisemitic.&quot;  You reinforce that message by labeling a discussion about the Holocaust as &quot;denial&quot; and antisemitic.  You are doing their bidding on their most important goal!

<p>But questioning the Holocaust is not antisemitic.  So you are basically doing their dirty work for them by equating these two things.  </p>

<p>Is David Cole antisemitic?  I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m antisemitic.  Why is questioning official history bigoted?  </p>

<p>Under that logic questioning 9/11 makes you anti American.  Questioning the extent of Stalin&#39;s crimes makes you pro Communist and pro murder.  It&#39;s ridiculous and we don&#39;t apply such an intellectually dishonest standard to other historical inquiries (and throw people in jail for so inquiring!). </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a propaganda coup and it&#39;s sad to see NoLibsWatch taking the cowards way out and supporting such mindless propaganda . . . which also happens to be the main weapon the conspiratards use against them and others.  Unless it isn&#39;t an accident . . . </p>

<p>Both positions are usually true.</p>

<p>Of course there is value in discussing the historical circumstances of the Holocaust, but this discussion is often overrun by anti-Semitism, especially on reddit, and the discussion itself does not advance the goals of NoLibsWatch.</p>

<p>They had these laws (forbidding questioning the Holocaust) imposed upon them by the Allies as part of its &quot;de-Nazification&quot; and Psychological Operations conducted against Germany and Europe after the war.   The Allies subjected the German population to propaganda that now even conventional historians admit were lies (e.g. claiming the Germans made soap and lamp shades out of Jewish body parts, claiming Dachau had a gas chamber, etc.).  The Allies also used German slave labor for years after the war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nolibs seems to be a group of neoconservative propagandists.  Neoconservatism is actually a socialist movement, surprisingly enough, that has allied itself with the Republican party and evangelical movement in the United States.  The real neocon leadership (not their tea party tools) are mostly from a zionist new york academic group- the majority of them are jews from eastern europe.</p>

<p>So these brigaders certainly come across as &quot;right wing&quot;, and I guarantee that they were bush supporters, but in terms of the actual meaning of that word, I think you&#39;re right.  And they hate liberals and libertarians alike.  They&#39;ve got plenty of hate to go around.</p>

<p>As far as the purpose of that sub- I think it&#39;s just to monitor the dig patriots that brought their bury brigade over to reddit after sinking that ship.  Should probably leave the politics to other subs, like this one. Son...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading through your posts, it seems as though your case here is valid. Thanks for explaining it in detail. </p>

<p>Some people are just emotional about the subject that they rather not question it. They are definitely in the wrong for limiting discussion on the matter there, because I do believe everything should be questioned. </p>

<p>However, along the lines that you have stated, they might still be good and fighting on the right side... just not as inquisitive about everything. I have known them for a long while, and they are quite good at tracking and warning people against the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> group, and so they are still useful for that. Questioning old events that were instilled in them over a long period of time, is going to be hard to do. For all we know, they are only interested in seeing the deceit in current events, but at least that&#39;s better than complete ignorance. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think they are controlled opposition because they do seem to do things properly, but they are just not ready or feel the need to ask questions about everything, especially about their own long held beliefs. </p>

<p>Also as <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> stated, they might just not want to take it away from the sub&#39;s main point and don&#39;t want people attacking them for that, when their mission is something else completely. </p>

<p>Pretty interesting that so many subs that are sympathetic to this sub are now banning discussions of the Holocaust.  Again, I wonder how long until the conspiratards manage to get the rules changed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We allow discussion of sensitive racial issues so long as everything remains respectful and no racial slurs are used.</p>

<p>As outlined in rule #1 which I helped design myself. (And consequently <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> had a meltdown over)</p>

<p>As long as I am a mod here everyone will be allowed to respectfully discuss racial issues.  </p>

<p>My perspective of the necessity of discussion about racial issues is based upon two things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Racial issues are obviously real or racism wouldn&#39;t even be a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to discuss issues of any kind only serves to amplify the severity of those under discussed issues.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As an afterthought, the Nazi Germans and more so the SS proved that political alliances based upon racial heritage are extremely dangerous ideas.  It allows the members of such a system to dehumanize their perceived enemies and do horrible things such as the Holocaust.  Religious alliances are equally dangerous as human kind witnessed with the Inquisition.  This IMHO is why all eyes should be looking toward Zionist Israel.  They hold a unique crossover between religious and racial politics that has yet to be fully realized.  It could go either way, their Zionist politics could slowly be watered down by competing politics over the years until Zionism is all but forgotten or some yet to be seen event could ignite the powder keg and radicalize their nation even more.</p>

<p>Dangerous situation if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s good to hear that at least one mod here is applying the rules as written.</p>

<p>But other mods are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/23tenj/jew_world_order/ch0rcwj">removing content</a> they consider to be racist and banning users for it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please refrain from posting racist content here (i.e. blaming an entire race or religion for the conduct of multi-cultural globalists).</p>

<p>And I must ask that you please refrain from attacking other users, of which you have done multiple times in this thread alone.</p>

<p>If you continue to violate the rules, you may be banned as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But are you alleging that it&#39;s racist to question the Holocaust?</strong>  </p>

<p>And I find that interesting (although you are entitled to your opinion) that you appear to accept the official story of the Holocaust.  Thanks for the input.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In another discussion I came across this <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/01/05/260006815/the-ugly-fascinating-history-of-the-word-racism">NPR article</a> on the history of word &#39;racism.&#39;  It supports the rules as currently written:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over a century after [Richard Henry Pratt] was first recorded using the word, we still ask that question — is she or isn&#39;t she racist? — in situations where no clear answer would ever present itself. We argue about the composition of the accused&#39;s soul and the fundamental goodness or badness therein. But those are things we can&#39;t possibly know. And as we litigate that question, other more meaningful questions become obscured.</p>

<p>Racism remains a force of enormous consequence in American life, yet no one can be accused of perpetrating it without a kicking up a grand fight. No one ever says, &quot;Yeah, I was a little bit racist. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; That&#39;s in part because racists, in our cultural conversations, have become inhuman. They&#39;re fairy-tale villains, and thus can&#39;t be real.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no nuance to these public fights, as a veteran crisis manager told my colleague, Hansi Lo Wang. Someone is either a racist and therefore an inhuman monster, or they&#39;re an actual, complex human being, and therefore, by definition, incapable of being a racist.</p>

<p>But questioning the Holocaust is not antisemitic.  So you are basically doing their dirty work for them by equating these two things.  </p>

<p>Is David Cole antisemitic?  I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m antisemitic.  Why is questioning official history bigoted?  </p>

<p>Under that logic questioning 9/11 makes you anti American.  Questioning the extent of Stalin&#39;s crimes makes you pro Communist and pro murder.  It&#39;s ridiculous and we don&#39;t apply such an intellectually dishonest standard to other historical inquiries (and throw people in jail for so inquiring!). </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a propaganda coup and it&#39;s sad to see NoLibsWatch taking the cowards way out and supporting such mindless propaganda . . . which also happens to be the main weapon the conspiratards use against them and others.  Unless it isn&#39;t an accident . . . </p>

<p>Because you&#39;re promoting the idea that questioning the Holocaust is antisemitic.  </p>

<p>Because you banned me when I was respectfully debating the topic and I am not antisemitic.  </p>

<p>You could have simply said the topic is off limits (since you were creating a new rule) rather than banning me.</p>

<p><strong>In short, you&#39;re acting like a conspiratard by banning people for false accusations of antisemitism.</strong>  I find this amazing that you&#39;re doing this from a sub that purports to fight exactly this.</p>
