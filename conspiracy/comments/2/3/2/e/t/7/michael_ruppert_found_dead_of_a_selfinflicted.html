       IN MEMORIAM MICHAEL C. RUPPERT, February 3, 1951--April 13, 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunday night following Mike's Lifeboat Hour radio show, he was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. This was not a "fake" suicide. It was very well planned by Mike who gave us few clues but elaborate instructions for how to proceed without him. His wishes were to be cremated, and as of this moment, there are no plans for a memorial service. However, I will be taking his show this coming Sunday night, April 20, and the entire show will be an In Memoriam show for Mike with opportunities for listeners to call in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was my privilege to have known Mike for 14 years, to have worked with him, to have been mentored by him, and to have supported him in some of his darkest hours, including the more recent ones. I am posting this announcement with the blessing of his partner Jesse Re and his landlord, Jack Martin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you Mike for all of the truth you courageously exposed and for the legacy of truth-telling you left us. Goodbye my friend. Your memory will live in hour hearts forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no more details to share than I am posting here. We should have much more information by Sunday night.

       What elaborate instructions?  It seems like this was either foul play, or done in a way to make foul play suspect.  Why?

       Why does the title of this post assume as fact that Ruppert shot himself? He may well have done, but with no witnesses and no suicide note, how can we be certain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Ruppert have powerful enemies, who might have wanted to silence him? Quite probably. Would those powerful enemies have assassinated him in a way that made it appear to be suicide or an accident? Almost certainly.

       Terrible. Heartbreaking to think someone brave enough to speak the truth he knew and to fight for change would give up and take his own life. We can only speculate as to what happened at this point, but it's a great loss.

       Seems a little odd - he did a radio show hours before his "suicide" and made no reference whatsoever to anything that could be construed as "suspicious".  No send off, no long goodbye, no subtle clues (that I could tell at least).

       So what's strange about this is that Michael Ruppert has done Joe Rogan's podcast twice and the last time he appeared on there was in May of 2012 and he was as positive as I've ever heard him sound. The 1st time he did Rogan's podcast he was all doom and gloom, now granted this was almost 2 years ago that he was in good spirits and that is a long time, but that's the last I heard from him. I know he did that 6-part series for Vice called Apocalypse man, but I haven't seen that yet. Here's the link for the last Rogan podcast he did in May 2012:

       You should check out the Apocalypse, Man doc - pretty heavy stuff.  And he didn't give me the impression of a man planning to commit suicide.
