       I can show you a mountain of conflicting and contradictory evidence. I can show you in the original warrants that the police found a Savage .22 rifle with one spent shell in Nancy's BR...even though she was apparently shot 4 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can show you that the Newtown Bee had their article quoting the already dead principal cached the day before the event on the 13th.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can show you that LE found a envelope in the Lanza's with the dna of a convicted felon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can show you that the ME claimed Adam's GSW was "intra-oral"...even though LE say he shot himself in the back of the head (no small feat in itself)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell you what really happened...but I can tell you that whatever happened...it wasn't what we were told.

       Precisely. I'll be the first to admit that there's a lot of shite peddled as fact on both sides of the debate....but to say the report is evidence when it is so contradictory, full of anomalies...and so heavily redacted is utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell does a guy shoot himself in the head...leaving an exit wound through his hat...but not leave any blood or brain tissue inside the hat? That's the sort of question you're left asking when studying the official report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's evidence...but evidence of what? Certainly not of a self inflicted GSW through the head.

       It's truly a story that, from top to bottom, makes no sense whatsoever.  Nothing is explained completely, questions are left unanswered, answers that are given are contradictory or nonsensical, anyone who
       <em>
        asks
       </em>
       questions is attacked and ridiculed and called insensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: I honestly don't understand how anyone could spend an hour or two researching the "facts" of the case and not come away thinking, "What the fuck?  None of this makes any sense."
      </p>
      <p>
       And because nothing makes sense, we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       the "official story" was a blatant lie and, in turn, a cover up - regardless of what the actual truth of the situation is (which I'm still ultimately unsure of).

       It's a cluster-fuck from top to bottom. Even the apparent mood of those present that day. Parents hanging around the scene for hours giving interviews with their kids instead of going home and crying.....parents w/children casually walking by SWAT members with their rifles laying on the ground...dozens of people at the fire station. Dozens...not hundreds.

       This is the second article I wrote on this event and it focuses solely on the immediate aftermath in and around SHS. None of it seems "real".

      <p>
       Every breaking news story like this is full of contradictions in the beginning - every one!  And the reason is simple - reporters are trying to get any scrap of information and aren't generally very responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can hang so much weight on a tiny regional newspaper writing something like, "A woman who identified herself to our reporter as the principal of the school" doesn't carry much weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Official reports" are also generally riddled with minor errors like this.  If you were ever involved in some real world event, and then looked at the news reports, you'd probably be quite shocked at the number of small mistakes there were.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason is that the people who take these jobs often aren't particularly smart or hard-working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, IF you had some actual story that you were trying to gather evidence for, such details might be important.  But you're just on a fishing expedition, looking for a few dozen broken details out of thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it doesn't answer the question - why are these specific details significant in proving a conspiracy?  If there were a conspiracy, why would the medical examiner and, whatever an "LE" is have different stories?  And what difference does it make how Lanza died?   There are literally millions of felons in America - why is it so unlikely that one of them sent a letter to the school at some point?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're being constantly fucked over by our own government in obvious ways - and yet this sub is endlessly claiming that the usual mass shootings that occur with depressing regularity and do not seem to change the country one slight bit for anyone other than the victims and their families are in fact vastly complex conspiracy theories with no obvious goal, motive or plot.

       You make a great many unsubstantiated assumptions. So many in fact that I'm not going to even bother refuting them. You clearly have much to learn about the details of this event.

      <p>
       I'll give you this one, though...in regards to the weight I put into a tiny regional paper...in business in a tiny community since, what, 1887? Yeah...what would they know about the people that live there.

       can someone please show me what the actual hard evidence is supporting the notion than a 112-pound guy with autism carried all that weight in equipment and blasted his way into the school, killing 26 people with 27 bullets, but with not one frame of photograph or video evidence placing lanza there
      </p>

       just one picture - lanza either blasting his way into the school, or him walking through the halls with that equipment.  no blood, no bodies, no emotional manipulation - just him

       It's disingenuous to demand "hard evidence" about Sandy Hook from us, because it is the authorities who have redacted and/or withheld the crucial evidence that would prove whether Sandy Hook was a real event or a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the same token, you have no hard evidence that Sandy Hook was real, just official fabrications and media lies.

       All I've got that tells me it was probably real is the footage afterwards of the kids and parents gathering around while the police were investigating and (supposedly) carrying dead bodies away. That's about it. Mainstream media consensus doesn't really count for much these days, and neither does the general population consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really makes me want to question it is the fact that they chose to demolish the school right away, the fact that they are suppressing information like 911 calls, the father who set up a donation website for his dead daughter only a few hours later + his obvious pretending to be distraught when interviewed by the media...etc.

       Nobody saw footage of that. According to Wayne Carver, the chief medical officer, the "bodies" were transported out of Sandy Hook in unmarked vehicles, in the middle of the night. That is the official story.

       The government encouraged the manufacture and importation of military firearms for criminals to use. This is intended to foster insecurity, which would lead the american people to voluntarily disarm themselves by passing laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called 'Orion', the CIA inculcated in these people the desire to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the anti gun lobby. - William cooper, behold a pale horse

       I don't have those figures to hand, but from what I've read on Sandy Hook there wasn't any CCTV coverage worth talking about, just a standard door entry system. They don't usually have a recording system either.

       Those seem to be the common security system in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's no information that categorically states that the school had an internal CCTV system, it's probably the case that it didn't.

       It seems to me that those who believe this was staged are falling victim to a glaring logical inconsistency.
      </p>
      <p>
       1- "official" government reports are not to be trusted
       <br/>
       2- TV news, newspapers, magazines, etc... are not to be trusted
       <br/>
       3- strangers on the internet are to be completely trusted as long as they agree with 1 &amp; 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't go to Sandy Hook and do their own research... so I don't understand how/why they trust ANY source of information.  what makes Alex Jones more credible than Brian Williams?  I could understand thinking that everyone and everything should be untrusted... which would mean without direct investigation (not on the internet) no information could ever be known.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, they should question everyones reporting equally.  but they don't, they weight heavily on the side of the least credible sources (those that profit from lying, without any risk if caught).

       The fact that they provided actual evidence in the form of researching publicly available information.

       Also the fact that the MSM has lost
       <em>
        all

       credibility at this point - they're paid to mislead, lie, and downplay stories like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that the "official story" of Sandy Hook is full of holes and has no credibility whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that this user was attacked and ridiculed all over reddit from day one of posting facts about SH and, as mentioned, had three accounts and two

       </em>
       completely banned.

       I don't "believe" either at face value.  I try to research multiple sources from multiple angles and glean what truth I can from all of it.  In this case, the user I'm referring to provided much more in the way of truth than the MSM did or has (in my opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       And whether I "believed" the user or not, why would anyone give the MSM the benefit of the doubt at this point?  It should be clear by now that they're completely full of shit and have been for quite some time.

       I think the reports themselves ARE the evidence... if you don't believe that evidence then you need to show evidence to the contrary.  (you don't NEED to, but you should be able to otherwise your beliefs are without merit).

       Reports are not evidence, they speculations or allegations until proven. I can "report" that all wounds were from long guns yet a rifle was found in the car. That doesn't make it evidence.
      </p>

       Evidence is the dead bodies, the actual guns used, etc. Propaganda pushing a tall-tale is not evidence.

       you're suggesting that reported evidence doesn't count as evidence because it isn't viewed directly.... that isn't really how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       eyewitness accounts are evidence (though not very reliable).... physical evidence is reported by others and taken as evidence (they don't bring dead bodies into a courtroom to be examined by a jury/judge but rather use reports by the medical examiner and police as source material).  DNA evidence is offered by "experts" and not analyzed directly by the court but by others who "report" on their findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's how society functions... you can of course throw specific reports into question, or specific reporters (experts) can be shown invalid.  that is done by showing evidence that these sources are untrustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       essentially an individual cannot be everywhere and an expert in everything.... so we have to find credible sources and accept third party evidence until/unless we find better contradictory evidence.  the contradictory evidence will also not likely be first hand foremost people, but simply reported to us from a better, ore credible source.

       didn't say it was truth... can you read?  said it was evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have contradictory evidence than you should believe that.... if you have nothing to contradict a specific reported narrative, you can still believe whatever you want.... but you cant claim that your narrative is more credible without SOME evidence to suggest it.
      </p>
      <p>
       a motive isn't evidence to an action, it simply explains why one MIGHT commit an activity.... not if they actually did.  it is a good first step, but should be followed by more.  You may have the motive to kill someone, but that doesn't mean you did, just that it should be looked into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an issue when someone claims to know something for certain without any reasoning or proof that their theory has merit. certainty without evidence gets thrown out a lot around here and its annoying.

       you don't understand what evidence is.... but that seems fairly common.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a TV report is, in general, a reporting of a number of things.  official police reports, eyewitness accounts via interviews, court records (when a trial occurs), sometimes also visual accounts of an events aftermath (on-site reporting).
      </p>
      <p>
       The official police report can be wrong... non-factual... misleading.  essentially a lie.
       <br/>
       the "eyewitnesses" could be fakes.... plants..... people who are part of a system feeding misinformation.  essentially a lie.
       <br/>
       The court records could be based on falsehoods... artifacts of a broken system... essentially products of a lie
The visual accounts could be misinterpreted... exaggerated... shown with specific goals in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       all this evidence could be fabricated... and should be questioned... but fake evidence is still evidence.  I would need to have evidence to suggest these other things are faulty.  the OP is simply asking for that evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you suggesting that the TV reports are based on nothing... fabricated entirely by the news anchors... based on nothing at all.  That too would require some evidence that TV news collaborates to fully manufacture whole events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish I didn't have to teach basic logic, or basic English when trying to have a discussion.  it is so time consuming and doesn't seem to work well.

       You really think the reports had a shred of evidence? Because they claimed an awful lot, and an awful lot was factually incorrect

      <p>
       lets have an actual discussion:
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as I'm aware the official report is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       a mentally unstable man named Adam Lanza, got a weapon and fatally shot his mother... he then went to the elementary school his mother worked, and killed 20 children and 6 adult faculty.  He then shot and killed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       That really isn't an awful lot to report (I did it in 3 sentences)... and I'm unsure what exactly is factually inaccurate about that.  Why is this considered factually inaccurate?  It seems like a straight forward tragedy without too much intrigue.  Is it believed that this never occurred at all?  did the press make it up?  did the government officials in the small town of Newton CT concoct it?  why would they go along with this story and pretend that their kids were murdered?  Does Newton CT not exist at all?  what motive does the Mayor of that town have to make its name synonymous with mass shooting?  how about the residents of that town?
      </p>
      <p>
       it is such a far fetched theory that it requires some serious evidence... its not far fetched to think someone walked into a school and caused mayhem (because that happens a lot).... and can be done by almost anyone that wants to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get it... help me understand your viewpoint.

       You know that's not all they said on 12/14/12, that's oversimplified. They first reported it was Ryan Lanza, factually incorrect. They reported the gun used was a rifle, factually incorrect. They reported a suspect in the surrounding forest, but that's not a topic of discussion anymore. Medical examiner said guns that were used were rifles, factually incorrect. State police said they would prosecute those who pushed false information, incorrect, if they really did the major news outlets would be getting investigated. Incorrect information on the gun in the trunk, some said rifle others said shotgun, can't be both so someone was factually incorrect there too.the list goes on

       What about the "nuns" seen leaving the scene?  Probably the weirdest aspect of the entire thing and it seems to have vanished down the memory hole.

       ok... so factual errors are what concerns you.  that makes sense.

       the media is horrible.... I dont think anyone could argue against the general incompetence of the MSM.

        okay... do you know this "someone"?

      <p>
       No, I don't - not personally.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why is this "someone" more believable than anyone in the MSM?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The fact that they provided actual evidence in the form of researching publicly available information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that the MSM has lost
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       credibility at this point - they're paid to mislead, lie, and downplay stories like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that the "official story" of Sandy Hook is full of holes and has no credibility whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that this user was attacked and ridiculed all over reddit from day one of posting facts about SH and, as mentioned, had three accounts and two
       <em>
        entire subreddits
       </em>
       completely banned.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WHY do you believe one group and not the other?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't "believe" either at face value.  I try to research multiple sources from multiple angles and glean what truth I can from all of it.  In this case, the user I'm referring to provided much more in the way of truth than the MSM did or has (in my opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       And whether I "believed" the user or not, why would anyone give the MSM the benefit of the doubt at this point?  It should be clear by now that they're completely full of shit and have been for quite some time.
