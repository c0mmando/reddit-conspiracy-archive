       Hey, this is an impassioned plea. There is a very, very important situation killing the United States, and is orchestrated at the highest echelons. The actions of these people demonstrate that they are determined to completely dismantle the United States by, in effect, taking away our Constitutional Rights, including our right to own property, and the power of our votes, and to put all the power in their hands. These people have the money to buy all the big media channels, including Reddit, and all the other ones, and are censoring all the media, and all the news, so that the American people never get to know what is going on here. This criminal entity is hiding from the public eye behind the front known as the "Federal Reserve". It is the cause of the monstrosity that is the wealth distribution:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slTF_XXoKAQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slTF_XXoKAQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Federal Reserve" is privately owned, yet it’s name was hand picked to confuse the American people into thinking that is is part of Our Government, when it is the opposite. The "Federal Reserve" is a pipeline that sends 40% of our taxes directly into the owners pockets. Here is their scam: when the United States needs money it goes to the "Federal Reserve" to get it, and all the "Federal Reserve" does is print the dollar notes for very low cost(amounts to pennies), then the "Federal Reserve" gives it to the United States and charges interest on it. One trillion dollars, year after year, of our money, that we worked hard for, is rapidly pocketed to the owners of the "Federal Reserve" in private accounts held offshore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owners are those who hold stock in the "Federal Reserve" bank, and only “certain people” are allowed to own such stock, and they pass these stocks along to their dastardly heirs who keep this fanatical plan going. It is not even known who these owners are, since the "Federal Reserve" absolutely refuses to be audited by the United States. See
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hikur9U1cXA">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to post to Reddit about this issue, but Reddit is censoring such links from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . The link is a link from a trusted transparent non-profit news source
       <a href="http://therealnews.com">
        http://therealnews.com
       </a>
       The "Federal Reserve" have been censoring all media and news that exposes their criminal acts, since they have a near complete strangle hold on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easy to see that with the incomparable amount of wealth that the owners of the "Federal Reserve" have accumulated they are poisoning the not just the United States, but also the entire world. It is common knowledge that companies they own like Monsanto, and Haliburton, among others, have special loopholes written into the laws that protect their operations that poison the human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owners of the “Federal Reserve” are funding the above, and starting and funding wars just to play both sides against the other. The "Federal Reserve" creates economic bubbles all over the world, and then purposely crashes them, so that they can make extreme profit. The owners of the "Federal Reserve" have bought the politicians, as well as the news and media, and uncensored news and media is the last hope to get this information out to the American People, but as you know the owners of the "Federal Reserve" are attempting to own the entire internet by doing alway with net neutrality rules, and they are actually trying to do this right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In October 2013, Carmen Segarra was fired from the "Federal Reserve" when she wrote a truthful report on it, this is corroborated by
       <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10882">
        http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10882
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, Glen Beck exposed the "Federal Reserve" and was then fired by Fox news.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB5LK-jihgk">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This monstrous robbery of the American people can go on no longer, it is imperative that the truth is bill boarded to the American people by a platform where they can get the truth, and actually understand it, and not through Reddit, Reddit is bullshit, it is no longer Alexis Ohanian’s platform, it is owned by the owners of the "Federal Reserve" now, and this is proven by the fact that they will sensor the link from The Real News Network, you can even test this yourself, (though will they possibly enable it now if they see this message on your forum, to try to hide the fact that they are censoring)
       <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10882">
        http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10882
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, Alexis himself even said that he wouldn’t use Reddit as a democratic platform, and this is probably why, because the moderators are now on the owners of the "Federal Reserve"’s payroll, as are many politicians, who are employed by the "Federal Reserve" on the weekends for very large amounts of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see from this writing, and in the reference links below, the American People have not been awakened to this monstrosity, because if they were this situation would never be going down right now. The American people need to be given this information in a simple, yet informative understandable way, since their ability to understand it is usually clouded by complexity, censorship, misinformation, being too busy, and un education.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that many people don't understand is that you need government to stop people, and government from fucking you over, and that is what the Constitution is for, that is why the Constitution needs to be upheld and enforced. The owners of the “Federal Reserve” are using all that money to pry away our Constitutional Rights one at a time, yet are free from prosecution while hiding behind that front. It is time to abolish paying any interest at all to the owners of the privately owned “Federal Reserve” for money they printed for pennies.

       “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” – Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809)

       Fast forward to 9/11, Iraq war for oil, and the economic crash in 2008 and you now see clearly what he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The reason for 9/11 was because Iraq decided to sell oil in Euros, which was not allowed by the privately owned “Federal Reserve” who commanded Iraq MUST sell oil in USD.)

       Recently, it is likely flight 370 was hijacked using drone technology in airliners, to get rid of the 4 Chinese software engineers present on that flight that were 20% sharers of an open patent for aircraft cloaking technology with Freescale semi-conductor which owned the other 20% so the whole patent would go to Freescale, which is owned by the owners of the “Federal Reserve. This patent was passed 4 days after the plane went missing, giving Freescale 100% of the patent, since the other 4 open patent sharers were eliminated.

       Rothschilds gain ownership of this patent:

       The real problem is what has allowed the private corporation known as the Fed to keep operating on American soil, along with other idiotic policies of it's ilk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of this country pay around $5 trillion a year in taxes to local, state, and federal agencies.  Just to give you an idea of where I am going with this, JP Morgan corporation is worth around $2 trillion.  Over the course of an average lifetime, the American people could buy JP corp 200 times.  Just let that sink in.

       Solid post. It is an aspect that is not understood by many. We can't be the only country to remove the central banks, as a world, we would need to purge them. If we dropped them, then war would be declared by other countries. Look at the war of 1812, Jackson assassination attempt, Lincoln assassination, world war 1 after we implemented the "federal" reserve, world war 2 with Germany, Iraq, Syria, and maybe I'm not up to date with Russia wanting to start its new currency and now we are trying to instigate them. It is a battle that I'm sure a lot of countries are not ready for and don't want, so they let these snakes ruin their countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all starts with the bankers. Too bad our schools just teach propaganda and not the real sides to history. Maybe then we could see a pattern in the world and learn from it and not think what is happening now is new.

       We'll written Sir. I try to educate people myself but we are always deemed unpatriotic or crazy. I don't think anything will change in our lifetime sadly, most people are clueless and the others don't give a fuck. People believe what they read on fox or cnn because the media is not being manipulated (ha).

       All of your section about MH370 has been debunked. The patent was issued to Freescale Semiconductors and Freescale Semiconductors alone. Freescale Semiconductors is a publicly owned company via stock shares. The men credited on the patent do not own any of the patent. Nor were the men on the flight manifest for MH370.

       You have lots of basic facts about the Federal Reserve wrong. For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The "Federal Reserve" is a pipeline that sends 40% of our taxes directly into the owners pockets. Here is their scam: when the United States needs money it goes to the "Federal Reserve" to get it, and all the "Federal Reserve" does is print the dollar notes for very low cost(amounts to pennies), then the "Federal Reserve" gives it to the United States and charges interest on it. One trillion dollars, year after year, of our money, that we worked hard for, is rapidly pocketed to the owners of the "Federal Reserve" in private accounts held offshore.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. Just no. This is all wrong. It is just not true that 40% of our taxes go to the Federal Reserve. In recent years (since 2008), the Federal Reserve has given the federal government
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more money that the government has given to the Fed. In the six decades before that, about 2% of the net interest on the debt went to the Federal Reserve. It is a very small portion of taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve is responsible for distributing Federal Reserve notes, but they don't charge interest on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government doesn't borrow money directly from the Federal Reserve, it sells Treasury securities (bonds and bills) at auction to anyone who will buy them. The Federal Reserve later purchases a portion of them on the secondary market. Those do earn interest for the Federal Reserve, but most of that goes back to the federal government.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The owners are those who hold stock in the "Federal Reserve" bank, and only “certain people” are allowed to own such stock, and they pass these stocks along to their dastardly heirs who keep this fanatical plan going. It is not even known who these owners are, since the "Federal Reserve" absolutely refuses to be audited by the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are
       <em>
        12
       </em>
       regional Federal Reserve Banks, not one. There is a mixture of public and private control of the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs)
      </p>
      <p>
       The stock of each FRB is owned by all the member banks in that region. There is absolutely no secret about it, at all. You can find the names of the banks on the web sites of each of the 12 regional FRBs, or from
       <a href="http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp">
        this FDIC form
       </a>
       . Search for Bank Charter Classes "N" and "SM".
      </p>
      <p>
       The stock cannot be traded. Each member bank is told how much stock it must own based on its balance sheet. The stock entitles the member bank to an annual dividend of 6% of the value of the stock it owns. But, regardless of how much stock the bank owns, it only gets two votes for directors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each FRB is controlled by a board of 9 directors. The big banks in each region pick two directors, the medium-sized banks pick two, and the small banks pick two. Then the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (which is a federal agency) picks 3 directors to represent the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the FRBs pay the dividend to the member banks,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the rest of the profit goes to the federal government. It's been doing that since 1947.

       The fact that the profit is less than expected doesn't change the fact that the fed has total control the money supply as well as "loses" money whenever it wants at the cost the American tax payer. And since it cannot be audited there is no way to track the depth of corruption.

       Except the President of the United States appoints the seven members of the Board of Governors; they must then be confirmed by the Senate. As per the Banking Act of 1935. So the fact that the regulation of the Fed is actually federally operated and their responsibility is to report to Congress on the Feds actions twice a year means yes...they can easily be audited.

       Reporting to congress does not mean audited. Last time bernanke went before congress he was asked to explain where billions of dollars went and he simply said "I don't know" and nothing was done. The fed is immune. They have owned every president since Woodrow Wilson barring JFK. The entire point of this discussion is pointing out the fact that the fed, due to control of the money supply, also controls who gets into government. The president appoints whomever they tell them to appoint. If not, they get to see the photos of what really happened to JFK.
