       This is for informational and speculative purposes only. This is not medical advice. Licensed health practitioners are available for this purpose.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Although the following tends to find fault with many vaccines and the vaccine industry, if you're going to read this,
       <em>
        please
       </em>
       review the copious amount data compiled by official sources of vaccine information, including the FDA, CDC, WHO, as well as the pharmaceutical companies themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only then will it become possible to have a serious, informed discussion about this unbelievably complex topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too often are such conversations suppressed or dismissed because “the science is in” on the subject of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an attempt to offer the
       <em>
        decreasingly
       </em>
       blasphemous view that the science is not, in fact, “in.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This statement, and the following material, isn't meant to argue that the
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       behind vaccination is flawed.
       <em>
        Vaccines do work. This has been demonstrated again and again.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       ...in humanity's desperation to overcome the terror of crippling pandemics, inexcusable and irreparable mistakes were made in the frantic rush to rid mankind of the devastating effects these diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about autism. This isn't about global “population reduction” reduction programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about very real, and very frightening, mistakes that have made in the history of the development of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about the obfuscation of the early history of vaccination...obfuscation which continues to this day, and which has the detrimental effect of stifling a serious debate on this vitally important subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only has the discussion on vaccine safety become completely polarized, but it also has devolved into a false dichotomy: you're either “pro”-vaccine or “anti”-vaccine. This has had the extremely unfortunate effect of severely limiting the conversation. Sadly, many important topics today have fallen victim to this false dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before continuing, I'd like to acknowledge a few books that opened my eyes to this controversial but fascinating field of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first is
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Virus-Vaccine-Contaminated-Government/dp/0312342721">
        The Virus and the Vaccine
       </a>
       , a fascinating true story of the contamination of the polio vaccine with a cancer-causing monkey virus (full text available
       <a href="http://www.vaksinite.info/The%20Virus%20and%20the%20Vaccine.html">
        here
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second is
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Marys-Monkey-Cancer-Causing-Assassination/dp/0977795306">
        Dr. Mary's Monkey
       </a>
       . Although I didn't use this book as a source, it's a thrilling story in its own right, and weaves together the JFK assassination, the contaminated polio vaccine scandal, and a secret project to develop a bio-weapon to kill Fidel Castro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly I owe much of this research to the indispensable
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Concerned-Families-Practitioners-Edition/dp/188121737X">
        Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners.
       </a>
       The thousands of references provided have proved to be a veritable gold mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a work in progress. Please let me know if you find any typos, inaccuracies, or bad links.

       When it comes to scientific claims my minimum bar is that if you have to submit something it has undergone peer review for me to even bother with it. You still have to be somewhat skeptical of peer reviewed articles but if it hasn't even undergone that you should just dismiss it immediately.

       No. No it isnt.  God grief no that is exactly what it is NOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Formal peer review as recognised by mainstream science is, essentially, a highly critical &amp; almost destructive process.
       <br/>
       Which is what it should be: if your research survives proper peer review, its good science  (you can have good science with out peer review, or course, but if you want it published in a reputable journal it will be subjected to pr.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Experts in the field your research paper is in (and the techniques it has employed) are selected by the journal that is considering publication..and they will thoroughly review your paper and look for weakness i.e. bad science: anything that means your conclusions are invalid, or too-great-a-leap from your results.
       <br/>
       Then they'll make recommendations, query your approach. Suggest ways to improve the paper so that the journal isnt embarrassed by publishing a shitty paper(reputations are fragile).
       <br/>
       (note that the peers and the authoring scientist wouldnt communicate directly: the peers are anonymous, and independent/anonymous to each other).
      </p>
      <p>
       They pick holes in your work.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Then the journal can accept and publish (if the criticism are minor, but the reviewers agree that the science is good. Note there are ALWAYS criticisms. Peer review can be a tough process for someone who is not used to it).
      </p>
      <p>
       -Or reject it..until the authoring scientist can e.g. improve the research or clarify anything that may simply be badly written (but was actually perfectly good science)
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not perfect of course, and mistakes can be made: the reviewers are human &amp; only have the paper they are given and must assume that it faithfully represents actually conducted work.
       <br/>
       But the more well known sorts of mistakes tend to be due to:
       <br/>
       -outright lying about the research (e.g. Andrew wakefield; that japanese guy who said he cloned a human)
      </p>
      <p>
       -collusion with an editor of the journal to publish bad science deliberately: this is how creationists managed to get an ID paper in a leading journal (somrhting that journal had to do a lot of explaining to recover their damaged reputation).
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the most part...very much the most part, it works. And when it fails: its actually a continuation of the scientific review process that leads to uncovering the problem. This usually happens when other researchers cannot understand why they cannot reproduce the same results.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no...Peer Review is NOT like getting some people on the internet to proof read.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I am on the subject: reputable journals with good scientific research are looking out for good science that will reinforce their reputation. You would never have to pay such a journal to publish your good science. gold is in demand.
       <br/>
       Shitty science can (usually) only get published if you pay someone to do so.  e.g. Jones/Harrits 9/11 related thermite paper.  (which was NOT properly peer reviewed: you can tell by reading it). The journals that need paying to publish something dont really have many scientists wanting to have their publication.

       Peer review doesn't mean much. You can fake all your data and still pass peer review. In fact, what's worse, often peer review will outright reject new information simply because it may introduce a new paradigm, even when the data is solid.

       Other experts in the field are
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to run the same tests to see if they can duplicate the results. I'm not saying peer review is perfect but it should be the bare minimum. It is a waste of time just reading blogs.

       Yes replication is a very important part of the scientific method, however, that has nothing to do with peer review.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm glad you brought this up as well. See, we still see problems with this idea of replication. For example, the FDA requires 3 studies showing that a drug is better than placebo (among other requirements) before it can be approved as a drug. This suggests that the data has been replicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, someone can run as many trials as they want, hiding all the trials which showed no difference, and only publish the ones that, by sheer chance, show a positive result. In the research community, 1 in 20 trials of placebo vs placebo will yield a "statistically significant" difference. Not to mention that nocebos (placebos with adverse effects) have a stronger placebo effect. Meaning, I can make a useless drug that makes you feel sick and it will often show a statistical benefit over standard placebo. Doesn't matter what the disease is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to the drug scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't until decades later when several independent researchers, who, as you have suggested, managed to successfully produce and publish the true negative results (which is difficult due to inadequate funding and publication bias - ie journal editors are less likely to publish studies with negative results) are able to compile enough published studies to create a meta-analysis that has a definitive answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally by that point, the drug patents have usually run out and drug companies are no longer interested in defending the drug. They've already moved on to market some other shiny pill with a sexy name.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing this corruption in action right now with many cholesterol lowering drugs like ezetimibe, and diabetic drugs like the sulfonylureas.

       You sound like you know a bit on the subject of peer review. Are you a scientist perhaps? What you say is intriguing but I would like to know what these 'other requirements' are. Because by the end of the post I was left with the impression there weren't any. Also would be nice to have some references for some of these assertions.

       The other requirements are simply demonstrating the adverse effects of the so called drug and also demonstrate how the drug is metabolized (to indicate if it will interact with other drugs or create more adverse effects in liver/renal impaired patients).

       This is the shit that holds us back. If you guys don't vaccinate will spread disease. This shit has worked for years and works fantastic. I don't give two fucks if some fat old guy is getting filthy rich the vaccines work.

       They point out in the video of throwing the balls at the little figures to show the difference of vaccinated and not vaccinated. Do you think it was a coincidence that those who weren't vaccinated were much much much more likely to die than those who had been?

       I kind of think its an interesting experiment....  I'd love to see the mods taking an active role in doing immense amounts of research, compiling it, and providing that content for the forum (and all of reddit) to delve into.
      </p>

       I wrote my first conspiracy research paper for the forum a couple years back... it was a damn good paper I thought, well researched... but got downvoted into oblivion - without comment.  The sticky is an effective weapon against downvote brigades.

       This is not the kind of crap that makes anyone look crazy.   This is the kind of crap that you disagree with and therefore would rather just remove it from the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why conspiracy has turned into fringe politics, because everyone down votes everything that upsets their fuzzy world view regardless of the quality of the analysis contained in the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have so many competing dogmas here that nothing interestingly "conspiracy" gets to the front page.  And every time someone's pet issue gets tarnished its "this is why people laugh and call us crazy! Boo hoo"
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly man, this is conspiracy and I can't think of a more appropriate place for people to discuss taboo subjects that may be considered anti-vax by the Almightily immune herd.

Then again, I was born and I live in Poland where big (hah, I wrote pig first) pharma is still fighting with our own post-soviet era pharma companies and I suspect that vaccines here are safer than in US.

       We actually tried that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to put up sticky polls asking the community to nominate and vote for what would be stickied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained very carefully what the requirements for a sticky were such as "it must be a self post, can not be a link"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one single nomination was one that could be stickied.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the mods vote on what we sticky, or we use the sticky to petition community feed back on an issue.

       They point out in the video of throwing the balls at the little figures to show the difference of vaccinated and not vaccinated. Do you think it was a coincidence that those who weren't vaccinated were much much much more likely to die than those who had been?

       My dear axolotl_peyotl a fantastic piece. One must be careful when including this much data in a post however, for misinformation is insipid. Always find the data.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gerald Myers, a genetic sequencing expert with Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico, tracked the evolution of HIV[8] and confirmed that today's major subtypes of the AIDS virus in humans appear to have arisen as recently as 1960.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Gerry (or Gerald) Myers may have said that (arisen as recently as 1960) at one point in his long and connected career with tracking HIV evolution.... but his last paper made no such claim... his last paper was very clear. 1970. PUNCTUATED EVENT. IATROGENIC. And is hardly ever talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.aidsorigins.com/sites/all/files/pdfs/rs/burr.pdf">
        HIV did not evolve via natural means. The same parent virus evolved simultaneously across the planet - into nine distinct but similar outbreaks.  The measured genetic change points to this common ancestor being distributed around the globe in "a punctuated event in the 1970s." It's clear as day something iatrogenic, sudden, and global in scale happened to create the HIV outbreak.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Myers left Los Alamos shortly thereafter and retired to Santa Fe. He passed in 2011. Very little can be found about him. It's even difficult to find that he died. The only obituary was written by his colleague and partner at LANL since the beginning...

      <p>
       When you talk to Dr Foley it becomes clear he communicates in subtext. This obituary is full of it.  I will point out what he is subversively referencing below as continue my critique of the research on the topic.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Beginning in the early 1980s, simultaneous outbreaks of Kaposi sarcoma and serious opportunistic infections (later associated with AIDS) were reported[2] among homosexual men, especially in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. This time span coincides with the average incubation period between HIV infections and the development of AIDS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh you touch on it so closely, but don't give the coverage it deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simultaneous outbreaks, in a very specific sub culture, in two very specific cities at a very specific time. We had a very abnormal medical event happening on both sides of the country that only affected people that identified as "gay". This wasn't a slightly elevated incidence in self identified "gay". We're not talking like oh it was 60% gays and 20% women and 20% straight men... Were talking 99% gays. No biological agent can accomplish that initial 4 years through natural evolution and transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The culprit is pretty poorly hidden.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dr. Michele Carbone openly acknowledged HIV/AIDS was spread by the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck &amp; Co. during the early 1970s.[11]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, you've made yet another error and omission. First, the programs you are referring were the LATE 1970s.
       <a href="http://www.rense.com/1.imagesH/broch.jpg">
        Second, this vaccine program was a trial, that was marketed only to GAY MEN.
       </a>
       And third, this trial took place SIMULTANEOUSLY, in NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is where Dr. Foley's subtext becomes crystal clear
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He was among the first people to fully realize the implications of HIV diversity
        <strong>

        grasping immediately that this virus was going to present a great challenge for vaccine design
        <strong>

      <p>
       <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt30000449;NAAN=13030&amp;amp;doc.view=frames&amp;amp;chunk.id=d0e969&amp;amp;toc.depth=1&amp;amp;toc.id=d0e969&amp;amp;brand=calisphere">
        We actually have a pretty lengthy and damning interview from the Doctor that ran the San Francisco cohort of this vaccine program about what the program did, what it observed, and how it was affected by the AIDS outbreak.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this interview, he catalogs how after giving the vaccine to a small group of the gay community, they began to observe a steady increase in the incidence of chronic hepatitis. He catalogs how the vaccine was made from the blood of men which chronic hepatitis.  Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver... which is the most important organ of the immune system.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This HIV to AIDS theory means something would have had to go around and simultaneously "HIV'd" a shit load of gay men in new york and san francisco, in the EARLY 1970s.... and then through some miracle of nature... the virus remained, largely unevolved, in New York and San Francisco.. for a decade.... silently spreading to infect a significant chunk of gay men in these two cities, but very few others. 10 years of natural human being movement, and somehow 90% of the infected stayed in the same city and sub culture...
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that single cause simply falls apart under analysis. What makes more sense is that the vaccination program, that occured in these two cities, in gay men, 2 years before, that observed an increase in hepatitis after they distributed the "vaccine" ......  actually injected something into these people that rapidly spread and destroyed the communities in which it was introduced - and then continued to spread outside of that. HIV makes a clear evolution from solely gays of New York and San Francisco to women and the rest of the planet over the next 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then talks about how this program was the first thing the CDC investigated as the AIDS outbreak began.
      </p>
      <p>
       The director of the vaccine study chronicles how he was provided funding by the CDC to follow up with his cohort shortly after the start of the outbreak. He talks about the secrecy involved with the patients identities - and how he couldn't find a lot of them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1982, the CDC concluded that such outbreaks “strongly suggests the occurrence of a single epidemic of underlying immunosuppression....” The next year, HIV was identified as the causative agent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And he talks about how the CDC only funded a few of this half-ass studies from him before putting all its money behind Robert Gallo's HIV theory of AIDS. No conclusions or papers or audits or analysis or peer reviews were ever done of the data he supposedly collected about the cohort he "vaccinated".
      </p>
      <p>
       Being the diligent scientist he was, he formed a sound scientific basis for the coincidence of the vaccine programs and the outbreak.... serendipity
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some people have said that even the hepatitis study was all a big front for something else that was going on on an even larger level than we realized.... I really do think it was
        <strong>
         serendipity
        </strong>
        that we were doing the hepatitis B trials at the same time that the AIDS epidemic broke.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, Dr. Foley's mastery of subtext shines to the informed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Through this
        <strong>
         serendipitous event [making a refernce to the "serendipity" cause of AIDS presented by the vaccination program director]
        </strong>
        , he took a close look at HIV sequence alignments, and was struck by the extent of the genetic differences between the earliest US/French HIV isolates and African HIV isolates
        <strong>
         [The extent of genetic differences was non-existant as he points out in his last paper.]
        </strong>
        He understood immediately that this was an extraordinary virus
        <strong>
         [ In that it was created and spread through vaccines that may or may not have been purposefully contaminated by the biological weapons entity of the government weapons-laboratory network he worked for. ]
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At this point I would like to share Dr. Foley's first words to me in a forum conveniently destroyed from the public record...  Emory University offered a Coursera course on AIDS... Myself and another person took to the forums to begin posing some of the questions about the science and the history.  Much to my suprise, Dr. Foley responded to a post I made in the forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       It started "sorting information from misinformation is an important exercise".  Like I said he is a master of subtext.
      </p>

      <p>
       While the OPV hypothesis, the green monkey hypothesis, the military pathogen hypothesis, maurice hilleman was a lone wolf actor.... all are intriguing on some level.... they will always be heresay and conspiracy theory.... And they all direct your attention away from what happened in 1978-79 when
       <strong>
        serendipity
       </strong>
       began to systematically cull the gay populations in New York and San Francisco.

       Was it now? Pretty sure what i linked to above illustrates quite clearly HIV was not "silently snaking around" in the 1970s. It shows FIV, which does in fact snake around. But with HIV the same genetic strain teleports across the planet and simultaneously starts 9 different outbreaks across the planet. Nothing was snaking. It exploded.

      <p>
       Was it now? To claim to kill every known virus is pretty much nonsense scientifically. This was blood from a hybrid population of gay men with chronic hepatitis that slowly degraded their livers and immune system. As a result of this weakened immune system the blood that this was manufactured from was often coinfected with a whole slew of pathogens that thrived in human blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they took blood from the most chronically diseased people -  blood teeming with diseases that could not be cleared by the immune system - mixed it up... let hilleman throw some bleach on it, and turned around and injected it right back into 600 gay men. The vaccine trial doctors then observed a significant rise in patients with chronic hepatitis infections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets keep in mind, we just need one vial that a step was missed on... and we've injected several hundred people with the most gnarly concoction of diseased blood ever made.   And thats exactly what our people begin to present with a year later.... the most gnarly simultaneous infections of diseases hardly seen.

       35 million doses is a lot of doses to have absolute knowledge of.  And considering the tests illustrating the presence of virus were nothing more than arbitrary thresholds of certain protein weights in a culture of blood.... And considering each batch could be made from a completely different beast of potential pathogens.... To claim absolutely there was nothing wrong with this vaccine.... just shows me how little you understand the variability and randomness of the process involved.

       Were they?  Sure the guys at Merck and the NIH were actively funding several scientists to publish papers that said this.... but no one was going wait a minute - gay had nothing to do with this, there were tons of bisexual men in san francisco in that time - and yet there was no propaganda illustrating how prevalent and widespread general fucking was. If there was a widespread rise in hepatitis in san francisco... then the female populations should have also shown evidence of it to some degree. But no one was paying for scientific papers that said that....

       There was no propaganda illustrating that disease does not target a vague sexual identity - it targets human cells... men.. women.. children.

       Well, there is a probability to killing each and every individual viral capsid.... and its not 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means theres a probability to killing each and every individual viral capsid in each dose of vaccine.... which is not 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that even 99.999% reliability.... 38 million doses distributes 4000 doses of communicable hyper disease.

       This is why you don't make vaccines from fucking diseased human blood. The whole premise of this vaccine is flawed from the beginning.

       Aitoclaves are really good at killing things. A proper autoclaving reduces microbes to one millionth(1/1000000). There are, for example, 50 million bacteria per square inch of human skin and perhaps 500000 viruses per sq in. If you were to autoclave a sample of human skin, only 50 bacteria and half a virus would remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the assumption is
       <strong>
        proper
       </strong>
       autoclaving. If for example a person boiled something, viruses would happily endure and survive. :)

       well you typically autoclave instruments - not your batch of vaccine blood-, and its helpful in destroying things that are actually alive...
      </p>
      <p>
       The topic of discussion, however, is not something that can easily and non-invasively be seen with a microscope... the viruses in discussion are Hepatitis and HIV... both are very very tiny, very patchy in their existence in the cells of a sample, and very very hard to detect without a concerted effort to amplify their existence in a culture.   In fact, most of our methods of verifying their existence are not ones of direct observation, but of observation of proxy measurement in the result of a lengthy biochemical process designed to make the measurement possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't let the existence of the autoclaves satisfy you... because it doesn't solve, or even pertain to, the problem we are discussing.

       So that the pro-vaccers can point and say "Look at how few adverse reactions have been verified by this VAERS service that 99.9% of the population has never heard of and your doctor would sure as hell never tell you about!!!!" Never mind the relatively short allowed reporting windows given that you won't know it exists until long after the injury or that they only allow reporting of recognized adverse reactions that were found during the corrupt testing by the pharma companies themselves.

       The problem is not vaccination itself. We need to consider the billions of lives saved because of vaccination; polio, measles variola, all were major cause-of-deaths until the full implementation of vaccination. To be an anti-vaxer today is to dismiss history itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course "sacrifices" were made, and the road to "modern medicine" was punctuated by (today's norms) extreme sadism and cruelty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem at hand now is "over-medication" and "profits over people" mentality (aside from its economic-political tools). So at hand we have clear examples of its dangers:
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/h1n1_narcolepsy_pandemrix.html">
        Pandremix anti-flu vaccine "causing" Narcolepsy
       </a>
       (caused not by the latent virus, but from its production) an obvious and serious example of such dangers, yet the continuation of such programs is troubling as it also encourages discrediting vaccination itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dangers of over-vaccination (HPV, flu, SARS) are just as dangerous as the current "psychoactive" drugs "trend" applied  to children. The risks do not outweigh the benefits, but profits outweighs everything, even common-sense.

      <h2>
       The Audacity of the “Anti-Vaxxer”
      </h2>
      <p>
       40 years ago, vaccine reactions were almost never discussed. Vaccines were overwhelmingly believed to have saved humanity from a variety of diseases that had plagued mankind for generations. Although mistakes had been made, for the most part, “the benefits far outweigh the negative effects.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the accepted “wisdom” holds that although severe reactions to vaccines have been documented, including brain damage and death, they are rare enough that the success of the vaccine “program” is more important.
       <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/11564541/CH-51-Vaccine-saftey-forward">
        According to Russell Blaylock, MD:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I reported a conversation coming from the Simpsonwood conference held in Norcross, Georgia, attended by 53 specialists in vaccine effects—including members of the World Health Organization and major vaccine manufacturers—concerning data indicating that vaccines were causing a statistically significant increase in childhood neurodevelopmental problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the attended stated that his main goal is to see that every child in this country receives his vaccines, today, tomorrow and forever. In other words, he could care less that the vaccines are significantly damaging children's brains and altering their brain development.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Blaylock">
        Russell Blaylock
       </a>
       , although a somewhat controversial figure, is known for his work in pioneering treatments for certain brain tumors, “as well as improving certain operations treating water on the brain.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of Dr. Blaylock's controversial views include his claim that aspartame may be unsafe even in small doses and that the H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine may carry more risks than the flu itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blaylock claims that physicians
       <a href="http://whale.to/a/regimentation.html">
        are more regimented than any time in history
       </a>
       and that “today they do what they are told without question.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this regimentation—this death of creativity—most doctors are completely unprepared when confronted with potentially vaccine-damaged children and their parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a popular field in neuroscience, many physicians know very little about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxin">
        excitotoxicity,
       </a>
       the major mechanism in virtually all brain disorders. Blaylock,
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excitotoxins-The-Taste-That-Kills/dp/0929173252/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1396995098&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=excitotoxins">
        who wrote a book on the subject,
       </a>
       continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of the most devastating side effects of vaccines involve neurological damage, including encephalitis, transverse myelitis, peripheral nerve damage, seizures, mental retardation, language delays, multiple sclerosis, behavioral problems, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sspe">
         SSPE
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Most physicians, especially pediatricians, think these events are “rare” and must be accepted to gain the benefit of vaccines. In fact, these adverse vaccine reactions are not as rare as many believe...medical authorities are using clever ploys to hide and alter the data on vaccine injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        They reclassify problems, deny a connection to the vaccines and more often than not, just brush such reactions off as “normal.” For example, one deception is to classify cases of polio as “aseptic meningitis.” By doing so, vaccine proponents can give the illusion that the polio vaccine policy was more successful than it actually was.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       An example of this reclassification ploy is the label of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/">
        In a 1982 study,
       </a>
       70% of SIDS cases were shown to follow the DPT vaccination within three weeks.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In order to avoid admitting that the sudden stoppage of breathing by a baby within hours to weeks of these vaccines was due to the vaccines, the vaccine defenders merely created a new disease and gave it the incredible name of sudden infant death syndrome, which is like naming it the “Baby Mysteriously Dies of Anything but a Vaccine Injury Syndrome.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As is detailed in David Oshinsky's
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polio-American-David-M-Oshinsky/dp/0195307143/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1396995523&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=polio+an+american+story">

         SV40
        </a>
        virus, present in both the killed and live vaccines, caused cancer in experimental animals. The public was not informed of this contamination until decades later. Worse, they continued to give the tainted vaccine to children assuming that it would not cause cancer. Modern science has proven them wrong.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dr. Blaylock continues by observing that most physicians, even pediatricians, know little about the brains of young children:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is evidence that the great number of vaccines given to our children, and adults, is causing injury to their nervous systems and that it reduces the ability of people to think, learn, behave and function as normal adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well known and accepted that when you vaccinate someone, lets say by a shot in the arm, the body's immune system is thrown into high gear. What is less well known by doctors in practice, especially by pediatricians, is that it also activates the brain's special immune system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The central immune cells in the brain are called microglia (they also involve astrocytes). These normally sleeping immune cells become highly activated when a vaccination is given. Until activated they remain immobile, but after activation they can move around the brain like an amoeba, secreting very toxic amounts of inflammatory chemicals (called cytokines) and two forms of excitotoxins (glutamate and quinolinic acid). This puts the brain in a chronically inflamed state.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There can also be the risk of vaccine-induced seizures:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Multiple vaccines during a single visit, or combination vaccines, raise the risk even higher. Seizures following a vaccination are due to two things happening in the brain. One is that many vaccines can cause a high fever, and this can trigger a seizure in seizure-prone babies, children and some adults.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also known that overstimulation of the immune system, which can occur with certain types of vaccines and especially when multiple vaccines are given during one office visit, can cause seizures. The excess activation of the body's immune system leads to overactivation of the brain's microglia, and the subsequent release of the excitotoxins leads to the seizure. This mechanism has been carefully worked out in the laboratory—it is not a theory.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Blaylock believes that vaccines can cause seizures even days later and that multiple seizures indicate a severely inflamed brain and the need for immediate medical attention. These “seizures” can also be “silent” in that they can be expressed behaviorally, such as periods of confusion or irritability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human brain develops much differently than most animals in that long after birth the brain still undergoes dramatic formation of its pathways. Much of this formation happens within the first two years, although it continues until age 25-27.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Excess vaccination disrupts this critical process and can result in a malformed brain, which manifests as either subtle impairment in thinking, concentration, attention, behavior or language, or serious problems with these processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has also been shown that excess immune stimulation by vaccination can trigger an interaction between excitotoxicity and brain inflammatory cytokines that greatly magnifies the damage, and can do so for decades.
       </p>

       “Adjuvants” are added to many vaccines as well. These are meant to powerfully stimulate the body's immune system and include toxic metals like aluminum and mercury, animal proteins, and “special lipids.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Adjuvants can cause powerful stimulation of the immune system for as long as two years, which means the brain's immune system also remains overactive.
       </p>
       <p>
        A growing body of research indicates that overactivity of the brain's immune cells (microglia) can lead to a gradual loss of brain connections (synapses and dendrites) and can even cause the brain to be miswired (abnormal pathways development).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Many pediatricians may know very little about the immune system and possible negative effects from vaccines or combination of vaccines. Dr. Blaylock continues with this damning pronouncement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anyone with even a basic understanding of immunology or having read the available research on the effects of excessive vaccination on the developing brain, would know that the present crowded vaccine schedule is extremely destructive to the child's brain. Likewise, there seems to be little concern as to the effects of multiple immunizations on the developing child's immune system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pediatricians and public health authorities are of the opinion that they can give an unlimited number of vaccines to babies and small children without risk. Our neuroscience proves this is insane. Almost every year, these vaccine enthusiasts add another set of vaccines to the schedule, despite the growing list of neurological and other health disasters occurring in our children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “Priming” the microglia can increase the damage caused by vaccinations or even natural infections.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's say a newborn is given the hepatitis B vaccine before leaving the hospital. The vaccine activates the baby's brain microglia (called priming). Then, let's say the child develops an ear infection. The ear infection once again activates the baby's immune microglia, but this time the activation is greatly aggravated because of the previous vaccine-induced priming, resulting in a seizure or even sudden death. The pediatrician will blame it on the ear infection, not the previous vaccine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There can be
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       factors that contribute to tragedies such as SIDS...and it may be premature to dismiss vaccine reactions as a possible cause.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another scenario would be a baby who receives a hepatitis B vaccine at birth and then gets his or her DtaP vaccine within months of birth. Two weeks later, mom finds the baby dead in its crib. The doctor blames it on SIDS and never reports it to the CDC as a vaccine reaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this case the triple antigen exposure (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) triggers the baby's already primed microglia—this time in the brainstem, where the respiratory control neurons reside. When the baby is placed on its stomach, it cannot muster enough force to fill its lungs. Any fumes from the mattress only aggravate the problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the pediatrician, it is easier and safer to blame it on a mysterious disorder called SIDS, than to admit it was a sequential vaccine reaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another thing that can prime microglia is vaccine adjuvants such as aluminum, mercury and protein additives. These products easily enter the brain, are stored for decades and can powerfully activate the brain's microglia, and do so for prolonged periods.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Aluminum is a very powerful inducer of brain microglia, and since aluminum has an immune-enhancing effect, many manufacturers add aluminum to vaccines. It wasn't until recently that vaccine authorities started officially acknowledging the danger of the possible toxicity of aluminum in vaccines.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, injected aluminum can complex with fluoride within the body to produce a compound, fluoroaluminum, that has a number of harmful effects, including brain injury.
        <a href="http://australianfluorideaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DR-RUSSELL-BLAYLOCK-Fluoride-excitototoxin-paper.pdf">
         There is some evidence
        </a>
        that fluoride can trigger microglia activation and excitotoxicity, which in combination is particularly injurious to the brain.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 2001,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11522584">
        a new condition was described
       </a>
       by Dr. R.K. Gherardi and co-workers that linked muscle pains and neurological problems with retained aluminum resulting form aluminum hydroxide vaccine adjuvants. The problem was linked to hepatitis B, hepatitis A or tetanus toxoid vaccines.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A subsequent report found a number of patients with a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In 2004,
        <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/63/5/838.abstract">
         a study reported in the journal
         <em>
          Neurology
         </em>
        </a>
        found that people exposed to the complete series of hepatitis B vaccines experienced a 300% higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis than the unvaccinated public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The study concludes: “These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immunization with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an increased risk of MS, and challenge the idea that the relation between hepatitis B vaccination and risk of MS is well understood.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines can be, and have been, contaminated by bacteria, viruses, viral fragments and mycoplasma. Once injected, they can enter the brain and continue to prime the brain's microglia for a lifetime.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another consideration is the ability of attenuated viruses to undergo mutation over time, eventually resulting in organisms that can cause new disease. When live viruses are used to make vaccines, a process of repeated passage of the virus through growth media reduces its virulence, or the ability of the virus to cause disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, as occurs with measles, rubella and many other viruses used in vaccines, once in the body the attenuated viruses can be converted to quite virulent viruses. This is thought to explain the high incidence of Crohn's disease in people who were vaccinated as children with live measles viruses.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11572573?dopt=Abstract">
        This 2001 study actually found
       </a>
       that the mutated measles viruses were different in each tissue, meaning that a variety of disorders are possible.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The risk of persistent viruses following vaccination with live viruses appears to be growing and may be secondary to a number of factors, which include the nutritional status of the person and preexistence of immune suppression. Immunologists have voiced concern that the growing number of vaccines being given early in life may impair immune function for life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another concern is with organisms that contain dozens or more subtypes. Many vaccines will target only a handful of these subtypes, creating the potential for new subtypes to emerge and become even more carcinogenic.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, HPV (human papilloma virus) has over 100 subtypes, yet the vaccine protects against only four. The other subtypes that in the past rarely produced disease might be given a fresh opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major issue with the vaccine program is the lack of long-term protection that occurs after you are
       <em>
        naturally
       </em>
       infected with a disease. Today, most younger people don't have natural immunization. In the past, the majority of the population had life-long protection from diseases like measles, rubella, chickenpox, etc., and this protected mothers and their newborn children as well. Vaccinated mothers do not offer this protection.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Of great concern is the recent finding that immune activation in pregnant women can have dire consequences for the developing baby. At one time it was thought that viral infections in the mother endangered the baby because the virus was passed through the placenta into the baby's body.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11695949">
         New research demonstrates
        </a>
        that it is the mother's immune cytokines that are causing the damage, once they enter the baby's body, and is not caused by the virus itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Researchers found that the eventual effect of maternal immune stimulation depended on the timing of the immune activation. Activations at mid-term could result in autism; stimulation late in the pregnancy could result in schizophrenia as the child grows into adulthood.
       </p>
       <p>
        What this means is that vaccinating a pregnant woman is associated with a high risk of autism, psychosis and other neurological problems as the baby reaches adolescence or adulthood. This is being completely ignored by those designing vaccines and making recommendations. At present, flu, chickenpox, hep B and rubella vaccines are recommended for pregnant women.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       HPV vaccination
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       to be recommended for pregnant women as well, but it caused enough birth defects and death that this practice ceased.

      <h2>
       The Herd Immunity Illusion and Other Scary Scenarios
      </h2>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most oft-cited truism among those who unequivocally defend the current vaccine program is the notion of “herd immunity.” The idea is that if a large enough percentage of the population is immunized against a certain disease, then epidemics can be prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, it was suggested that 60-70% of the population needed to be immunized to reach those goals...today some claim that 95-100% immunization is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very strong, and rarely mentioned, case against the perceived state of “herd immunity” in the population today. The mistake lies in the assumption that high percentages of the population are
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       immune to diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The problem with this is that most of the protection afforded by these childhood vaccines waned many decades ago, so that most baby boomers, the largest percentage of the population, have
        <em>
         no
        </em>
        protection. In fact, vaccines for most Americans declined to non-protective levels within 5 to 10 years of the vaccines.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         This means that for a majority of Americans, as well as others in the developed world, herd immunity doesn't exist and hasn't for over 60 years.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The media and vaccine enthusiasts would have us believe otherwise, like claiming that as many as 40,000 people die from the “flu” every year, despite this claim being completely unsupported by the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Peter Doshi, Ph.D., a Johns Hopkins scientist, recently issued a
       <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6770">
        blistering report
       </a>
       , claiming that only a small portion of those diagnosed with the “flu”
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       have the influenza virus present.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the United States,
        <a href="http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Headline/influenza-virus-flu-vaccine-Peter-Doshi-Ph-D-/2013/05/16/id/504942/">
         says Doshi
        </a>
        of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Drug companies and public officials press for widespread vaccination each fall, offering vaccinations in drugstores and supermarkets.
       </p>
       <p>
        The results have been phenomenal. Only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States on an annual basis. Today, the total has skyrocketed to 135 million doses. Mandatory vaccination polices have been enacted, often in healthcare facilities, forcing some people to take the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to Doshi, “The vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated. For most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it.” That's not the case, he says.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although the CDC implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, Doshi disagrees. He points to
        <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2994">
         an Australian study
        </a>
        that found 1 in every 110 children under the age of 5 had convulsions following vaccinations in 2009 for H1N1 influenza. Additional investigations found that the H1N1 vaccine was also associated with a spike in cases of narcolepsy among adolescents.

       debacle will help reignite this crucial conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another method of the pro-vaccine scare campaign is to evoke mortality rates in the thousands or millions from previous eras or Third World nations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If they send out warnings through the media that tens of thousands of infants may die of measles if children (and adults) are not vaccinated each year, it has a major impact on parental decisions to vaccinate.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One of the most common themes among proponents of the flu vaccine is that everything must be done to prevent the 1917-1918 flu epidemic that killed millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       However,
       <a href="http://phys.org/news173715307.html">
        recent research
       </a>
       raises serious doubts about blaming a “wild” strain of the influenza virus for the extraordinary number of deaths. Evidence suggests it was none other than Bayer's indefatigable promotion of aspirin that may have been largely responsible.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hypothesis...is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0–31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Before the mortality rate spiked, Bayer embarked on an aggressive ad campaign to promote their new product. Furthermore, autopsy reports from 1918 are consistent with what we know today about the dangers of aspirin toxicity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The motivation behind the improper use of aspirin is a cautionary tale, said author Karen Starko, MD. In 1918, physicians did not fully understand either the dosing or pharmacology of aspirin, yet they were willing to recommend it. Its use was promoted by the drug industry, endorsed by doctors wanting to “do something,” and accepted by families and institutions desperate for hope.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another terrifying epidemic in American history was the
       <a href="http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg">
        1916 polio outbreak
       </a>
       that killed at least 5,000 people. As can be seen by this graph, the 1916 death rate from polio was extremely anomalous, and was one of the many events that inspired the push to develop a polio vaccine when rates began rising again in the 1940s and 50s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although originally blamed on “Italian immigrants,” this explanation is beginning to be seriously called into question.
       <a href="http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tovacj/articles/V004/13TOVACJ.pdf">
        A study
       </a>
       was published by H.V. Wyatt in 2011 that suggests a much more sinister explanation for the outbreak:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Previous accounts of the 1916 devastating epidemic have been faulty. The unique features of the epidemic and its sudden appearance have never been explained.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, Simon Flexner and his associates at the Rockefeller Institute at 63rd Street and York Avenue, near Queensborough Bridge on Manhattan Island, had been passaging spinal cord tissue containing poliovirus, from one Rhesus monkey spinal cord to another.
       </p>
       <p>
        I propose that highly virulent virus escaped and caused the epidemic. Scientists, technical and animal house staff were unaware that they could be infected by poliovirus which could then infect others.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It seems it would be premature to completely dismiss this hypothesis, especially since an extremely virulent multi-virus (MV) strain of polio was being experimented on within walking distance of the worst polio outbreak in half a century. Mortality rates reached 25% among those afflicted, compared to the usual mortality rate of less than 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       These past events and their “official” explanations are extremely important to reanalyze, because they could potentially be used to mislead the public.

       Paralysis and the Politics of Polio

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio">
        Poliomyelitis
       </a>
       , or polio, is a contagious disease caused by a virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fever, headache, sore throat, vomiting are some of the milder symptoms, and some victims develop neurological complications and paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases it can be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people mistakenly believe that polio usually leads to paralysis, but this isn't the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus don't exhibit any symptoms,
       <em>

        The Wikipedia article on polio
       </a>
       initially cites the figure as 90%, but elsewhere on the page the “asymptomatic” outcome of poliovirus infection is listed as 90%-95%. According to
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/polio.pdf">
        the source used for these statistics,
       </a>
       “Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymptomatic.”
      </p>
      <p>
       About 5% of infected people will experience mild symptoms such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and fever—often diagnosed as a cold or flu. Muscular paralysis affects approximately one out of every 1,000 people who contract polio.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus. [Moskowitz, R. “Immunizations: the other side.”

      <p>
       Usually there is a full recovery from paralytic polio—it rarely is permanent. Only a small percentage of cases will experience residual paralysis.
      </p>

       There are many serious questions about what factors contribute to increasing an individual's susceptibility to serious adverse reactions to the polio virus.

        He compiled records showing that countries with the highest per capita consumption of sugar, such as the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person per year) had the greatest incidence of polio.

        Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream, soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In 1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their consumption of these products.

       <p>
        That summer, North Carolinians reduced their intake of sugar by 90%; polio decreased by the same amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases of polio in 1948 and 229 cases in 1949. [Data taken from North Carolina State Health Department figures]

       <p>
        One manufacturer shipped one million less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the publication of Dr. Sandler's anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        But powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business leaders and convinced the public that Sandler's findings were a myth and the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to “normal.” [

        The NIH Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Cutter polio vaccine, had received advance warnings of problems: in 1954, staff member Dr. Bernice Eddy had reported to her superiors that some of the inoculated monkeys had become paralyzed (pictures were sent as well). William Sebrell, the director of NIH wouldn't hear of such a thing.

      <p>
       Dr. Bernard Greenberg, who also was head of the Dept. of Biostatistics for the University of North Carolina School of Public Health,

        “testified that

       not only did the cases of polio increase substantially after mandatory vaccinations—a 50% increase from 1957 to 1958, and an 80% increase from 1958 to 1959—but that the statistics were
       <em>
        deliberately manipulated by the Public Health Service

       to give the opposite impression.” According to Greenberg:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prior to 1954 any physician who reported paralytic poliomyelitis was doing his patient a service by way of subsidizing the cost of hospitalization....Two examinations at least 24 hours apart was all that was required....In 1955 the criteria were changed...residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset.
       </p>
       <p>
        This change in definition meant that in 1955 we started reporting a new disease....Furthermore, diagnostic procedures have continued to be refined. Coxsackie virus infections and aseptic meningitis have been distinguished from poliomyelitis....Thus, simply by changes in diagnostic criteria, the number of paralytics cases was predetermined to decrease.

       Some have speculated that approximately
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/phillips.html">
        90% of polio cases were eliminated from statistics
       </a>

        DDT
       </a>
       may have played a significant role in the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 50s. By the early 1960s, it finally became understood that DDT was having a devastating impact on the environment and possibly human health.
      </p>

        DDT delousing
       </a>
       were both extremely, and terrifyingly, common before this realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1953, Morton S. Biskind
       <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02883493">
        published
       </a>
       a damning report called “Public health aspects of the new insecticides.” A decade before Rachel Carson would release her groundbreaking
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring">
        <em>
         Silent Spring,
        </em>
       </a>
       Biskind was desperately trying to sound the alarm:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was even known by 1945 that DDT is stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in the milk. With this foreknowledge the series of catastrophic events that followed the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history, should not have surprised the experts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, far from admitting a causal relationship so obvious that in any other field of biology it would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite, the overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Biskind
        <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/west5a.html">
         had the composure to argue
        </a>
        what he thought was the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic: Central nervous system diseases (CNS) such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world's populace with central nervous system poisons.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Biskind emphasized physiological evidence of DDT poisoning that resembled polio physiology:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Particularly relevant to recent aspects of this problem are neglected studies by Lillie and his collaborators of the National Institutes of Health, published in 1944 and 1947 respectively, which showed that DDT may produce degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord in animals. These changes do not occur regularly in exposed animals any more than they do in human beings, but they do appear often enough to be significant.
       </p>
       <p>
        He continues, bearing his exasperation in trying to make the obvious plain. “When the population is exposed to a chemical agent known to produce in animals lesions in the spinal cord resembling those in human polio, and thereafter the latter disease increases sharply in incidence and maintains its epidemic character year after year, is it unreasonable to suspect an etiologic relationship?”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Physiological_investigations_into_the_ac.html?id=1xkUAQAAIAAJ">
        A German study
       </a>
       of the physiology of acute DDT poisoning confirmed that DDT often causes polio-like physiology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biskind's views fell into disfavor after the introduction of the polio vaccine, which “proved” to most that the majority of polio cases were caused by a virus. By 1955, Biskind, whose works had been published in established medical journals and who testified before the Senate on the dangers of pesticides, was forced self-publish his writings.

        identifying a “polio-like” illness

       in five California children. “All children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset...All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Incredibly, the oral polio vaccine was given to Indian children, despite the fact that in the U.S., the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule
       <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf">

       According to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication
        <em>
         it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.

       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received.

       SV40
      </h2>
      <p>
       We return to 1959 and the pioneering work of Dr. Bernice Eddy, whose previous warnings about the Salk polio vaccine went unheeded, resulting in many deaths. For her efforts, she was removed from polio research at the NIH.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a complete account of Eddy and her story,
       <a href="http://www.vaksinite.info/The%20Virus%20and%20the%20Vaccine.html">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       History, as they say, is doomed to repeat herself, for Eddy would yet again discover something was wrong with the polio vaccine. This time, however, the ramifications would be far more catastrophic, and her subsequent silencing was much more profound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Eddy was fresh from her research into viral causes of cancer and her pioneering work in first describing
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomaviridae">
        the polyoma virus
       </a>
       . However, she soon would earn the dubious honor of being the first to identify what we now call
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV-40">
        SV40
       </a>
       (Simian virus 40), an infectious agent capable of causing cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       SV40 had widely contaminated the polio vaccine, and Eddy desperately tried to sound the alarm. Even though her previous warnings, if heeded, would have prevented the tragic Cutter Incident, she yet again was met with astonishing opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened next was tragic not only for Eddy herself, but it precipitated one of the worst medical blunders/conspiracies of the 20th century.

       by Edward Shorter offers the following account of
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html">
        this story:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy's discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. “I did things on the side which I wasn't assigned to do,”  Eddy said. One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscope—the kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companies—Eddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Edward_Smadel">
         Joseph Smadel,
        </a>
        that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as “lumps.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Eddy tried every possible means to alert her peers to the danger, and ultimately decided she would “surprise” a meeting of the Cancer Society with her findings.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel's desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Smadel hit the roof. “Smadel called me up,” Eddy said, “and if there was anything in the English language—any awful name—that he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad.” Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bernice Eddy came to a shocking conclusion: an entire generation had been given cancer-causing monkey viruses. Using this knowledge, she predicted a future epidemic of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Hilleman">
        Maurice Hilleman
       </a>
       and Benjamin Sweet came to similar conclusions. Sweet and Hilleman were pharmaceutical researchers for Merck and are credited with first identifying the virus as SV40, the 40th such simian virus discovered until that point. According to Hilleman:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The discovery of this new virus...raises the important question of the existence of other such viruses...As shown in this report, all three types of Sabin's live poliovirus vaccine, now fed to millions of persons of all ages, were contaminated with SV40.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hilleman and Sweet noted the possibility that it
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13774265">
        might cause cancer,
       </a>
       “especially when administered to human babies.”
       <a href="http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/June2001/PolioVaxSV40.htm">
        According to Sweet
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was a frightening discovery because, back then, it was not possible to detect the virus with the testing procedures we had....We had no idea of what this virus would do. First, we knew that SV40 had oncogenic (cancer-causing) properties in hamsters, which was bad news. Secondly, we found out that it hybridized with certain DNA viruses...such that [they] would then have SV40 genes attached [to them]....
       </p>
       <p>
        When we started growing the vaccines, we just couldn't get rid of the SV40-contaminated virus. We tried to neutralize it, but couldn't....Now, with the theoretical links to HIV and cancer, it just blows my mind.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/174424">
        Further research
       </a>
       uncovered even more disturbing information.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This cancer-causing virus was not only ingested via Sabin's contaminated oral sugar-cube vaccine, but was directly injected into people's bloodstreams as well. Apparently,
        <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">
         SV40 survived the formaldehyde Salk used
        </a>
        to kill microbes that defiles his injectable vaccine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Experts have estimated that up to 100 million Americans and at least 100 millions others throughout the world were exposed to SV40 through the polio vaccine. [Bookchin, D., et al. “Tainted polio vaccine still carries its threat 40 years later.
       <em>
        The Boston Globe
       </em>
       (January 26, 1997)]
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though SV40 is universally acknowledged to cause cancer in animal models, strangely enough its role in causing cancer in humans is still debated. As Wikipedia explains:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hypothesis that SV40 might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research. Several different methods have been used to detect SV40 in a variety of human cancers, although how reliable these detection methods are, and whether SV40 has any role in causing these tumors, remains unclear.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of these uncertainties, academic opinion remains divided, with
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131333">
         some arguing
        </a>
        that this hypothesis is not supported by the data, and
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483871">
         others arguing
        </a>
        that some cancers
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626046">
         may involve
        </a>
        SV40.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the United States National Cancer Institute announced in 2004 that although SV40 does cause cancer in some animal models, “substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans.”

       Despite the United States National Cancer Institute's reliance on broad “epidemiological evidence” that SV40 “likely” does not cause cancer in humans, numerous studies published throughout the world strongly suggest that SV40 is a catalyst for many types of cancer:

       One of the most important researchers and authorities on SV40 is a molecular pathologist at Chicago's Loyola University Medical Center named Michael Carbone. From the Wikipedia page of American physician
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner">
        Herbert Ratner
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet &amp; Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not only is SV40 showing up in brain tumors and leukemia, but according to research conducted by Carbone and others, SV40 is being detected in 38% of patients with bone cancer and in 58% of those with mesothelioma, a deadly type of lung cancer. Carbone's pioneering work indicates that SV40 blocks an important protein that normally protects cells from becoming malignant.

       In 2001, the
       <em>
        San Francisco Chronicle
       </em>
       published a story called
       <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">
        “Rogue virus in the vaccine: Early polio vaccine harbored virus now feared to cause cancer in humans,”
       </a>
       stating:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The discovery of SV40 in human tumors has generated intense debate within the scientific community, pitting a handful of government health officials, who believe that the virus is harmless, against researchers from Boston to China who now suspect SV40 may be a human carcinogen. At stake are millions of research dollars and potential medical treatments for those afflicted with the cancers SV40 may be causing.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I believe that SV40 is carcinogenic (in humans),” said Dr. Michele Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. “We need to be creating therapies for people who have these cancers, and now we may be able to because we have a target—SV40.”
       </p>
       <p>
        But scientists at the National Cancer Institute say their studies show almost no SV40 in human tumors and no cancer increase in people who received the contaminated vaccine. “No one would dispute there's been a widespread, very scary exposure to the population of potentially cancer-causing virus,” said Dr. Howard Strickler, NCI's chief investigator. “But none of our studies and other major analyses have shown an inkling of an effect on the population.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Critics charge, however, that the few studies done by the government are scientifically flawed and that health officials have downplayed the potential risks posed by SV40 ever since they learned in 1961 that the virus contaminated the polio vaccine and caused tumors in rodents.
       </p>
       <p>
        “How long can the government ignore this?” asked Dr. Adi Gazdar, a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center cancer researcher. “The government has not sponsored any real research. Here's something possibly affecting millions of Americans, and they're indifferent. Maybe they don't want to find out.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 1998, after a national cancer database was analyzed, it was determined that among those exposed to SV40 from the polio vaccine, there were 17% more bone cancers, 20% more brain cancers, and
       <em>
        178%
       </em>
       more mesotheliomas.
       <a href="http://www.nccn.net/%7Ewwithin/polio.htm">
        Researchers also found
       </a>
       10 times more osteosarcoma rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more alarming,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835679">
        some research suggests
       </a>
       that SV40 can be passed from human to human and form mother to child.

        A study of nearly 60,000 women
       </a>
       found that children of mothers who received the Salk vaccine in the early 1960s had brain tumors at a rate 13 times greater than mothers who didn't receive the shot.

       found SV40 in 23% of blood samples and 45% of semen taken from healthy subjects. Mauro Tognon, one of the authors of this study, believes this might explain why brain, bone, and lung cancers are on the rise.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Edward Shorter asks these questions and quotes an extraordinary statement made by Albert Sabin:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was this silence merely the incompetence of the press in the face of a complex scientific question, or was there a deliberate effort to keep a lid on the story? Albert Sabin was asked thirty years later why the silence? “I think to release certain information prematurely,” he said, “is not a public service. There's too much scaring the public unnecessarily. Oh, your children were injected with a cancer virus and all that. That's not very good.”

      <p>
       Today,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation">
        the SV40 Cancer Foundation
       </a>
       is devoted to raising awareness about a potential link between the simian virus and human cancer.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The SV40 Cancer Foundation was founded by Raphaele and Michael Horwin. The Horwin's son Alexander Horwin was born on June 7, 1996 and was given the oral polio vaccine in November 1997. Alexander was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a malignant brain cancer, leading to his death on January 31, 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Horwins contend that the polio vaccine their son ingested was contaminated with SV40, leading to his death. Four independent PCR tests performed at four separate research institutes on Alexander's brain tissue demonstrated the presence of the virus.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Virus and the Vaccine
       </em>
       documents the incredible saga of the Horwin family. The vaccine manufacturer unsuccessfully tried to argue in court that the SV40 contamination was the result of a trip to the zoo (!), but the Horwin family had overwhelming scientific evidence on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tragically, although the judge admitted the polio vaccine was the likely origin of the SV40 that was found in his tumor, the vaccine manufacturer was exonerated because their equipment was insufficient and unable to offer 100% certainty that the product would be SV40-free.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most important reasons this subject needs to be
       <em>
        thoroughly
       </em>
       studied is that traditional methods of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy
       <a href="http://www.sv40foundation.org/Treating.html">
        may make SV40-related cancers worse:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is well documented that SV40 binds with tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB. These genes and their proteins are needed to drive a damaged cell towards apoptosis—programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a critical cellular function that stops the growth of tumors in man.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cell-killing or cytotoxic therapies like chemotherapy and radiation utilize apoptosis. These therapies cause cellular DNA damage such as point mutations, strand breaks, and other disturbances to a cell’s DNA. This DNA damage, in turn, triggers the apoptosis which leads to cell death. In this way, chemo and radiation kill cells (cancer cells and healthy cells).
       </p>
       <p>
        However, when the large T antigen (Tag) of SV40 is present in a cancer cell it binds p53 and RB and stops these genes from working. There is no apoptosis. The result is that chemo and radiation kill healthy cells,
        <em>
         but the cancerous cells infected with SV40’s Tag live on with even more mutations.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         This means that standard cancer therapies may only make a SV40 cancer more abnormal and aggressive and less responsive to standard cytotoxic therapies.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowing this, you would think that a patient who is diagnosed with a cancer associated with SV40 (i.e. brain cancers, mesothelioma, bone cancers, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and thyroid cancers) would have their cancer tested for the presence of this virus. And, if the virus is present, the patient would be offered rational therapies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are no prospective tests or trials in which SV40 status is used in clinical decision-making. Instead, tumors are tested often after a patient has died to determine whether it contained SV40. At this point, there is no benefit to the patient.
       </p>
       <p>
        SV40 is a problem that federal government authorities have not addressed responsibly because the government’s own vaccine programs are responsible for the spread of the virus throughout the western world. Federal authorities are so concerned about being blamed for unleashing a cancer-causing monkey virus that they would rather ignore its role in cancer than take the appropriate steps to develop rational therapies.

        Vaccine authorities were so concerned about the possibility that SIV was a precursor to HIV, and that polio vaccines were the means of transmission from monkey to human, that the World Health Organization convened two meetings of experts in 1985 to explore the data and consider their options. After all, SIV was very similar to HIV
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079">

      <p>
       However, WHO concluded the vaccines were safe enough and insisted the mass vaccination campaigns continue. By 1989, they recommended not making the polio vaccine using monkeys infected with SIV.

       <p>
        Scientific concerns were also heightened when researchers found some West Africans who were infected with an SIV-like virus that was a fundamental twin to HIV. They called it HIV-2, and like the initial HIV subtype,
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2867393">

       Since most historians agree that AIDS originated in Africa, how could it be linked to the polio vaccine if Salk and Sabin's trials were conducted in the U.S., the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In March 1951, several years before Drs. Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin would scuffle over whose vaccine was the true prophylactic,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski">
         Dr. Hilary Koprowski
        </a>
        announced at a medical conference that he had become the first doctor in history
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2096806/">
         to test polio vaccine on humans.
        </a>
        His “volunteers” included several institutionalized children with mental handicaps. They drank the vaccine in chocolate milk.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Zaire).
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555313/">
         Called by drums,
        </a>
        rural natives traveled to local villages where they had a liquid vaccines squirted into their mouths. 98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers.

         WHO denied
        </a>
        sanctioning the large-scale trials.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 1959, Albert Sabin
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1993129/">
        published a study
       </a>
       that claimed that Koprowski's polio vaccine used in the African trials contained un “unidentified” and “unstable” cell-killing virus. Although he was quick to point out the flaws in the vaccine of Koprowski, his professional rival, unfortunately his ability to detect viruses in the polio vaccine fell short when it came to mass contamination of Sabin's
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       polio vaccine with SV-40.
      </p>
      <p>
       In response to Sabin's claims of contamination, Koprowski simply scoffed at him and said he was just trying to discredit his work (as he would do again and again to anyone making this accusation). The virus allegedly detected by Sabin was never identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until recently,
       <a href="http://www.popline.org/node/366900">
        the earliest known blood sample
       </a>
       containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville, one of the epicenters of the AIDS epidemic that would occur a decade later.

        </a>
        and confirmed that today's major subtypes of the AIDS virus in humans appear to have arisen as recently as 1960.
       </p>

        Although

         more recent conflicting reports
        </a>

      <p>
       Regardless of
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       the first HIV infection occurred, it would seem to be premature to dismiss the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis">
        OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) AIDS hypothesis
       </a>
       on this basis alone. The timing of the first HIV infection is irrelevant to the question of whether or not some doses of the experimental polio vaccine used in Africa in the late 1950s were contaminated, thus precipitating a future outbreak.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Koprowski's vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi—the precise area where high levels of HIV infection
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3321361">
         were identified
        </a>
        by researcher 30 years later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people's mouths.
       </p>
       <p>
        Could squirting an HIV-contaminated polio vaccine into people's mouths cause AIDS?
        <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">
         According to Tom Folks
        </a>
        , chief retrovirologist at the CDC, “Any time a person has a lesion in his mouth, then there could be transmission” of the virus.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dr. Robert Bohannon of Baylor College of Medicine asserts that squiring polio vaccines into one's mouth would tend to aerosolize some of the liquid. Small drops could then go into the lungs, and from there to the blood cells susceptible to infection. This
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7935079">
        could be
       </a>
       an efficient mode of HIV transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experts believe that the average time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS is approximately 8-10 years.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the African polio vaccine was indeed contaminated with SIV/HIV, initial outbreaks of AIDS would have occurred from the mid-1960s to early 1970s. This period
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3423743">
         accurately coincides
        </a>
        with the emergence of AIDS in equatorial Africa.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Understandably, authorities are very reluctant to admit that there's even a possibility that scientists may have contributed to the AIDS pandemic by growing polio vaccines in virus-laden monkey kidneys.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1992, Tom Curtis
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">
        published a story
       </a>
       for
       <em>
        Rolling Stone
       </em>
       that created quite a stir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although dismissed by most experts, “a few scientists, notably the biologist
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.D._Hamilton">
        W.D. Hamilton,
       </a>
       thought the hypothesis required serious investigation, but they received little support from the scientific community.”
      </p>
      <p>
       William Haseltine, a professor at Harvard, believes that hypothesizing about the origin of AIDS is distracting and nonproductive, saying, “It's not relevant...I'm not interested in discussing it.”  Dr. David Heymann, head of the WHO's Global Program of AIDS, stated that “the origin of the AIDS virus is of no importance to science today.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonas Salk wouldn't comment on the possibility, as apparently he was too busy working on an AIDS vaccine, and Sabin's response was “you can't hang Koprowski with that.” Koprowski himself initially dismissed the idea with a laugh, and then later said that “this is a highly theoretical situation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       His amusement must not have lasted long, because Koprowski sued Curtis and
       <em>
        Rolling Stone
       </em>
       for “...the destruction of (his) professional and personal reputation, for mental and emotional suffering, and for...humiliation and embarrassment.” As a result
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis#Development_of_hypothesis">
        the magazine was ordered
       </a>
       to pay
       <em>
        $1
       </em>
       in damages. [
       <a href="http://biasco.ch/materiale/OdM/testo/SeedsOfDoom2006_10_05rev.pdf">
        See
        <em>
         The Seeds of Doom

        by Christian Biasco
       </a>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       However, both Tom Folks of the CDC and Robert Gallo thought testing the seed stocks of polio might be a good idea. According to Folks, “any time we can learn more about the natural history [of AIDS], it helps us understand the pathogenesis and...the transmission.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Gallo believes that questions like this “are of more than academic interest because answering them may help avoid future zoonitic catastrophes—that is, transmission of disease from lower animals to humans.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Responding to these concerns, some AIDS researchers formally requested samples of the original polio vaccine seed stocks. But the government would neither release nor test them because there are “only a small number of vials” of the material, and tests “might use it all up.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Inspired by Curtis' investigative report, a British writer named
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hooper">
        Edward Hooper
       </a>
       traveled in Africa, Europe, and the United States for seven years. As a result of his research, he published a book in 1999 called
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316371378/mongabay-20">
        The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the scientific community generally rejects the OPV AIDS hypothesis, Hooper “criticizes the research and conduct of many of the scientists involved in the investigation and alleges a 'very substantial cover-up' took place to silence the hypothesis.”
      </p>

       How Now, Mad Cow
      </h2>
      <p>
       Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was first noticed in the mid-1980s. Mad cow disease is a progressive nerve disorder of cattle that's similar to scrapie, a disease that affects sheep.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Authorities believe it spread to cows from sheep when they were fed scrapie-infected bone meal.

         Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

        (CJD and vCJD (a newly discovered variant) are the human equivalents of mad cow disease. They cause a comparable wasting of the brain leading to muscle incoordination, sensory loss, and mental confusion. It is always fatal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mad cow disease and the newly discovered variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob may be caused by the same infectious agent.
       <a href="http://www.mad-cow.org/%7Etom/spont_monkey.html">
        A study published in
        <em>
         Nature
        </em>
       </a>
       showed that monkeys injected with BSE developed very similar symptoms to vCJD. They also have similar molecular characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mad cow disease can be passed from cows to humans if they ingest BSE-infected beef,

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        BSE-associated infectious agents are capable of contaminating polio vaccines because polio vaccines are not only grown in monkey kidneys, but in calf serum as well. In fact, many parts of the cow are used in vaccine production. Glycerol is derived from cow fat; gelatin and amino acids come from cow bones; and the growth medium for viruses and other microorganism may require cow skeletal muscle, enzymes, and blood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorities knew that vaccines could be infected with BSE-associated transmissible agents as early as 1988. Yet, in England,
        <a href="http://www.mad-cow.org/00/may00_news.html">
         vaccine manufacturers waited months
        </a>
        before switching to cows less likely to be infected and refused to removed current stock off the shelves and out of doctor's offices until it was all sold, or expired five years later toward the end of 1993.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to one British legislator, “The Department of Health was potentially criminally negligent in not requiring the immediate withdrawal or cessation of use of vaccines from potentially contaminated sources. It is also beyond belief the Department should not even have monitored those who were injected, and is now trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Finally, in October 2000, the Department of Health became so concerned about the likelihood of of children being infected with BSE-contaminated vaccines and falling prey to vCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease—dozens of people, including children, had already contracted it—that they
        <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/21/nhs.bse">
         issued a recall
        </a>
        of hundreds of thousands of polio vaccines made using fetal bovine serum extracted from British cows.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the United States,
       <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1843322">
        the FDA issued a “warning” to manufacturers
       </a>
       in 1996 instructing them to “take whatever steps are necessary to reduce potential risk of transmission of BSE agent.” By 2000, the FDA realized that its “recommendations” were being ignored, for vaccines were still being made in bovine materials from countries reporting BSE. These vaccines wouldn't be removed from the market until 2002, when all existing stock had been purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although cows in America don't exhibit “mad cow symptoms,” tens of thousands of cattle are severely incapacitated each year in what some have suggested may be related to BSE. These “downed” animals have not been ruled out of vaccine production by the FDA.

       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540a3.htm">
        “regain both neuro-virulence and the capacity to circulate and cause outbreaks.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For example, from 2001 to 2005, there were several vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in the Philippines, Madagascar, China and Indonesia. In 2006, additional cases of vaccine-derived polio were recorded in Cambodia.
       </p>

      <p>
       In 2010,
       <a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19566">
        a study was published in Finland
       </a>
       with a title that just about says it all: “Highly divergent neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses of all three serotypes are recurrently detected in Finnish sewage.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Although no cases of “suspected poliomyelitis” have reportedly occurred in Finland since 1985, “Since December 2008, 21 genetically highly divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) have been isolated from sewage in Tampere, Finland. While the source of the VDPV is unknown, characteristics of the viruses resemble those of strains isolated from immunodeficient, persistently infected persons.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, animal matter and questionable drugs are still used in making the polio vaccine.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite the polio vaccine's long history of causing polio, and the manufacturer's inability to protect the public from dangerous microorganisms that perpetually contaminate an ever expanding repertoire of “new and improved” products, the currently available inactivated, or “killed-virus” polio vaccine continues to be manufactured in much the same way as earlier versions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the United States, today's polio vaccine is a sterile suspensions of three types of poliovirus. The viruses are grown in cultures of “a continuous line of monkey kidney cells...supplemented with newborn calf serum...” The vaccine also contains two antibiotics (neomycin and streptomycin), in addition to formaldehyde as a preservative.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Canada, the inactivated polio vaccine is made in “human diploid cells” instead of monkey kidneys. Some researchers believe this is a safer alternative.
        <a href="http://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Polio-SV40/prpolio12798.aspx">
         According to Barbara Loe Fisher
        </a>
        , president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Virginia, “With mounting evidence that cross-species transfer of viruses can occur, the United States should no longer be using animal tissues to produce vaccines.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dr. Arthur Levine of the NIH, however,
       <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;amp;dat=19970129&amp;amp;id=vJAiAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=560FAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=1389,5403613">
        believes that making polio vaccines
       </a>
       using human cells isn't risk-free either, “because they must be tested for human infections.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Levine also worries that even discussing these issues will frighten parents, “We do a grave disservice to the public if we were now to question the safety of the current polio vaccines on the basis of SV40.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It is perhaps this attitude that prompted the CDC to recently remove the section of their website devoted to SV40 information. However, how can this be justified when hundreds of studies have now been conducted linking SV40 to cancer?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Barbara Loe Fisher would like to see changes in the way vaccine safety is governed. She believes that agencies like the FDA have an inherent conflict of interest because of their mandate to promote universal vaccination on one hand and regulate vaccine safety on the other. “Who's minding the store when the FDA has allowed drug companies to produce vaccines grown on contaminated monkey kidneys?”
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Urnovitz is even more resolute in his convictions. He thinks that an extensive study of human exposure to simian microbes is long overdue. “Half of the people in this country are baby boomers who were born between 1941 and 1961 and are at high risk for having been exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with monkey viruses. Are we just a time bomb waiting to happen, waiting to develop lupus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease?”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Urnovitz sums it up nicely, “You have to realize that if you mess around with nature, you're going to pay the price...”

       From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Cutter incident was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history and caused several thousand children to be exposed to live polio virus upon vaccination.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NIH Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Cutter polio vaccine, had received advance warnings of problems: in 1954, staff member Dr. Bernice Eddy had reported to her superiors that some of the inoculated monkeys had become paralyzed (pictures were sent as well). William Sebrell, the director of NIH wouldn't hear of such a thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mistake resulted in the production of 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live polio virus. Of the children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis (a form of the disease that does not involve the central nervous system), 56 developed paralytic poliomyelitis and of these 5 children died as a result of polio infection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The exposures led to an epidemic of polio in the families and communities of the affected children, resulting in a further 113 people paralyzed and 5 deaths. The director of the microbiology institute lost his job, as did the equivalent of the assistant secretary for health. Oveta Culp Hobby stepped down. Dr Sebrell, the director of the NIH, resigned.

       I'm sorry about your health problems, but I do find it interesting that you seem so passionate about this subject and GB is one of the more common of the possible debilitating vaccine reactions, especially from HPV vaccines (which I did mention in this post btw).

       Contamination, Compensation and Corruption
      </h2>
      <p>
       Most young parents don't remember when MMR vaccines didn't exist and when virtually all children contracted measles, rubella, mumps, chickenpox and pertussis, and as a result they developed life long immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world, no one would suffer and these diseases would be eradicated. However, it seems we may have put
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much trust in the ever-increasing vaccine schedule to achieve this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem was greatly compounded in the U.S. by the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
        1986 National Childhood Vaccination Injury Act
       </a>
       , which shockingly was meant “to reduce the potential financial liability of vaccine makers due to vaccine injury claims.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was subsequently created “to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, when the vaccine manufacturer makes a mistake, which has happened before and will happen again, you have to go to a special
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
        vaccine court
       </a>
       and you aren't even allowed to sue the manufacturer directly. Many countries other than the U.S. have similar arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the burden of possibly damaging litigation, this seems to remove an absolute incentive for safety and responsibility on the part of the manufacturers and their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the reasons that vaccine manufacturers should be held completely accountable is that contamination of vaccine stocks are disturbingly common, and this includes organisms such as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus">

       is of particular note, because millions worldwide were exposed to the cancer-causing virus beginning in 1955 as the result of contaminated polio vaccines. The story behind this tragedy is quite shocking and a more detailed account is included in the section on polio.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241931/">
        Studies by Michele Carbone
       </a>
       and others have demonstrated a profound link between SV40 virus from vaccines and mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas, as well as numerous types of brain tumors.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a DNA virus isolated in 1960 from contaminated polio vaccines, that induces mesotheliomas, lymphomas, brain and bone tumors, and sarcomas, including osteosarcomas, in hamsters. These same tumor types have been found to contain SV40 DNA and proteins in humans.
       </p>
       <p>
        It appears unlikely that SV40 infection alone is sufficient to cause human malignancy, as we did not observe an epidemic of cancers following the administration of SV40-contaminated vaccines. However, it seems possible that SV40 may act as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of some tumors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One of the most potent cocarcinogens with SV40 is asbestos.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        SV40 and asbestos are cocarcinogens in causing mesothelioma in hamster and mice, and in causing malignant transformation of human primary mesothelial cells in tissue culture. In vitro and animal experiments showing cocarcinogenicity between SV40 and asbestos support this hypothesis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Although many countries quietly banned SV40 once news of the contamination was released in the 1960's, “an analysis presented at the Vaccine Cell Substrate Conference in 2004 suggested that vaccines used in the former Soviet bloc countries, China, Japan, and Africa, could have been contaminated up to 1980.” And according to Carbone's analysis:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The high incidence of SV40 sequences in Italian specimens, for example, is probably linked to the fact that Italy is the only country in the Western world that used contaminated vaccines as late as 1999.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Carbone and co-workers
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626798">
        also published a study in 1999
       </a>
       claiming that current testing for SV40 was inadequate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has also been demonstrated that those infected with SV40 before 1963 have passed the virus to their offspring (vertical or transplacental transmission).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is why vaccine proponents continue to cover this disaster up—since knowledge of this mass contamination of tens of millions of unsuspecting people and future generations would devastate public trust in government health authorities and the sacrosanct vaccine program.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These fears were given some credibility when
       <a href="http://www.newssum.com/98-million-americans-received-polio-vaccine-contaminated-cancer-virus-596">
        the CDC recently removed the SV40 section on their website.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer-causing polyomavirus called SV40.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michele Carbone, Assistant Professor of Pathology at Loyola University in Chicago, has recently isolated fragments of the SV40 virus in human bone cancers and in a lethal form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. He found SV40 in 33% of the osteosarcoma bone cancers studied, in 40% of other bone cancers, and in 60% of the mesothelioma lung cancers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Michele Carbone openly acknowledged
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edikv0zbAlU">
         HIV/AIDS was spread by the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck &amp; Co. during the early 1970s.
        </a>
        It was the first time since the initial transmissions took place in 1972-74, that a leading expert in the field of vaccine manufacturing and testing has openly admitted the Merck &amp; Co. liability for AIDS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As for HIV, although much of the population is unaware of the SV40 scandal and its implications, many do remember the

      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most shocking thing about the episode was that the products

        <em>
         a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the FDA.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/11564541/CH-51-Vaccine-saftey-forward">
        Neil Miller
       </a>
       , this level of corruption often extends to the safety studies of the vaccines themselves.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Vaccine studies are often funded by pharmaceutical companies with a financial interest in the outcome. Lead authors of important studies that are used to validate the safety or efficacy of a vaccine are often beholden to the manufacturer in some way. They may own stock in the company or are paid by the manufacturer to travel around the country promoting their vaccines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lead authors may receive consultation fees, grants or other benefits from the drug maker that contravene ethical boundaries and compromise the integrity of the study. When studies of this magnitude are jeopardized, generations of people—and society itself—are placed at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some instances, study results may be preordained...tobacco companies used this very same ploy. They financed numerous bogus studies ostensibly “proving” that cigarettes didn't cause cancer. The real studies got lost in the muddle.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the infamous Simpsonwood conference held in Norcross, Georgia, experts knew that mercury in vaccines was damaging children. They had irrefutable proof—the very reason for convening the meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, instead of making this important information public, they hatched a plan to produce additional “studies” that denied such a link. In fact, vaccine proponents had the audacity to claim in some of these papers that mercury in vaccines not only doesn't hurt children but that it actually benefits them!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Perhaps one of the most important shortcomings of the vast majority of vaccine safety studies is the absence of the true double-blind study.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another ploy used by vaccine proponents is to design studies comparing vaccinated people to other vaccinated people. Honest studies would compare them to an
        <em>
         unvaccinated
        </em>
        population. In addition, vaccine control groups rarely receive a true placebo, which should be a harmless substance.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, when the safety profile of a new vaccine is being tested, one group may receive the experimental vaccine made with aluminum while the “control” group receives an injection of aluminum as well (rather than water or another harmless substance).
       </p>
       <p>
        When vaccines are compared in this way, that is, to other substances that are capable of causing adverse reactions, the vaccine appears safer than it really is. Whenever this deceptive tactic is utilized, officially acknowledged adverse reactions to a vaccine may represent only a fraction of the true potential risks to the recipient.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       However, not all studies are skewed, for example
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116914/">
        this 1999 study published by the British Medical Journal
       </a>
       showed a strong correlation between the haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to rising rates of type 1 diabetes, concluding that “the potential risk of the vaccine exceeds the potential benefit.”

       Part of this has been an experiment for me to see what would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In over seven years of being on reddit, I haven't even come
       <em>
        close
       </em>
       to putting together something as long as this and with as many sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I knew it would be controversial (look at some of the comments here), but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't little disappointed at the reception so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took an unreasonable amount of work to put this together, and I was hoping to see an enthusiastic enough response for me to eventually do part 2...I'm not sure anymore though.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main motivation for doing this is for other folks (though I sure learned a shit ton myself researching all of this).
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope that most people aren't indifferent or unwilling to explore this kind of stuff.

       This will be an awesome reference in the future for myself or others (I'm sure) when discussing vaccines and the concerns associated with them.  I hope you realize that there are those of us who greatly appreciate the time and effort posts like this take and aren't discouraged from doing similar research in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lukewarm reception, I think it's a couple of things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         this is a huge, informative post with a ton of sources and which requires hours to sift through properly.  Some people are probably lazy - others are probably either currently going through it or have bookmarked it for later.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "debunkers" and c-tards have nothing to refute all of this with so I think they're choosing to just ignore it as much as possible which leads to less overall comments and, thus, less overall attention on the post.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some people are willfully ignorant on the topic of vaccines and can't be bothered to do any of their own research - they see this and immediately dismiss it.

       I'm not surprised by the down votes - vaccines are a controversial/massively shilled topic to begin with and I think a lot of people are visiting this thread who would not normally subscribe to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to down vote it from the crossposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of upvotes is highly suspicious though.   This is one of the most interesting, well researched posts I have seen.  Also I could swear there were more responses before my phone started running out of memory and I had to relaunch reddit is fun.  Something is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       fishy with the vote count.  The total score is varying by ~15% just between page refreshes, only on this thread.  Also, there is only 1 other topic with such a low total vote to comment ratio in the first 100.  On the plus side it seems to be affecting
       <strong>
        both
       </strong>
       upvotes and downvotes -- 3 downvotes disappeared in the last few minutes.

       Most of the lack of reception is due to three main things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Massive amount of material and people are just lazy as another poster mentioned.
       </li>
       <li>
        Vaccines are probably the number one shill topic to target out of all possible conspiracy topics because most topics are either easily provable (9/11, JFK, etc.) or are very out there (aliens etc.). This is not to say that it's not easily provable to point out how terrible vaccines are and how often times they don't work or aren't needed, but you have to remember we aren't just fighting to prove one thing, we are fighting to disprove all the propaganda around the topic as well. Many
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        posts aren't fighting against propaganda the way vaccines and GMOs are.
       </li>
       <li>
        Vaccines, much like GMOs (and chemtrails too) are a much more controversial than many other r/conspiracy posts because they have a massive impact on society, and people will always defend what is most entrenched in their minds.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       But mostly it's just mega shillage. I'm talking nuclear explosion levels on this topic.

       Hey man, i have been here just as long and I really appreciate this work.  The reception is exactly what I would expect in the modern day climate of reddit.  You hit a nerve that JTRIG can't handle so it's avoided, or just slandered.

       Each vaccine is a ticket to the Disease Lottery, there are many prizes to be distributed, mostly autoimmune diseases, allergies, and even if you don't win one of those you'll still be stuck with a spot of Aluminum in your brain to lower your IQ.

       When will people get it through their heads that a vaccine is just another big pharma product? Products that we KNOW are killing people and fucking with their heads and body chemistry...permanently. Vaccines are transhumanist agenda medicine. The measles vaccine kinda works but guess what? You will never have immunity against any measles strain ever again in your life without a booster shot! And your kids too!

       Vaccines are not a black and white issue, there are benefits and risks.  Nothing wrong looking into the risks, it's everyone's duty to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Associating someone that researches this with being ill-informed is a ridiculous concept.  Big pharmacy kills more people on prescription drugs and I don't see anyone placing blame there.

       Its not so much about being against vaccines or for vaccines.  Its about being realistic and informed about the potential for vaccines to do harm as well as good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who denies that irresponsible manufacturing of vaccines can cause massive harm to the unfortunate people who get served a bad batch is insane!   Just because vaccines do so much good when manufactured properly with safe ingredients doesn't mean that pharmaceutical companies aren't trying to make a profit.  It doesn't mean that honest mistakes can't happen and then be subsequently covered up because of liability.  It doesn't mean that there are never reasons to question the necessity of a particular vaccine.

       This black or white logic is irrational.

       So judging from the misspelling of licensed... and the word practitioner... I'm betting you got a pretty good education...   i bet you practitioners went over every topic covered in this posting.... i mean you have a LICENSE to be a HEALTH PRACTITIONER clearly indicating you know everything there is to know about the topic at hand.  In fact, this LICENSE to be a HEALTH PRACTITIONER pretty much gives you carte fucking blanche to dictate who and who is not informed....

       Hey but good for you, you almost made it to being a doctor... almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades though.

I wish you would have notified me that you were going to do this so we could setup some analytics on the upvote/downvote counts and see the moment when it was used.

      <h2>
       Birth Control Controversy and Measles Malpractice
      </h2>
      <p>
       One of the more frequent vaccine “conspiracy theories” that gets bandied about (and ridiculed) is that some vaccines have been nefariously used for anti-fertility purposes, particularly in Third World nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this claim is largely unsubstantiated, scientists affiliated with the World Health Organization
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       start experimenting with anti-fertility vaccines in the 1970s. Numerous studies throughout the 80's and 90's documented the progress of these experiments, including:

       hCG refers to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCG">
        Human chorionic gonadotropin
       </a>
       , a hormone that stops menstruation and prepares the uterus for pregnancy. They theorized that if anti-hCG antibodies could be induced, then fertilization would remain incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mid 1990s, Human Life International (HLI) became suspicious of a WHO tetanus vaccination campaign in countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Nicaragua. WHO had developed a “neonatal tetanus” vaccine and began distributing it in numerous Third World countries in the early 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neonatal tetanus is extremely rare in developing countries, but it continues to be a concern in Third World regions because of the lack of proper sanitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/vcd/vcdvaccineslacedwithbirthcontrol.shtml">
        According to J.A. Miller, correspondent for Human Life International
       </a>
       (HLI Reports, Human Life International, Gaithersburg, Maryland; June/July 1995, Volume 13, Number 8):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In October 1994, HLI received a communication from its Mexican affiliate, the Comite' Pro Vida de Mexico, regarding that country's anti-tetanus campaign. Suspicious of the campaign protocols, the Comite' obtained several vials of the vaccine and had them analyzed by chemists. Some of the vials were found to contain
        <em>
         human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)
        </em>
        , a naturally occurring hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy.
       </p>
       <p>
        When introduced into the body coupled with a tetanus toxoid carrier, antibodies will be formed not only against tetanus but also against hCG. In this case the body fails to recognize hCG as a friend and will produce anti-hCG antibodies. The antibodies will attack subsequent pregnancies by killing the hCG which naturally sustains a pregnancy; when a woman has sufficient anti-hCG antibodies in her system, she is rendered incapable of maintaining a pregnancy.
       </p>
       <p>
        HLI reported the sketchy facts regarding the Mexican tetanus vaccines to its World Council members and affiliates in more than 60 countries. Soon additional reports of vaccines laced with hCG hormones began to drift in from the Philippines, where more than 3.4 million women were recently vaccinated. Similar reports came from Nicaragua, which had conducted its own vaccination campaign in 1993.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here are several key points raised by HLI concerning the WHO tetanus vaccination program:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Only
         <em>
          women
         </em>
         between the ages of 15 and 45 were vaccinated (in Nicaragua the age range was 12-49). Young children and men were excluded.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not only did the vaccines contain human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), but the vaccination protocols called for multiple injections: three within three months and a total of five altogether. Tetanus vaccinations allegedly provide protection for ten years or more...why multiple injections?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since the 1970's, WHO has been researching development of an anti-fertility vaccine utilizing hCG tied to tetanus toxoid as a carrier...the exact same coupling alleged to be found in the Mexican-Philippine-Nicaragua vaccines.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       HLI cites numerous studies, many written by WHO researchers,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7418885">
        that document
       </a>
       WHO's attempts to create an anti-fertility vaccine utilizing tetanus toxoid as a carrier. [“Observations on the antigenicity and clinical effects of a candidate antipregnancy vaccine: B-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin linked to tetanus toxoid,”
       <em>
        Fertility and Sterility,
       </em>
       October 1980, pp. 328-335.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally, when reports began surfacing in the Philippines of tetanus toxoid vaccine being laced with hCG hormones, the WHO and the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) immediately denied the allegations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Confronted with the results of laboratory tests which detected its presence in three of the four vials of tetanus toxoid examined, the WHO and DOH scoffed at the evidence coming from “right-to-life and Catholic” sources. Four new vials of the tetanus vaccine were submitted by DOH to St. Luke's (Lutheran) Medical Center in Manila—and all four vials tested positive for hCG.
       </p>
       <p>
        From outright denial the stories now shifted to the allegedly “insignificant” quantity of the hCG present; the volume of hCG present is insufficient to produce anti-hCG antibodies. But new tests designed to detect the presence of hCG antibodies in the blood sera of women vaccinated with the tetanus toxoid vaccine were undertaken by Philippine pro-life and Catholic groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of thirty women tested subsequent to receiving tetanus toxoid vaccine, twenty-six tested positive for high levels of anti-hCG.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Apparently, the WHO and the DOH didn't seriously respond to these results, instead trying to explain many of the findings as “false positives.” As for why one might use the tetanus vaccine for such a purpose:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The human body does not attack its own naturally occurring hormone hCG, the body has to be fooled into treating hCG as an invading enemy in order to develop a successful anti-fertility vaccine utilizing hCG antibodies. A paper delivered at the 4th International Congress of Reproductive Immunology (Kiel, West Germany, 26-29 July 1989) spelled it out: “Linkage to a carrier was done to overcome the immunological tolerance to hCG.”
       </p>
       <p>
        After the vaccine controversy had reached a fever pitch, a new bombshell exploded;
        <em>
         none of the three different brands of tetanus vaccine being used had ever been licensed for sale and distribution or registered with the Philippine Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD),
        </em>
        as required by law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The head of the BFAD lamely explained that the companies distributing these brands “did not apply for registration.” The companies in question are Connaught Laboratories Ltd. and Intervex, both from Canada, and CSL Laboratories from Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seemed that the BFAD might belatedly require re-testing, but the idea was quickly rejected when the Secretary of Health declared that, since the vaccines had been certified by the WHO...there was assurance enough that the “vaccines come from reputable manufacturers.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Just how “reputable” one of the manufacturers might be is open to some question. In the mid-'80s Connaught Laboratories was found to be knowingly distributing vials of AIDS-contaminated blood products. [“Ottawa got blood tainted by HIV.”
        <em>
         Ottawa Citizen,
        </em>
        4 April 1995.]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The HLI report concludes by stating that similar evidence was beginning to emerge from Africa. Despite the WHO's insistence upon “false positives,” many of the women who were vaccinated had painful reactions and even abortions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to Sr. Pilar Verzosa, the nun who headed the Philippine branch of HLI, the vaccinated women “started complaining of infected arms and then miscarriages or premature deliveries or even defective babies.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even more disturbing was that the HLI's investigation led them to numerous clandestine groups such as the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the US National Institute of Health (NIH).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2888%2992117-4/abstract">
         The NIH supplied the hCG hormone
        </a>
        in some of the anti-fertility experiments. Moreover, the vaccine was never even licensed for sale and distribution. Authorities violated several internationally recognized laws and ethical standards, including the 1947 Nuremberg Code prohibiting medical experiments on human subjects without their knowledge or consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        HLI has called for a congressional investigation. Yet, to date no public admission of wrongdoing or apology has been issued, and few details of this illicit, covert operation ever reached the general media.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Although it's unlikely that the current tetanus vaccine contains significant amounts of hCG, one manufacturer warns pregnant women that “animal reproductive studies have not been conducted.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, “it is also not known whether [the vaccine] can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity.” To nursing mothers they advise, “It is not known whether [the vaccine] is excreted in human milk...caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman.”

       Another WHO/CDC catastrophe concerns the measles vaccine.

       Most infants under five months are protected from measles by maternal antibodies, and standard measles vaccines are ineffective in babies under nine months. Since measles death rates are higher in Third World countries,

      <p>
       The public was told that EZ-HT “produces a better immunological response than standard vaccines,” but studies had been conducted that concluded the vaccine was unsafe for infants, including the following:

        Child mortality after high-titre measles vaccines: prospective study in Senegal.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The study concluded, quite unequivocally, that “The higher risk of death in the two high-titre vaccine groups remained significant in multivariate analyses. These findings suggest a need to reconsider the use of high-titre measles vaccines early in life in less developed countries.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 1987 to 1989, scientists set up a research center near 30 remote villages in central Senegal. Their stated primary objective was to study the clinical efficacy of two high-titer measles vaccines: Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ-HT) and Schwartz (SW-HT).
       </p>
       <p>
        Researchers may have suspected the vaccine was dangerous when the results of earlier studies began to filter in. But they were probably reluctant to abandon their high-titer shot without testing it at least one more time to be sure. Senegal must have seemed ideal; the region was extremely remote, and less than 4% of the mothers who “consented” to the study were literate.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the results were tabulated (using eight statistical procedures) it became clear that children who received the high-titer measles vaccines had significantly higher mortality rates at 41 months than children in the standard low-titer measles vaccine group.
       </p>
       <p>
        But they were not dying from measles.
        <em>
         Most of the deaths were from other common childhood diseases.
        </em>
        Apparently,
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681265">
         the high-titer measles vaccines lowered overall immunity
        </a>
        making the children fatally susceptible to diarrhea, dysentery, malaria, malnutrition, acute respiratory ailments, and other infectious diseases.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Babies who received SW-HT died at a rate that was
       <em>
        51%
       </em>
       higher than those who received the standard vaccine...nearly 50 excess deaths for every 1000 babies vaccinated. EZ-HT was much more potent, contributing to a rate that was
       <em>
        80%
       </em>
       higher, contributing to 75 excess deaths for every 1000.
      </p>

       Strikingly, according to the previously cited study published by
       <em>
        Lancet
       </em>
       in 1991,
       <em>
        1 in every 6 babies vaccinated with EZ-HT died within three years.

       Before the trials finished, nearly 1500 minority babies had been given the experimental vaccine, according to

He said he was very concerned that the events not fuel suspicion in the minority community of government-sponsored medical research.

      <p>
       We now know that the CDC lied about the study on numerous occasions.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The “informed consent” form provided to parents violated internationally accepted ethical codes of conduct regulating human experimentation. Parents were not informed that EZ-HT was unlicensed in the US.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Parents were told that millions of doses of EZ-HT had been used in Europe. But the LA babies were actually receiving a vaccine that was up to
         <em>
          500

         times more potent.

       <li>
        <p>
         The CDC said the communities targeted for the vaccine were those hit hardest by recent measles outbreaks. According to data obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Health, these communities were
         <em>
          not
         </em>
         the hardest hit. Journalist Keidi Obi Awadu, in his
         <em>
          Outrage!
         </em>
         , documented that “three three regions chosen to receive the experimental shots were predominantly Black and Hispanic.” Furthermore, “several mixed-race and White communities harder hit by the recent outbreak of measles were not chosen to participate in the study.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Although the CDC claimed no children were adversely affected, one baby did die from a rare bacterial disease. According to Awadu, several children “experienced what parents are describing as long-term immune system impairment, seizures and other acute conditions consistent with vaccine-induced injury.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stephen Hadler of the CDC claimed the babies died in earlier studies because they didn't have access to adequate health care. However, one of the more important findings of the Senegal study was “the three vaccine groups were comparable as regards various social, family, and health characteristics. Intensive medical care was provided during the project.”
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1990, WHO requested 250 million doses of the deadly EZ-HT measles vaccine to be dispensed throughout the world. However, data from Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Haiti continued to confirm that EZ-HT doesn't save lives—it increases mortality. By June of 1992, the link was irrefutable; WHO called for a moratorium on use of the disputed vaccine. By some estimates, this may have prevented 18 million baby deaths. [Awadu]

       The Chickenpox/Shingles Charade
      </h2>
      <p>
       Vaccines have been introduced to counteract problems caused by old vaccines. The chickenpox vaccine contributed to a herpes zoster (shingles) epidemic that may last for more than 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster#History">
        Herpes zoster (HZ)
       </a>
       is a reactivation of varicella zoster, the chickenpox virus, and only affects those previously infected with chickenpox. Although most people recover completely from chickenpox, the virus never leaves the body, and especially as people age, the virus can become active again and reappear as “shingles.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Shingles appears as a painful rash or group of blisters on one side of the body, and usually lasts for two to four weeks. Although shingles usually resolves on its own without intervention, some treatments exist to reduce the duration of the symptoms, as well as to prevent a possible severe complication known as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_herpetic_neuralgia">
        postherpetic neuralgia
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Although you can't “catch” shingles from someone who is infected, you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       come down with chickenpox if you've never had it before. Also, shingles is much more common in those over 50.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was previously thought that the weaker immune systems of the elderly contributed to this higher rate of shingles, but
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16126614">
        recent evidence
       </a>
       indicates that it's more likely because they have less contact with children affected with chickenpox.
      </p>
      <p>
       When most adults (who have already had chickenpox) come into contact with children infected with the virus,
       <a href="http://vaccineawakening.blogspot.com/2006/05/shingles-vaccine-targets-baby-boomers.html">
        their immunity is naturally and asymptomatically boosted
       </a>
       , protecting them from shingles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1898279/">
        According to this study
       </a>
       , “The peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella.” Attacks of zoster are postponed when these periodic encounters occur. Also, even the CDC acknowledges that those who have been vaccinated against chickenpox are still susceptible to shingles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine, there were estimated to be 500,000 shingles cases in the US each year. During the period of increasing varicella vaccination, beginning in 1998, HZ among adults
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1177968/">
        increased by 90%
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a 2004 CDC report, the number of shingles cases in 2002 was 33% than in 2001 and 56% than 2000.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759842/">
        This study
       </a>
       , a review of the US universal varicella vaccination program, stated the problem quite clearly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        HZ morbidity costs have exceeded the cost savings from varicella-disease reductions. Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased HZ morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from VZV disease.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Neil Miller summarizes the predicament:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Apparently, there is a societal benefit when chickenpox remains endemic. When the wild-type varicella virus is permitted to circulate naturally throughout society, adults receive beneficial periodic exposures to the virus boosting their immune systems and helping to suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, as more and more children are vaccinated with the synthetic or manufactured chickenpox virus, the natural virus becomes less pervasive and there are fewer opportunities for adults to receive these periodic boosts. This has led to much higher rates of shingles in Americans.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The FDA, CDC and vaccine manufacturers “traded” chickenpox, a relatively mild childhood disease, for a much more serious ailment that affects adults.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15837242">
        Studies have shown
       </a>
       the cost alone for this mistake may be astronomical:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We estimate universal varicella vaccination has the impact of an additional 14.6 million (42%) HZ cases among adults aged &lt;50 years during a 50 year time span at a substantial cost burden of 4.1 billion US dollars or 80 million US dollars annually utilizing an estimated mean healthcare provider cost of 280 US dollars per HZ case.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dr. Gary Goldman, an expert on the varicella virus, was hired in 1995 by the CDC to monitor the new chickenpox vaccine. According to Goldman:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Due to the universal varicella vaccination program whereby every healthy child is vaccinated at age 12 months, there are no longer the seasonal outbreaks of varicella that occurred in schools and communities. These annuals outbreaks and exposures (called exogenous exposures) played a significant role in boosting cell-mediated immunity to help suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster among children and adults who had a previous history of natural or wild-type varicella.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicken-pox-vaccine-associated-with-shingles-epidemic-54648017.html">
        Goldman continues:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The universal varicella vaccination program in the US...will leave our population vulnerable to shingles epidemics...there appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to Goldman, the CDC is more than aware about the problem, and that when he approached them with his concerns, they replied that “any possible shingles epidemic associated with the chickenpox vaccine can be offset by treating adults with a shingles vaccine.”
      </p>
      <p>
       By 2006, the FDA had licensed Zostavax, a vaccine designed to reduce the risk of shingles. Incredibly, Merck, the same company that makes Varivax (the chickenpox vaccine), is also manufacturing Zostavax. Such an apparent conflict of interest is accepted without question, even though the very “success” of Varivax is contributing to the need for yet another product.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of Goldman's research, it's quite clear how dangerous it is to create new vaccines to treat problems caused by old vaccines. He asserts:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The shingles vaccine serves as a vaccine to offset the initial deleterious effects associated with the similar and related varicella vaccine. It will be difficult to replicate the protection against shingles that existed naturally in the community when incidence of chickenpox was high.
       </p>
       <p>
        Using a shingles vaccine to control shingles epidemics in adults would likely fail because adult vaccination programs have rarely proved successful. There appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As for the vaccine's effectiveness when first released, even according to Merck, Zostavax was only 51% effective at “reducing the risk” of developing HZ in those aged 60-69. Efficacy drops to 41% in those 70-79, and is merely 18% above 80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several conflicts of interest also surround Merck and the HZ vaccine. Merck
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15930418">
        participated in the organization of oversight activities and monitored the progress
       </a>
       of the primary study used to justify licensing the vaccine.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Several authors of the study received consultation fees, lecture fees, or honoraria from Merck. Others received grant support from Merck or owned stock in Merck—all while concurrently overseeing important aspects of the study requiring complete objectivity. Two of the researchers were actively involved in this study while having “partial interests in relevant patents.” Still others were employees of Merck.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Dr. William Schaffner, even
       <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=62219">
        received financial payment from Merck to discuss Zostavax with reporters.
       </a>
       Neil Miller notes how this truly should be considered unacceptable:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This questionable practice lowers public confidence in the high ethical standards that should be required and are expected from the custodians of our healthcare system. It also encourages public cynicism towards media coverage of all vaccine-related news.
       </p>
       <p>
        How can we trust
        <em>
         any
        </em>
        claim pertaining to vaccine safety and efficacy when custodians of our healthcare system are receiving money from the drug companies they are commissioned to oversee? A functional system of healthcare checks and balances is imperative.
       </p>

        total votes

       I guess that makes sense - I just seem to notice that certain posts relating to "sensitive topics" always seem to have
       <em>

       few votes relative to the number of comments they have and also relative to other, "less controversial" posts.

       Faith in vaccine and the government to save our diseased butts is bordering on religious extremism type stuff.

       We are giving away our powerful natural abilities to be naturally immune to anything NATURE throws at us, and even in some cases what science throws our way. The same science you then turn back to as the saviour. The same science that reaps the financial benefits of what they inflicted on you.

       Smallpox Shenanigans

      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">
        Smallpox
       </a>
       is caused by the variola virus. You can catch smallpox through infected blankets or clothing, or by inhaling droplets discharged from the nose and mouth of an infected person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within 12 days after exposure, those infected will experience fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, backache, and muscle pains. This is soon followed by severe abdominal pain and a subsequent rash develops on the entire body. The rash then transforms into pus-filled sores which eventually crust over and may leave scars. The disease almost always confers permanent immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are different forms of smallpox (variola major, variola minor, fulminating, malignant, modified, etc.) and some are more serious than others. According to the WHO, case-fatality rate can reach 20% or higher. By 1980 the WHO declared
       <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_global_eradication_of_smallpox.html?id=SCmFQgAACAAJ">
        that smallpox had been eradicated
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the WHO was quick to give credit to their own worldwide vaccination campaign begun in 1967, variola
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10721355">
        had already stopped infecting people
       </a>
       in more than 8 out of 10 countries throughout the world. At that time, only 131,000 cases of smallpox were reported. According to Neil Miller:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some medical historians question the validity of [the WHO's] claim. Scarlet fever and the plague also infected millions of people.
        <em>
         Vaccines were never developed for these diseases yet they disappeared as well.
        </em>
        Several reputable historians credit
        <em>
         multiple
        </em>
        public health activities—sanitation and nutrition reforms—with reducing the incidence and severity of the early problematic diseases, including smallpox, scarlet fever, dysentery, typhoid, and cholera.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The history of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine">
        smallpox inoculations
       </a>
       is important to get an understanding of the history of vaccination, and not just because this story explains how the word “vaccine” was derived.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the 1700s, it was known that contracting smallpox would give you immunity later in life. Some doctors even intentionally exposed people to smallpox hoping to provoke a less severe reaction and still confer immunity. Children were even exposed to pus extracted from “mild” cases of smallpox, a
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9341063">
        technique known as variolation
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1715,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine#cite_ref-11">
        Peter Kennedy
       </a>
       suggested collecting smallpox fluid and introducing it to the patient through a scratch in the skin. This technique would become the model for future applications and research.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It quickly became customary for the upper and middle classes to submit to the procedure. But it was an uncertain and hazardous practice. Often, smallpox by variolation was indistinguishable from an attack of ordinary smallpox. Moreover, it rarely conferred permanent immunity; the variolated could contract the disease more than once.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trouble and risks of variolation were disliked and feared but were accepted in the name of duty. The variolated often died from the procedure, became the source of a new epidemic, or developed other illnesses from the lymph of the donor, such as syphilis hepatitis or tuberculosis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Variolation spread throughout England, Europe, Canada, and the American colonies. However, the primary side effect of the procedure was smallpox itself. This caused researchers to seek alternatives to the dangerous and uncertain medical technique.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 1774,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Jesty">
        Benjamin Jesty
       </a>
       set out to prove that
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpox">
        cowpox
       </a>
       infection protected against smallpox. Apparently, there was a rumor in England among 18th century dairymaids that when you catch cowpox, a relatively harmless disease, you would become immune to smallpox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesty took diseased matter from cows and “vaccinated” his wife and sons (cowpox is also referred to as the vaccinia virus). Supposedly, no one in his family contracted smallpox during later epidemics, although his wife almost lost her arm as the result of a severe inflammation, rousing the ire of his peers for experimenting on his own family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner">
        Edward Jenner
       </a>
       , an English physician whose work Wikipedia dubiously refers to as having “saved more lives than the work any other human.” Apparently, no credit is due to the 18th century milkmaids, or even Jesty, who “unlike Edward Jenner, a medical doctor who is given broad credit for developing the smallpox vaccine in 1796, did not publicize his findings made some twenty years earlier in 1774.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jenner made a deliberate cut on James Phipps, a healthy 8-year-old boy, and inserted cowpox matter into the open wound. The boy caught cowpox. Seven weeks later, Jenner injected smallpox matter into the boy and claimed he was immune to the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenner's medical colleagues disputed his claim that cowpox protected against smallpox: “We know that it is untrue, for we know dairymaids who have had cowpox and afterwards had smallpox.” [White, W.
        <em>
         The Story of a Great Delusion: In a Series of Matter-of-Fact Chapters
        </em>
        (London: EW. Allen, 1885): xi.]
       </p>
       <p>
        Soon thereafter, even Jenner admitted: “There were were not wanting instances to prove that when the cowpox broke out among the cattle at a dairy, a person who had milked an infected animal and had thereby apparently gone through the disease in common with other, was liable to receive the smallpox afterwards.” [Harding Rains, AJ.

      <p>
       Despite facing a good deal of opposition, Edward Jenner continued his experiments and in 1798 he published his
       <em>
        Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae,
       </em>
       a “vulgar treatise” on horsegrease cowpox.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He knew of men who milked cows soon after dressing the heels of horses afflicted with “the grease,” an oily and detestable horse disease. Jenner now insisted that
        <em>
         these
        </em>
        men were immune to smallpox, and that children would forever be protected from the disease if they were injected with cowpox after the cow was infected with the rancid secretions from horses' heels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenner published
        <em>
         Inquiry
        </em>
        in order to recommend horsegrease cowpox. He carefully discriminated it from plain cowpox, which, he admitted, had no protective virtue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The public was appalled by Jenner's recommendations. Still, many attempts were made to verify Jenner's prescription for protecting children; every experiment ended in failure. Jenner's peers were pleased to learn of his failures. One commented: “The very name of horsegrease was like to have damned the whole practice of vaccinations.”
       </p>
       <p>
        This may have been why, in 1806, when the esteemed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Willan">
         Dr. Robert Willan
        </a>
        published
        <em>
         On Vaccine Inoculation,
        </em>
        a treatise on the most recent developments in the field, Jenner was freely cited, yet neither horsegrease nor horsegrease cowpox was ever mentioned. Instead, plain cowpox was exalted as the true prophylactic.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Jenner continued to promote his nauseating treatment and as a result of his petitions to the House of Commons in 1802 and 1807, mass inoculation campaigns began.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Soon thereafter cases of smallpox among the vaccinated were reported. At first they were denied. When denial was no longer possible—because the vaccinated were obviously afflicted with the disease—Jenner and his supporters claimed that if vaccination did not prevent smallpox, it at least provoked milder forms of the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        But when the vaccinated caught the disease and
        <em>
         died,
        </em>
        new explanations became necessary. These deaths were attributed to “spurious” cowpox. [Miller, G., ed., *To Doctor Alexander J.G. Marcet, London, 11 November 1801, Letters of Edward Jenner and Other Documents concerning the Early History of Vaccination (London, England: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1983):13]
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenner explained that “the disease produced upon the cows by the colt and from thence conveyed to those who milked them was the
        <em>
         true
        </em>
        and not the
        <em>
         spurious
        </em>
        cowpox.” According to Jenner, protection from smallpox is not possible “until a disease has been generated by the morbid matter from the horse on the nipple of the cow, and passed through that medium to the human subject.”
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it was virtually impossible to discriminate between the apparently different forms of cowpox. Thus, when the vaccinated recovered from the ordeal, Jenner claimed the cowpox was genuine; otherwise it was spurious!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wikipedia's bold statement seems to be losing some of its bite, for Jenner even admitted that his “gift” caused disease and death: “The happy effects of inoculation...not very unfrequently produces deformity of the skin, and sometimes, under the best management, proves fatal.” He tried to blame the failures on improper inoculations, an excuse that would continue to be used in the years following his death in 1823.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that time, three kinds of smallpox vaccination were being used, cowpox (promoted as “pure lymph from the calf”), horsepox (known as “the true and genuine life-preserving fluid”) and horsegrease cowpox, the “foul concoction” promoted in Jenner's
       <em>
        Inquiry.
       </em>
       All were known to cause disease and death.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Jenner's deaths, vaccine failures continued to be blamed on improperly administered inoculations. Soon, two or more punctures were recommended, with some doctors claiming that a “good vaccination” required
       <em>
        four
       </em>
       punctures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there is no evidence that the number of puncture marks influenced the success of the practice, medical authorities at the time suggested that people be vaccinated again and again “until vesicles cease to respond to the insertion of the virus.” [White, W., pg. xxiii.]

       <p>
        To bolster their claim that smallpox inoculations were safe and effective, vaccine proponents often resorted to medical ploys. Hospital records were consistently “doctored.” For example, smallpox victims who were previously vaccinated and required hospital services were frequently registered as unvaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Dr. Russell of the Glasgow Hospital, “Patients entered as unvaccinated showed excellent marks (vaccination scars) when detained for convalescence.” Vaccinated patients who died from either smallpox or the smallpox injection were often certified as unvaccinated as well, or had their death certificates falsified.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, according to Dr. Herbert Snow, senior staff surgeon of the London Cancer Hospital, “Of recent years, many men and women in prime of life have dropped dead suddenly. I am convinced that some 80% of these deaths are caused by the inoculations or vaccinations they have earlier undergone. The coroner always hushes it up as 'natural causes.' I have been trying to get these case referred to an independent commission of inquiry, but so far, in vain.” [McBean, E.

I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases as pustular eczema, varioloid or whatnot—except smallpox.” [Ibid., pg. 64]

       By around 1850, several countries had enacted compulsory vaccination laws, including Bavaria, Denmark and England.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prior to compulsory vaccine legislation, smallpox outbreaks were regional and self-limiting. The most severe epidemics occurred following mandatory shots.

        In England, from 1870 to 1872, after more than 15 years of forced immunizations—and a 98% vaccination rate—the largest epidemic of smallpox ever recorded maimed and killed thousands of people. Most of the population had been vaccinated and re-vaccinated. [Allen, H.

       Dr. William Farr, Compiler of Statistics of the Registrar-General, London, noted that “Smallpox attained its maximum mortality
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       vaccination was introduced. The mean annual mortality to 10,000 population from 1850 to 1869 was at the rate of 2.04, whereas in 1871 the death rate was 10.24 and in 1872 the death rate was 8.33, and this after the most laudable efforts to extend vaccination by legislative enactments.” [McBean, E., pg. 27]

      <p>
       According to Sir Thomas chambers, a London health official: “Of the 155 persons admitted to the Smallpox hospital in the Parish of St. James, Piccadilly, 145 had been vaccinated.” At Marylevore hospital, 92% of the smallpox cases had been vaccinated. In 1871, officials at Highgate Hospital admitted that 92% had been vaccinated as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Figures were similar in many other countries where compulsory laws were established. For example, in 1870 and 1871 more than one million Germans contracted smallpox after Germany enforced mandatory shots; thousands died. 96% of the victims were vaccinated. [Ibid., pg. 13]

        From 1887 to 1889, countless Italian citizens contracted smallpox after Italy enforced mandatory shots; thousands died. According to Dr. Charles Dauta, Professor of Hygiene and Materia Medica at the University of Perugia, “Italy is one of the best vaccinated countries in the world....For 20 years before 1885, our nation was vaccinated in the proportion of 98.5%....The epidemics of smallpox that we have had [from 1887 to 1889] have been so frightful that nothing before the invention of vaccination could equal them.” [“Vaccination in Italy,”

       In 1918 and 1919, after the US took control of the Philippines, mandatory smallpox vaccination was enforced. Thousands died after the entire population was vaccinated. A 1920 Report of the Philippines Health Services declared, “The 1918 epidemic looks prima facie as a flagrant failure of the classic immunization.” [Ibid., pg. 22]
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the connection between mass vaccination and the increase in epidemic became more apparent, several countries rescinded the mandatory vaccination laws and even outlawed the practice completely.

      <p>
       The Secretary of the Governing Board in Dublin, Ireland, declared, “Smallpox virus taken from the calf would communicate that disease to the human subject and be thereby a fertile source of propagating the disease, and would, moreover, render the operator liable to prosecution under the Act prohibiting inoculation with smallpox.” [White, W., pg. xxi.]

      <p>
       Australia abolished compulsory vaccinations in the late 1800's, and proceeded to report only 3 cases of smallpox in 15 years. Statistics from England and Wales show an inverse correlation between the percentage of babies vaccinated and the number of smallpox deaths: the greater the number vaccinated, the greater the loss. Deaths from smallpox tumbled after people refused the vaccine. [Official statistics from England and Wales, as reported by Shelton, HM., pg. 22]

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By the mid-1850's, a very large anti-vaccine movement had been established. After the 1870-1872 smallpox epidemic, thought to have been caused by mandatory shots, this movement gained credibility and became more organized in its efforts to resist compulsory laws and awaken others to the inherent dangers of smallpox vaccinations.

        In 1878, Mary Catherine Hume published
        <em>
         150 Reasons for Disobeying the Vaccination Law by Persons Prosecuted Under It.

        Parents were being fined a jailed for refusing to submit their children to the shots.

       <p>
        Before the Exemption Act was passed in 1907, every year thousands of parents were prosecuted for resisting vaccination. Many had their homes and property confiscated. Hume's book advocated civil disobedience despite the punitive efforts of pro-vaccinators.

       In 1884, a massive collection of smallpox data was published by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination, containing “unbiased vaccine statistics, newspaper stories about people who were damaged by the shot, and legal briefs regarding compulsory laws.”

        Despite harsh laws, many people refused to be vaccinated and would not allow their children to receive the shots. According to Lord Bramwell, “It is a most mischievous thing that there should be a law in existence which good people are tempted to disobey. It is a bad example to set, and it tends to bring laws into contempt which are of real importance.”

       Even Mahatma Gandhi, although by no means a scientist, would eventually weigh in on the vaccine debate: “I am and have been for years, a confirmed anti-vaccinationist...I have not the least doubt in my mind that vaccination is a filthy process that is harmful in the end.” [Gandhi, MK.

It tends to make more virulent epidemics and to make them more extensive.

       Many studies were conducted that confirmed that the smallpox was actually dangerous and largely ineffective. In 1915, the U.S. Department of Agriculture linked several foot-and-mouth disease epidemics to the smallpox vaccine. [U.S. Department of Agriculture.
       <em>
        Farmer's Bulletin

       (April 22, 1915):15]

      <p>
       In the mid-1920's, Great Britain authorized the
       <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.whale.to/v/charles_forward.html">
        Andrews and then the Rolleston Committee
       </a>
       to study post-vaccinal encephalitis and deaths resulting from the smallpox vaccination.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         The contents of this Report were of so damaging a character that it was deemed advisable to withhold it from publication.
        </em>
        In this (the Rolleston) Report ninety-three cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis with fifty-one deaths are stated to have occurred between Nov., 1922, and Sept., 1927, and in a subsequent Report (Cmd. 3738), covering the three following years, there are recorded a further ninety cases with forty-two deaths.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Among the “damaging” results from these reports were that young adults vaccinated against smallpox were five times more likely to die from the disease than the un-vaccinated! It's no wonder that many respectable institutions were beginning to question Jenner and his legacy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The indisposition of the authorities to admit any awkward facts telling against vaccination is a feature in the history of Jennerism. Thus, until 1911 it was the practice to tabulate deaths following vaccination under the heading—“Cowpox and other Effects of Vaccination.”
       </p>
       <p>
        At the date referred to a new heading, “Vaccinia,” was introduced...five deaths, all of infants, which would in former years have been assigned to the effects of vaccination, appear under the respective headings of erysipelas, pyaemia, septicaemia, convulsions, and phlegmon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Possibly the Registrar-General could offer some reason for altering the practice of thirty years, but the effect, none the less, is to exonerate vaccination by attributing death to secondary causes instead of to the primary cause—vaccination.

        In May 1926, the
        <em>

vaccination and the encephalitis which follows it.”

       The next month
       <em>

      <p>
       In 1928, the League of Nations issued a report that noted, “The post-vaccinal encephalitis with which we are dealing has become a problem in itself...Their occurrence has led to the realization that a new, or at least a previously unsuspected or unrecognized, risk attaches to the practice of vaccination.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Report also noted 139 recent cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis and 41 deaths in one country alone, Holland. Compulsory smallpox vaccinations were discontinued as a result.

       </p>
       <p>

       Later that year, the

       In December of 1952,
       <em>

       published a study documenting the reaction of a woman who was three months pregnant to the vaccine: “She developed a severe primary reaction and three months later she was spontaneously delivered of a feeble hydropic premature infant covered with a very severe generalized vaccinia. The child died 18 hours later.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Another study determined that 47% of women who were vaccinated during their first trimester failed to give birth to a normal child. [McBean, E., pg. 82.]

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the late 1950s and 1960s, several medical and scientific publications documented numerous cases of post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis following smallpox vaccination. Neurological reactions ranged from encephalitis to epilepsy, polyneuritis, multiple sclerosis, and death.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some regions of the world, 1 of every 63 people vaccinated was damaged by the shot. Extreme sensitivity to multiple shots was also observed. Subsequent inoculations were responsible for many of the post-vaccinal ailments. In fact, the death rate from vaccination appeared greatest in those who were vaccinated early in life and then re-vaccinated in later years. The morbidity and mortality rates were extremely high in babies as well.

       Smallpox and AIDS
      </h2>
      <p>
       By the 1980's, a link between contracting AIDS after receiving the smallpox vaccination became apparent: “Primary smallpox immunization of persons with subclinical HIV disease poses a risk of vaccine-induced disease and multiple immunizations may accelerate the progress of HIV disease.”
      </p>
      <p>
       According to researchers, this raises “concern about the ultimate safety of vaccinia-based vaccine in developing countries where HIV infection is increasing.” [Redfield, R., et al.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3821799">

        The WHO advisor did his study, concluded that the smallpox vaccine was a trigger for AIDS, and filed his report with WHO.

       The regions that received the most vaccinations coincided with the areas of the greatest outbreaks of AIDS, including Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawai, Ruanda, and Burundi. Brazil had the highest AIDS rates in South Africa, and they were the only country including in the smallpox vaccination campaign on the entire continent.
      </p>

       According to the WHO advisor, “I thought it was just a coincidence until we studied the latest findings about the reactions which can be caused by vaccinia. Now I believe the smallpox vaccination theory is the explanation of AIDS.”

       During the 1970s experimentation with smallpox virus was conducted, and two medical researchers were even killed in England as a result. To reduce the risk of future accidents, all remaining known samples were moved to a CDC facility in Georgia and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, Siberia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous deadlines came and went to destroy the virus, with some scientists defending the need to preserve them...“for science!”

       </p>
       <p>
        The method involves infecting calves with a related virus, vaccinia; the resulting pus is used in the making of the vaccine. That process is considered barely acceptable for human vaccine today.

       <p>
        In 1997, four years before the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense contracted with DynPort Vaccine Company to produce a new smallpox vaccine. In September of 2000, one year before the terrorist attacks,
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/26/business/26SMAL.html">

       </p>
       <p>
        Some researchers were puzzled by these actions since smallpox was supposedly eradicated and authorities were debating whether to destroy all of the remaining seed stocks of the virus. According to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, of the Department of Health and Human Services, “A lot of people thought this was a crazy idea, to make a new vaccine when the disease didn't exist.”

       In June 2001,
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the 9/11 attacks, a team of bioterrorism specialists led by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies conducted a smallpox epidemic exercise ominously called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Winter_%28biodefense_exercise%29">

       <p>
        However, like any theoretical exercise, conclusions are predicated on the underlying assumptions. One key assumption was that each person with smallpox would infect at least 10 other people and that those 10 people would each infect at least 10 more people and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        But
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11747722">

        regards those infection rates as grossly unrealistic. The authors of the study looked at data from numerous smallpox outbreaks and reported that on average less than one person was infected per infectious person.
       </p>
       <p>
        In all outbreaks, some infected persons did not transmit a single case of smallpox to another person.
        <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/10/smallpox-attack-exaggerated/">
         The CDC researchers concluded
        </a>
        “the probability that the average transmission rate will be greater than two cannot be demonstrated reliably.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even though the Dark Winter simulation was severely flawed, Dr. Henderson, the “team leader” who also led WHO's global effort to eradicate smallpox, concluded that the threat was real and recommended 100 to 135 million doses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than 10 days after 9/11, Dick Cheney was shown a video of the Dark Winter simulation and urged to increase the production of smallpox vaccine.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On October 24, 2001, President Bush asked Congress for $509 million to develop and produce a new smallpox vaccine. He solicited bids for the job from several pharmaceutical companies, insisting on 300 million doses—one dose for every American—within the shortest possible time, not to exceed one year.

      <p>
       The new vaccine
       <a href="http://prospect.org/article/smallpox-wars-1">
        was expected to be made from

       a “diploid cell substrate” (human embryo) or from animal tissue cell cultures, including those with “tumorigenic potential.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ideally, it would not cause adverse reactions, would not be dangerous to people with immune system deficiencies, and would have the capacity to defeat genetically altered strains of variola. But researchers provided no evidence that the new vaccine would cause fewer adverse reactions than the old vaccine.

        Furthermore,
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12496351">
         experts were very concerned
        </a>
        about “the transmissibility of vaccinia virus from a recently vaccinated person to a susceptible host.” In other words, some people—no one knows how many—will develop smallpox by coming into contact with a recently vaccinated person.

        In 2002, the U.S. government tested their existing smallpox vaccine on 200 “fit and healthy” college students.

       Also in 2007, an experimental smallpox vaccine called ACAM2000 (made by Acambis) was declared safe and effective by the FDA, despite the fact that
       <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACAM2000+Clinical+Trials.-a0115255261">
        clinical trials of this vaccine were halted

        ACAM2000 is “nearly as effective”

       as the older smallpox vaccine, Dryvax, and poses “similar risks of serious side effects.”

      <p>
       As for Dryvax, the listed adverse reactions include autoinoculation (transfer of the virus to other parts of the body) affecting the face, nose, mouth, genitalia and rectum; infection of the eye resulting in blindness; post-vaccinal encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, neurological sequelae, and death.

       However, even while U.S. Homeland Security was contemplating mandating the smallpox vaccine, not every government official was convinced.

        Because there has been no research into the biological mechanisms that predispose people to vaccine reactions and there has been no effort to screen out these individuals, this type of action should be condemned; it will create unfathomable human suffering and sacrifice.

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_waxman">
        Henry Waxman

       was forced to state the obvious: “The president has asked healthcare workers to volunteer to be immunized so that they can serve society. In turn, society should help them if they are hurt when they volunteer.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In response to these concerns, in 2006 the U.S. government published the “final rules” to the

        Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
       </a>

      </p>
      <p>
       Also, “unvaccinated individuals injured after coming into contact with a vaccinated member of an emergency response plan, or with a person with whom the vaccinated person had contact, or their survivors may be eligible for the same program benefits.”

       In conclusion, Neil Miller offers a crude, but damning, summary of this alternative perspective of the history of smallpox and the smallpox vaccine:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Being with unsanitary living conditions and poor nutritional awareness. This results in regional and self-limiting outbreaks of smallpox.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Conduct human experiments with variolation—the practice of inserting viral matter (infectious pus) from a smallpox victim into a deliberate cut on a healthy person.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When this fails, conduct human experiments with cowpox, horsepox, and horsegrease cowpox.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When this fails, deny it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When this fails, blame it on “spurious” cowpox, improperly administered injections, or too few puncture marks...and recommend re-vaccination.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When this fails, manipulate statistics by altering medical records and falsifying death certificates...and
         <em>
          mandate
         </em>
         the smallpox vaccine.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When people refuse the shot, vaccination rates drop, and cases of smallpox dwindle...take full credit for eradicating the disease!

       The point is that modern smallpox knowledge is not based on 18th century knowledge, anymore than evolutionary theory is required to be supported by the writings of Charles Darwin.

       My post on smallpox isn't based on this knowledge either. If you had even read the entire thing, you'd also realize that I mention almost nothing about the 18th century.

       General posting patterns, both as far as topics are concerned and methods of conversation. Technically it's impossible to "prove" someone is a shill because of how the internet works. However, making a solid educated guess is very easy.

       That's fine, but please refrain from accusing other members of being "shills" in a given thread. It's technically a rule violation here.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely, he's a determined skeptic/debunker with too much time on his hands. Even if he is a shill it doesn't exactly help to label other users as such arbitrarily or not, as the term is so overused it has lost all credibility, and more often then not only serves to disrupt the conversation &amp; dismiss the views of others who simply disagree with you based entirely on an assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I'm aware shills exist, corporate, government and ideological. Leaked documents and public recruiting efforts have confirmed this. It is also incredibly unlikely they would not spread their influence throughout reddit, among other forms of media. Still, without proof, it is counterproductive at best to throw the word "shill" around at any user who maintains a skeptical viewpoint. After all, we have an entire subreddit of skeptics (
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic
       </a>
       ) who get off on attempting to prove others wrong, typically to boost their own ego. Not to mention, the trolls. Now, if you see someone you suspect is a shill (or not) who is trolling and violating the rules, feel free to report them. I don't take trolling lightly, and may ban actual trolls on a first offense, whereas normally I would simply remove offenses or issue a warning.

       Well, the first section is on smallpox, which really hasn't been much of a 20-21st century issue.   The other sections have plenty more recent studies/doctors/etc.  Maybe if you read past the first half a page.....

       I found the part about the low contagion rate particularly interesting.   Makes me think it was probably only epidemic because the Native Americans were more susceptible and/or more likely to spread it, and the disease ran out of that population to spread through.   It would also explain why I've seen reports that the Pilgrims found convenient recently abandoned ghost towns to move into where hundreds of years earlier the native population had fought off the fucking

       This is such a tough issue for me. On one hand I completely respect the results of science and vaccines. Polio nearly disappeared until the unvaccinated started getting it again. Measles and other preventable diseases keep popping up in the pockets of the less educated and more religiously oriented segments of America. There is no doubt lives are saved with vaccines and needless suffering and medical costs are prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm not one to trust the Conspiracy. At all. And there is behavior in this nation I cannot explain. Americans blindly lap up everything told them by their chosen media, be it the ultra-secret anti-government UFO club of theirs or the Republicrat political parties. The Conspiracy is taking freedom away at a record pace, many of you marching right along to the beat gleeful and ignorant. There may be something to the idea that some mind-control drug or toxin is injected early in these vaccines. What else explains "American Idol"? Seriously, who watches that shit?

      <h2>
       Risks, Reactions and Revenue
      </h2>
      <p>
       Adverse reactions to vaccines are unacceptably common. Even the FDA admits that FluMist (the live-virus nasal spray vaccine) can cause pneumonia and “medically significant wheezing.” Neil Miller reports that “during pre-licensure clinical studies 3% of all children six months to one year of age who received the vaccine ended up in the hospital with respiratory problems!”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before this vaccine was approved, a large study conducted in 31 clinics showed that it caused “a statistically significant increase in asthma or reactive airways disease” in children under five years of age. Nevertheless, in September 2007 the FDA licensed this vaccine for children as young as two years old.
       </p>
       <p>
        With some vaccines, the number of people who experience systemic reactions, such as fever, headache, respiratory infection, muscle aches, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chills and fatigue, is very high.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, up to 10% of babies will vomit following their pneumococcal shots.
        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm">
         A whopping 62%
        </a>
        of 18-55 year-old recipients of the meningococcal vaccine had systemic reactions. Doctors consider most systemic reactions “normal.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Common systemic reactions are separate from
        <em>
         severe and fatal
        </em>
        reactions, including neurological, immunological and paralytic disorders such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9_syndrome">
         Guillain–Barré syndrome
        </a>
        , demyelinating diseases, arthritis, anaphylactic shock, and other life-threatening conditions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Vaccine injuries can often be “disguised” by labeling the conditions as learning disabilities, hyperactivity, mental retardation, attention deficit, etc. Many parents are completely unaware at how common these adverse reactions can be, let alone that they can occur at all. According to a study published by
       <em>
        Pediatrics,
       </em>
       when parents were specifically asked to observe changes in their baby's behavior after a shot, only 7% reported no reactions at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the public's general ignorance of the various types of possible damage that can result from vaccines, the true number of vaccine injuries may be vastly underreported.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547435/">
        this study:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (PL-99-660) requiring health care providers to report suspected vaccine reactions to a centralized reporting system. As a result, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was established in 1990.
       </p>
       <p>
        VAERS is a postmarketing safety surveillance program that collects information about possible adverse reactions (side effects) that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United States. Current and historic VAERS data are public access, available to health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the general public.
       </p>
       <p>
        VAERS receives approximately 30,000 reports annually. Since 1990, VAERS has received over 350,000 reports, most of which describe mild side effects, such as fever and local reactions.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 13% of all reactions are classified as serious, involving life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. By monitoring such events, VAERS helps to identify unusual patterns of reports and important safety concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our findings show a positive correlation between the number of vaccine doses administered and the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths.

        Since vaccines are given to millions of infants annually, it is imperative that health authorities have scientific data from synergistic toxicity studies on all combinations of vaccines that infants might receive. Finding ways to increase vaccine safety should be the highest priority.

       However, the FDA estimates that 90% of doctors don't even report reactions. Continuing from the study on VAERS:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since VAERS is a passive system, it is inherently subject to underreporting. For example, a confidential study conducted by Connaught Laboratories, a vaccine manufacturer, indicated that “a fifty-fold underreporting of adverse events” is likely.

       <p>
        <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=406452">

        </a>
        , former commissioner of the FDA,

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to Neil Miller, one of the authors of the aforementioned study, the federal government is aware of the unnecessarily high danger of many vaccines.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In fact, Congress established a “hazard” tax on childhood vaccines. When parents pay the doctor for requested shots, some of that money goes into a special fund to compensate them when their children are seriously damaged or die.
       </p>
       <p>
        As of September 2009, nearly $2 billion was granted for thousands of injuries and deaths caused by mandated vaccines. Numerous cases are still pending. Awards were issued for permanent injuries such as learning disabilities, seizure disorders, mental retardations, paralysis, and numerous deaths, including many that were initially misclassified as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parents need to understand that vaccines are drugs. Each one contains a proprietary blend of chemicals, pathogens and other foreign matter. That is the nature of a vaccine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, children receive one vaccine at birth, eight vaccines at two months, eight vaccines at four months, nine vaccines a six months, and twelve additional vaccines between 12 and 18 months (DtaP and MMR are each given with a single injection but contain three vaccines).
       </p>
       <p>
        The United States is the most vaccinated country in the world, yet it has a poor infant mortality rate. One would think that a country with
        <em>
         more
        </em>
        immunizations, which are explicitly promoted as life saving, especially for babies, would have an excellent infant death rate...as new vaccines are added to the recommended vaccine schedule, the US infant mortality rate worsens.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1960 (before mass vaccines) the US had one of the best infant mortality rates in the world. By 1998, the US dropped to 28th place. By 2006 [the US] fell to 42nd place, worse than Cuba but ahead of Croatia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Interesting that Croatia would be so low on that list as well, as their policy towards vaccinating infants was made very clear by recent legislation
       <em>
        forcing
       </em>
       all parents to vaccinate, a disturbing decision that was even more disturbingly lauded by those who think the vaccine debate is only about “autism.”
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Miller is quite clear that vaccination
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       prevent disease...the tragedy is that greed and conspiracy have created a system that is becoming increasingly difficult to trust.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you choose not to vaccinate, there are risks involved. Your child could contract a disease for which a vaccine has been developed. Your child may also experience complications form this disease, which could be permanently debilitating or life-threatening, depending on the particular condition and other factors, such as the child's physical constitution and its ability to reestablish health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not vaccinating is just one risk; vaccinating is another...diseases are described in frightening detail and their risks exaggerated beyond reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        With vaccines (and many drugs as well) the “solution” is often developed prior to the marketing of fear. For example,
        <em>
         before
        </em>
        the chickenpox vaccine was licensed for general use in 1995, doctors would encourage parents to expose their children to the disease while they were young. Doctors recommended this course of action because they knew that chickenpox is relatively innocuous when contracted prior to the teenage years, but more dangerous in adolescents and adults.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It wasn't until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the vaccine was licensed that the CDC began warning parents about the dangers of chickenpox. Many doctors soon stopped encouraging parents to expose their children and instead receive the shot. The “solution”—a vaccine—preceded the apparent danger.

       Vaccine efficacy can be specious.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For example, scientists presume that certain “surrogate markers” or “precancerous lesions” precede cervical cancer. With the HPV vaccine, they simply compared the numbers of these markers in women who received the vaccine to the numbers of these markers in women who received the placebo. However,
        <em>
         no actual cases of cervical cancer were prevented in any of the test subjects in any of the clinical studies of the HPV vaccine.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The HPV vaccine was marketed deceptively as well when first introduced, being promoted as “100%” effective. However, the vaccine is only “100%” effective against two of numerous strains of HPV, not cervical cancer itself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During prelicensure studies, 361 women who received at least one shot of Gardasil went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes within three years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to the report
       <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe078060">
        HPV Vaccination – More Answers, More Questions
       </a>
       : “cautious approach may be warranted in light of important unanswered questions about overall vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and adverse effects that may emerge over time.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In this 2007 report commissioned by the NEJM, two studies were considered on the vaccine's effectiveness on cervical cancer. The report asked: “In these trials, called Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) I and II, what is the efficacy of vaccination among all subjects, regardless of causal HPV types?”
      </p>
      <p>
       The results were not promising, as it was determined that in FUTURE I that the vaccine had an efficacy of only 20%, and this was only against low-risk lesions: “no efficacy was demonstrable for higher-grade disease, but the trial may have lacked adequate power to detect a difference.”
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the larger FUTURE II had more conclusive, and even less favorable, results, as the vaccine was only 17% effective, and again had no impact on preventing high-risk lesions. The report mentions the obvious shortcomings of the vaccine:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Another factor explaining the modest efficacy of the vaccine is the role of oncogenic HPV types not included in the vaccine. At least 15 oncogenic HPV types have been identified, so targeting only 2 types may not have had a great effect on overall rates of preinvasive lesions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This concept of “strain replacement” is not limited to the HPV vaccine, and is an extremely important aspect of the vaccine debate that deserves more attention. Miller continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gardasil is not the only vaccine that targets some strains of the disease while excluding others. The Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were also constructed in this manner, and have become problematic due to “strain replacement.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Scientists have discovered that when vaccines only attack some strains of a disease, other strains gain prominence. The disease becomes more virulent and people who are normally not susceptible to the ailment are infected.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, there are several different types of haemophilus influenzae, including types a, b, c, d, e, and f. The “b” type is just one strain—the only one for which a vaccine was created—the Hib shot. Although this vaccine appears to have decreased cases of haemophilus influenzae type b in children,
        <em>
         the overall rate of invasive haemophilus influenzae disease in adults increased.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Researchers don't consider this a failing of the Hib vaccine, rather
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17304452">
        “it raises the question whether a [new] vaccine will need to be developed.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Prevnar, the pneumococcal vaccine, is only designed to protect against a few of the 90 different strains that can cause the disease. The vaccine is therefore still considered “effective” if the child is stricken with pneumococcus...just not from one of the strains included in the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        Journal of the American Medical Association
       </em>
       and the
       <em>
        Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal
       </em>
       have both published data demonstrating that non-vaccine strains of pneumococcus are replacing the strains targeting by the vaccine. What's even more concerning is the new strains are more dangerous and drug-resistant. According to the study
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3416489/">

       </p>
       <p>

       Another concern is when vaccines are given to one group with the hope of protecting another group. Miller explains:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mass rubella vaccination campaigns were never intended to protect vaccine recipients; the disease is usually harmless when contracted by children. Instead, the goal has always been to protect the unborn fetuses of rubella-susceptible pregnant women.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the hepatitis B vaccine was originally introduced, this same rationale was employed. Children rarely develop this disease. In the US, less that 1% of all cases occur in persons less than 15 years of age. The disease is even more uncommon in babies and toddlers. However, “because a vaccination strategy limited to high-risk individuals has failed,” and since children are “accessible,” they are compelled to receive the three-shot series beginning at birth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some studies show that hepatitis B vaccine recipients lose protective antibodies after 5 to 10 years.
The vaccine that babies receive shortly after birth at the hospital will not be effective a few years later. “
       <a href="http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hbv-prevention/hbv-vaccines/3775-icaac-2012-hepatitis-b-vaccine-effective-long-term-but-some-lose-protection-after-15-years">
        By 5 to 15 years after vaccination
       </a>
       , some individuals have antibody levels below the protective threshold—and in some cases even undetectable.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The necessity for multiple “booster” shots is disturbing. Initially, when a new vaccine is introduced, a single shot may be recommended, Later, when the artificial immunity wears off, vaccine manufacturers and the CDC recommend one or more additional shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        With natural immunity, which is acquired by being exposed to the actual disease, protection is not meager and temporary, but rather complete and lifelong. The child will rarely contract the disease again. This is not true with vaccines. Isn't it odd that the vaccine industry's answer to an ineffective vaccine is to compel more of it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another example of the strange logic employed by the media and many vaccine enthusiasts is the hysteria surrounding blaming those who are unvaccinated when there are outbreaks of disease.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unvaccinated children are often sent home form school during outbreaks of measles, mumps and other contagious diseases. Ironically, these children are not sent home for their own protection. On the contrary, doctors claim that unvaccinated children will spread disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, this does not make sense (unless we consider it a veiled confession of vaccine inefficacy). How is it possible for an unvaccinated child to imperil vaccinated children? If the shots are effective, then vaccinated children should be protected.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Miller continues by stressing that even members of the U.S. government are aware that the current vaccine program has many shortcomings, as well as the uncomfortable fact that some members of the FDA and CDC have extremely suspect financial interests.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hearings are regularly held to highlight problems with individual vaccines as well as to investigate the integrity of the vaccine program itself...
        <em>
         Members of the exclusive FDA and CDC committees that are responsible for licensing and recommending vaccines for all children in the US are permitted to have financial stakes in those vaccines.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For example, in 2000, a congressional hearing before the Committee on Government Reform was held called
       <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21687264/Conflicts-of-Interest-in-Vaccine-Policy-Making-2000">
        Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Policy Making
       </a>
       . The tone of the hearing was set in the opening statements, when it was announced that they needed to determine if “the entire process of licensing and recommending vaccines” has been polluted and the public trust has been violated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent revelations about questionable tactics to approve the first rotavirus vaccine prompted the hearing. It was suspected that members of the FDA and CDC knew about the dangers of the rotavirus vaccine before approving it and recommending it for every child in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a physician on the FDA's committees that voted to recommend the vaccine,
       <a href="http://www.vaccineinfo.net/issues/conflictofinterest/ConflictsOfInterestHearing.shtml">
        received $255,000 a year from Wyeth-Lederle
       </a>
       , the making of the vaccine. This fact was also cited in the 2000 congressional hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Paul Offit, who was on the CDC's committee that recommended the vaccine, also held a lucrative patent on another rotavirus vaccine under development. “In addition, [Offit] was paid by the drug industry to travel around the country and teach doctors that vaccines are safe.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, even within the last few months, Offit has made appearances on numerous talk shows, both TV and radio, bemoaning those who dare to question vaccines. The vast majority of the time he specifically mentions only “autism” and how ignorant the “anti-vaxxers” are for being afraid of “autism.” Instead of educating, he is continuing to restrict the conversation by completely omitting all of the concerns outlined so far, among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the more striking things revealed by this hearing was with regards to the FDA and CDC advisory committees that voted to recommend adding the rotavirus vaccine to the childhood vaccination schedule. A whopping 60% of the FDA advisory committee and 50% of the CDC committee had financial ties either to the drug company that produced the vaccine or to Merck and SmithKline Beecham, two other companies developing potentially lucrative rotavirus vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the hearing, Congressman Dan Burton had this to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Families need to have confidence that the vaccines that their children take are safe, effective and very necessary. Doctors need to feel confident that when the FDA licenses a drug, that it's really safe and that the pharmaceutical industry has not influenced the decision-making process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintaining the highest level of integrity over the entire spectrum of vaccine development and implementation is essential. No individual who stands to gain financially from the decisions regarding vaccines that may be mandated for use should be participating in the discussion or policymaking for vaccines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One would think, in the face of waning public confidence in the entirety of the vaccine program, that the FDA and CDC would take the opportunity to agree with such a rational request and restore the confidence of Congress and the public. Sadly, the response was quite the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 24th, 2000,
       <em>
        Reuters Medical News
       </em>
       published an article called “Congressional report slams FDA, CDC policies on disclosing financial conflicts.” The article describes how Linda Suydam, the senior associate commissioner at the FDA, stated quite unequivocally that “Both the law and policies allow us to use people who have financial ties.” Both the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were also unwilling to make any of the recommended changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rotavirus vaccine saga continued when a
       <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa052664">
        2006 study
       </a>
       was used by the FDA and CDC as a basis for licensing and recommending a new vaccine called RotaTeq. Neil Miller explains the obvious conflict of interest:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Authors of the study included Paul Offit and H. Fred Clark, co-owners of the patent on this vaccine (along with Dr. Stanley Plotkin). In addition, several other members of the study team who were supposed to be objectively evaluating the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, were paid consulting fees, lecture fees, and/or provided grant support by Merck, the vaccine manufacturer, or by GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of another rotavirus vaccine soon to be approved as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some study team members even owned stock in Merck, whose equity value would increase by positive evaluations of this vaccine. Apparently, such conflicts of interest were deemed irrelevant to the impartiality required to ensure the integrity of the entire vaccine approval process and the safety of millions of babies who would soon receive this new vaccine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The vaccine market is shifting towards adolescents and adults as well. According to a June 17th, 2007 article published by
       <em>
        Genetic Engineering and Biotech News,
       </em>
       “at present, pediatric vaccines occupy a higher market share, but this trend will shift towards the adult vaccine segment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally, the US is the largest market for vaccines because they are “more profitable than generic pharmaceutical drugs.”

       I guess the point is the history of vaccination is much different than most realize, and this has created a situation where vaccine manufacturers can make shit products
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       have financial ties to the FDA, CDC and other government regulatory agencies that approve their shit product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines could be
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       safer, but greed has corrupted the scientific process.
      </p>
      <p>
       This affects everyone around the world, especially in countries where experimental vaccines are used.

       it has been my experience that anyone who practices caution and skepticism with specific vaccines they put in their child; is labeled a BABY KILLING LIAR. yes in all capitals, i have been called this several times on the internet. As an individual i have the right to do whatever the hell i want with my body, but when it comes to accepting that all vaccines are good for you- anyone who doesnt hold this blanket belief is instantly labeled "antisicence".

       Well I do in fact, so that sweeping generalization doesn't work.  I find the schooling system to be more of an indoctrination than real education.  No critical thinking, trivium methodology, or even personal finance is taught.  Kids can calculate the area of a circle before they learn compound interest.

       It's a type of propaganda popularized by Stalin and the Soviet union,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_of_the_people">
        'Enemy of the People'

       . So you get all this made up labels, anti-this/that, baby-killer and other silliness. 
By my observation, truth supports itself just fine,  it's only when something's not doing too well in that department that people resort to that kind of underhanded rhetoric.

       thank you. People are ready to nail me to the cross because i say i am cautious around certain vaccines They start making statements like "they should be mandatory" etc. Then the moment i tell them i was injured by one in highschool- the air in the room completely changes. Yes im one of tiny statistics of people injured by a certain vaccine, im not 100% against all vaccines but i sure as hell damn are cautious around blanket statements.

       Thanks for well done research. I really enjoy these well cited stickied posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that no one attempts to actually debate the cited works. Instead of critical rebuttals, the "
       <em>
        debunkers
       </em>
       " are, thus far, either resorting to ad hominem or saying that the post is too long and was purposely made so that no one would read it. I am guessing that in the age of soundbites and trite memes that no one wants to take the time to read. You know like how one would sit down and read a book.

       Without going in to many details I used to work at hospitals and I would see people coming in with paralysis and saying "My god damn mother didn't let me get a polio vaccine when I was a kid".

       Regular flu shots might pose more of a risk than reward for young and healthy people because there are very rare but possible side effects from a bad batch. For old people it's rolling your dice in the right direction because the flu kills old people all the time. However it's not always a good profile and sometimes you still can get sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with any medicine there's always a risk. Run the averages and get your recommended vaccinations.

       I trust the science of vaccination.  I don't trust the multinational corporations (beholden only to their bottom lines) that produce the products labeled as vaccines.

       The science of vaccination and the products sold as vaccines are not synonyms.  Vaccination, as a methodology and discipline, has been well tested.  However, that doesn't mean I trust companies like GSK, Merck, etc. to produce so-called vaccines that aren't poisonous.

       Very good. It's refreshing to see someone other than myself able to reiterate this distinction clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want to help you appreciate just how
       <em>
        insidious
       </em>
       this error is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccinations are the result of a process... that has inherent probabilities of failure at each step.  Those probabilities combine to eventually give a probability of dangerous contamination per dose - which is a non-zero number.  They also combine to give a probability of ineffective dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this probability is .01%, meaning the vaccine is 99.99% effective and safe - and 100 million doses are deployed over a given time frame - 10,000 children will get an ineffective or dangerous vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the development of this product, a binary event of .01% probability will first exhibit on average by 10,000 trials (E = 1/p).  This means our vaccine would have to be tested on 10,000 people - for there to be a 50% chance a contamination event was observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of our current biological systems, from vaccines, to medicines, to certain foods.... none of them can be tested to reveal low-probability events that only reveal themselves at trials on a greater order of magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will go the path of vaccination, and some will not.  Both are equally supported in my opinion to suspect both paths are reasonable.  So it is into the great unknown we as a society venture through the darkness. Sometimes you really can only fall back on faith.

       Indeed.  For me, the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.  Sometimes, you get a company like Bayer knowingly selling HIV contaminated pharmaceutical products to foreign markets.  Sometimes you virtually eradicate Polio.

       I usually don't respond to your shillery because you actually make decent counterpoints sometimes, but I'm going to nail you for this.  During the middle ages massive numbers of people died from starvation, literally a complete lack of nutrition, at all.  Peasants couldn't afford to eat well, many spent their entire lives subsisting on a single crop.  Far from the wide-range of micronutrients needed for a strong immune system.  There was no such thing as refrigeration; eating rotten, bacteria-infested food was commonplace.  Sewers were basically non-existant, human and animal corpses were improperly contained, purified water was nonexistant.  People rarely received medical treatment, most diseases were diagnosed as some sort of satanic possession.  The type of "exercise" they received was often brutal slave labour, which would severely over-stress their bodies, not make them stronger.

       <p>
        To bolster their claim that smallpox inoculations were safe and effective, vaccine proponents often resorted to medical ploys. Hospital records were consistently “doctored.” For example, smallpox victims who were previously vaccinated and required hospital services were frequently registered as unvaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Dr. Russell of the Glasgow Hospital, “Patients entered as unvaccinated showed excellent marks (vaccination scars) when detained for convalescence.” Vaccinated patients who died from either smallpox or the smallpox injection were often certified as unvaccinated as well, or had their death certificates falsified.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, according to Dr. Herbert Snow, senior staff surgeon of the London Cancer Hospital, “Of recent years, many men and women in prime of life have dropped dead suddenly. I am convinced that some 80% of these deaths are caused by the inoculations or vaccinations they have earlier undergone. The coroner always hushes it up as 'natural causes.' I have been trying to get these case referred to an independent commission of inquiry, but so far, in vain.” [McBean, E.

       was aware of the medical shenanigans used to hoodwink the public: “During the last epidemic at the turn of the century, I was a member of the Health Committee of London Borough Council. I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases as pustular eczema, varioloid or whatnot—except smallpox.” [Ibid., pg. 64]

       By around 1850, several countries had enacted compulsory vaccination laws, including Bavaria, Denmark and England.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prior to compulsory vaccine legislation, smallpox outbreaks were regional and self-limiting. The most severe epidemics occurred following mandatory shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        In England, from 1870 to 1872, after more than 15 years of forced immunizations—and a 98% vaccination rate—the largest epidemic of smallpox ever recorded maimed and killed thousands of people. Most of the population had been vaccinated and re-vaccinated. [Allen, H.

       vaccination was introduced. The mean annual mortality to 10,000 population from 1850 to 1869 was at the rate of 2.04, whereas in 1871 the death rate was 10.24 and in 1872 the death rate was 8.33, and this after the most laudable efforts to extend vaccination by legislative enactments.” [McBean, E., pg. 27]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Sir Thomas chambers, a London health official: “Of the 155 persons admitted to the Smallpox hospital in the Parish of St. James, Piccadilly, 145 had been vaccinated.” At Marylevore hospital, 92% of the smallpox cases had been vaccinated. In 1871, officials at Highgate Hospital admitted that 92% had been vaccinated as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Figures were similar in many other countries where compulsory laws were established. For example, in 1870 and 1871 more than one million Germans contracted smallpox after Germany enforced mandatory shots; thousands died. 96% of the victims were vaccinated. [Ibid., pg. 13]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The German Chancellor himself opined, “The hopes placed in the efficacy of the cowpox virus as a preventative of smallpox have proved entirely deceptive.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 1887 to 1889, countless Italian citizens contracted smallpox after Italy enforced mandatory shots; thousands died. According to Dr. Charles Dauta, Professor of Hygiene and Materia Medica at the University of Perugia, “Italy is one of the best vaccinated countries in the world....For 20 years before 1885, our nation was vaccinated in the proportion of 98.5%....The epidemics of smallpox that we have had [from 1887 to 1889] have been so frightful that nothing before the invention of vaccination could equal them.” [“Vaccination in Italy,”

       Over a twenty year period beginning in 1886, thousands of Japanese citizens died and hundreds of thousands were infected with smallpox after Japan enforced mandatory shots every five years. [Shelton, HM.
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/shelton3.html">
        <em>
         Vaccine and Serum Evils
        </em>

       (San Antonio Texas; Health research, 1966):20-21]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1918 and 1919, after the US took control of the Philippines, mandatory smallpox vaccination was enforced. Thousands died after the entire population was vaccinated. A 1920 Report of the Philippines Health Services declared, “The 1918 epidemic looks prima facie as a flagrant failure of the classic immunization.” [Ibid., pg. 22]
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the connection between mass vaccination and the increase in epidemic became more apparent, several countries rescinded the mandatory vaccination laws and even outlawed the practice completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Secretary of the Governing Board in Dublin, Ireland, declared, “Smallpox virus taken from the calf would communicate that disease to the human subject and be thereby a fertile source of propagating the disease, and would, moreover, render the operator liable to prosecution under the Act prohibiting inoculation with smallpox.” [White, W., pg. xxi.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia abolished compulsory vaccinations in the late 1800's, and proceeded to report only 3 cases of smallpox in 15 years. Statistics from England and Wales show an inverse correlation between the percentage of babies vaccinated and the number of smallpox deaths: the greater the number vaccinated, the greater the loss. Deaths from smallpox tumbled after people refused the vaccine. [Official statistics from England and Wales, as reported by Shelton, HM., pg. 22]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By the mid-1850's, a very large anti-vaccine movement had been established. After the 1870-1872 smallpox epidemic, thought to have been caused by mandatory shots, this movement gained credibility and became more organized in its efforts to resist compulsory laws and awaken others to the inherent dangers of smallpox vaccinations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1878, Mary Catherine Hume published
        <em>
         150 Reasons for Disobeying the Vaccination Law by Persons Prosecuted Under It.
        </em>
        Parents were being fined a jailed for refusing to submit their children to the shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the Exemption Act was passed in 1907, every year thousands of parents were prosecuted for resisting vaccination. Many had their homes and property confiscated. Hume's book advocated civil disobedience despite the punitive efforts of pro-vaccinators.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 1884, a massive collection of smallpox data was published by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination, containing “unbiased vaccine statistics, newspaper stories about people who were damaged by the shot, and legal briefs regarding compulsory laws.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite harsh laws, many people refused to be vaccinated and would not allow their children to receive the shots. According to Lord Bramwell, “It is a most mischievous thing that there should be a law in existence which good people are tempted to disobey. It is a bad example to set, and it tends to bring laws into contempt which are of real importance.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even Mahatma Gandhi, although by no means a scientist, would eventually weigh in on the vaccine debate: “I am and have been for years, a confirmed anti-vaccinationist...I have not the least doubt in my mind that vaccination is a filthy process that is harmful in the end.” [Gandhi, MK.

        According to the controversial researcher

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        RSV remains highly contagious and results in thousands of hospitalizations every year; many people die from it. Ironically, scientists are developing a vaccine to combat RSV—the infectious agent that very likely entered the human population by way of a vaccine.

       , a microbiologist named Dr. Howard B. Urnovitz revealed that as many as 26 monkey viruses may have been in the original Salk vaccines, including the simian equivalents of human echo virus, coxsackie, herpes (HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8), adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr, and cytomegalovirus.

       Part of this has been an experiment for me to see what would happen.

       In over seven years of being on reddit, I haven't even come

       It took an unreasonable amount of work to put this together, and I was hoping to see an enthusiastic enough response for me to eventually do part 2...I'm not sure anymore though.

       Peer review doesn't mean much. You can fake all your data and still pass peer review. In fact, what's worse, often peer review will outright reject new information simply because it may introduce a new paradigm, even when the data is solid.

       And Lo! We have a winner! The futility of it all - this battling.

       A younger me saw commenters as adversaries, and I would often argue with my ego back at the darkness... if they posted supporting materials - I didn't read them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one day i saw a flickering in the darkness.... as if someone was attempting to conceal a light. And I began to religiously read any comment written in opposition that had sources.  A large part in my large comment on this post - was obtained from reading sources that perceived adversaries posted claiming to bolster their position.

       My whole point was just that you said it's impossible to completely sterilize anything XD I don't dispute that the problem exists or all.
