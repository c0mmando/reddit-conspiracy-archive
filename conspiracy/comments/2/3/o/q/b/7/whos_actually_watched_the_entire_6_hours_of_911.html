       I'm through the first 2 parts and there's SO much information that i feel like i have to rewatch the whole thing again already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I knew a lot about that day but so far the biggest mind blowing thing is that video of the Pentagon being hit and how the closer camera appears to have been manipulated and the frames of the plane doesn't match up between the two cameras.  Can anyone explain this?  Or have more information about it?

       Regardless of what you do or don't believe about that day, it raises some good questions and doesn't come off as preachy. IMO.

       "and it prays" doesn't make sense. I understand confirmation bias, but if you assume (i) she's either in a plane actually being hijacked, or (ii) she's in some hangar someplace with no idea why she is being asked to lie to her husband, then list all of the phrases it sounds like she is saying, and cross-reference them to each of the the above two scenarios.

       I agree, all it simply does is it raises valid questions stemming from all the events before, during, and after that day. I also like how it examines common "debunker claims" and raises good counter questions from that. I found it easier to go through in one hour increments during a run on the treadmill haha

       I can't hear anything except another woman telling the caller "it's okay" once I actually thought about it. The first time I heard that it gave me chills though. I think we're hearing what we want to hear.

       And even if it wasn't, how could you explain the list of calls supposedly made well above the altitude calls could have been made?  And that's not even considering you'd be flying too fast to even switch between towers without the calls being dropped anyway

       Just to play devil's advocate: around that time, many aircraft were equipped with credit-card activated "airphones" in the back of the seats - the fumbling "hanging-up" sounds at the end could be because of this.

       I didn't say the calls are fake, they just couldn't have happened at 20,000+ feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have diverted them elsewhere and landed and allowed phone calls for some reason (amp up the storyline).  It explains the lack of any engine noises/screams.  Who knows, it's just one of 10000000 things that doesn't add up.

       It's not two conflicting things...it's two separate possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. She is on a plane where angry/yelling Arabic men have just stood up together, stormed the cockpit, killed the pilots with box cutters and hijacked the plane....OR
      </p>
      <p>
       B. She was removed from the plane by men (possibly wearing masks), escorted into some building (or the jet could have taxied into a hangar where she and the other passengers were removed), and taken to a room. If it was a planned government act, the people carrying this out would want to keep the panic to a minimum, as having uncontrollable, screaming people would create a situation that is less stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which one fits based on the call?

       a voice is heard, so the actual call is real enough, the question is, where did it come from? cos it did not come from the plane.

       But the McGurk effect has a visual component so it (or anything similar) isn't relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is relevant is a form of confirmation bias. As I wrote in this thread in another reply, she is either: (i) on a plane actually being hijacked, or (ii) in a hangar (or some unknown place) afraid and having no idea why she (or the woman speaking) is being asked to lie to her husband, or who the people are who are holding them captive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to conform what she could be saying to what makes sense in one the above two scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, listen carefully to the woman explaining to her husband about the hijacking and how she "really hopes" to talk him again. Listen to the whole message carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume she was aboard a plane where only moments ago, Arab men yelling orders in a foreign language (or English with middle eastern accent) had just stood up, violently killed the pilots with box cutters, and hijacked the plane. If her call was a secret attempt to call their loved ones, I'd think she would sound absolutely terrified or hysterical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, she says in a more unsure (but definitely worried) tone, "I really hope I will talk to you soon" (or something to that effect).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just try it as an exercise...using everything you can glean from her call...her words, her emotional state, and her tone of voice, which of the above two scenarios fits better?

       I agree that her manner is strange for the alleged situation. Another thing that always gives me pause about her call is when in the beginning she says, Babe, I need you to listen very carefully (etc) it's very measured and odd and emphasizing... I'm not sure what, but communicating something to  her husband. If I'm not mistaken, he was a police officer at the time and she had been until about 3 months prior when she became a flight attendant. Of course, her LEO experience would enable her to remain calm as well.. I'm curious what her husband thinks now that some years have passed especially, though I would never ask him of course, don't hit me reddit :)

       In once of the articles I posted today, there are credible theories that some, if not all of these callers, believed they were part of a training exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a transcript of another call from a passenger...he begins:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hello Mom? This is Mark Bingham..." as if he was told roughly what to convey to her (or a relative) and he was trying to get it right and was nervous
      </p>
      <p>
       ...because in any situation, I mean even one where there are terrorists aboard your plane, you don't call your mom and begin the conversation by telling her your full name. (??)

       After pondering these phone calls and the mystery as to where the callers were located (if not in the air), I remembered that people were talking in forums 4 or 5 years ago about fake passenger lists, flights that never boarded not took off, and the complete absence of any videos from the airports showing any passengers boarding the planes. I decided to see what I could find. There is a lot of info on this topic, but the ultimate disposition of it is debated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is no possible final and completely conclusive answer as to where the passengers went, there has been a lot of hard work, and deep digging by people and pilots, and subsequent partial conclusions. One solid one pertains to a Delta Flight having all of the passengers from the two flights that actually were recorded as taking off being quarantined at the Cleveland Airport. This much is been concluded with diligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       From here, we don't know what happened.... whether some were killed, or some were made up, or if some were offered new lives and compensation....it's hard to imagine. But it doesn't sound as grisly as we have been suggesting here in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with this article (below), then search for "9/11 Passengers" and read the first forum post that comes up at "letsrollforums.com"...keep going if you care to after that and post if you want to share...This whole passenger issue is a really interesting area.

       That's a great video...had not seen that before. The sad thing is, it doesn't stand well on its own to the dumbest of sheeple because in my experience, you have to explain to them why Building 7 matters; how its controlled demolition destroys the whole official narrative of the Twin Towers destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I like it because it is more
       <strong>
        conclusive
       </strong>
       (not circumstantial) then the other 4 minute classic from 5 years ago by Michael Corbett called
       <em>
        9/11, A Conspiracy Theory
       </em>
       which is still great, if only for it's sarcastic and scathing presentation. Plus, it was really the first of its kind (despite the date of upload, I remember seeing it in early 2009). EDIT: maybe not...because it has info about the SEAL raid of Osama...And that was 2011 I think.
      </p>

       So true.  I didn't see it until a few years ago, and that happened for a reason.  Same reason they waited until after 5pm to bring it down, so it could be buried.  Luckily, someone was still paying attention.

       I get the whole "empire gonna do what an empire gonna do" thing, but it seems exceptionally unlikely that this absurd bullshit is gonna stand the test of time. History will not be kind to us. They're going to study our idiocy for 1000 years.

       Making it only the 3rd steel framed tower to be brought down by fire in the history of the world, WTC 1 &amp; 2 were the first two.  Oh, and the fire that NIST said brought down WTC7 went out an hour before it collapsed.  So much bullshit.

       No, jet fuel would be the only other thing in there aside from paper/office furniture/drywall.  Out of those, kerosene burns the hottest and still isn't hot enough to weaken steal beams.  On top of that, they estimate at the most an inch of kerosene on the floor.

       It's a shame that has turned into a battle cry for debunkers because of some of the conclusions they jumped to.  In this doc they basically just present a shit load of information and then at the end of the segment ask the viewer "so what do you think?" and then your left laying in bed that night thinking about the ramifications.

       Don't think of the ramifications (if you are trying to decide who's right, the debunkers or the "truthers"). That's bringing in emotion where it isn't needed. Just use logic.

       I am not trying to be rude....I only say this because this is precisely why people don't believe the "conspiracy theories"... they become too freaked out about the possibility that it's true, and that their government was behind it, and they therefore subconsciously stick to the official narrative because it is so much more comforting.

       I'm not sure ramification was the right word...just the fact that there's a part of our government that will do whatever it takes to achieve their goals.  What's next?  The economy is based on nothing but lies and bullshit and historically economic collapses are followed by world wars.  That's why every morning I wake up and assume that russia or iran has "attacked" us and WW3 is imminent.

       I have several times. I was particularly blown away initially at the international global spin/debunking industry that came forth during to it (I was aware of the Popular Mechanics stuff - but the other non-English presentations were insane to me). Why go through all that effort if it was as it was reported? Shouldn't the facts stand up to international journalistic inquiries? That alone is puzzling.

       It is extremely well done, if not too well done. It's tough to integrate in to my conversations with friends and family to get them to start questioning the event.

       That debunking thing surprised me too...reminded me of the kind of people we see here, parroting the same stuff over and over on various topics.

       The red pill is a motherfucker. Once it really sinks in, you can't help but wonder "what won't they fucking do?"

       Fear is a logical and valid response once that realization sets in at which point overcoming said fear becomes paramount.

       Rumsfeld and Bush were both out of the loop during the attacks while they should've been making decisions on whether to shoot down flights 77 and 93. Even if you buy the official narrative how can you not be furious at these clowns? Why was Bush allowed by secret service to sit in the school? He knew America was under attack before going into the classroom. Letting Bush read about goats put himself and the whole school in danger. While the FAA is freaking out about several possible hijackings (thanks a lot war games/radar blips) our commander in chief is reading to children where itwas known he would be for days in advance.

       I have, and I would watch it all the way through again if it were twice as long. It raises a lot of questions and if you have any interest at all in 9/11 it should be watched.

       what the hell - so weird...I just (as of yesterday) watched about 5 hours of the video in one sitting. I thought I was the only one who still hadn't seen it.

      <p>
       anyhow, this video is AMAZING. Very well produced, tons of research went into it, and the "debunkers" are debunked on a point for point basis, using their own words.

       Just gonna continue the respect &amp; interest in this certain doc, also watched it in one sitting, couldn't stop.

       The planes get me man, just crazy. The VMO exceeding speeds, flight 93 that 'buried itself into the ground' (WTF?), only four fighter jets in the air defense of one of the most protected air space in the world.

       The problem for me is there's SO many discrepancies all over the board i can't even focus on just one.  And yeah, FOUR fighters in the whole northeast?  I live in the middle of nowhere WA state and we have nonstop fucking jet training overhead, and you're telling me only 4 jets were available in that whole quadrant?  PLEASE.  Oh and then there just happened to be a war game that day, further confusing people.

       The response of the ATC was very telling "Is this real world or exercise?" And the guy yelling to shut off the damn sims on the radar. Its remarkable more people don't care about the war games - they perfectly hindered any chance at shooting down the planes. What are the odds on 9/11 that most of our air defense are away from the northeast, some are participating in hijacked airplane drills, and radar screens are filled with fake hijacks that screwed up the response time of the only fighters we did have?

       Funny how often these real life things happen during drills.   Didn't the London subway bombings happen during a "drill" also?  Confused people make it easier to get away with.

       I'm pretty sure it just came out a few months ago.  I've seen probably 99% of the docs about 9/11 too, but this provided a lot of new info even to me.  Plus being so long it gives the time to go indepth into a bunch of topics not normally covered.

        And of course, it lacks that oh-so-elusive pot of gold that truthers have been searching for: evidence

      <p>
       Not really.

      <p>
       <em>
        The New Pearl Harbor
       </em>
       is essentially 6 hours of
       <em>
        circumstantial
       </em>
       evidence.  You've never heard that word, obviously, so I highly recommend you look it up and read about it.  You'll find that - surprise! - there is more than one category of "evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       No "truther" that I've ever met expects to find a handwritten letter, in blood, from Dick Cheney himself, outlining all involvement in 9/11 by the U.S. government.  "Truthers" are well aware that the
       <em>
        direct
       </em>
       evidence is long gone.  They are also well aware of the fact that
       <em>
        destroying evidence/tampering with evidence is fundamental to a successful cover-up
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiratards like to pretend that there is a "lack of evidence" to support the claims of "truthers", when that couldn't be any further from the truth.  There are
       <em>
        mountains of circumstantial evidence
       </em>
       that plainly suggest there is much more to the story than the official version of events; mountains of reasons why the official story does not make logical sense and should be rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anyone attempts to discount circumstantial evidence or suggest that it is neither acceptable nor admissible in a court of law, keep in mind that Timothy McVeigh was convicted of a terrorist act primarily on
       <em>
        circumstantial evidence
       </em>
       .  Truthers may not have
       <em>
        direct evidence
       </em>
       at their disposal, but that only matters to anti-truth conspiratards who simply don't understand "evidence".
      </p>

         Validity of circumstantial evidence
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence.[2][citation needed] This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly, but mistakenly, considered more powerful. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh's trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, "Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence." [3] The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.

       So, where's the evidence you ask?  Well, here's 6 fucking hours of it, in a well-organized documentary, complete with sources from both mainstream news and non-mainstream news, and everything in between.

       Exactly... here is more simple analogy. I have a pair of dice and tell you they are normal, and not weighted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I roll a 7 once, it means nothing as rolling a 7 has a probability of 1/6. You would believe that they are normal dice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if I roll a 7 ten times in a row (the probability of which is &gt;1/60,000,000), how sure would you be that my dice are weighted? Given the odds, would you honestly have any doubt that I was lying? No. But your evidence that they are weighted is entirely circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at each of the irregular/unusual events which happened on 9/11 as getting a 7 from a roll of dice. Now think of the probabilities of all those irregular/unusual events happening at the same time.

       You can't use probability post-hoc like that to debunk a narrative. For example, the probability that I typed these exact characters in the exact instant of time that I typed them, with the exact number of microseconds between characters, is infinitesimal, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

       I'd say certain things like the manipulation of the pentagon video footage (and never releasing anything else), the measurements of the pentagon damage, the person on the plane that whispers something about it being a fix etc are all pretty substantial.  it's hard to have evidence when the gov't locked down everything related to that day

It could be the receiver brushing against her shirt and making a sound that resembles whispering.

       I'm 38 and i've heard it before, but i grew up in philly.  I definitely could have misinterpreted it, but in the framework of what was happening at the time (and how the phone calls were all found to be questionable based on no cell service/satellite phone debates) who knows.  Also aside from the whisper she spoke clearly and not very emotionally the entire time..with no background noise...not something i'd expect on a hijacked plane.

       The whispered voice example is my favorite example of confirmation bias at work. When you know what to listen for, you hear what you're expecting. "It's a frame" only sort of makes sense when you are trying to cram evidence into a conspiracy theory, but it's not really a phrase that is likely to be naturally uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but it's a ridiculous naked example of confirmation bias and psychological error.
