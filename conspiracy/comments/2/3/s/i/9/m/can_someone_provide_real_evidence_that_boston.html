<p>&quot;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they expected some kind of resistance, but not the kind that actually affects them like stopping agression against Syria. I&#39;m sure that made them furious. The human variable is always going to be unpredictable. The best way to counter this is through disinformation, repeating the same lies over and over and over until people say &quot;FINE! Just shut the fuck up.&quot; </p>

<p>But people are not doing that. They are saying &quot;What the fuck? Explain this!&quot;</p>

<p>So they ramp up the same tactics, power in numbers and whatnot. Fake profiles, puppet accounts, all to create a false consensus to convince the &quot;awakened&quot; that maybe, just <em>maybe</em> they are wrong. They&#39;re still failing at that but it works in <a href="/r/conspiratard">some level.</a></p>

<p>They can&#39;t. It just not possible. If enough people resist they&#39;ll just shut the whole thing down. Just help out locally. Don&#39;t bother using the web for that. It&#39;s all compromised and monitored and just paints a bullseye on your face.</p>

Tens and possibly hundreds of hours of video footage is redacted including footage taken from police cruisers just sitting in the parking lot all day. Why would that be redacted? Almost every picture is redacted too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read <em>a</em> police report, where it described a number of children&#39;s bodies being all crammed into a small room where they&#39;d tried to hide, but been found and sprayed with gun fire, ensuring that survivability was virtually impossible. Grim stuff.</p>

<ol>
<li>President Lyndon B. Johnson lying about Gulf of Tonkin. </li>
<li>President Richard Nixon lies about the Watergate scandal. </li>
<li>President Ronald Reagan lies about the Iran-contra affair. </li>
<li>President Bill Clinton lying about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. </li>
<li>President George W. Bush lying about WMD in Iraq. </li>
<li>President Barack Obama lying about how he will close Guantanamo, and make sure no-one is tortured. </li>
<li>George Tenet lying before the 9/11 commission. </li>
<li>Condoleezza Rice lies about envisioning hijacked airplanes used to stage terrorist attacks. </li>
<li>President George W. Bush lies about seeing the first airplane strike on 9/11. </li>
<li>Colin Powell lying about Iraqi mobile anthrax/WMD production capabilities. </li>
<li>Vice President Dick Cheney, lying about Iraq Al-Qaeda ties. </li>
<li>Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Indisputably Lied to Congress About NSA Surveillance. </li>
<li>President Barack Obama lies about domestic spying program. </li>
<li>Director of the National Security Agency, Keith B. Alexander, lying about NSA surveillance. </li>
</ol>

<p>This was passed off as truth, and then it was proved to be lies. Pretty much every major event the government has told a lie to further its agenda. There&#39;s no reason to believe this behavior has stopped.</p>

<p>Ham lost the debate in that moment, because he&#39;s not actually open to being convinced of, well, anything, really. So there&#39;s no point trying to get him to understand evolution or the big bang or even gravity. He never will, by his own choice.</p>

<p>I remember driving to work as it was just being reported. First , it was just reports of shots fired, then the real story started to unfold. A parent from sandy hook called in to work saying they wouldn&#39;t be in.

<p>For now, everyone who died is supposedly fictitious. But not one of the emergency personnel in attendance has mentioned attending to non-existent corpses.

<p>Of course, there&#39;s always the simple and plausible alternative, supported by mountains of data and thousands of pages of documentation - and which we&#39;ve seen acted out, sadly, far too often - of this just being the nexus of mental illness and easy access to firearms. </p>

<p>And there is your problem, in a nutshell. </p>

<p>I can provide any number of links to interviews with those affected by the tragedy, reports of funerals, or even the thousands of pages in the official report. But you&#39;ll just handwave them away as &quot;MSM&quot; - even as its <strong>exactly</strong> the same mainstream media from which all your information on the tragedy originally comes. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, your &quot;false flag&quot; hypothesis require a implausibly complex plan, coordinated across dozens of agencies, federal and private, then executed with impeccable (and most ungovernmental) precision. And not just once, but according to you on multiple occasions. </p>

<p>Yet there&#39;s not one shred of evidence <strong>for</strong> this. Not one person has said they were part of it (and gag orders never stopped any other whistleblower, involved in far less outrageous events). None of the copious documentation certainly required to organize these events has ever appeared. </p>

<p>You might as well claim &quot;the moon is made of green cheese,&quot; then demand proof otherwise - forbidding opponents from offering up science. </p>
