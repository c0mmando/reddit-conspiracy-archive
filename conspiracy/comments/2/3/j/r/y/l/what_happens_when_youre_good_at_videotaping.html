    <div class="md"><p>You just cannot blame the consumer for terrible business practices. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like blaming you for ordering Comcast internet regardless of the crappy DSL you <em>could</em> have taken instead. </p>

<p>The government is charged with one thing above all else: to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Unfortunately, they&#39;ve become their own enemy. We the People are the catalyst to change that - we can seriously and legitimately (legally) dissolve the current government and institute a new one. Our fearless leaders in certain positions have even hinted that this may be what needs to happen (a revolt or revolution).</p>

<p>Right now though, the majority of people are easily swayed to believe that the state has our best interests in mind. Taxing the sun?! Taxing people who go off the grid?! Selling out to the highest bidder, but making products based of the lowest bidder?! </p>

<p>Madness. They&#39;re all insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re not insane, that&#39;s sanity, that&#39;s what is normal. Human beings want comfort and whomever provides it to them they&#39;ll naturally follow.</p>

<p>What remains unnatural is how and this is just my observation on the matter so take this part for what it&#39;s worth, that the oligarchs prevent people like Kennedy and Hilter from coming to power and keep their own &quot;kind in power&quot;.</p>

<p>So really the masses are in their own right entirely sane. Yet they are all culpable. It&#39;s not like a consumer choice, but let&#39;s use that. People don&#39;t demand the government mandate upgrading infrastructure, let these companies get away with ripping people off, and yada yada. Individual there isn&#39;t much blame to assign, but there is blame. As a collective whole on the other hand it is entirely our fault. It&#39;s our world, we live in it, and we sit back and let this stuff happen because we ether lack the power to change it or refuse for whatever reason to do so.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s actually use some real examples. You can&#39;t tell me that we couldn&#39;t resolve the issue with Ghettos, big pharma, big agra, or big prison. You can&#39;t tell me that it&#39;s not the masses fault for continuing the two party system, for not even carrying that the vote is rigged and the candidates are preselected.</p>

<p>It is their fault. Sure the elite have money, position, influence, but we have a collective power they fear. They know we have this power and they try to strip us of as much of our capacity to use our power as possible.</p>

<p>Yet in the end it is societies fault what it permits to happen. It is soceties fault that it chooses to remain willfully ignorant of the happenings around it. The other day I was talking to someone who didn&#39;t even know that Drones were easily hack able and yet had political opinions around the subject, believing these drones were superior. That&#39;s not healthy, yet that&#39;s what is accepted and celebrated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to attempt to dismiss them as insane, but frankly they&#39;re not. They&#39;re just as they are, as they choose to be.</p>

<p>To correct you on a few points, the government doesn&#39;t exist to protect the constitution. On the face value that let&#39;s assume is true, it stopped being true when Abraham Lincoln bypassed congress and declared martial law. In 1913 that martial law when bankrupt and you became collateral for the second. Hence why your name is always capitalized on your social security card. It&#39;s a legal term called: Capitis Diminutio and it represents one who has no rights.</p>

<p>Technically they get you to agree to this, so they&#39;ve legally got you to agree to wave your rights under the constitution and magna carta. So even if both still applied, it wouldn&#39;t matter much.</p>

<p>Though if you look back at the founding of the nation, back before the Federal Government was forced upon the citizens and their righst inherently stripped, the original constitution didn&#39;t even include a bill of rights. Why? Because several of the Founding Fathers were Tyrants.</p>

<p>It was the work of George Mason who with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison (not sure on that name), who got the Bill of Rights implemented to restrain the new tyrannical government. Without these people there would be no Bill of Rights because as the Federalists put it, it wasn&#39;t necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so simple. It&#39;s too easy to selectively film an encounter and edit to make the cop look bad. Being on a list does nothing to prevent the exercise of your rights at all - it does give the cops some indication that you might be there, like a reporter with credentials. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree. You can&#39;t selectively film one bad cop, because even one is too many. However being on a list can have serious consequences if you want to find a job or are checked when working with children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not suggesting that one bad cop is too many, but the reason cops don&#39;t like to be filmed, and will take steps to insure they know who&#39;s doing the filming (like accredited news reporters/photographers) is to keep it fair. Also, amateur &#39;reporters&#39; can and do get in the way, putting themselves and others at risk.</p>

<p>Certainly, being on a watch list can have negative consequences on your job. Perhaps this person, Jeff Gray, is doing more than just exercising his 1st amendment rights.</p>

<p>Nearby, in Keene, some of the activists are being a little disruptive in pursuit of the bad cop. They&#39;re causing more problems than they are solving.</p>

<p>Just &#39;cause they&#39;re cops doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re doing a bad job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re heading the same way.. slowly.. but surely.. </p>

<p>Our government just last year pushed through a spy bill which citizens protested and which we had a referendum in which the population voted against it, which our Prime Minister choose to ignore and pushed the bill through anyway.. called the GCSB spy bill which makes it legal for the government to collect our meta data and online transmissions the same as the USA&#39;s NSA.</p>

<p>There were protests against the bill going through which the government had police photographers there taking photographs of the people protesting.. my guess for the same reasons as this thread states... realistically.. I expect to already be on one of their lists because of comments I&#39;ve made here/other places online and because of 6 degrees of separation from some people on my Facebook friends list being activists..</p>

<p>NZ&#39;s still a lot.. &quot;free&#39;er&quot; than the United States.. I&#39;ve lived in both countries.. but we&#39;re definately moving in the same direction as the US.
Australia and Briton governments are arresting people for the comments that they&#39;ve tweeted etc which hasn&#39;t happened here yet..</p>

<p>oh, and the guy locked up for porn. Was a sex offender who&#39;d offended against a child looking up loli porn, it was a violation of his parole.. so.. of course he was locked up.</p>

<p>The six pointed star of David represents the much more docile easy to guide &amp; handle lambs/sheep.</p>

<p>(6 pointed) Wolves came to the cave for meat scraps &amp; evolved into obedient dogs. (5 pointed) Cats came to the farmers fields to eat &amp; do not easily follow orders.</p>

<p>Predatory wolves acting as shepherds are the <strong>center</strong> of most all con<strong>fusion</strong> leading to unnatural suffering forced upon all DNA replicants on this sun stone.</p>
