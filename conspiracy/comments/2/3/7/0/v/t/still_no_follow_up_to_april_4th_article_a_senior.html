       Very suspicious timing for release of this info as well--article was published at 11:46 on a Friday evening...All follow-up articles were derived from this original Washington Free Beacon article and no other info has been published--
       <strong>
        no name/age/sex of victim, no date or time of death, no location of incident, no official cause of death
       </strong>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.
       </p>
       <p>
        CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.
       </p>
       <p>
        “We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done,” White told the Washington Free Beacon. “He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.”
       </p>
       <p>
        A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agency’s elite spying branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.
       </p>
       <p>
        No other details of the death could be learned.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agency’s computers that were being used in the investigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agency’s role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Morrell testified that “subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agency’s role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

       April 4 was also the date Seymour Hersh published “The Red Line and the Rat Line” in the London Review of Books (which has been thoroughly whitewashed in the complicit U.S. media)...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2011 Barack Obama led an allied military intervention in Libya without consulting the US Congress. Last August, after the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, he was ready to launch an allied air strike, this time to punish the Syrian government for allegedly crossing the ‘
        <strong>
         red line
        </strong>
        ’ he had set in 2012 on the use of chemical weapons.​
       </p>
       <p>
        ... The
        <strong>
         rat line
        </strong>
        , authorised in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.

       I doubt we get any other information about it. There isn't a need for his name to be released at this time. Suicide is a private matter and he didn't commit or attempt murder-suicide. Nor did he commit a crime that lead to a standoff resulting in his suicide. Those are the kind of scenarios where the person would be identified to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       If his family, friends or co-workers thought it was foul play then we would have heard about it by now. The only way I can see his name being released is if his name pops up in an investigation, the governing body wants to interview him and the CIA replies "Well, he killed himself."

       CIA agents/employees are people too. They experience stress, depression and hard times just like the rest of us. Becoming a member of the CIA doesn't magically make one immune to mental illness, terminal diagnosis, or any of the other many reasons that people commit suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there is evidence to the contrary, I have no reason to believe that there was foul play. Sometimes people commit suicide. It sucks. It's reality.
