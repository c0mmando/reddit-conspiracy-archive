       i have no theory. you are theorizing that i have one. I am simply pointing out the nature of website ownership and access to source code. the potential of using ownership and access to source code for purposes that are inconsistant with the wants of the website's users exists, regardless if it has happened in the past. It is not a theory that there are subreddits that have been banned.

       It is simple it works like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Make it against the rules to post user-written text on any of the major subreddits.  This way you can't have users communicating directly about political issues.  All communication must happen via discussion of "approved" mainstream media sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Make it against the rules to post any political videos.  All political or police brutality videos now relegated to ghettos with low traffic.  These are ineffectual for actual communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Allow moderators on other subs to censor based on political affiliation or simple bias.  This notably covers bestof which previously was one avenue to get good text to a wider audience but is now worse than useless as the moderators censor content that is against their politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't as if there's a secret room with a big red censorship button.  It's been done little by little, and by writing the rules to make reddit content mimic mainstream media content.  When I started on reddit (5 years ago or so), it was full of "alternative" news, conspiracies, etc.  There were plenty of places to post text, hell even
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now reddit is basically CNN.  Anyone who disagrees either leaves or ends up in one of the ghettos, like this one.  These ghettos are now walled off, so even great content can't be posted to bestof, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with mods is that they are generally people with time on their hands, who are honored by the position and, in order to maintain the position, moderate to keep things mainstream.  They are not courageous or principled people in all but a few cases.  This is death by a thousand cuts, and the content has suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is wholly unacceptable to remove reddit.com as a default, but add advice animals.  It makes as much sense as CNN getting news form twitter.  It's a purposeful degradation of content quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       As usual it's not "secret group of evil people manipulating things" its "profit motive + human nature = shit."  That's always what happens, but free communication is too crucial to just throw our hands up and say "that's life."  It requires a solution.

       Reddit will implode? Pffft.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell the demographics for most redditors is very very young. 25 and under.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate my point I offer this recent survey from an obscure sub:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/235t42/results_of_the_great_infp_survey/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/235t42/results_of_the_great_infp_survey/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       508 respondents to the survey and only 65 of them were more than 25 years old. Of that,
       <em>
        only 12 of the 508 were older than 40.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Redditors are very young and without a history or experience. Like a school of fish they are a swimming mass that might flit from here to there, their lives seem to be dictated by their tech connection devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as Reddit remains a feeding ground they will stay. When some other tech/social media beckons they will leave. Doesn't really matter though where they gather, as it seems to me their derivative thinking skills are undeveloped, and their sense of continuity and the wholeness of history are nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only the Here and Now and no sense of how the puzzle of civilization and human relationships and government and ethics and economics and family and morality all fit together to create a whole - that takes life experience - which is Reddit's biggest chasm.

       This is massively unfair. I'm 24, I'm educated and I post here all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Like a school of fish they are a swimming mass that might flit from here to there, their lives seem to be dictated by their tech connection devices."
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you talking about? We're all using tech devices right now to use Reddit, regardless of age. Technology is not only for the young any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't appreciate your prejudice in this post and would ask you to consider the young people of Turkey, Syria and Egypt who made use of technology to send a political message and expose corruption in order to overthrow corrupt governments. These people's lives were not "dictated by their tech connection devices" but rather actual dictators and they deserve respect. It's odd that you feel young people don't have a sense of history yet you have forgotten this already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also disagree with your notion that "their derivative thinking skills are undeveloped." Young people are more likely to be in education than people who are say, middle aged. They practice derivative thinking every day, rather than someone who has been out of education for years and is no longer in the habit of thinking in such a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young people are also capable of caring for others and even if a particular topic doesn't concern them directly it doesn't mean that they don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attitude towards young people in this post is very disappointing and is just as offensive as if you had made a post about all people of a particular race or gender. "A recent survey from an obscure sub" that shows young users were a majority does not support your insulting claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's disheartening to see that you have received 10 points for that post too. I didn't realise I was viewed with such disdain here because of my age.

       Dude anyone can misread or badly interpret statistics.
       <strong>
        That was specifically for people who fit the "INFP" personality for myersbriggs personality test, not all of reddit.

       good try though.. how old are you? hungryuu for upvotes little fishy fishy?

       Fuck your statement and everything about it's rhetorical bullshit. It's pure rhetoric that's blatantly false.

       Technically speaking, all peoples lives throughout all history of time have been dictated by their "tech" connection devices, like back in the day when your "tech connection device" was a dove with a little parchment attached to it.
