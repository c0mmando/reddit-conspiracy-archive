       I shared it on FB like many others, and it looked like it was getting some traction. Then commenters started saying it was taken down. Sure enough, it says it was taken down by the user. Does anyone know where another link exists, or the name of the user of the YouTube channel? He had a bunch of other videos up but I did not subscribe so now I can't follow up.

       The Young Turks do a pretty good job with this one. Some of the facts may have been misrepresented by accident. StormCloudsGathering is a stand-up guy and didn't want false information on his channel so he took it down.

       Yeah he posted that he was going to update the video after the one they are working on now. The videos might have crazy fire stuff in the background but his explanations of things and connections he finds are incredible and open the lid even more.

       Since no one has posted it, it is because of factual errors. The ENN land deal was shelved in 2013, and was not for the land directly around his ranch. This guy decided that he wasn't going to pay grazing fees for 20 years, and the BLM decided to collect. I have seen no credible evidence to the contrary. I have seen plenty ideas that make sense, but that has more to do with my mistrust of the gov, than having any evidentiary value.

       This whole thing stinks of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've watched on the TV news, it seems like they're trying to misdirect people's mistrust and contempt towards the government in a way that benefits their agenda or is more acceptable. Many people are starting to realize that loss of civil liberties is really starting to matter, the government is doing more and more to limit autonomy, and individual rights are disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This topic is becoming more and more prevalent in the thoughts and discussions of many people, and that topic can be exploited by the media in a number of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So they put this "good old fashioned cowboy" on TV and play him up like a hero, while the "evil over-reaching gub'munt" tries to take away his land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh I don't doubt that this is really happening - I don't correctly know the facts because the media isn't correctly reporting them - but I'm sure that it's all real. It's just the way the news media is re-telling the story that makes it propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       And aside from that, why is this national news anyway? Stuff like this happens all the time and it's not really a big deal. They cover this event because it makes for good television and good propaganda.
