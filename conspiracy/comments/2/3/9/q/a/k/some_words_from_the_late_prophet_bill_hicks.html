       "The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we … kill those people. "Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace."

       Brilliant comedian, way ahead of his time.  Up there with Carlin in my opinion.

       Carlin is one of my favourites too, but some of his stuff is waaay dark, like, dark for the sake of being dark. I suppose Hicks had those moments too, with the whole Goat Boy bit. Some of it was about selling tickets, after all. But just like Carlin, Hicks let a lot more of himself out than most comedians ever do.

       I think it's a relentless form of personal honesty, and linking that in with the broader cultural narratives, that defines a great comedian.  I really enjoy stand-up as an artform and these guys are two of my favorites!

       You people need to stop idolizing this guy.  His handler was a former Nixon administration guy.  Look it up.  He IS Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, he said some cool stuff and his act was pretty funny the first time you heard it (not years later when he is still doing the same material), but he is not the "prophet" all of you think he is.

       I don't "idolize" anyone, everyone has an asshole side as far as I'm concerned. But his words, they are timeless. Not all of them, of course. But this particular quote, it carries weight and has done so for over 20 years.

       Obviously it does Ambiguously, as does a lot of what Jones says.  It's the stuff they don't say that matters.
