<p>Well... when are we going to get our democracy back people? I&#39;m sick and tired of waiting for a leader to take charge. When will we take charge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When will we take charge?</p>

<p>This very question begs of one&#39;s self to lead by action.</p>

<p>Please try to do it in a non-violent fashion, as the pen is mighter than the sword.</p>

<p>Sick of waiting for a leader, then be that leader.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the beauty of the american system.</p>

<p>I know, right now she&#39;s pretty much a whore, but in conception, she was beautiful in that anyone with the right amount of gumption can make a positive difference. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still that way (dangerous, but still..), the question is are your beliefs worth staring down the beast for. And if so, instead of asking someone else to stand up and fix it, stand up, and fix it.</p>

<p>As for what it will take? It takes someone with the courage to act, elsewise camps are made, and ppl are cooked in the name of &quot;purity&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the neocons and their loyalty to Israel, has by far done more damage to the well being of America than anything I can think of. </p>

<p>Talk about a domestic enemy, here we have an extremely aggressive form of political party that is backed up by AIPAC(American Israel Public Affairs Committee). If you know anything about AIPAC, you know they are richest most powerful lobby in Washington DC. Powerful in the way they can create or destroy the career of most politicians in DC. To go against them means a campaign of slander and smear usually with liberal amounts of the word &quot;anti-semite&quot; thrown in. </p>

<p>The wars for Israel has cost America Trillion$ of dollars. Had America not gotten caught up in the shit hole of the Middle East, the US economy would stronger instead of forced sequestration. Still, AIPAC manages to divert hundreds of millions of US taxpayers money to Israel for &quot;aid&quot;.  The US is being completely drained financially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the quote is, &quot;a republic, if you can keep it.&quot;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need a leader. We need a movement. The internet is still relatively free and we still have our voices. We need to speak up, online and off.</p>

<p>Exploring these subjects made me an anarchist. I&#39;m convinced of it. Governance should be localized, to fit more with the biology, geology, demographics, climate, etc. You can&#39;t have this massive central authority dictating how people all over the country and the world do things. It&#39;s impractical and kinda stupid.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s where we are, and we have people like Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski to thank for it.</p>

<p>Earth should be a playground for human potential, not a subject to be dominated, but that&#39;s how these assholes see it. They won&#39;t stop and they have the guns.</p>

<p>All we can do is stop consenting. I signed no social contract and 90% of our federal tax dollars go to killing machines, not welfare, not social security, not space exploration, not anything positive.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an idea out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNg_rgbIQZs&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UUwziJkP7NJzkaJs2bHmyKVw&amp;amp;index=3">I think could work.</a> It just requires a critical mass of people.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think it&#39;s a movement and I know <a href="http://youtu.be/4-C8FZcnkko">Hedges has said as much.</a></p>

<p>Although I think he&#39;d prefer some socialist thing... I agree though. When the masses are clearly over it, the state will have no choice but to <em>go away.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can find that started much sooner then now, we just seem to be much better at spotting it. Look at FDR during the depression era, constantly undermining the peace in Europe. We have been trying to become the worlds bullies for awhile and after ww2, our warmongering became more easily justified. This country is filled with corrupt politicians and we are allowing the banking elite control our wars. We died as a nation in 1913, it won&#39;t change without an uprising like the socialist Germans led by hitler. Even if we stopped going to war with other countries, we would need to spend that money on a war with its own citizens, 25% of the dollar goes to support the defense spending. </p>

<p>It is sad to see what a great country this should be. These politicians have let our country be eroded from the inside by letting our agriculture slip, manufacturing jobs leave the country, and made finance type jobs a valuable job. Our top paying jobs don&#39;t actually provide a service for anyone, they just find ways to &quot;invest&quot; your money.</p>

<p>Hopefully enough people start to make a plan for change. It probably won&#39;t happen until the next world war happens.</p>
