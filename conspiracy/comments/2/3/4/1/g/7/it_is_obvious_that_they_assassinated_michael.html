<p>Are you basing that on the one sentence he said in part one of the VICE documentary?  An idea he never returned to for the remainder of the documentary or anytime since?</p>

just a few minutes in. and you can hear him say it in his own words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His implication is that he was in a bad place mentally and so left everything behind to &quot;die or commit suicide&quot;, not realizing that he would find so much peace and happiness living with nature (which is the main point of the entire rest of the documentary).</p>

<p>I did not get the impression that he remained suicidal once leaving his life behind - in fact quite the opposite.  He seemed at peace and never happier throughout the remainder of the documentary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to the podcast and both versions are right. He did say &quot;see you next week&quot; but he also seemed very low, anxious and depressed. Nothing I&#39;ve  seen rules in suicide or rules out murder. Just not enough to go on yet, but the probability of suicide seems slightly higher, given his mood on the podcast- which preceded his death by just a few hours.  We mustn&#39;t forget his books were good and  made him some powerful enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think he sounded depressed, but if the majority do think that, then so be it. </p>

<p>The reason I find this irritating is that people seem happy to bandy the term &quot;suicide&quot; about without any evidence. The victim can&#39;t deny it, the police can close the case, the public goes to sleep. </p>

<p>The wet work professionals who &quot;suicide&quot; people for a living don&#39;t leave evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit I made this comment with about 5 minutes remaining in the podcast. But, you dont have to get all bold text about it. You have to admit the subject matter through the whole show was how they deal with the &quot;darkness&quot; in the world. It just sounded like this guy was down in the dumps and very depressed. So when I consider that with the suicide, it would make sense to me. If you dont agree that&#39;s fine, it makes no difference to me.</p>

<p>Actually I don&#39;t agree. He sounded fine.  He would have been acutely aware of the public reaction to him being found without leaving a note, so I find that strange.</p>

<p>Finally, how many people would kill themselves without making some provision for their beloved, ailing pet dog? I&#39;m serious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is this. He shot himself. He was clearly disturbed. His life had become a bit of a train wreck towards the end. He was given the opportunity and platform to spell out his view of the world via the recent Vice documentary and decided to take his own life feeling that he had nothing more to add in this lifetime and knowing his suicide would draw international attention to his views and history. The end. </p>

<p>Very sad. May he rest in peace.</p>
