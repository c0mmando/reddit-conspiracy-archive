       Are you basing that on the one sentence he said in part one of the VICE documentary?  An idea he never returned to for the remainder of the documentary or anytime since?

5 mins...  but about 4:30 is the start.. giving away all possesions paying off all he could.. tieing up loose ends so to speak..

       His implication is that he was in a bad place mentally and so left everything behind to "die or commit suicide", not realizing that he would find so much peace and happiness living with nature (which is the main point of the entire rest of the documentary).
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not get the impression that he remained suicidal once leaving his life behind - in fact quite the opposite.  He seemed at peace and never happier throughout the remainder of the documentary.

       Actually, perhaps you should listen to it, and then report back to explain which part of his closing statement
       <strong>
        "We'll be here next week"
       </strong>
       made you think he was about to commit suicide. I'm genuinely interested.

       I listened to the podcast and both versions are right. He did say "see you next week" but he also seemed very low, anxious and depressed. Nothing I've  seen rules in suicide or rules out murder. Just not enough to go on yet, but the probability of suicide seems slightly higher, given his mood on the podcast- which preceded his death by just a few hours.  We mustn't forget his books were good and  made him some powerful enemies.

       I didn't think he sounded depressed, but if the majority do think that, then so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I find this irritating is that people seem happy to bandy the term "suicide" about without any evidence. The victim can't deny it, the police can close the case, the public goes to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wet work professionals who "suicide" people for a living don't leave evidence.

       I will admit I made this comment with about 5 minutes remaining in the podcast. But, you dont have to get all bold text about it. You have to admit the subject matter through the whole show was how they deal with the "darkness" in the world. It just sounded like this guy was down in the dumps and very depressed. So when I consider that with the suicide, it would make sense to me. If you dont agree that's fine, it makes no difference to me.

       Actually I don't agree. He sounded fine.  He would have been acutely aware of the public reaction to him being found without leaving a note, so I find that strange.

       Finally, how many people would kill themselves without making some provision for their beloved, ailing pet dog? I'm serious.

       I don't know much about this man but it does seem odd if there indeed wasn't a note. When the announcement of your death has to include the statement that it wasn't a "fake" suicide, you'd think you'd take extra steps to make sure people know that you did it yourself.

       I'm really in no position to argue with you on it. I totally agree that seems fishy. But I got the impression from him talking about the hours spent at the airport that he was not well. I shouldn't have stated so blatantly in my original comment the he shot himself. I dont know.

       Disagree.  He mentioned multiple times that he'd be back next week and discussed his plans for the future (which, interestingly enough, he said he couldn't give details about but that it would be big and he was very excited about it).

       The instructions he  supposedly gave were to his colleagues as how to continue the show without him. There was no suicide note.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may well have committed suicide, but without a note it could just as easily have been murder, bearing in mind who he was.

       THEY said he committed suicide not I or a note, THEY said he instructed them how to continue the show after he planned to. You'd think he wouldn't write the note randomly and put it there if he wasn't going to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you suggest that he would tip them vaguely on committing suicide and being murdered before he'd do it himself?

       what makes you think they thought he was such a threat now?  Your speculating. Ruppert wasn't a fan of mad speculation so unless you can prove he didn't shoot himself, you have no valid point.

       My theory is this. He shot himself. He was clearly disturbed. His life had become a bit of a train wreck towards the end. He was given the opportunity and platform to spell out his view of the world via the recent Vice documentary and decided to take his own life feeling that he had nothing more to add in this lifetime and knowing his suicide would draw international attention to his views and history. The end.

       It's not obvious to either Hasting's wife or brother that they killed him. According to the people who know him best he was a disturbed and paranoid individual. Funny that 
Internet activists know him better than his own family.
