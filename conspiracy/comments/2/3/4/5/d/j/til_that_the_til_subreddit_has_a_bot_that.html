        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The post in question:  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/233z2a/til_that_ghw_bush_claims_he_could_not_remember/">http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/233z2a/til_that_ghw_bush_claims_he_could_not_remember/</a></p>

<p>The mod initially had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the bot removed it but it says it removed it for the word &quot;bush&quot; which shouldn&#39;t be on his remove list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then sent another message saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, need a minute before it can be approved. Not sure about that source, it doesn&#39;t seem to have any citations and doesn&#39;t seem very reliable on its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moderator ignorance of facts does not make something &quot;unreliable&quot;.  This is a condensed version of his book that is very heavily sourced.</p>

<p>Then they just decided to get rid of it with this accompanying message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, upon further investigation it doesn&#39;t seem to meet the requirements for the sub. It needs to be cited on the linked source, which it is not. It is also not a reliable source on its own, and I didn&#39;t see where in there the headline was actually supported either.</p>

<p>The bot was a false positive in the sense of removing it for the keywords, but it still is not an appropriate TIL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess TIL mods know better than Gore Vidal</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a wonderful book, by the way, I’m reading called Family of Secrets by…Russ Baker. He spent many years on it. And it’s a family — forgive me, Bushes and Bushettes — a family of criminals. Why they’re not all in jail I don’t know. If I seem a little dazed, I’ve been reading about their crimes, and proposed crimes, and how they got away with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah.. and I guess Russ Baker is &quot;unreliable&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baker has written for many US publications including the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, the New York Times, The Nation, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, the Village Voice, Esquire, Slate and Salon, and served as a contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review.[1][2][3] Internationally, his work has appeared in dozens of top publications including: The Globe &amp; Mail (Canada); The Sunday Times, The Guardian, and The Observer (UK); Der Spiegel and Frankfurter Allgemeine (Germany), La Repubblica (Italy), South China Morning Post (Hong Kong), and the Sydney Morning Herald.[4]</p>

<p>Baker received an MS in Journalism from Columbia University and a BA in Political Science from UCLA, and has served as a member of the adjunct faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He has won numerous journalism awards, including a 2005 Deadline Club award for his reporting on George W. Bush&#39;s military record. He also writes essays, profiles, humor, and culture and travel pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is there always some lame excuse for deleting these types of things?</p>

<p>Why is there a bot that has the Bush family singled out for &quot;special attention&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Account creation with nothing but a username and password? Globally known? Extremely high traffic? Contained within is a sub for virtually every interest/ topic ever? This is the IDEAL test bed for controlling information flow digitally, because here you have every kind of Internet user, bar ones that do not use reddit. But honestly, the ones that don&#39;t know how to use reddit are the ones not very likely to &quot;dig deep&quot; when they are browsing and therefore unlikely to ever come across alternative news. They just stick to Facebook where everything they say can be traced back to their real name and their immediate family and friends.</p>

<p>Just my take on it, anyway.</p>

<p>The link in question is an excerpt from a book.  The author of the book is presenting the excerpt on his website.</p>

<p>I find it curious and inaccurate to claim that the link doesn&#39;t support the headline.</p>

<p>But regardless, you should post a comment on your link directing Russ Baker &amp; his readers to this page.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;d find it very interesting.</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re missing the point. Funny how you omit my message asking it to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>More importantly, I didn&#39;t see the headline backed up within the source. Without that, whether or not it&#39;s a reliable source is a moot point. Can you quote where the headline was backed in the source? I might have overloooked it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have not answered that. Your headline says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TIL that GHW Bush claims he could not remember where he was when Kennedy was murdered </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is that supported within the linked article, as the rules require? Or is this just another of those &quot;my post broke the rules and was removed, so I&#39;ll make a post omitting the blatant rule violations and try to imply the mods are evil&quot; post?</p>

<p>&quot;The information is all out there&quot; is also irrelevant. Read rule one again, you need to link <strong>directly</strong> to the source. Even if your post said the sky was blue, if your source doesn&#39;t also back that claim, then the post is removed. That&#39;s what directly means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there a bot that has the Bush family singled out for &quot;special attention&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the same reason it removes &quot;Obama&quot;. Rule 4. Previously we didn&#39;t have Bush on the list as it&#39;s also a word, and we wanted to avoid false positives. Since this is the first it&#39;s come up, the false positive thing doesn&#39;t seem to be a huge issue. It isn&#39;t &quot;special attention&quot; (I like that you put it in quotes, quoting <strong>yourself</strong> as though it was us that had first said that.) It&#39;s using the bot to remove rule violating posts. The &quot;special attention&quot; is just you assuming it&#39;s being treated differently than other topics.</p>

<p>Edit: Upon further investigation, we&#39;ve actually had &quot;bush&quot; getting removed by the bot for awhile now, and yet this is the first someone has brought a false positive to our attention. So yea, not special treatment, just a political topic. Doesn&#39;t seem to be a false positive issue in general. If the bot&#39;s false positive had been the only issue, this post would have been put up when we were messaged, as OP was told in the first response to him. However, because it had other issues (source does not back claims in headline) then it does not get to stay up.</p>

<p>So... NOT the link of your source? <strong>Directly</strong> means that when you click the link, it&#39;s on that page. You just provided a link that isn&#39;t the page your source took you to. Thank you for further showing that you didn&#39;t link directly to the source, and this was removed under the most basic part of rule 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say it, but you really are a sad excuse for a human being.  Your stated justification for blocking his factual post on the great many horrendous crimes committed by Bush is <em>entirely</em> incorrect.  Backing and enforcing such blatantly bullshit censorship.  </p>

<p>Just doing your job, huh?  The old Nuremberg excuse.  It didn&#39;t work then, and it certainly doesn&#39;t work now.  By controlling a default sub, you are an active participant in the crippling of an amazing tool for humanity.  One that allows a large number of people to share critical information with one another.  instead, with your active support, it us used to propagate lies and state propaganda.</p>

<p>I could never do as you&#39;re doing.  To claim ignorance to such immoral actions is unacceptable.  Dante said the innermost ring of hell is reserved for your kind.  Those who can so easily betray their fellow man.</p>

I overlooked it because I don&#39;t look at links that aren&#39;t the source, <em>because they do not matter.</em> You get one click on the source link. That&#39;s it.
