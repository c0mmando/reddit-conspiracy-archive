<p><strong>Update 3: Old mods (save for 1) re-added <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> mod added and other random mod added as well. CENSORSHIP CONTINUES AND INTENSIFIES!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong></p>

<p>I must admit to being privy to inside information before this went down. We are now exactly 24 hours before my predictions all came true. undefaulted, mods bickering, everyone leaving, made the news. 10/10 would be involved in drama again. </p>

<p><strong>Update 5</strong>: <a href="/u/Creq">/u/Creq</a> is likely a schizophrenic. But he did discover an interesting trend! The dust is settling and the victory goes to...<strong>NO ONE!! EVERYONE IS A FUCKING LOSER! INCLUDING THE COMMUNITY!</strong></p>

<p>Nice fucking going Anut and Maxwell. Fuck you both. </p>

<p>Politics aren&#39;t the same as Technology. You wouldn&#39;t want a post about Feinstein or NSA on <a href="/r/Science">/r/Science</a> would you? Absolutely most of it is overzealous modding, but these aren&#39;t NSA shills, they&#39;re just stupid 20 year old dudes who got caught up with too much power and went a bit crazy with an automod. You asked for the contrary opinion, this is it. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get downvoted. Things will change in the next 72 hours on <a href="/r/Technology">/r/Technology</a>, just watch. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve read the responses under me and I&#39;m just going to edit here as I don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate to say more directly unofficially. What I can tell you is this. I personally disagree with a ton of the modding. You guys think it&#39;s some type of ridiculous conspiracy, just look at the edit number 3. How paranoid...If anyone took 3 minutes to follow that story they would see several of the mods that got booted and the mod that invited them discussing it totally publicly, along with several screen chats of private backroom dealings. And it all showed nothing. In fact, those mods are pushing heavy to change it. I don&#39;t agree with it so I&#39;m not going to play devil&#39;s advocate, I&#39;m just giving you the reality behind this so called conspiracy. And it is a a conspiracy...just not in the capacity you&#39;re all thinking. It&#39;s not JTRIK or whatever, it&#39;s not the NSA. It&#39;s college kids with a robot mod to help save time because they have shit moderators. It&#39;ll change. It&#39;s changing now. </p>

The problem, of course, is that this is a very limited definition, which serves the interests of the very powerful. If technology is only something to be passively affirmed, we have extricated it from the real world complexity by which it is actually characterized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this.</p>

<p>I was aware of all of these conspiracies, but to address 3), this is an interesting conundrum for Americans, democracy, regulation, laws etc.</p>

<p>every industry has regulations. For example, baseball has many regulations that are put in place by the baseball industry itself. Congress pretty much leaves baseball alone, until steroids become an issue, because kids...</p>

<p>So it is with every industry.  Industry sets its own rules, and the government rubber-stamps them, until something goes wrong, like miners getting killed because of unsafe work practices. </p>

<p>On the one hand, we know regulations are necessary, but on the other hand we have to ask if we want the industry to regulate itself, or if we want politicians regulating industries?  Neither prospect seems attractive, but I would say id prefer to have competent people practicing in an industry to know best how to regulate their industry, rather than a paid-off, incompetent politician who has no idea how things work in the industry that they are trying to regulate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is a fundamental question in our economic system. to regulate or not to regulate... and if we regulate, who is the regulator? </p>

<p>when you think of regulations in terms of sports, we see that most sports have regulations, and most of those regulations probably had some reason for being implemented. the rule books for professional sports are probably quite thick, and referees sometimes have to talk amongst themselves to sort out a tricky call... </p>

<p>another example of regulations would be like for driving a car. after some experience driving, you probably appreciate why there are rules and why they are important to follow. </p>

<p>im not saying that the revolving door between regulators, lobbyists, and industries is the sign of a broken system, I&#39;m saying that is by design... </p>

<p>Those posts got a couple hundred up-votes?  Cool beans.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has over 225,000 subscribers so you&#39;ll need to do a lot better than that.  As it is, if a post gets 400 up-votes that is only .002% of the community.</p>

<p>Your use of flair to (apparently) mock and belittle the spying revealed by Snowden makes it seem like you agree with the spies. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>Americans have been told only a small part of the full story about NSA spying.  So there&#39;s not really any &quot;it&quot; for Americans to be &quot;okay with.&quot;</p>

<p>Most people also don&#39;t have any problem with child-rapists until they know they are raping children.</p>

<p>I think all things have to do with liberty, it is the new religion. From the Christian sprang the Libertarian Era. and now we have assmunches that rode the wrong horse that wish to derail the whole race. Sorry guys, the race is won, and we all who the victor is.</p>

For instance if they allowed NSA-related technology content it would probably overflow their subreddit and drown out other technology news that doesn&#39;t normally get media attention. NSA related articles are interesting but it&#39;s probably better suited for it&#39;s own dedicated subreddit at this pace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I busted out Reddit for censoring &quot;Obama&quot; posts during the 2012 election, where new Obama posts would be allowed to stay in the new queue for 2 hours then inexplicably be deleted. This two hour time frame was good because if you search for &quot;new&quot; Obama submissions you find a whole page of them but also because posts would never really have a chance to get big and draw a lot of attention.</p>

<p>When I documented this bullshit and brought it to the attention of reddit, the reddit management, instead of being concerned or curious about my findings, offered up all kinds of flimsy excuses for their &quot;search bug&quot;. I was called a bunch of names, told I was an idiot because i couldnt understand or comprehend why the search bug would delete Obama submissions after 2 hours but not Romney submissions. I was told I was stupid because I didnt understand how a &quot;search bug&quot; could remove the name of the person submitting the submission and replace it with the word [deleted].</p>

<p>So, while the search bug seemed mighty suspicious to me, it was the reddit admins that confirmed my suspicions for me.</p>

<p>This search bug also affected the word &quot;Reddit&quot;. Some of us experimented with other words but these are the only 2 we discovered at the time.</p>
