       I know this seems far-fetched, baseless and highly skeptical but Hillary Clinton is going to win the next election. I have a friend who works for a super, secret other government agency and has procured documents that says she is going to win through vote rigging and media manipulation. I am willing to put all my money on it.

       It's none of those things.  It was clear she was going to run when Bill started campaigning hard for Obama.  In exchange, Obama will campaign hard for Hillary, and she will likely beat anyone the Republicans can field against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, she won't have to rig votes to do it.

       Sounds like a lot of bullshit to me, not Clinton winning but your friend who works for a super secret government agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton will win if the GOP cant field a person who isnt an idiot. The only reason Obama won was because the other option was Romney.

       Romney couldn't even make the numbers on his tax/spending plan add up properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you think Romney would have done any better than Obama on any of the issues ?  Would have stopped the wars sooner ?  Would have stopped the NSA spying ?  Would have stopped the bailouts ?  Would have regulated Wall Street more ?  Would have kept rich people's influence out of govt ?  No.

       She doesn't have to play any card, just as Obama didn't have to say "vote for me because I'm black".  A lot of people will be stoked by the chance to elect a woman.  A lot of people around the world will be impressed by USA having a woman president, just as many are by USA having a black president.

       He didn't have to say it, he got the minority vote by being one. Hillary will ride on the same concept.

       I agree that Hilary is absolutely horrible and should never take office of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, let's take a look at the real problem. Whoever gets elected will have been groomed for the job by TPTB. It will have been years in the making and it won't change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of who gets elected, the same shit will continue. Remember these people are merely puppets, we're not going to get another Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I hope she does not get elected... but I don't have much faith in the other guy to be any better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real shit show would be if neither candidate gets a majority vote in the electoral college. It would go to the house and be interesting to see what happens.

       That IS a concern.  She'd enter office at same age as Reagan was when he entered office.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she has an unassailable position in the primaries, due to money and support.  And just about every R candidate or policy I can think of is bad.  And the top third parties seem to never come up with a reasonable candidate.

       Why do you like the left boot on your neck so much more than the right boot?  Can you really feel a difference?  Is the left boot softer?  or, because its being worn by a woman, maybe there is less weight behind it?  Im really curious about this.

       Yeah, actually, I think the party (D) that tries to work for positive improvement in this country (healthcare reform, immigration reform, renewable energy, Wall Street regulation, etc) is better than the party (R) that wants to prevent any improvement, ban gays, ban abortion, etc.

       Their good stuff comes at a huge cost.  They offer nice sounding things, but so does the pedophile in the van offering kids candy.  The dems promise things, but its usually at the expense of someone or something else.  I don't like the politics the democrats play either.  They convince certain groups of people they are victims and must be protected by government and they give the people that vote for them special treatment (not unlike the republicans, just different people).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no use for the republicans.  Its the party of stupid people.  Mean and stupid people.  I refuse to associate with people like that.

       Well, for example, healthcare reform might move us closer to the European models of healthcare.  Those countries tend to get better results for less than half the per-capita cost we pay.  USA is very sub-standard in healthcare and health insurance.  So real healthcare reform wouldn't be a "huge cost", it would be a cost saving.  In fact, ACA is just about revenue-neutral (in federal budget).  Not that ACA is "real reform"; it's just a baby step in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Renewable energy and fighting climate change would create jobs and improve health and environment, and decrease our dependence on the Mideast.  All good things, right ?  No "huge costs" there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration reform.  Surely you can't think it's good that we have some 11 million people in the country illegally, living every day in fear of being found out and deported ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I think the D's are trying to improve the country, and we should vote for them.

       If you don't vote, you're letting other people choose for you.  And there ARE better and worse candidates.  I'm very glad my votes for Obama helped keep McCain and Romney out of the White House.  Although Obama has plenty of faults.

       Yeah, I read up about Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, and decided they both were out of touch with reality.  Anyone who leads with "I'll eliminate the IRS !" is either deluded or trying to fool you.

       I think if Romney had been elected, he would have done the same bad things Obama did (let the wars go on too long, renew the Patriot Act, let the NSA spying go on) and none of the good things Obama did (healthcare reform, renewable energy, try to get immigration reform).  As well as trying to enact more tax cuts for the rich.  No, Romney and Obama are not the same.

       Ah, yes, the "why are you in this sub ?" gambit.  You can't tolerate hearing an opposing view ?  I think you need to re-read the subreddit statement, which starts with "This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone's opinions and ALL religious beliefs and creeds. We hope to challenge issues which have captured the public’s imagination. From JFK, UFOs, Gulf of Tonkin and of course 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking - not hate speech.

       And do you think Romney would have done any better than Obama on any of the issues ?  Would have stopped the wars sooner ?  Would have stopped the NSA spying ?
