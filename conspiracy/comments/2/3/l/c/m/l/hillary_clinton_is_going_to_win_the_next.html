<p>It&#39;s none of those things.  It was clear she was going to run when Bill started campaigning hard for Obama.  In exchange, Obama will campaign hard for Hillary, and she will likely beat anyone the Republicans can field against her.</p>

<p>And, she won&#39;t have to rig votes to do it.  </p>

<p>Clinton will win if the GOP cant field a person who isnt an idiot. The only reason Obama won was because the other option was Romney.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Hilary is absolutely horrible and should never take office of any kind.</p>

<p>However, let&#39;s take a look at the real problem. Whoever gets elected will have been groomed for the job by TPTB. It will have been years in the making and it won&#39;t change anything.</p>

<p>Regardless of who gets elected, the same shit will continue. Remember these people are merely puppets, we&#39;re not going to get another Kennedy.</p>

<p>So yeah, I hope she does not get elected... but I don&#39;t have much faith in the other guy to be any better.</p>

<p>The real shit show would be if neither candidate gets a majority vote in the electoral college. It would go to the house and be interesting to see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for example, healthcare reform might move us closer to the European models of healthcare.  Those countries tend to get better results for less than half the per-capita cost we pay.  USA is very sub-standard in healthcare and health insurance.  So real healthcare reform wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;huge cost&quot;, it would be a cost saving.  In fact, ACA is just about revenue-neutral (in federal budget).  Not that ACA is &quot;real reform&quot;; it&#39;s just a baby step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Renewable energy and fighting climate change would create jobs and improve health and environment, and decrease our dependence on the Mideast.  All good things, right ?  No &quot;huge costs&quot; there.</p>

<p>Immigration reform.  Surely you can&#39;t think it&#39;s good that we have some 11 million people in the country illegally, living every day in fear of being found out and deported ?</p>

<p>Yes, I think the D&#39;s are trying to improve the country, and we should vote for them.</p>

<p>Although Obama has plenty of faults</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean he&#39;s a puppet who is controlled by people behind the scenes. The puppet who has signed the NDAA into law, who has increased drone strikes since Bush left office, who has further eroded civil liberties, who had built upon and expanded on every Bush policy? </p>

<p>Why are you even in this sub? You are still voting for Obama for goodness sake! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I read up about Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, and decided they both were out of touch with reality.  Anyone who leads with &quot;I&#39;ll eliminate the IRS !&quot; is either deluded or trying to fool you.</p>

<p>I think if Romney had been elected, he would have done the same bad things Obama did (let the wars go on too long, renew the Patriot Act, let the NSA spying go on) and none of the good things Obama did (healthcare reform, renewable energy, try to get immigration reform).  As well as trying to enact more tax cuts for the rich.  No, Romney and Obama are not the same.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, the &quot;why are you in this sub ?&quot; gambit.  You can&#39;t tolerate hearing an opposing view ?  I think you need to re-read the subreddit statement, which starts with &quot;This subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone&#39;s opinions and ALL religious beliefs and creeds. We hope to challenge issues which have captured the public’s imagination. From JFK, UFOs, Gulf of Tonkin and of course 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking - not hate speech. Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romney couldn&#39;t even make the numbers on his tax/spending plan add up properly.</p>

<p>And do you think Romney would have done any better than Obama on any of the issues ?  Would have stopped the wars sooner ?  Would have stopped the NSA spying ?  Would have stopped the bailouts ?  Would have regulated Wall Street more ?  Would have kept rich people&#39;s influence out of govt ?  No.</p>
