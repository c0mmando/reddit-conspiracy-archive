        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday I made a post to <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a>  titled <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/23fpoj/til_a_prize_of_one_million_dollars_has_been/">&quot;TIL a prize of one million dollars has been offered to anyone who can demonstrate that $7,000 audio cables are any better than ordinary cables&quot;</a></p>

<p>Now not long after I posted it the thread began to take off and I sat and watched the discussion happen. This is where it gets weird. The thread started to become very popular (this is obviously bad for the companies that make these expensive cables as it is near proof that their product is false)</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6sZ6upJ.png">A user then makes an edit to the wikipedia page using an account to cover their IP.</a> They changed <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tAujqyM.png">this part:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, audio reviewer Michael Fremer attempted to claim the prize, and said that Randi declined the challenge.[19] Randi said that the cable manufacturer Pear was the one who withdrew.[20]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jTVMlBa.png">this:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>audio reviewer Michael Fremer proved that <strong>the integrity of more expensive cables gave a higher sound quality</strong> and claimed the prize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>There was no source cited for this info at all</em></p>

<p>After this an edit war began and the &quot;user&quot; claimed that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s common knowledge that this happened whereas the source used before was sketchy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being changed back and forth the user gave up and the post was left as it originally was where it said that it had never been proven that the cables were of any higher quality.</p>

<p>Now some time after that when the post reached about +2700 the mods of <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a> quietly  removed the post without making a comment to say why but only the flairing the post as <strong>&quot;Rule one, title innacurate, all information must be sourced&quot;</strong>
Now here&#39;s the thing. </p>

<p>The information is in no way innacurate and is completely sourced and the timing is really odd considering the editor of the page had just been called out and the page returned to its original form.</p>

<p>So for that I must ask if the mods of <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a>  have a history of protecting corporate interests or removing posts that are bad publicity for corporations.</p>

<p>From my perspective it seems they&#39;ve attempted to change the article to cover up the products failures and after failing, removed the post to shut down the truth and discussion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/23fpoj/til_a_prize_of_one_million_dollars_has_been/cgwl4w1">Here&#39;s the discussion the mods have removed</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0nfoW8v.png">Here are the comments from the thread that question the edit for if they get removed by the mods</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/23l1yq/7222422267_til_william_poundstone_did_a_chemical/">These removals seem to be quite common for the mods of /r/todayIlearned</a></p>

<p>reddit should just implement some transparency.  you delete something, you&#39;re name goes with the flair so users can see who is deleting their stuff.</p>

<p>as well as remove seniority permissions in the mod line, leave that democratic short of the founder.  founder has unilateral authority, if foudner leads then its a democratic system amongst the current mods.  Want to kick a mod out, better have majority support amongst other moderators.  that way no one can just remove every mod that came after them when they throw a hissy fit, or someone doesn&#39;t share their view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because wire is wire, and the audio as it is, is just electricity. The only things that affects signal degradation in a cable is *Gauge, or width, *Length, and the amount of power, or *Watts. None of which are substantially different in &quot;high quality cables&quot;. Moreover, the reason they sound the same is because the amount of power is so small compared to the size of the cables, there is no discernible difference. It&#39;s like connecting a 1ft or 2ft diameter high-voltage wire to your toaster to see which one toasts better. Maybe, if you had a 2k ft run of cable, you would hear a little low end signal degradation, but you would still hear it in the $7k cable of the same gauge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wires cant be high voltage. </p>

<p>that&#39;s like saying a building is high gravity. wires only have two properties that affect current: resistivity &amp; conductivity. these are intrinsic to the material in which the wire is made of. voltage is a qualitative value that measures electric potential between two points in space.</p>

<p>connecting a high voltage source to a low voltage source (like the ground) via a wire is like having a ball on top of a building. a higher building is analogous to higher voltage. higher voltage just makes charge move with more force through a wire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is just university level physics 2</p>

<p>to be honest i don&#39;t think he&#39;s right about the electrical signal. charge flows in a wire due to moving electrons. the novel thing is that the electrons don&#39;t actually move near the speed of light like we think they do. electrons in a wire move due to a force that is exerted on them, usually measured in volts. and they actually move pretty damn slow, this value is known as the electron drift speed. but then you ask: &quot;well how can a light be turned on almost immediately when I flip a switch 100 yards away if these electrons are moving so slow&quot;. well the answer is clever and simple, since the wire is full of electrons, pushing electrons at one end sends a ripple through the wire at a very fast speed and all the electrons shift slightly to the right to compensate and then the electrons at the other end shift. so it gives the appearance that it happened instantly. think of it like that little marble device that you see in offices: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Newton_Cradle_5_ball_system_in_3D_2_ball_swing.gif">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Newton_Cradle_5_ball_system_in_3D_2_ball_swing.gif</a></p>

<p>essentially my point is that there is a sea of electrons in the wire and they just get pushed around to create current.</p>

<p>now the only thing i can think of that he may have gotten confused about is electromagnetism. when you move current through space it creates a magnetic field around it (fucking weird right? but there is solid reasoning for this). that&#39;s about the only thing that moves around the circumference of wire carrying charge.</p>

<p>You only need a saber saw and a small reversing drill to get started.  Thats all I had back in the 70&#39;s.  I picked up better tools as I went along.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting a parts list for a 2 way bookshelf speaker project in a few days.  It&#39;s the highest fidelity, lower cost, small, and powerful bass, I know how to build. It will be intended to get new people started with an absolutely mind boggling awesome sounding small speaker, and it won&#39;t matter if the wood working skills are not all the best.  They sound so good friends will want some for themselves. Thats how speaker builders get started.       </p>

<p>, that one of them has enough of a stake in the sales of these cables to make it worthwhile to arbitrarily remove the post. </p>

<p>No that&#39;s not it. My point is that &quot;Social Network Management INC&quot; hire these kinds of people to influence social media for profit.</p>

<p>Say Amanda mods <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and sees that by going to work for Social Network Management INC she could make much money just by removing posts and twisting the game a little.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be loyalty just whoever can pay Social Network Management INC the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is the mod eventually came to defend it when the post was big. There he said that the uneditable source wikipedia used was wrong.</p>

<p>I think he tried to edit the article to cause the link to be removed (because that would not raise suspicion like a mod removing the #5 link on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>)</p>

<p>But the way I see, even if you don&#39;t think there&#39;s a shill I think we can all agree something really odd happened with this and the mods are not being honest about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what an odd think to use so much effort to hide or censor.  Especially since it&#39;s pretty common knowledge on reddit at least that more expensive cables are pure rip-off and everyone always tells everyone to buy from sites like monoprice.com</p>

<p>The fact he was changing the wiki-page to justify the &quot;inaccurate&quot; tag, leads me to believe this is less <em>mods</em> and more <em>mod</em>, probably encountered one that has an unreasonable hard-on for the expensive equipment and doesn&#39;t like being shown he&#39;s wasting money/is wrong.</p>

<p>Try sending a message to the top mods about this.  State the info you have that you submitted this link and a mod deleted it while conveniently someone was editing the wiki-page multiple times to support the removal.</p>

<p>See what they say.  </p>

<p>Not always a conspiracy, sometimes you just have the misfortune of running across a fanatic.</p>

<p>I just did a quick check over and there seems to be a couple of mods that might fit that description.  I don&#39;t have time to thoroughly check atm though.  (but holy shit one of them mods 200 subs ._.)</p>
