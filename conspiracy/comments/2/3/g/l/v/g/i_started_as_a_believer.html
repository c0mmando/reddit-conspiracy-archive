        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My introduction to conspiracy theories was the fake moon landing. I was astounded to discovery we did not really go. This was about 2003, and I believed it.</p>

<p>Then, a while later, something made me add &quot;debunk&quot; to some searches, and I found material that contradicted every detail that had convinced me that the moon landings had been faked. </p>

<p>I repeated this with Ancient Alien theories, which seem so real.
I repeated this with 9/11, with all aspects and all details of 9/11.</p>

<p>Now, whenever I read a fascinating claim, I immediately google with +debunk. I do this with everything now, not just conspiracy stuff.</p>

<p>Doing this, it seems that every detail for every conspiracy theory is or has been thoroughly debunked. I want to believe, but even so, I find it so hard.</p>

<p>But, it is so much fun, I cannot stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure I believe your little anecdote about how you were a precocious conspiracy theorist and then saw the error of your ways, found Jesus or whatever, when you were older and &quot;wiser&quot;.

<p>The word &quot;debunked&quot; is very powerful trigger-word, because when people read that a conspiracy theory has been  debunked, they tend to believe it without checking if the debunking is valid. Often it is not. But I think you know that.</p>

<p>I do thoroughly examine the debunk, and also look at the counter debunks. Those are often the most entertaining.</p>

<p>Because I flipped on the moon walk hoax, I wonder why it seems to be all or nothing for so many folks. That is, it seems unacceptable to be a 9/11 truther but also reject the Sand yHook conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon hoax ideas are silly. (sorry guys)</p>

<p>Sandyhook is up for debate. Measuring ears is dumb. That doesn&#39;t mean all points are dumb, and even if it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy it strongly suggests that our FEMA and DHS disaster strategies and evidence processing is real crap.</p>

<p>9/11 has a bunch of solid evidence behind it. This is NOT debunked, and the only debunkings I have seen are fundementally composed of: &quot;NIST!&quot; and &quot;NUH UH!!!&quot; The science cannot even be properly tested by either side because they won&#39;t release the models...</p>

<p>One at a time there buddy. The biggest difficulty in analyzing conspiracy is the orbiting garbage. It muddies real investigation AND makes for some poor excuses of debunking.</p>

<p>If you were to always go with the &#39;debunked&#39; argument, then you automatically must believe there has never, ever been a conspiracy theory that has been proven true.</p>

<p>All you have to prove is that the 911 Commission Report is a lie. If the &quot;Official Story&quot; is a lie, then there was never a real investigation. You don&#39;t have to listen to a bunch of people argue over free fall speeds to know it&#39;s a fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My man. The final conclusion of the 911 commission report, the reason they said it happened, was that there was a &quot;failure of imagination&quot;. They literally concluded that it was impossible for anyone to have predicted that terrorists would ever think to fly a plane into a building. That is literally the last chapter of the 911 commission report and you need to confirm that for yourself.</p>

<p>But this is a direct lie. How do we know its a lie? Because of Operation Northwoods. Operation Northwoods literally proposed flying planes into the Empire State building in order to blame it on the cubans. Please confirm this fact for yourself. The joint chiefs of staff signed off on this plan in 1961.</p>

<p>So am I saying that 911 was Operation Northwoods was 911? No. Im saying the conclusion to the 911 commission report is a BIG FUCKING LIE and Operation Northwoods proves it (because flying planes into buildings was <em>obviously</em> &quot;imagined&quot; 50 years ago. 911 is a fraud and if you can&#39;t see it, you don&#39;t understand MKUltra and you don&#39;t understand the truth.</p>

<p>IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE PRESIDENT. The Joint Chiefs of Staff signed it and were ready to go. But that&#39;s not even the point.</p>

<p>The point is that the entire 911 Commission Report comes to a single conclusion. That is conclusion is that &quot;We could never have imagined anybody would ever think to fly a plane into a building so we weren&#39;t expecting that&quot;. But people aware of Operation Northwoods (the entire military and most awake and aware people) have heard of exactly that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And if a similar plan was put in front of Dick Cheney, do you think he would do the same thing JFK did? What if we knew for a fact that a plan was put in front of Cheney which called for &quot;a new Pearl Harbor&quot;. What would you think about that? That exact plan was called The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#.22New_Pearl_Harbor.22">&quot;Plan for a New American Century&quot;</a> and it called for a &quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;. So Operation Northwoods and the PNAC were the same plan presented to different Presidents. JFK refused and was dead a year later. How is Dick Cheney doin?</p>

<p>No it didn&#39;t. All it said was that change would be slow unless there was a major event like it, which is true. It doesn&#39;t necessarily <em>call for it</em> though. So no, they weren&#39;t the same plan. Not even slightly. And Cheney was never President.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s an important nuance that many conspiracy theorists fail to grasp: Yes, 9/11 was absolutely exploited for a variety of purposes, but that does not mean that the people exploiting it had anything to do with it or that they knew about it beforehand. </p>

<p>The fbi and congress have admitted that the Saudi government was involved as well. So if you continue to keep your head in the sand, you have the freedom to make that choice. I live in a world where knowing the truth is important to me, no matter how uncomfortable those truths may be. Its clear that you don&#39;t have the courage to face the truth and its fine that you make that decision. </p>

<p>Well I just searched through the full text of the actual document proposing Operation Northwoods and it does no such thing. There is no mention whatsoever of flying any plane into the Empire State Building or any other. You are either misinformed, or lying.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really disinformation since the guy was right.</p>

<p>Are you implying I specifically single out new accounts? Even a cursory glance at my history would disprove that.</p>

<p>No. I choose a topic and when I&#39;m finished I move on. This is no way proves I have ulterior motives.</p>

<p>And he doesn&#39;t do the same thing? My point is that it&#39;s stupid to claim someone has &quot;ulterior motives&quot; when anyone (even you) can be accused of that, using the same level of evidence you used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A guy posting twice about how VT lies has ulterior motives.</p>

<p>Again, in no way shape of form does that seem to prove any &quot;ulterior motives&quot;. And again, one could use the fact that you&#39;ve only commented on posts regarding this topic, to accuse you of having ulterior motives. Do you actually have ulterior motives? Probably not, but the same goes for the OP.</p>

<p>If a major news source is found to have lied, they usually get called out. I fail to see why veterans today should be immune to that.</p>

<p><em>a person&#39;s overly frequent or vehement attempts to convince others of something have ironically helped to convince others that the opposite is true, by making the person look insincere and defensive.</em></p>

<p>The fact that conspiracy theories have to be constantly &quot;debunked&quot; shows that ulterior motives are in play. I don&#39;t waste time disproving, I spend time substantiating my own theories. Debunking is counter-productive to someone who already knows he is being lied to as the government has proven that time and time again.</p>

<ol>
<li>President Lyndon B. Johnson lying about Gulf of Tonkin. </li>
<li>President Richard Nixon lies about the Watergate scandal. </li>
<li>President Ronald Reagan lies about the Iran-contra affair. </li>
<li>President Bill Clinton lying about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. </li>
<li>President George W. Bush lying about WMD in Iraq. </li>
<li>President Barack Obama lying about how he will close Guantanamo, and make sure no-one is tortured. </li>
<li>George Tenet lying before the 9/11 commission. </li>
<li>Condoleezza Rice lies about envisioning hijacked airplanes used to stage terrorist attacks. </li>
<li>President George W. Bush lies about seeing the first airplane strike on 9/11. </li>
<li>Colin Powell lying about Iraqi mobile anthrax/WMD production capabilities. </li>
<li>Vice President Dick Cheney, lying about Iraq Al-Qaeda ties. </li>
<li>Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Indisputably Lied to Congress About NSA Surveillance. </li>
<li>President Barack Obama lies about domestic spying program. </li>
<li>Director of the National Security Agency, Keith B. Alexander, lying about NSA surveillance. </li>
</ol>

<p>This was passed off as truth, and the it was shown to be lies. Pretty much every major event the government has told a lie to further its agenda. There&#39;s no reason to believe this behavior has stopped.</p>

<p>Debunking should start with official narratives and mainstream media information, not conspiracy theories as this guy is suggesting. We are trying to find the real truth of the matter, not mudding the waters with disinformation.</p>

<p>In no way shape of form does it mean that. For example, if someone tries to advocate the ancient astronaut theory to me, I will understandably debunk it, as it&#39;s a terrible argument and has no evidence to support it.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama lying about how he will close Guantanamo, and make sure no-one is tortured.</p>

<p>Much easier said than done, it&#39;s actually really hard to close the prison.</p>

<p>Really? Every single thing? That&#39;s a major accusation.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we try and debunk both? Of course you can try to debunk official narratives, but that doesn&#39;t mean your theories should be immune from debunking. If they are clearly flawed, or just bad overall, then it has every right to be debunked.</p>
