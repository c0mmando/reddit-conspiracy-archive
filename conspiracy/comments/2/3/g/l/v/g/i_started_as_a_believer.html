       My introduction to conspiracy theories was the fake moon landing. I was astounded to discovery we did not really go. This was about 2003, and I believed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, a while later, something made me add "debunk" to some searches, and I found material that contradicted every detail that had convinced me that the moon landings had been faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeated this with Ancient Alien theories, which seem so real.
I repeated this with 9/11, with all aspects and all details of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, whenever I read a fascinating claim, I immediately google with +debunk. I do this with everything now, not just conspiracy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing this, it seems that every detail for every conspiracy theory is or has been thoroughly debunked. I want to believe, but even so, I find it so hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it is so much fun, I cannot stop.

       How about instead of "believing" one side and then the other over and over, you simply make the decision to not "believe" anything.  Collect data, verify it, hypothesize about it, discuss it with others. You should reserve forming a solid opinion about anything that is happening.  There will most likely always be more information that might take you on another path.  Keep an open mind.

       To be honest, I'm not sure I believe your little anecdote about how you were a precocious conspiracy theorist and then saw the error of your ways, found Jesus or whatever, when you were older and "wiser". It really doesn't work like that, unless you had a brain injury or something you're not telling us about?
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "debunked" is very powerful trigger-word, because when people read that a conspiracy theory has been  debunked, they tend to believe it without checking if the debunking is valid. Often it is not. But I think you know that.

       I did buy into the moon landing hoax and after seeing the counter points I did change my mind. No kool-aid and no water walking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do thoroughly examine the debunk, and also look at the counter debunks. Those are often the most entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I flipped on the moon walk hoax, I wonder why it seems to be all or nothing for so many folks. That is, it seems unacceptable to be a 9/11 truther but also reject the Sand yHook conspiracies.

       The moon hoax ideas are silly. (sorry guys)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandyhook is up for debate. Measuring ears is dumb. That doesn't mean all points are dumb, and even if it wasn't a conspiracy it strongly suggests that our FEMA and DHS disaster strategies and evidence processing is real crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 has a bunch of solid evidence behind it. This is NOT debunked, and the only debunkings I have seen are fundementally composed of: "NIST!" and "NUH UH!!!" The science cannot even be properly tested by either side because they won't release the models...
      </p>
      <p>
       One at a time there buddy. The biggest difficulty in analyzing conspiracy is the orbiting garbage. It muddies real investigation AND makes for some poor excuses of debunking.

       It is always wise to see both sides to an argument.  I use the same techniques as far as trying to debunk an idea. I am curious to know your thoughts on 9-11. Why have they kept the pentagon videos so top secret? It seems to add fuel to the fire since they never released any video of planes flying into the pentagon, except for those 2 super grainy videos. Any thoughts on that?

       Listing a whole bunch of stuff in one compendium does not make any one of them true. It is tedious, but, it's all been addressed. It has 13 years.

       For every conspiracy theory argument there is an equally valid counter argument. Sometimes one side or the other is proven, sometimes it never is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to always go with the 'debunked' argument, then you automatically must believe there has never, ever been a conspiracy theory that has been proven true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe consider viewing a conspiracy a little more scientifically and adjust your personal theory (not 'belief) to fit new information.

       All you have to prove is that the 911 Commission Report is a lie. If the "Official Story" is a lie, then there was never a real investigation. You don't have to listen to a bunch of people argue over free fall speeds to know it's a fraud.

       My man. The final conclusion of the 911 commission report, the reason they said it happened, was that there was a "failure of imagination". They literally concluded that it was impossible for anyone to have predicted that terrorists would ever think to fly a plane into a building. That is literally the last chapter of the 911 commission report and you need to confirm that for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is a direct lie. How do we know its a lie? Because of Operation Northwoods. Operation Northwoods literally proposed flying planes into the Empire State building in order to blame it on the cubans. Please confirm this fact for yourself. The joint chiefs of staff signed off on this plan in 1961.
      </p>
      <p>
       So am I saying that 911 was Operation Northwoods was 911? No. Im saying the conclusion to the 911 commission report is a BIG FUCKING LIE and Operation Northwoods proves it (because flying planes into buildings was
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       "imagined" 50 years ago. 911 is a fraud and if you can't see it, you don't understand MKUltra and you don't understand the truth.

       IT GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE PRESIDENT. The Joint Chiefs of Staff signed it and were ready to go. But that's not even the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that the entire 911 Commission Report comes to a single conclusion. That is conclusion is that "We could never have imagined anybody would ever think to fly a plane into a building so we weren't expecting that". But people aware of Operation Northwoods (the entire military and most awake and aware people) have heard of exactly that.

       And if a similar plan was put in front of Dick Cheney, do you think he would do the same thing JFK did? What if we knew for a fact that a plan was put in front of Cheney which called for "a new Pearl Harbor". What would you think about that? That exact plan was called The

       and it called for a "New Pearl Harbor". So Operation Northwoods and the PNAC were the same plan presented to different Presidents. JFK refused and was dead a year later. How is Dick Cheney doin?

       No it didn't. All it said was that change would be slow unless there was a major event like it, which is true. It doesn't necessarily

       though. So no, they weren't the same plan. Not even slightly. And Cheney was never President.

       And here's an important nuance that many conspiracy theorists fail to grasp: Yes, 9/11 was absolutely exploited for a variety of purposes, but that does not mean that the people exploiting it had anything to do with it or that they knew about it beforehand.

       The fbi and congress have admitted that the Saudi government was involved as well. So if you continue to keep your head in the sand, you have the freedom to make that choice. I live in a world where knowing the truth is important to me, no matter how uncomfortable those truths may be.

       Again, in no way shape of form does that seem to prove any "ulterior motives". And again, one could use the fact that you've only commented on posts regarding this topic, to accuse you of having ulterior motives. Do you actually have ulterior motives? Probably not, but the same goes for the OP.

       If a major news source is found to have lied, they usually get called out. I fail to see why veterans today should be immune to that.

        a person's overly frequent or vehement attempts to convince others of something have ironically helped to convince others that the opposite is true, by making the person look insincere and defensive.

       The fact that conspiracy theories have to be constantly "debunked" shows that ulterior motives are in play. I don't waste time disproving, I spend time substantiating my own theories.

       Why can't we try and debunk both? Of course you can try to debunk official narratives, but that doesn't mean your theories should be immune from debunking. If they are clearly flawed, or just bad overall, then it has every right to be debunked.
