       Thanks for posting this. Stealing is normal for VT. Veterans Today also often republishes articles without the authors consent. This is shabby behaviour. Some of those plagiarized articles are quite good, but instead of posting articles from Veterans today, I recommend linking to the original source.

       But much worse is that the editor in chief Gordon Duff is a known source for disinformation. In the past I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He seemed so credulous. I thought his gullibility might have been abused by somebody else who used him as front. This doubt is gone. Gordon Duff has exposed himself. His own words show that he is a liar:
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch this video and hear it from his own mouth:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZufw3G931Q">
        Gordon Duff Is a Disinformation Agent
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or read this fine blog post. While I don't necessarily agree with all of the author's conclusion, he makes it very clear, why Duff is not to be trusted.

       Interesting to see all the downvotes. Apparently, it's OK to steal and manipulate photos as long as Veterans Today does it.

       You don't know if that's their board. You have nothing to prove it is or isn't. You're assuming based on bias.

       And whenever it's a mainstream source, the people here are absolutely outraged.

       When it's an "alternative" source that validates your beliefs, as with this one, nobody cares. In fact, you're just defending it all the more. Double standard much?
