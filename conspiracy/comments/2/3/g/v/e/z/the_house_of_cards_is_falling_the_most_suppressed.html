       Nearly all of these points are verifiable and should at least raise a healthy dose of skepticism from those who take a moment consider them, especially compared to other shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have good reason not to trust those who hold power over your nation (and their are plenty, remembering as well that studies show America to in practicality function as a plutocracy more than a democracy) then skepticism becomes nothing short of patriotism.

       do an excellent job of debunking pretty much everything.  And if you're going to hang your hat on CNN doing this, then you give that inept "news" network that screws things up almost as much as Fox WAY too much credit.  The problem with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is that you guys will claim a conspiracy on dubious, false, or just circumstantial evidence, and then scream bloody murder when called out on it, demanding "evidence of no conspiracy."
      </p>

       I know that Santa Claus isn't coming in my house every night and raping my dog with a candy cane, but I have no evidence that he ISN'T doing it because it didn't happen in the first place.

       There's no data from these guys, just denialism. Like usual. You see the difference between them and us is that we can discuss issues without coming to conclusions, whereas they simply deny everything, regardless of evidence.

       He's silencing discussion by name calling.  Hijacking is probably a better term though.  Name calling does not promote an exchange of ideas and the discussion devolves into bickering.

       I'm silencing nothing by name calling.  And frankly, as soon as someone calls out the idiocy of some of the posts here (EX: Sandy Hook was NOT a hoax.  It happened)  the majority of this sub tries to shout that person down, calling them a sheep who isn't smart enough to "see" what they see.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are conspiracies out there.  Not everything is a conspiracy though.  Sandy Hook happened.  Nothing changed in this country, despite the vast majority of the country WANTING something to happen.  You want a conspiracy?  THAT is a conspiracy of the people in power not giving the country what they wanted.  Trying to shit on the memories of a couple dozen innocent children so that you can get some "reddit karma" is way worse than me pointing out why your posts get deleted.

       I don't think the motivation is to shit on the memories of kids.  It's to uncover a hoax, a psy op, people believe has been perpetrated on society.  If this is true it is a noble goal.

       And I seriously doubt people proposing this theory are fishing for karma.  There are about a million more topics one could get karma on.

       There's no hoax.  Children died.  Nothing happened.  Nobody declared martial law.  The army aren't in the schools.  Nobody took away guns.  We didn't even get universal background checks.  Nothing came of Sandy Hook at all.  There's no additional funding for mental illness.  There's no investigation into what medications the kid may or may not have been taking.  Nothing.  Just a bunch of people who try to be CSI detectives from behind a keyboard.  There is not a single noble thing in what these people do by continueing to post the same information over and over again, like magically it's all going to change, Obama will walk out with a bunch of actors, shrug his shoulders and go "You got me
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ,  and I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you darn kids."  These people aren't actors.  This wasn't covered up.  EVERY video I've watched or link I've seen on this Sandy Hook crap has been debunked.  There ARE conspiracies out there.  But you guys obsess over these stupid ones that make you all look like you're wearing tin foil hats.  It isn't noble.  It's sad.  And yeah, it's pretty much trying to play to the people who will upvote this crap until it's finally deleted because it's been posted over and over again.  And then rather than reading or finding out WHY it was deleted, they'll post another thread decrying the mods and their censorship on a site that none of you own.

       Well, I'm not going to debate the Sandy Hook hoax right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But suffice it to say I don't think the motive involved guns (or at least it wasn't the main motive).  The main motive was the subject of this post; to make delving into hoaxes and conspiracies a taboo subject.  Your post is a good example of how this taboo is taking hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experience is different than yours.  Even on a sub devoted to inquiry into conspiracy theories this is one theory (and hoaxes in general) that gets downvoted and discouraged all the time.  Your type of comment is common and has the effect of chilling inquiry into these theories.

       My, you seem like an open minded fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
       But indeed, that is the clever and diabolical plan I suspect the perps pulled off).
      </p>
      <p>
       First, there were a number of red herrings designed to attract conspiracy theorists (like the initial false reports like the Principal giving an interview with the paper but she was later said to be a victim or the conflicting evidence about the number of shooters and the type of gun used, etc.).  Also, there was the whole Satanic angle that was similarly used to attract conspiracy theorists (Newton being a hub of Satanic activity and even a field next to the firehouse and school
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSMGcXgQT84">
        having weird symbols mowed
       </a>
       into it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you had universal media condemnation of citizen investigators like
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/09/the_worst_sandy_hook_conspiracy_theory_yet/">
        this
       </a>
       .  In fact, right from the beginning there was someone that was alleged to pretend to be a victim or something like that (I can't remember of the top of my head) and so they were preparing us for these 'crazy truthers and other opportunists' who would come out of the woodwork to take advantage of the tragedy and harass innocent victims and heroes.  Then even the authorities, the police spokesmen and others warned that they would  charge citizen investigators with crimes and even changed the law to increase the government's ability to keep information private.

       I like how when you can't defend your position, and it's made out that you have no REAL evidence that Sandy Hook didn't happen, or any of the countless insane conspiracies that are posted over and over here, there are 2 go-to responses.  Either "You're a sheep/blind/idiot and go away from here and stop posting" or "You're obviously part of the conspiracy."  Crappy Debate 101 says if you can't argue your point, attack the other side instead.  Frankly, if anyone is part of a discredit campaign, it's you, based on your responses.

       I specifically say I'm not alleging you are part of a conspiracy but yet you pretend like I am.  I can indeed debate evidence for the Sandy Hook hoax but this post has more to do with suppression of the Sandy Hook hoax theory.  This sub is dedicated to exploring conspiracy
       <em>
        theories.
       </em>
       Yet there are many blowhards like yourself engaging in chilling speech name calling and shutting down inquiry.  I theorized this was actually the motive of the conspiracy and by engaging in this behavior you are
       <em>
        furthering
       </em>
       the conspiracy, although you may not have been part of the conspiracy.  Do you understand the distinction?

       The OP claimed that there was a conspiracy because his threads were being deleted.  My original post was that the REASON they get deleted is because too many people post the same link over and over again, with NO new "evidence" of whatever they are posting.  THis so happens to be about Sandy Hook this time, but it can be about 9/11, Benghazi, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there's a distinct difference between inquiry and beating a dead horse.  Would we like to go back and re-address if the Earth revolves around the Sun?  Is the Earth flat or round?  Is the Earth 6,000 years old or not?  There's WAY too much stupidity on the internet nowadays.  It's the catch 22 of the internet.  Before, a couple lone nuts would sit in their mom's basement or a cabin in the woods and make all the tin foil hats they wanted and might be able to convince a couple dozen other weak-minded individuals of their claims.  Now, everyone can post on the internet, sound credible, and convince people that what they say is true immediately.  Again, just because there's a pretty YouTube video claiming something DOESN'T mean it's true.

       I don't know anyone on this sub read that blindly accepts a theory because there was a pretty YouTube video.  People that suspect a Sandy Hook hoax have reasons for their suspicions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you label it "tin foil" hat territory and think it's the equivalent of a flat-Earth argument doesn't mean people should be hounded or shamed into not discussing it.  Maybe you should have a little humility and figure that if there are so many people that persist on pursuing an idea that you find ridiculous maybe it's
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       that is making incorrect assumptions.  And what' the big deal?  Why can't you just say you find the theory very unlikely and ask for proof rather than brow beating people and calling them "weak-minded" and trying to shame them from pursuing this theory?
      </p>

       Not only are you rude and trying to chill the open discussion of theories here but you aren't making a very convincing argument.

       Well "nuts" is a derogatory term meant to discredit people that support a theory without actually disproving the theory.  It's the same ad hominem style attack you projected upon conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a flat Earth theory is more susceptible to proof than a hoax theory so it's not a good analogy to use.  Plus, I doubt there are really that many people that actually support a flat earth theory.

       You want proof that Sandy Hook happened? I'll start with thousands of hours of media coverage, witnesses, funerals, and police reports. And you'll disregard it in 3..2..1.....

       MSM lying, contradicting each other and themselves, reporting strange unofficial facts from nameless govt non spokespersons.
      </p>
      <p>
       witnesses, 'Uncle Gene' rehearsed his spiel, was seen by people looking for "his kids", lied about how long he had them in his house, was in two places at the same time, house and firehouse parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       closed coffin, no parental inspection, media circus event.
      </p>
      <p>
       polcie reports, late, redacted, no details on critical things like kids SSNs, birth certificates or death certificates, or even a detailed or brief biopsy of their deaths, ie number of bullets. contradicting stories of how many and what type of guns, where they were found, the condition of the AR15 (demilled), the non burnt carpeting where the gun was found on the carpet, the AR15 and the SIG have purchase receipts, the Gloch is an invisible gun.

       I don't have the time nor the desire to argue over the internet, but I would like a discussion. It seems like a lot of those things can be explained or are based on your assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could list names of people that were there and debunked rumors but I won't convince you. I will tell you I believe the official account and I understand that in the face of such a shocking and unfortunate event people misspeak or things go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the spirit of  truth seeking I would like to hear what you think happened and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you really think the whole thing was staged and that an organization hired actors and those actors, who supposed to be killed in a national tragedy, then went to the most watched event in the world?

       I take the middle ground.  It wouldn't surprise me if Veterans Today was controlled and engaging in disinformation.  But it's no worse, in fact better, than most MSM sources.  At least it's allowed to be truthier than the other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly it's no different than this sub if a substantial part of it is disinformation.  Yet  people still hang around trying to separate the wheat from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       On these subjects you should always entertain the thought that
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       news sources are controlled.  But it would mean you couldn't read anything if you never read the controlled press.

       So Gordon Duff is right that one must read between the lines.

       The "editor" is a Jewish Zionist.  Misinformation has always been their game.  I've held Veterans Today with much healthy skepticism.  Even their name is a ploy to create artificial backing.  They make up stories, they lie, and because if this, every single article they post must be considered suspect.

       What, and you don't make assumptions about the truth of a someone's assertions based on their political/philosophical outlook?

      <p>
       Seems like you have are very distrustful of conspiracy people or libertarian Ron Paul supporters (i.e. you're a conspiratard).  So you wouldn't hold it against a conspiracy theorist Ron Paul supporter if they "reported" on some event?

       Again.  Thanks for proving my point.  Also, I supported Ron Paul when I first heard about him.  Then decided not to after I read more on his views and past.  He has some great ideas with foreign policy and other things, but he isn't the savior of the country that some people make him out to be.

       Yeah, was this an attempt to counter, or just more of the same?  We don't make blanket statements.  We don't need to.  There are criminals walking in many organizations. This one, is quite easy to spot.  While he hocks fiction labeled as factual news.

       Conspiratard is so pathetic. Nice to see them showing up again, especially on this subject, which was one of the worst shams pulled. I hope Halbig blows this thing wide open.

       I know right? It's just a matter of time before they realize all the "kids" who were killed were actually just a litter of beagle puppies no one wanted. I mean it's obvious, I saw a YouTube video that talked about this beagle mom that had puppies right before the "incident" and the next day, no one knew where the puppies were. If that's not obvious this was a hoax, I don't know what is.

       My, you seem like an open minded fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
       But indeed, that is the clever and diabolical plan I suspect the perps pulled off).
      </p>
      <p>
       First, there were a number of red herrings designed to attract conspiracy theorists (like the initial false reports like the Principal giving an interview with the paper but she was later said to be a victim or the conflicting evidence about the number of shooters and the type of gun used, etc.).  Also, there was the whole Satanic angle that was similarly used to attract conspiracy theorists (Newton being a hub of Satanic activity and even a field next to the firehouse and school
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSMGcXgQT84">
        having weird symbols mowed
       </a>
       into it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you had universal media condemnation of citizen investigators like
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/09/the_worst_sandy_hook_conspiracy_theory_yet/">
        this
       </a>
       .  In fact, right from the beginning there was someone that was alleged to pretend to be a victim or something like that (I can't remember of the top of my head) and so they were preparing us for these 'crazy truthers and other opportunists' who would come out of the woodwork to take advantage of the tragedy and harass innocent victims and heroes.  Then even the authorities, the police spokesmen and others warned that they would  charge citizen investigators with crimes and even changed the law to increase the government's ability to keep information private.
