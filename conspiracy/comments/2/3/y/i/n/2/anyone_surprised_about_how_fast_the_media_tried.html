       He's getting the Ron Paul treatment. Call him a racist and forget about the fact the federal government actually does have entirely too much power. Bundy supporters and occupy protestors should realize, they share a common enemy here. I'm really disappointed in how gullible the public is.

       No. I am not at all surprised about that. He is a threat to their masters' agenda. What surprises me is how quickly Reddit took to supporting the smear campaign.

       They somehow managed to make one of the most liberal communities on the internet support dispatching a militarized police force to stop an elderly rancher from grazing his cattle on public land in a state that is 84% public land.

       Disappointing?  The reddit demographic is mostly far left progressives; they cry for this kind of stuff and ask for seconds.  "Racist" is literally, in their minds, the most derogatory insult one could use and "racists" not only deserve to die, but also to be tortured death.

       Given that it was presented as a partisan left/right issue, as well as an environmental one, I'm not. Not to mention, the only pro-Bundy arguments put forth by right wing media outlets were easily discredited, and you literally had to spend time doing independent research to figure out, say, the tortoise issue was bogus.  It has occurred to me (and some others I've spoken too) that this situation was used to discredit the issue of land abuse by the federal government.

       It's not like he was breaking federal AND state law for 20 YEARS or anything. This is completely out of the blue. He decided one day to walk his cattle across a broken fence and then the next day FBI knocking on his door! The feds NEVER warned him over those 20 years. Come on

       The more important fact is that the national media stirred up attention to his story
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       it was a story; they drove the armed protests to Bundy, not reported on spontaneous arrival of armed protestors.

       If he wants to be racist or prejudice then that is his personal opinion which you are absolutely free to have or not to have. That being said, the fact remains that the federal government completely overstepped their bounds. They rushed in like the cavalry and tried to intimidate even though, by law, they were supposed to have local authorities intervene when such an issue comes up. That is not what the feds did and they know it so they use the excuse that the guy is a scumbag racist trying to avoid paying taxes to justify their position.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely disagree with his personal mentality, but the guy is free to believe whatever he wants to believe. We all are, but that's just not the issue here. Plain and simple this was a smear campaign to discredit him.

       It certainly feeds into the notion that the Tea Party and militia types who supported him are racist pricks, but I suppose you'd have to ask Bundy why he decided to say those things to his supporters, because he apparently thinks those opinions have something to do with "federal overreach".

       I'm sure they have been through his entire background looking for anything they can find.  Doubt a rancher would have much of a colorful background.  This is the only thing they have. They will milk it for all it's worth.

       Not really, but apparently he said a lot of stuff that was anti racist as well.  Not all of his comment was aired though. Here's a link.

       No, I'm not surprised, truthfully though I don't see how anyone in this subreddit could be surprised though. It's been sort of obvious that the mainstream media is being controlled for years from my perspective.

       Painting him as a racist turns liberal public opinion from indifferent to vicious attack-dog status in a hurry, and that's exactly what Harry Reid needs right now.  There was way to much public support for this guy, so they are publicising his weaknesses than have absolutely nothing to do with the real issue so the public won't defend him unless they want to be labelled a racist.

       Not really. Anyone who publicly opposes the US government instantly becomes demonized in the media. But don't worry we are the freest, fairest, most equal, most prosperous, most enlightened, and democratic country in the world.

       People who are for individual liberty have to use this as a learning moment. We see that the talking point is if you opposes statism you are called racist so we have to be more diverse while at the same time preserving our principles. The other side will always try to distract away from our principles because that's our strongest point. We need to bring more diversity into the fold and refocus the attention on state corruption and oppression, statism's weakness.

       No but I am really surprised at the stupid comments on news sites people have written. I swear- I think some people deserve the depopulation agenda as they are too stupid to live. No one suspects a thing. They all jump on the moron bandwagon, never asking a question or suspect any propaganda.

       without putting on the blinders of him being progun/pro militia anti government bundy is a pretty repulsive person imo.  mooching off federal lands and ignoring the courts is really not something admirable.  being incredibly racist, even if its just the old timey racism, is the icing on the cake.  hes not a good person and certainly not someone we want to paint as a patriot but too many people will ignore everything else if someone is anti government these days

       So how's he mooching off public land? Your taxes cause the grass to grow? Seems like he's helping to fight desertification.

       I find it hilarious that ppl are still defending this guy. The Federal government have too much power but this story is in the mainstream for a reason. Hes either s shill who is being made to being a rebel for standing up to the Feds and ppl are up in arms about how hes being made into a racist to make it look like hes being set up. Same ppl focusing on this and go "its not about race" are idiots when its become cool to be anti establishment when minorities have been fucked for years and no one gave a shit and still dont so they make it look like ppl are being petty over
racist dialogue and both sides are guilty of this. They have cheapened the race card issue so much the real race issuea like private prison slavery is swept under the rug

       You know saying a politically incorrect word like "negroes" is different from wanting to throw them in to an incinerator?
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff bundy said in the video about being better off a slave basically applies to all of the middle class who are about to be either on gov assistance or on the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bundy's point is if you're a slave at least you're learning a skill. The government would rather you do nothing.

       Im not even arguing about that part. I know what the main stream is doing but its funny its always a white dude who is painted as the rebel especially since it became more popular to be anti establishment when brown and black ppl have been fucked for centuries and no one gives a fuck. Like even if we fixed corruption etc u really think black folks will be aeen as equals to ppl or brown ppl wont be killed by drones etc. So there will always be bigger race issues.
