<p>If he wants to be racist or prejudice then that is his personal opinion which you are absolutely free to have or not to have. That being said, the fact remains that the federal government completely overstepped their bounds. They rushed in like the cavalry and tried to intimidate even though, by law, they were supposed to have local authorities intervene when such an issue comes up. That is not what the feds did and they know it so they use the excuse that the guy is a scumbag racist trying to avoid paying taxes to justify their position. </p>

<p>I completely disagree with his personal mentality, but the guy is free to believe whatever he wants to believe. We all are, but that&#39;s just not the issue here. Plain and simple this was a smear campaign to discredit him.</p>

Hes either s shill who is being made to being a rebel for standing up to the Feds and ppl are up in arms about how hes being made into a racist to make it look like hes being set up. Same ppl focusing on this and go &quot;its not about race&quot; are idiots when its become cool to be anti establishment when minorities have been fucked for years and no one gave a shit and still dont so they make it look like ppl are being petty over
racist dialogue and both sides are guilty of this. They have cheapened the race card issue so much the real race issuea like private prison slavery is swept under the rug </p>
