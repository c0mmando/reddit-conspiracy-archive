       The study design also makes no sense at all. They looked at a database of health complications reportedly related to drug use over a 5 year period, 2, 000 of which (only 3% of the total database) were
       <em>
        reportedly
       </em>
       related to marijuana complications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 35 of the reported marijuana related health problems were cardiovascular complications (2%). 21 of those people who had heart complications also smoked tobacco, most of them heavily. Many of them had other health problems associated with higher risk for heart problems, and the association between marijuana and the cardiovascular complications is completely speculative in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really a worthless study, doesn't tell you anything. In fairness, though, marijuana does increase your heart rate, so logically if you already have heart problems you're probably at a higher risk for a heart attack if you smoke. But it's the same for sex or exercise -- if you have heart problems you're at higher risk for a heart attack during those activities too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the researchers themselves note; "The 35 cases described must be compared with the 1.2 million regular [marijuana] users in France"

       But MJ is also a vasodilator. So it increases your heart rate and dilates your blood vessels. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm no doctor. But doesn't the VD effect counter any negative cardiovascular effects.

       It wasn't even heart attacks, it was self reported congestion or sometihng like that. It was also based on people who smoke marijuana so it has nothing to do with the marijuana itself. Inhaling smoke is bad, who knew it?

       Yup.  Inhaling burnt paper or burnt dried tobacco leafs is not good for the lungs.  For this
       <em>
        study
       </em>
       to be more scientific they should only look at edible Marijuana.  Or only Marijuana users who smoke out bongs/glass.  And Marijuana users who only smoke weed, not combined with tobacco.

       That's fine, but as a former frequent smoker and graduate in cognitive Neuroscience i can assure you Marijuana does damage to the lungs, and 'alters'  brain function permanently(damage is not the right term for what it does to the brain in my opinion).

       Weed does this too. A good point to make though is that if weed gives you a heart attack then you were going to have a heart attack eventually anyways.

       It's funny how, when people have arrhythmia, they give them blood thinners which destroys the B-complex.  This increases heart attacks like-whoa.. but hey, NO STROKES RIGHT!?  Typical modern medicine.

       Try some hawthorn berry extract and magnesium, been shown to set heart rhythms straight.

       Science is for sale, not a shocker to anyone who is paying attention.  Of course, that makes us a bunch of Bible thumpers in the eyes of the "enlightened" believers of the faith of science.  heh

       The whole point of science is
       <em>
        not having "faith" in

       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>

       The literal definition of believe is "To accept something as true". Why would someone saying they believe in evolution make you cringe? They're not saying they believe it on
       <em>
        faith
       </em>
       -- maybe they looked at the evidence and decided it was true, therefore
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
