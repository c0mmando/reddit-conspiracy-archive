    <div class="md"><p>Woah....this is the first time I have seen anyone mention the dangers of aspartame. Hearing that word makes me emotional....I almost died my freshman year of college because of that bullshit synthetic sweetener. My migraines caused from aspartame got progressively worse to where I could not even get out of bed. if someone wants to hear the entire story I am happy to tell it. it also gave me brain fog so bad i would forget my own number....</p>

<p>i am glad there aren&#39;t too many people out there who are sensitive to aspartame though. i know bill gates drinks a lot of diet coke which has aspartame, but for thousands of people it actually gives them irreperable brain damage or gives them lupus or fibro at an early age. it many cases, it kills them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, the powers left to the US public are small and are diminished annually. If you were able to unite as little as 5% of the US population and get them to act cohesively, you might have a shot. If 5 million marchers showed up at DC calling for a Constitutional Amendment barring all forms of contributions to federal employees, you would have their undivided attention. Also, a coordinated campaign to convince Americans to withdrawal the money from their 401(k)s would cripple Wall Street and force the Federal Reserve to debauch the currency even further.</p>

<p>However, none of this is likely as it&#39;s actually fairly brilliant how the enslave us. By encouraging us to only care about our self-interest, they keep us divided. The carrot is hopium--hope that things will get better, and the stick is the felony record--get one and your middle class life is over. The more stories about surveillance and police malfeasance, the less likely most Americans will do anything, while they&#39;re getting bled dry. </p>
