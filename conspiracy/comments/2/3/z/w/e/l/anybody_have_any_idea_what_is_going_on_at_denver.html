        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I just left Colorado yesterday and as I was getting into the airport to leave board my plane I noticed the murals and the masonic capstone (I also noticed a lot of Mason temples in Colorado which given the mining history makes sense right?) Upon further research I stumbled across a few things talking about there being a secret bunker located at DIA. That underground there&#39;s a secret research facility.  That it&#39;s connected to NORAD and NIST. And that it&#39;s a safe haven for when/if the United states is attacked. Does anyone know or have any other information?  The whole story makes sense, I mean, if you&#39;re gonna be a giant bunker might as well start at the highest most fortified land then just dig as far as you can. I also read/watched about how they have a vehicle that can go from 1-14000 mph in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>According to a former construction worker who allegedly took part in the construction of an underground section on the Denver International Airport in the 90′s named, Stu Webb, a massive 2.5-3 mile long tunnel system exists in and around the DIA complex.</p>

<p>According to Phil Schneider, there are over 132 D.U.M.B.&#39;s that existed in the 90&#39;s. Most of these bases are linked together via massive dry underground tunnels. Schneider was an alleged geologist employed by the US Navy’s black Ops sector to help plan and aid in the construction of Deep Underground Military Bases for the government who was later found dead in his apartment after exposing this information.</p>

<p>a man was in the Denver Airport looking for the bathroom, he took an elevator, going down (obviously he was unaware of the rumors about the tunnel), he went in what he thought was the mens room, he claimed to have seen a huge urinal, meaning that it was way to big &amp; to high for a human size man to use, he was so freaked, he ran the hell up out of there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at the full mural, it&#39;s not really some NWO plot laid out. It&#39;s a big anti-war piece, so I don&#39;t put any weight behind that theory.</p>

<p>The big horse? Really creepy, but let&#39;s face it, everyone has shitty art in their house. Again, not something worth focusing on.</p>

<p>Now, as for the DUMB thing, the underground base...maybe. However, it&#39;s one of those double-fake-out names that you&#39;re just not sure about. Deep Underground Military Base. Ok, makes sense. DUMB....waitamminit....troll? But what if they made it a troll name to make people think it was a troll when it wasn&#39;t?! MY MIND!</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything going on at DIA, it&#39;ll be a tunnel. Forget the art stuff. Art is sometimes just art.</p>

<p>some hints: the aerial photos show a built (but buried) super-long runway among other buried features. they also show excavation over a massive area seemingly not related to the runways or airport. it was built a long long way from denver and denver already had a perfectly good airport that was handling the existing traffic fine. its shaped like a swastika...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I reread and came across the other day various maps and &#39;predictions&#39; made by a number of well-known and documented psychics (all &#39;off&#39;, incorrect in terms of their time frame - though I have found this often to be the case with psychic prediction in personal experience, that time moves and manifests at-the-speed-of-lived-life at quite a different rate in relation to what is &#39;seen&#39; psychically. The predictions and readings may be spot-on in terms of the content, but the timing is often way out). Many of these maps of the US and other nation-state geophysical configurations post the psychically predicted earth changes show a similar form; that in part, the west coast of the US will be inundated by water almost all the way up to Denver at some purported, but unknown, future date. The suggestion was that the Denver &quot;New International&quot; Airport was built in preparation for and on the basis of such a likelihood (this links in to stories of &quot;looking-glass&quot; devices being used under above-top-secret capacity and departments, to scan probabilities of timeline development, and making decisions and actions on the basis of such future reveals). This scenario may be partly related to such a development at that airport and its surrounds. You sound like you&#39;ve been looking into Phil Schneider&#39;s information and story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t come up with this stuff, these are psychics projections (with a high degree of inaccuracy in some of their track records). On the site I was looking at, which aggregated the varying maps, it was suggested this was one of the reasons that Denver airport had been made a significant centre, but it mentioned nothing of how this event would take place, its wider implications, and so on. Purportedly the US navy was using a modified map that incorporated the changed coastline already. The same maps showed massive scale change and coastline loss, everywhere, globally. True or false? I don&#39;t know. Perhaps the land in certain areas and regions would sink while other areas rise? I don&#39;t know. Is it possible? The planet is known to have gone through radical geological and climate changes historically. It is theorised some of these changes (pole shifts, floods, ice ages) are cyclical.  Perhaps an occurence like this could be as possible as much as any other proposed scenario these days is possible, as outlandish as it might seem (was 911 predicted as likely? The Fukushima tsunami and nuclear event? The scale of the surveillance state as revealed through the Snowden leaks? The sexual abuse network with global links that is slowly coming out of the woodwork?, etc). Again, I didn&#39;t make this up, nor do I necessarily align my own beliefs with such (I don&#39;t believe outright all I read, nor all I read online in particular). It&#39;s just another scenario and story out there, that linked in with OP&#39;s question. Perhaps that&#39;s something to go to the psychics websites with and ask them? (some of them are dead now though).</p>

But it was weird bc other videos were talking about how in places like DIA we are working with OWB&#39;s (other world beings) and that&#39;s how we have the technology we have.

    <div class="md"><p>Has been awhile since I looked into this specifically. I&#39;m aware of no hard evidence of the tunnels or the &#39;city&#39; and base alleged to exist (though photos and papers have reputedly been provided to some investigating this), only accounts and reports from various people, ranging from Schneider to some trades people and UFO researchers coming across anomalous phenomena (vents, physical structures, noises, budget mishaps, etc). I saw images of alleged smuggled photographs once online, but how are these to be verified as genuine?
Really its down to first-hand reports at this stage, and whether or not one believes such accounts. 
I don&#39;t think I came across the Dulce cages when I first looked into it. Sounds intriguing. </p>
