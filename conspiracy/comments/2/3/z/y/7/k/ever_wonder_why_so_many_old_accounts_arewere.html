       I think the only reason "certain subs"  still exist is because shitposting AI is still not 100%. I'm sure they're working on that. If only shills knew they'd lose their jobs to robots maybe they'd stop whoring themselves out and get real jobs.

       Most people don't even access Reddit using SSL. You have to be an anal bastard like myself to always type
       <a href="https://pay">
        https://pay
       </a>
       . in front of everything to even use SSL on Reddit. And that specific vulnerability requires one side or the other to peck-peck-peck to grab more memory/session keys to get anything of use.

       If Reddit warned users to change their passwords it means their system was vulnerable and most likely people knew about it and took advantage. If it didn't happen there would be no need for Reddit to acknowledge this flaw.

       No, if you are a responsible service provider and you use SSL and you use OpenSSL (if you are are a responsible service provider YOU USE SSL site-wide; not necessarily OpenSSL), you updated your openssl version and rotated your SSL key and told users about the flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is irresponsible in that it's 2014 and they STILL can't manage site-wide SSL. But they're responsible in that they realized that they do use OpenSSL on their servers and use SSL (god, i hope) when they accept your password, if not your session key) and they updated their version of OpenSSL and rotated their SSL keys and told everyone about it. If you logged out and in again during the likely 4-12 hours they were vulnerable with your password (i.e., not with a session key, which is likely vulnerable...all the time...), there's a remote possibility that someone using the exploit might get your password...but the likelihood is really, really remote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any proof that specific accounts were hacked? And that they were hacked using heartbleed? (Of all the things to use to glean individual account credentials, that's just silliness - for Reddit, running a cracker like John the Ripper with a good password list or just sitting in a coffee shop or university sniffing traffic would be faster and more effective.)

       That does not mean that someone stole your password using the heartbleed flaw and used it to log in and shill. It's so much easier just to guess your password, ESPECIALLY SINCE PRETTY MUCH NO ONE EVEN ACCESSES REDDIT USING SSL BECAUSE REDDIT SUCKS AT PROVIDING USERS WITH BASIC SECURITY.

       I didn't lose my temper, I used capital letters so that people reading this may better understand my points. Seriously, no offense, do a little bit of reading about the exploit itself, how it works, how it can be exploited, and you'll understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're more exposed by the fact that Reddit is not secure at all than you are by this specific bug. Not to say that this bug isn't a big fucking deal - it is - just not to Reddit, which was never really all that secure to begin with.

       Why would I take it like a man when I'm a woman? Chill and learn a little bit, eh? Read a little about the heartbleed exploit, what it is, and how it works. Then read about how, you know, Reddit doesn't use SSL site-wide and direct your energy into getting them to secure their site and our interactions with it instead of getting all pissy and spewy.

       I'm not wrong. It's easier to steal your password by guessing it than to steal it using the Heartbleed vuln, especially if you didn't log in during that 4-12 hour period and you don't use https to access the site anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done arguing with you because obviously you are too fragile and butthurt to do some basic research to back up your ridiculous theory - so fine, it's true: the magic heartbleed fairies stole your passwords and they're shilling under your account name and Reddit even admitted to it by being precautionary and asking you to change your password like every other affected web site did! Onward, extrapolator.

       But let's quit the derail - can you explain the proof you have of non-shills whose accounts were taken via the Heartbleed exploit and then became shilly? Or at least link to a couple? And the info that makes you think the accounts were pwned using that openssl vuln?

       Why not share them and the proof that they were pwned using the openssl bug? Or share with a security researcher to publish? Posting vague bullshit sounding stuff to the sub doesn't help the cause, but putting real info out does.

       If I wanted to share 1000 usernames I would have put it in the post. Putting real info out? Yeah, people get shadowbanned for that. Your refusal to actually investigate this and expect me to spoon feed you doesn't help your case, and makes you look like an amateur. I don't like indulging amateurs.

       So why is it that you think a bunch of accounts were hacked and used to shill using the heartbleed vulnerability? Why be such a jerk about it and why not explain more than "mystery solved." Mystery ISN'T solved, you haven't provided even a halfway decent theory, much less even a bit of evidence. Done arguing with you, because you obviously aren't able to either back up your theory with even cursory info.

       Easier to just create throwaway accounts in bulk.  Like your own account which is suspiciously only 5 days old for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I don't think most people don't use SSL for reddit, or bother with a secure password for it.  It's not like its your bank account or something.

       Throwaway accounts don't have years of history as cover stories. They're useless since people wouldn't take them seriously. Reddit uses SSL for authentication
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       . Besides, heartbleed is an option that was probably exploited since Reddit warned people to change their passwords. I'm sure brute force or other methods work just fine for those who don't care about secure passwords.

       You were reported for allegedly harassing this user. After reviewing your post history, I see I was in error in regards to the "shill" accusations, having mistaken you for another user who had made similar statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I see two seperate instances, in another thread, wherein you attacked this particular user. I also see he attacked you once in response. All offenses were removed and you were both warned prior, accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm going to have to ask that you simply avoid attacking other users, in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the post above:

       isn't quite a violation.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       could be a violation but is so minor I'm going to leave it, and again just ask that you refrain from attacking other users as you had prior, in another thread, and suggest (not demand, but ask) that you and the other user simply avoid interacting with one another if possible, as you clearly can't seem to agree on much and one or the other appears to typically escalate the situation unnecessarily.

       Well, you haven't in any way convinced anyone besides your votebots that you know what you're talking about re:heartbleed (you don't appear to even be able to speak to it or even defend your own claims, which is kind of weird), but you are apparently definitely an expert in not admitting you're talking out yer ays, haha. So good deal, persona_manager!

       If my premise doesn't make sense to you then you need to better equip yourself before getting into a debate about a subject you know nothing about. You're a waste of my time.

       I don't recall any admin saying that accounts were hacked.

      <p>
       The "immediately change your password" announcement was SOP for any website confirmed with the vulnerability. It doesn't confirm that any accounts were actually compromised.
