        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has reddit really become a weaponized propaganda tool, or are American redditors really susceptible to TV propaganda which is amplified and expressed on reddit?  One can &quot;earn&quot; extremely high upvote counts for posting any comment that implicitly/explicitly states:</p>

<ul>
<li>That Russia is <em>literally</em> Nazi Germany/USSR</li>
<li>That the US should &quot;defend&quot; against Russia (from Eastern European NATO countries)</li>
<li>That Russia wants to start WW3</li>
<li>That the US economy is invincible</li>
<li>That NATO is the best thing to ever happen to the world</li>
<li>That any alternative viewpoints can and should be promptly dismissed/silenced/neutralized</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously it is safe to say that the propaganda phase of the next world war is well underway, and de-escalation was a complete joke, both sides showing little interest in chilling out.  As for the comments in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, they are extremely detrimental to any de-escalation efforts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the hive-mind of the &quot;like&quot; generation. i find it very difficult to get through to anyone who watches a lot of T.V. the propaganda is so ingrained, so subtle, so pervasive, from news to soap operas to action shows. when you go to work, or socialize, everyone who watched the same news and shows are repeating the same opinions they&#39;ve been programmed with and you approve, because magically, their views are your views...</p>

<p>encourage friends and relatives to give up T.V. especially for their news. point out some of the worst propaganda when it is obvious. keep doing it until they get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is NATO putting a base on Russia&#39;s doorstep a &quot;good&quot; thing. What need is there to place one so close to them especially after promises were made when the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>How is Russia supposed to trust NATO when they keep surrounding them with basses close and closer.</p>

<p>Do you even know Ukraine was a fraction of the size it was; Russia gave Ukraine extra land because it was too small.</p>

<p>Russia proposed a very fair offer on the table 2 main points were; No NATO base in Ukraine and Ukraine becomes a Federation State. (All states run their own finances and feed money to the Government as opposed to all places give money to the Government and they disperse it as they see fit.) </p>

<p>There are places in Ukraine that produce the most money (Mining in Donetsk) but everyone is poor because Kiev takes the money and plays favorites of which location gets it.</p>

How long has the rightful state or Palestine been a f oveoy excluded and not granted a voting nation?  How is it had?  What a goddamn laugh.  The people at the helm now would have even more power.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what NATO is there for and what it does, and how its presence helped Europe from breaking out into another world war during the cold war? Are you completely ignorant of the fact that NATO guarantees allies and gives a very good fighting chance if a member state is invaded?  Have you even heard of the Bosnian war and the genocides that occurred there? What about other Yugoslav wars? Are you not familiar with recent history?</p>

<p>What does Palestine have to do with this?</p>
