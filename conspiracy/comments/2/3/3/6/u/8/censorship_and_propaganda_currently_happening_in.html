       As you might (or might not) know there are currently some demonstrations going on every monday because people are genrally fed up about the EU and Germany in particular being a vasall of the United States and it's industry complex as well as the FED and the official actions going on about the crisis in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It started with a handful of people in Berlin and several bigger German cities have joined. The demonstrations in Berlin have been constantly growing from a handful to appr. 3000.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are intended to follow the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_demonstrations_in_East_Germany">
        "Montagsdemonstrationen"
       </a>
       which led to the fall of the Eastern German government 1989/1990.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media here is trying to ignore them. Some papers have already started to vilify them as being interspersed with nationalistic right-wing groups. The old
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule">
        "Divide and rule"
       </a>
       game.

       On the left you see some PETA-activistsat the "Brandenburger Tor" in Berlin at 5:47pm yesterday. This was going through German media and reported by REUTERS. On the right you see the same place at 6pm the same day with the people from the Monday Demonstrations. This hasn't been shown by any media here.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Coincidally" all webcams controlled by state-tv and officals had a blackout during the demonstrations. In cities like Berlin, Stuttgart, Munich...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look on Google News for "Montagsdemonstartionen Berlin" (at least in Germany) you will find: nearly nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in what this all about I recommend you view a speech by Ken Jebsen. He is a former journalist of the German government media until he chose to quit because he couldn't stand being a tool of propaganda any more. He has been insulted as being a  Holocaust denier and much more after more and more people took notice of his show called
       <a href="http://kenfm.de/">
        "KenFM"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It is relevant for everybody in this world.
      </p>

       Lol holocaust denier.  I guess the smear campaigns try and stay relevant to each culture and their history.  But their aim is always the same... to discredit all of them.
