       Obama is going to lie to you about how we got to this point. He's not going to admit that ISIS is the result of failed US foreign policy and blowback from a century of imperialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is going to lie about the threats we face. He's not going to admit that ISIS is in no way a threat to the US, nor will it ever be. He's not going to discuss any of the other, better uses of American time and money that would save more lives or end more suffering. He's not going to discuss any alternatives to the 'tried and failed' strategy of "Hey, lets just blow up everyone we don't get along with".
      </p>
      <p>
       He is going to lie about the consequences of military action. He, like Bush, will assure you that it will be cheap and quick. That casualties, civilian and military, will be minimal. He'll promise us that the mission will be limited. He'll say phrases like 'protect freedom and democracy', 'something something the people', 'values', and 'no boots on the ground'.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is meaningless, of course. The promises will be broken, are made with full knowledge that they will be broken. As soon as the door is open to military action, as soon as 'the people' and congress approve anything, 'conditions on the ground' will change and the mission will be extended to the original objective of removing Assad from power and nation-building Syria (only this time all the trillions of dollars will be funneled to buddies of the Democratic administration rather than the Republican administration). And Congress and 'the people' will just have to watch in horror as America engages in another quagmire catastrophe. There will be no recourse as whatever bill Congress passes cannot 'tie the hands' of the president in the event that 'conditions on the ground' change. Once the door is open, Obama, and whoever replaces him, will be free to do whatever they want to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know what Obama will say. We know what Obama will do. The question is, how many people will buy what he is selling? Obama was supposed to bring us hope. My only hope is that 'the people' won't get fooled again.

       If by "angry citizens" you're referring to any sort of violent mob mentality, then that's just plain and simply stupid.  The type of "anger" that any citizenry needs is the type that's channeled toward non-violent,
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       intense action designed to topple, overthrow, and bring down the corporatocracy.  Violence is unnecessary if everyone were to put their/our shitty, indoctrinated, brainwashed problems aside as inconsequential, and all just came together as the one people we are and worked together to not be ruled over in the manipulative manner that is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything short of the people coming together as one on a national and global scale will not work - and no, I

       mean any stupid NWO b.s.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       type of "global union" is a nefarious one that's not designed to help the people and I'm

        not

       I can't say I'm doing it collectively, however.  I haven't gotten any sort of "Universal Collective" organization going or anything like that.  I just try to make sure and try to be as cool and loving to everyone I can be.  Not easy, of course, but even those I may disagree with, I disagree with or argue with them
       <em>
        as my brother or sister

       I wouldn't consider myself any type of person to lead any type or sort of "movement", however.  Heck, I feel this idea is one that

       Occupy seemed like more of a warning of what will happen if things don't change. It will just be worse next time. The zeitgeist movement seems to be the only other movement you can pinpoint.

       Very well, sir.  One hears "angry citizens", however, and the mind tends to go toward the "angry mob" mentality is all...and angry mobs are
       <em>
        rarely
       </em>
       non-violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Additionally - and to respond quickly to a comment you made earlier ("haha karma? just as bad as prayer... useless fairy tale stuff") - the universe we live in is a vibrating one.
       <em>
        We
       </em>
       ourselves are nothing more than vibrating pockets of energy.  Solidity is an illusion, and energy is ubiquitous and malleable.  Science (even as it so remedially manifests itself on this very primitive, extremely backward planet) has definitively shown and proven this.  It has also shown that the brain, being made up of that very same type of ubiquitous energy (and therefore functioning on an unbroken continuum
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       it) can communicate directly with physical objects that are at extremely remote distances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many tests (remote viewing and otherwise) have already been done proving this very thing for any critical or discerning mind to disprove or deny.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this in mind, although the logic and rational behind the phenomenon might be perhaps somewhat misplaced, what at times (but not always) happens when people engage in that thing called "prayer" is that the mind is simply focused and concentrated, and the act of focusing literally amplifies its ability to concentrate more energy
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       it - similar to the manner in which increasing a magnet's strength draws more lead filaments to it [or iron, as "dino" corrected below].  Drawing such energy into a properly concentrated and focused mind can accomplish things that a mind not so concentrated and focused will fail at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it be through "prayer" or any other type of direct concentration, there is indeed quite a significant, tangible effect that can take place, and one need not cater to any religious belief in order for the phenomenon to still be valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as karma is concerned, this is simply the manner in which
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion">
        Newtons Laws of Motion
       </a>
       , in conjunction with the law of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">
        Conservation of energy
       </a>
       actually apply themselves in the arena of human interactions and emotions.  Nothing "fairy tale stuff" about that, as the laws are universal and apply across the board - even in arenas we are as of the moment generally ignorant about.  It need not be looked upon in a any "hocus pocus" manner.

       Yeah, No. The laws apply to energy, not emotions and human interactions. The idea of Karma is just mankinds idea that the world is balanced overall, that everything has to have a balance. That combined with seeing significance in random events

       I think you mean "Sou

       ce?" - with an "r".  As I already mentioned - which, if you would have actually been paying attention to what I posted, you wouldn't have even bothered asking about - there are multitudes of tests that have taken place in the area of (but not limited to) remote viewing that have given great weight to the holographic nature of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some research on some of the remote viewing tests that have taken place.  It's all out there.  Google is your friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also research Quantum Nonlocality.  It shows even more clearly how effects in one location have been shown to have a simultaneous effect on literally the opposite side of the universe.  Sounds crazy, but individuals with minds
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       more studied than my own and with lots of fancy letters after their name have vouched for it and have published papers and won awards expounding on the subject.

       And what, pray tell, do you actually think "psychological effects" and "increased concentration and relaxation" are?  Don't close yourself by having such a limited view of what energy actually is.

      <p>
       Again, energy is
       <em>
        ubiquitous

      <p>
       There is literally nothing that energy

       .

       I disagree. I feel that most people won't be able to read the information objectively if it is being given to them by the person they are arguing with. If a person truly cares about truth and reaching a conclusion in the discussion, they should be happy to do their own research. Especially with the  internet. Information is infinitely, and easily accessible.

       That's ok if we disagree. I feel that if you make a claim it's your responsibility to back it up, otherwise people could claim anything and expect to be taken seriously. The other person would be constantly having to do the legwork to support other people's claims and why should they? If someone had to do research, even a quick google, every time someone claimed something online it would all add up to a lot of lost time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see why another person should have to find the evidence to support someone else's argument, especially when it's someone they're debating with.

       Not only did coreyapayne state my own general position on the matter in

        his response to you

       <em>
        both of you
       </em>
       in the middle:  I may not have held the previous poster's hand and spoon fed him the specific links, telling him
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       where he should look and who he should read about (and, in part, for the
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       reason payne mentioned), but I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       indeed give him the specific enough direction to look in with particular emphasis on certain details and areas of investigation.  If that's not enough for someone to get to enough of the specific areas of study to not only confirm what I mentioned but to show that I am indeed
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       coming in and "claiming anything and expecting to be taken seriously", then even spoon feeing someone like that the specific studies will do nothing but give him fodder for the already calcified bias he made hardily apparent.

       You're going to have to do leg work
       <em>
        anyway

       if you really want to get to the heart of certain claims even IF you were given specific information to research - definitely with regard to the information I'm talking about anyway.
       <em>
        And that's the whole damn point
       </em>
       that both I and payne have been implying:  The majority of the world is simply too lazy to do the work anyway regardless - so even if you DO hand them the information, they will generally be too lazy to do anything but slightly glance over even award-winning work before coming back with the "stock rejection" response that they likely already had cued up, on the ready, and formulated long before they even
       <em>
        looked
       </em>
       at anything given to them:  "Nuh uh.  This is a stupid study because..."
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, most of us humans are a

       dumber and
       <em>
        un

       critical than we think we are.  We are nowhere near as objective in our thinking as we might like to make ourselves believe.  We
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       we're critical thinkers, but in reality, most of us are blind sheep simply following whatever TPTB above us
       <em>
        tell
       </em>
       us to follow and
       <em>
        tell
       </em>
       us is the case.  As such, we simply tend to believe or not believe a thing - studies, trials, etc - only if some
       <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/27/why-are-these-fraudulent-papers-unretracted/">

        "peer-reviewed"
       </a>
       magazine or article that "looks fancy and legitimate enough" tells us to believe that such and such is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem with that general modus operandi is that there are a lot of things in the public forum expounded as "science" that are in fact absolute and pure trash - and even
       <em>
        purposefully
       </em>
       so - yet because they're put forth as "science" by TPTB to the public, the vast majority of the people not only unthinkingly take it in as gospel truth, but they spread and disseminate the bad information every chance they get to others.

       Ultimately, it's definitely important to be as wide-reaching as one can in their research of things - especially of things that the establishment's version of "good science" say are or are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       valid.  Knowledge acquisition is a dynamic and changing thing, of course, and as such, everyone's research and discoveries - most definitely my own included - change from day to day.  That being said, the previous poster ("Dino") does not seem to be at the point of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       inquiry sufficient to investigate some of the things spoken about here with a critical enough eye to objectively assess how his own personal and emotional biases are effecting the validity of the data itself.

       <p>
        I just don't see why another person should have to find the evidence to support someone else's argument, especially when it's someone they're debating with.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not sure if most of what happens here on Reddit (and even outside Reddit in life in general for that matter) is "debating" as much as it is pushing forward the agenda of one's own personal confirmation biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to do this myself - although I'm
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       I do and have at times done it as well, seeing as (last time I checked anyway) I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       appear to be human, and we humans
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have these "confirmation bias" tendencies and have to regularly check them.  It doesn't help either that TPTB here, again,
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that we are like this and manipulate almost every facet of society in a manner designed to keep us confused, separated, and at odds with one another.  I certainly try to keep as much of all this in check as possible, but it's definitely a very tough thing to do on a planet as difficult to live in and as rife with deception and chicanery as this one is, to be sure.
      </p>

       I get that the burden of proof for metaphysical stuff falls on the person making the claim. However, I feel nothing should be dismissed due to lack or evidence either.
      </p>
      <p>
       One should always be keeping their mind open for possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you try to stay open minded, after all, look what sub we're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting that people will lap up conspiracy with little proof but the same people are so quick to belittle metaphysical concepts.

       God will repay every injustice, in this life or the next: "Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." - Romans 12:17-21 ESV

       This does not relate to karma, which is an energetic theory of interrelationship and non-linear causation.  This quotation points to vengeance and fear being used to threaten human beings on behalf of or in the name of a deity.

       Well it's only really believed in reincarnation systems, in which karma is simply an observation of what it means to be all things at all times.

       The reason that ISIS is a "thing" is that our false-flag op pf deploying CW's in Ghouta, Syria last year (intending to blame Assad)
       <strong>
        FAILED
       </strong>
       . The British Parliament smelled a rat, and so did the US public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary goal (removing Assad and replacing him with an Israel-friendly puppet) has not changed, only the strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtually unheard of one year ago, ISIS has been built up as the new
       <strong>
        TERROR
       </strong>
       , but it is simply an excuse for intervention in the region... and
       <em>
        "hey, while we're over there anyway, why not crush Assad?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the primary goal in mind, and the SHIT that Obama says and the US does in the coming days, weeks and months will all be much easier to understand.

       Holy shit I feel like this is a legit conspiracy. These ISIS videos are so obviously bogus, and it seems like the US government is getting increasingly better at manipulating not only mass media, but online media as well. What a time to be alive.

       When I see a beheading video on the internet, I expect blood when someone is cutting your throat.

       Those videos were 100% newsworthy, English speaker, no blood or gore, it was like a pg13 and it looked like it was made for the sole purpose of being disturbing but mainstream media could show it.

       How about the fact that they don't actually show a beheading and the government in the UK was trying to tell people they could be considered terrorists for just watching it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two things should at least make you suspicious. Both videos have also been completely censored from youtube despite the fact that they do not show any gore and you can find other videos of beheadings all overyoutube.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all of that even liveleak said they won't be showing those videos despite the fact that they have never shied away from posting anything. That's what they are there for. To me this is obvious that there was government pressure on them to not host this video. I can think of no other reason they'd refuse to host a non-beheading video.

       I completely agree. When I heard liveleak was going to censor the videos, even though there is no gore, i was shocked. This is a major turning point in my opinion because live leak has always been known as the best non-censored video site. Like I said in my original post, the US government is getting damn good at online media manipulation.

       Well it must be pretty hard to find since neither of those links has a video or picture of a victim or Lanza there that day. I want tangible evidence, not a wall of text about a victim who won't even disclose any details. to quote the article, 
"To protect Hammond's privacy and that of her family, Sonski will not talk about her condition, prognosis or where she is being treated -- her family is in a self-imposed seclusion due to the barrage of media that has surrounded them. Sonski said she knows only the barest details of what occurred. Their visit was about a special sisterhood, and her desire to laugh with her friend once again."

       The article came out during the media circus of the event.  If I were in Hammond's shoes, I'd keep them all at bay too. I wouldn't sacrifice my privacy so those bastards could go sell it on the evening news.  What was done is done, she has a life of her own to live.  Of course Sonski doesn't know the details.  She wasn't there.  She's only a friend who supported Natalie Hammond.  If you keep digging, there is details about what happened to Hammond, what she experienced, and how she was injured.  Some of those details are right in the article you quoted.

       We live in a free society where we tote guns.  Sadly it's inevitable we have such tragic events occur.  It's that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes more sense that an unstable kid shot up a school for his own deranged reasons than it does our government staging the whole thing to institute a ban on guns.  Occam's razor is very appropriate here.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who declare it was a hoax base their conclusion on many many assumptions and conjecture.  By comparison, many innocent men have been wrongly incarcerated i prisons because of conjecture.  How are you so certain it was all a hoax without solid, unequivocal evidence?  It's all just rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence of what happened is in the 26 dead.  I'd like to see Sandy Hook hoax supporters make these claims face to face to these affected families. Tell it to their loved ones graves.  These are real people who were unlucky enough to be victims of one person's lawlessness.

       I never said anything of the sort; a better question is, why do you believe what every major news outlet released about that event? The burden of proof is not on the reader, it's on the news provider, and the "journalism" that took place that day was terrible.

       I think its irresponsible to suggest it was all a hoax.  Just because there wasn't a video of lanza doesn't absolve him from guilt.  How is it acceptable to extrapolate an entire theory of a hoax based off no video?  He had access to guns, walked onto campus, killed 26 lives, then killed himself.  I'm not sure why that's so inconceivable.  So what's the alternative? That he was framed, didn't act alone, and was orchestrated by the gov't to push a gun ban agenda? That's taking it too far and a disgrace to the families that this kind of rhetoric is being entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, there are 26 dead at the hands of lawless man.  Plain and simple.  All this flimsy conjecture and assumption is near baseless. Its good to question the narrative, but to take it too far and imply assumptions as truth is being irresponsible rationally.

       Plain and simple, huh? You are the one who originally just googled some articles to try to prove me wrong, obviously didn't read the articles that you linked until I called you out on your bullshit, and now you are simply regurgitating what CNN and FOX says about the event.

       Wow, you're misconstruing or not digesting what im saying. 
I already said its ok to question and be skeptical about what happened.  Its the hoax, and government conspiracies that imply Sandy Hook was one big phony show that I have a problem with.  Some even say the dead aren't really dead, that they're actors.  This is my point.  Its irresponsible to spread such outlandish theories based on flimsy conjecture.  I'm not regurgitating anything, but merely using common sense and applying Occam's Razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your uppity response is a perfect example of the rhetoric conspiracy theories employ. I'm not sure what BS you're referring to.  I think you're intentionally ignoring certain facts.  It is known Hammond was injured in the attack, the article even details where she was wounded, and hospitalized as a result. She even saw Lanza for herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       and I'm not a shill.  Just an everyday person who isn't willing to subscribe to fantastical ideas without unequivocal proof and will refute misstatements.  For example, the poster said "no one" was injured, when in fact there was 2 injured.  Not sure what got your panties in a bunch.

       Yeah, thanks for the link. Based on this info, and some comments from representatives that Congress wouldn't dare vote on military authorization until after the elections, by which time all the hysteria will have died down, I now suspect that Obama's speech tomorrow won't be to sell us the war, but to inform us that he has already started it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Good evening, America. We have all been shocked by recent beheading videos. ISIS is a terrible threat. On this eve of the anniversary of 9/11, we can't let people threaten us. That is why, this morning, with the cooperation of Denmark, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates, I signed an executive order authorizing a bunch of military stuff in the name of self-defense. A lot of you won't like it, but fuck you. I'm out."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, tomorrow we get to learn that Obama has already penetrated, but 'just the tip'. And that will be enough for him to escalate the situation to such a degree that if he ever has to bring the matter to congress next year, they will have no choice but to vote to go 'balls deep'.

       Easy there, tiger. What I meant was that people should realize that politicians lie to them. If they (wait for it)
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       that maybe politicians aren't telling them the truth, things might change for the better for everyone. Apathy is saying, 'Well this time wasn't so good, but gosh darn, the next guy will be different!' and then getting raped without KY.

       That's what people will read in your message.

       Accept it means, apathy.  Realize it and say something is a totally different message but achieves what you are saying.  Consider every message, we may not always see it but we have apathy for this world built in to us now.

       Many of the older generation were brought up with a media that actually reported news, not one that is used to instill fear and apprehension. At the facility I work at, the old timers repeat Fox narrative around the breakroom tables, and view us whippersnappers as out of touch.

       Yes it does. And the beginning of the change will happen when we realize that these politicians are dealers in words, soothing our collective egos and helping shape narrative. Which is why I say, we should come to the acceptance that when they are speaking, it's not because they are on our side, or because they love freedom and our best interests, it's because they want us to believe their nonsense. In that context, acceptance would be good.

       People don't even understand they're being used.  You tell them to accept it, and we slip deeper into our cozy bed.  Considering how long it has been with this collective apathy, I disagree with what I see as helping people be more comfortable with their current place.

       He's going to speak about his "strategy" to fight ISIS. He's gone from saying they're not threat, to a "junior varsity group", to they're are a threat, just bombing them will contain them and they can be contained, to they cannot be contained a few days later, and now that we need a strategy to defeat them and they are an imminent threat. All of these statements took place within, a believe, a five week period.

       How do you call al Qaeda not a threat or a junior varsity terrorist group when they've only been renamed? Hell al zarqawi founded Isis. I don't get why we call them Isis besides Islam being named..

       Classic doublespeak shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly because only a portion of the average population hears each thing he says. So when he says "ISIS isn't a threat," they sigh with relief and continue their daily jobs. A week or two later, they hear "ISIS is a threat to the United States" and various other war rhetoric, and they get scared, and jump right behind him.

       I met a woman at a party in Arlington who had worked in the Reagan administration.  She told me:  the president is just a PR guy.  He meets every Weds afternoon with representatives of the major banking families and is given his orders.  It's his job to sell their plan to the American people.

       I disagree. Not because they are a threat, but because a false flag will most likely occur in the near future, which will be blamed on ISIS.

       Maybe that's the "conditions on the ground have changed" moment? He says "They're not a threat to us, we have the greatest military in the world." then boom, dirty bomb in Manhattan during rush hour. Now "conditions on the ground" have changed and not only are we fighting harder in Syria to stop them, but now we're fighting on American soil to find the ones responsible.

       At least that'd be a reason for the massive militarization of the police, and the limited responses (body cams) to calm the populace.

       I want you on the first ride over. Have fun. Anyone that supports this looming invasion,go yourselves. This is why we need a real democracy. You vote for it,you go fight. If you are an old shit,you cook the meals or clean the toilets.I have no problem fighting a just war, I can't even laugh at this shit anymore. Who gives a flying fuck if you don't agree with sharia law? Who gave you the fucking right to tell people how to live? If the fucking people over there have a problem with it they can handle it. We are not the fucking world police. Yea sharia law sounds like horseshit,but to me Christianity is far worse,and I would never try and kill a church goer or ban anyone's practice of worship. Kosher practices horrify me,but who the fuck am I to say you can't do that. Horrendous things happen on your own soil everyday,how about we start there first.

       Christianity has been around longer and responsible for many more deaths,just because it has cleaned up its act a little recently doesn't mean anything to me. Christianity has affected my life in many negative ways. Sharia law does not effect my life or anyone I knows life in any way. Christians are holding back the human race,and scientific progress in the good ole USA. It is an opinion. I live in Louisiana and nearly every bible thumper I meet are the absolute worst people I have ever had the misfortune of speaking to. Racist homophobes that ignore common sense in the name of,well you know. And I don't care about arguments that they are all not like that. I know. My experiences with the majority of them have been unpleasant to say the least. I have to deal with them,not extremists living on the other side of the planet. How many people have been tortured and murdered in Jesus Christs' name? One mans beheading is another's lethal injection. It's all bullshit to me,I just feel that Christianity is winning the numbers game,but who knows a couple more centuries and maybe they will give them a run for their money.

       I would hate algebra,in your analogy,not the teacher or students. By your logic I should hate the priests,the pope,etc. I don't hate anyone,let alone Christians or Muslims. I hate anything that teaches someone to kill in any name.It isn't my problem that people get the dogma wrong or right. You are familiar with the crusades right? Church sanctioned killing. The people I refer to bring up the bible with the hateful statements. Christianity is at the heart of it. They have beliefs,just like the extremists,that maybe get the message wrong. Instead of live and let live,we have people in office right now in Louisiana that are taking away abortion rights because of Christianity. And when calculus starts getting kids to kill in algebras name,I will hate math too.

       You asked why I thought Christianity was worse. It is responsible for more deaths and suffering on this planet in my opinion. Potato,tomato. Math=Christianity in your analogy. The teacher wasn't preaching Christianity,the teacher was teaching math. I might be wrong,but no one is born knowing what the fuck a bible is. It is taught. Religion is holding the entire planet back. Just because the church would rather fuck children instead of killing them at the moment doesn't whitewash thousands of years of atrocities. I'm not going to respond anymore,because this thread isn't about that. Goodnight and good luck in the afterlife

       Oh we definitely can be fooled again so soon. The majority of people I work with on a daily basis are of the notion that we need to be over there taking care of the "ragheads." And that's all they need. As long as the majority supports them, they aren't worried about the minority because we've been so complacent for so long.

       Wayyyyy different than Bush.   Obama wasn't a Harvard grad with a poor ability to keep promises that contradicted his donor base,  an inability to pull out of fights or prevent new ones, and he certainly would NEVER, EVER, endebt the country trillions of dollars on a failing political agenda that requires an increasing amount of unconstitutional power, due to losing the war of popular opinion.  These guys are totally different.

       Right, so we should just sit back and do nothing and let ISIS run amok in an already unstable part of the world?  Let them continue their atrocities of killing, raping, and maiming civilians?  Or is that all just a "show".

      <p>
       Let's just sit back and do nothing.  Especially after we were part of the reason for their uprising?  We have the responsibility to diminish their wrath, if not reduce them to geopolitical insignificance.  If anything, Obama is attempting to clean up what

       You're missing the whole point of having the responsibility of cleaning up what mess you helped create.  Put yourself in Obama's shoes.  If the President before you unjustly invaded Iraq under the false guise of pre-emption before their "weapons of mass destruction" would fall into the hands of terrorist cells; then accept it was all a mistake and made a stable Iraq into a volatile Iraq, don't you think you have the responsibility as the sitting President to clean up this shit storm?  That's the reasoning behind Obama withdrawing our troops from both Iraq/Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore he understands that we destabilized Iraq, giving rise to ISIS Not to mention power grabs and unwanted influence by Iran and Syria.  With this understanding that we fucked up their country, we now have a responsibility to help stabilize it so Iraqis can move forward.  This responsibility includes dealing with ISIS.  Our foreign policy
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       changed in this sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't all about "corporations and banks controlling their resources", or "the military industrial complex lining their pockets".  If that were the case, don't you think we wouldn't have withdrawn?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       geopolitical and ethical issues we're facing, with real consequences we must address.  We made a mistake, now we're trying to clean it up.  Simplifying our nation's actions based on conspiracy wouldn't be looking at all the issues comprehensively.  When you do that, you're only contributing to rhetoric and cheating yourself from understanding.

       You can keep saying that for every president and nothing will change. Obama and Bush have the same friends, many of the same cabinet members and advisors. I think it's naive to think that it's because of Bush. IMO he is a continuation.

       It seems you'll need to bolster your understanding of how the Presidency works.  When a new President is elected, they appoint an entirely new cabinet and slelect a whole new set of advisers.  Obama's administration was completely different from Bush's.

      <p>
       On the contrary, it's naive to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       understand Bush got us into the Iraq mess.  You'll want to brush up on your history.  Like I mentioned, it was Bush and the Neocons who pushed for an unjustified and unnecessary invasion of Iraq.  At the turn of the century into the early 2000s, Iraq was already the United Nation's bitch.  They were economically handcuffed because of sanctions handed down by the UN as a result of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and general middle east aggression toward neighboring countries.   So the US led the way in pushing him back into Iraq from Kuwait (Operation Desert Storm) and called for international sanctions as a consequence for his actions.  His airspace was even controlled by the UN, oil exports were blocked, and he was forbidden from assembling weapons of mass destruction given his history of aggression.  We had him in check.  At the same time, Hussein continued to keep his own country in check.  He had all the power and ruled with an iron fist.  No sectarian violence, no civil war.  Iraq was still stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after 9/11, Bush's administration were desperate to show that the United States wouldn't take the attack lightly and
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       was going to pay.  His administration lied about weapons of mass destruction that Iraq allegedly developed and were hiding and also lied about an Iraq/Al Qaeda connection.  Ultimately, it is widely accepted that none of this was true.  They made a boogeyman out of Hussein and Al Qaeda as a pretext for pre-emptive war.  So despite a worldwide consensus that the US shouldn't invade Iraq, we did anyway. Because we're 'Murica and you don't mess with Texas.  It was a knee jerk reaction to help shape Bush's "tough stance" legacy and establish "pre-emption" as his foreign policy.  Ever since we invaded Iraq, we completely destabilized their country and wasted billions upon billions of dollars trying to rebuild the nation.  We were stuck in a slog, a quagmire.  Bob Woodward's and Thomas Rick's books document all of this thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you have Obama who's elected and wants to change direction knowing what a huge mistake invading Iraq was. He withdraws our troops from Iraq and Aghanistan, and wants to address the ISIS situation since they're a product of Iraq's instability which the US created.

       There has been change, and positive steps in the right direction have taken place.  But the ultimately change we all seek in our hearts won't happen overnight.  We're human and it's in our nature to fuck up.  There's a process.  It's an evolution right?  Just like anything in life.  There are people in power who don't have the ethical fortitude to do what is just, and instead get drunk on their own influence and ego.  Sometimes those people's policies and choices influence the nation and world in economically disastrous and deadly ways.  But you also have sincere, intelligent men and women in the political process who are genuinely fighting for our behalf.  Elizabeth Warren is a perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes years, sometimes decades to learn from mistakes and try to correct them before moving forward to the change we all seek.  Our "democracy" isn't perfect.  We're fumbling through it, and picking ourselves up along the way and trying to get to a better place.  It's pessimistic to think nothing will change.  Harboring such an attitude only perpetuates pessimism and impedes true progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is doing the best he can.  He was dealt a shitty hand from Bush's Presidency, and believe it or, has initiated change.  Maybe change isn't coming as swiftly as we all would like, but at the very least, he's taken the initial steps away from the ineptitude that plagued the prior administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like someone who's abused alcohol for years.  That same person isn't going to change overnight.  There's a long process involved in becoming clean.  Or at least being able to control alcohol to where it's manageable enough where you can pursue what makes you happy.  If you have a pessimistic attitude about falling down, you'll never get back up.

       I entirely understand that Bush got us involved Obama did nothing but lie and continue Bush's policies. We still torture, we still spy (probably more now)we still do all of that stuff and we're still eager to use our military whenever possible and of course I understand how the presidency works, Obama associates with the same groups that Bush does. This is ridiculous, nothing real has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm entirely optimistic, I just think it takes time...but that doesn't change the fact that nothing has really changed and in my opinion, there getting worse. Were going to hit rock bottom soon to borrow from your alcohol comparison. And no one cares at all.

       I'm willing to agree that we may still torture.  Guantanamo could back that statement up.  There might even be special ops "black torture cells" peppered throughout the world that we administer.  So we're on the same page there.  But I would argue that Obama does want to close down Gitmo, it's just taking such a long time because of the complex legal issues involved.  I also would not discount that Obama would secretly retract these black cells without admitting they exist.  Maybe not all of them, but I could see him significantly reducing them.

       Come on, let's be honest here.  You don't think withdrawing our troops from Iraq/Afghanistan was a real change?  The fact that our brave men and women don't have to be deployed away from their families time and time again isn't a step in the right direction?  I could also bring up other policies Obama has executed that were a positive change, but that's a whole other discussion.  He isn't perfect.  Like we both acknowledge, real change takes
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of work, patience, and time.

       I would have to agree that our domestic situation in the United States is becoming worse.  We have the largest income disparity between rich and poor in the history of our nation, Wall Street has run rampant since Clinton signed the Glass-Stegall Act, our education system is in a horrible condition, healthcare still needs a lot of work, and our infrastructure is falling apart to name a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       hope.  The Department of Justice recently settled and fined CitiGroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan to the tune of 50 billion for their role in the Mortgage fraud crisis.  Also Elizabeth Warren just called for those irresponsible Wall Street Bankers to serve jail time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baby steps.  I'm not quite convinced we're gonna hit rock bottom soon.  There's still time for the US to pick itself back up.  But I will concede that the outlook is daunting and can seem bleak.  There's truth in saying that "no one cares".  A lot of us are too concerned with our superficial lives that we don't take the time to learn what's going on, or educate ourselves.  It's hard to do when mainstream media is battling to shape our minds.  It's hard to do when we're distracted by TV, video games, movies, celebrity culture, acquiring possessions.  Weapons of mass distraction man.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, don't count us out quite yet.

       I agree with you that there is hope. I just don't believe it will ever come from the president, it will come from people getting fed up. In my opinion, the only changes have been minute and don't make a difference in the grand scheme of things...you're assuming that I am not aware of what's been happening. I am, it just doesn't appease me in the least

       Yep, the President is only one man and does have limitations.  It will also take synergy from both houses of our elected congress, a knowledgeable and
       <em>
        engaged
       </em>
       citizenry to keep them accountable, an ethical and
       <em>
        responsible
       </em>
       corporate ethos, and a dialing back of our defense spending so that we can invest in education, health, and infrastructure.  There's a lot that needs to be dealt with, but with so many people involved in debate and posturing, itll take time.  The changes seem minute, but we have to start somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't assume you're not aware of the general zeitgeist, but focusing too much on the corruption and bullshit that plagues us as a nation can disable our ability to solve problems.  Acknowledge our shortcomings, hold those irresponsible players responsible and lets move forward.  We can't afford to be completely cynical.  It'll will just turn into apathy, and we can't afford to be apathetic.

       I hear you...i generally just brush it off when im not discussing it...when talking to people inside the the box you need to talk/think inside the box....but outside of political debate i sort of view it as a big game and the same players are always winning if you know what i mean. I feel like the only changes we get are changes that dont really effect the people in charge. Smll things to satisfy the masses but they really dont matter in the grand scheme of things. Dont misunderstand me, im hopeful but my hope is in no way focused towarss the system...i think we need to a new system, at is point it would be easier to replce the system than to go through 150 years of gradual erosion to our rights and choices. Hopefully im making sense....i just dont see any point playing within the paradigm. Life has become a game, but only because we dont think to leave the gameboard.

       Would it really be

       though?  Realistically, we can't just
       <em>
        replace

       the system.  The reality is that if any real change is going to transpire, it will be a process that will be long and arduous.  An evolution.  It may take another couple hundred of years. or maybe another thousand before we get to where we want to be as a human species.  So what do we do now? We work within the current system to try and reform it into something different.  Maybe a completely different paradigm.  The point is that we have to
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       and fight to where we want to be.  It isn't enough to say that we need to change the paradigm but not engage in the existing one to change it.

      <p>
       That is a pessimistic view.  It sounds like you've already accepted that there's nothing we can do, and that our rights and choices will be stripped from us.  As if you've given up.  How are you so certain that our rights and choices will definitively be stripped of us?  It's this attitude that will only perpetuate a pessimistic view.  If this is our only attitude, then we're as doomed as you say.  But like I mentioned, if we keep fighting for what we all know is a better place for our humanity, then we must just might have a chance and 150 years from now we'll look back and be proud of how far we've come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like how we look back now and realize how we advanced from ending slavery, gaining equal voting rights for women, the civil rights movement, gay rights movement, banning nuclear proliferation, etc. etc.  The system can work for us.. it's just that we're living through a time where the system has become selfish and unethical.  But that doesn't mean it can't change for the better of the whole.

I just don't even care about the system anymore. I understand where your coming from and basically felt the same until this past year....but now I just don't see the system as necessary. We know what we want. Why should we he required to use this horrible system to get it. like that Einstein quote, something like'you can't solve a problem with same consciousness that created it.

       Show me credible sources of this "growing pile" of evidence that the US runs ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is an organically grown Sunni Muslim caliphate that has it's origins in the Iraq insurgency which eventually spilled over into the Syrian War.  That's why they currently control large swaths of Sunni Iraq and encroaching upon Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm not sure where you're getting this idea that it runs amok because we want it to.  ISIS exists for it's own extreme Muslim political pursuits in a region that has grown increasingly hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be more appropriate to argue that ISIS exists as a result of the US invasion of Iraq.  But I don't subscribe to some conspiracy that the US directly controls it's agenda.  Show me evidence.

       ISIS declared it would not recognize state boundaries, and has taken control of Sunni lands in Iraq, and as of 2013, Sunni lands in Syria.  They have since joined the Syrian and Iraqi territories they hold and named themselves the Muslim authority in this area.

       Well sir, you just like millions of others, billions, talk like a real peasant. A confused peasant who still thinks he has something to offer and some influence to make in what the King is going to do. Because they 'sold' you all the lies and you 'bought' them a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you purchase the 'illegals' coming over the border in swarms? Did your peasantry approve of that? Did a majority of your peasant cohorts approve of this and were they sold on this in advance and now are clapping their hands above their heads in awesomeness?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which percentage of peasants is all excited about Obamacare? Which percentage of peasants is excited about an exponential growth of contract/temp jobs and complete annihilation of full time positions with benefits soon to come?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which percentage of all those Obama Hope for Change stickers from his campaign are still on the road today?
      </p>
      <p>
       If approval rating is 'all time low' under 40%, as you peasants like to watch those numbers as they are the lord himself, what kind of approval will you expect from his future actions? You expect something good? After you are lied, not just the million times from this guy, but a trillion times from all the other guy that are 'the government' all the time. How can you talk like that man?!
      </p>
      <p>
       How many times does your peasant ass needs to be impaled with a pineapple before you stop talking like that?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say, do not buy this type of talk that continues to sway you in a wrong direction. Distance yourself from such. It is like being hypnotized and running in circles.

       Your condemnation is a bit too much "they, they, they" as opposed to "we".  It doesn't matter that you may not buy into the obvious government rhetoric bullshit.  You're
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       as much a part of that shitty system as the least of us "peasants".  We're
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       pieces of shit as far as TPTB are concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're definitely very much correct in that the system
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed trash - yes.  However, your life is as effected and even
       <em>
        supporting
       </em>
       of that shitty system as are many others.  You drive a car, don't you?  You put gas in it, right?  You go to the grocery store and support the corporations selling what you put in your body.  I bet a good portion of your clothes - if not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of them - can be traced back to a corporation and/or a sweat shop somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's my point here?  Am I condemning
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       ?  No.  I'm not.  I'm no different than you or anyone else.  And, I guess,
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       my point.  We are all at different stages of understanding and evolution.  You seem to be more aware than others of how shitty this system indeed is.  That's good.  However, know that we're ALL in this together and we're ALL "scum" and "useless, expendable chattel" to those calling the shots at the upper levels of manipulation on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all in this together and should help one another get out of the muck as much as possible while trying to mock, chastise, and/or condemn each other as little as possible.

       If you think that
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       president in the history of this country - or at least definitely in the past eighty plus years - was not a bought and paid for puppet shill for the global multinationals, then you simply haven't been paying any attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much that Barry's the worst president ever.  It's that the global lie that the corporate system he's the CEO of has
       <em>
        always been
       </em>
       is simply getting more and more obvious to everyone every day.  The only difference between him and all the CEOs before him is that the system he's the spokesperson for is a lot more obviously a corrupt machine now than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all been bullshit, essentially, and that Soetoro just happens to be the current puppet doesn't necessarily mean that he's any worse than all the other puppets before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get it twisted.  He sucks for sure - yes - but they
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       pretty much sucked...and it's because THE MACHINE ITSELF sucks - not just the CEO spokesperson for it.

       People didn't want to go to war with Syria last time around if you would remember. There was mass outrage over the idea and they backed down. Now with this ISIS thing they have a enemy the public can get behind. Sure they are responsible for ISIS, and sure we still have no business going to Syria, or anywhere in the Middle East for that matter. But we have a boogeyman now. The public loves going after a bad guy. Now they can go do what they want, without the public saying no, and actually not just being indifferent about, but being all for it. They've manipulated the citizens into rooting for what they originally said they didn't want. The trick is getting the people to support your idea, without their support you risk people just saying fuck this, and not supporting the idea in any way, and not wanting to join and fight, and starting mass protests.

       I dont exactly think that's how its gonna go. From what I can tell so far Obama is not much of a wartime president. However I d ont keep up with politics as much as  I know I should. Im not saying that it has or has not been blown out of proportion. My best guess is that obama is gonna just say the same old same old or say some bs way of dealing with isis.

       I think you may have a brain tumor pressing up against your amygdala. You should probably go have an MRI done. If it comes up negative, and you still feel this way after you've sobered up, then I recommend you volunteer for military service so you can go heroically put all of ISIS to death. Please take pictures of your exploits and post them to Facebook.

       Who cares. We're fucked. either we're a slave or a dupe. Until the machine is done fucking us completely, we're fucked. Glad it's the first and last black president we'll have.

       puh-lease. its obvious in your comment that you don't like him because he is black. "Glad it's the first and last black president we'll have." don't get me wrong I don't like him either but to me its his politics i don't like. I actually supported him but now I really don't like him. So yes sir you are in fact a racist.

       Keep drinking the coolaid. THAT'S what'll kill you. al-Qaeda was formed by the CIA. ISIS was formed by the Mossad. The real terrorists you should be fearful of were elected by you. The more you educate yourself with in-depth research, the less afraid you will be of the bogeyman you have been told is lying under your bed. Time to grow up.

       How is this different from any other president in recent history? It's not. And the reason isis is even a thing is because we as a country can't keep our noses out of other countries business. Wahhh

       Yes it should, because it's true, and inevitable. We simply need to move past the false idea that society "needs" politicians (aka professional liars).

       Occupy seemed like more of a warning of what will happen if things don't change. It will just be worse next time. The zeitgeist movement seems to be the only other movement you can pinpoint.

       Your condemnation is a bit too much "they, they, they" as opposed to "we".  It doesn't matter that you may not buy into the obvious government rhetoric bullshit.  You're
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       as much a part of that shitty system as the least of us "peasants".  We're
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       pieces of shit as far as TPTB are concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're definitely very much correct in that the system
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed trash - yes.  However, your life is as effected and even
       <em>
        supporting
       </em>
       of that shitty system as are many others.  You drive a car, don't you?  You put gas in it, right?  You go to the grocery store and support the corporations selling what you put in your body.  I bet a good portion of your clothes - if not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of them - can be traced back to a corporation and/or a sweat shop somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's my point here?  Am I condemning
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       ?  No.  I'm not.  I'm no different than you or anyone else.  And, I guess,
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       my point.  We are all at different stages of understanding and evolution.  You seem to be more aware than others of how shitty this system indeed is.  That's good.  However, know that we're ALL in this together and we're ALL "scum" and "useless, expendable chattel" to those calling the shots at the upper levels of manipulation on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all in this together and should help one another get out of the muck as much as possible while trying to mock, chastise, and/or condemn each other as little as possible.

       That's what people will read in your message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept it means, apathy.  Realize it and say something is a totally different message but achieves what you are saying.  Consider every message, we may not always see it but we have apathy for this world built in to us now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all my parents have ever said.  Nothing you can do, just accept it....yadda yadda yadda......standard response from people who don't know how to think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts with the right kind of talk.  It starts with the kind of talk that makes people think about the situation not simply just accepting a norm that has always been but doesn't have to be.

       Yep, the President is only one man and does have limitations.  It will also take synergy from both houses of our elected congress, a knowledgeable and
       <em>
        engaged
       </em>
       citizenry to keep them accountable, an ethical and
       <em>
        responsible
       </em>
       corporate ethos, and a dialing back of our defense spending so that we can invest in education, health, and infrastructure.  There's a lot that needs to be dealt with, but with so many people involved in debate and posturing, itll take time.  The changes seem minute, but we have to start somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't assume you're not aware of the general zeitgeist, but focusing too much on the corruption and bullshit that plagues us as a nation can disable our ability to solve problems.  Acknowledge our shortcomings, hold those irresponsible players responsible and lets move forward.  We can't afford to be completely cynical.  It'll will just turn into apathy, and we can't afford to be apathetic.
