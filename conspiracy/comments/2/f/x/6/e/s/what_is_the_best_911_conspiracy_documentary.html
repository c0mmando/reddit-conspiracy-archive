    <div class="md"><p>It just premiered in Detroit last week and it&#39;s only available to purchase, not online yet. It&#39;s good to show someone who is on the fence about 9/11 conspiracies as it talks about the director&#39;s emotions as he uncovered the truth and deals mainly with scientific facts rather than the who and why part of things. There&#39;s not much new in it but it&#39;s very well put together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a link to another comment that dealt with it. 
If the foundation of the theory falls apart, then the rest goes with it.  I am not really interested in getting into a debate here.  One thing I learned about this sub is that you can debunk EVERYTHING someone says using accurate and independent sources, and someone will just come up with a crazier idea.  Conspiracy theorists don&#39;t have &quot;theories&quot;  they a Semi-Religious beliefs that they will defend even after all logic is evaporated.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps there are some conspiracy theorists that are myopic ideologues, I am not one of them. The last thing I want to believe is that there are powerful people that will use black ops to murder innocents for cause to start a war. I&#39;ve gone back and forth, and argued your exact perspective. I&#39;ve read all the debunking material I can get my hands on. But in the end I know that I&#39;m logical, and that I am motivated by trying to determine the truth the best that I can. It&#39;s this unfaltering belief in the State that I see as a religion.</p>

<p>This comment...sure, maybe the theorists have NORAD all wrong, but to pretend that debunking this proves &quot;progressive collapse&quot; is what&#39;s illogical. I have a scientific mind, and what NIST has ultimately done is unscientific. It&#39;s not up for review, it doesn&#39;t answer big questions, and parts of it&#39;s research are kept secret from the public. </p>

<p>The narrative that you believe was constructed, and is incongruous with what thousands of policeman, firefighters, and civilians experienced on that day. To me that&#39;s a semi-religious ideology that you&#39;re willing to defend in the face of logic. </p>

<p>And you say you&#39;re not willing to debate because... Why? People don&#39;t capitulate to what is so clearly inside your brain irrefutable fact? Guess what, you&#39;re...nobody. As am I. We&#39;re talking about one day exploded and buried by the past. You know nothing more than anyone else about the truth. But by all means share your &quot;independent sources,&quot; I would very much like to be proven wrong, as my ego is not wrapped up in any one belief or interpretation of history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the &quot;debunking&quot; is based around the negligence, impotence and inaction of the US government. The same US government that was repeatedly warned the attack would take place. In a <em>shocking</em> coincidence, the same government that ignored these warnings is controlled by the corporate entities that profited immensely on the wars that occurred soon after. </p>

<p>That&#39;s odd. Or very serendipitous depending on who you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a link to another comment that dealt with it. 
If the foundation of the theory falls apart, then the rest goes with it.  I am not really interested in getting into a debate here.  One thing I learned about this sub is that you can debunk EVERYTHING someone says using accurate and independent sources, and someone will just come up with a crazier idea.  Conspiracy theorists don&#39;t have &quot;theories&quot;  they a Semi-Religious beliefs that they will defend even after all logic is evaporated.  </p>
