       I think that either ww3 or a massive die Out due to ebola or some other cataclysm is about to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYWHERE (on the internet; the final frontier for free thought) all people are talking about is the celeb leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's even worse is if you even imply that they are a distraction from these things, it gets immediately deleted. Even on 4chan. I tried to post a discussion about it, and BAM. 404d immediately. Tried again and the same thing.

       What i have learned form years of watching the sun and countdowns and possible leaks..all this conspiracy stuff: you cant worry about it. its gunna happen if it happens, sit back, relax enjoy. have a gun, or a bow, have a BOB. and be ready to eat animals if you need to. but.. relax.

       If it was iCloud, they probably used the iBrute exploit which was published for any script kiddy to use. Pretty much the find-my-iPhone API wouldn't trigger a lock out with too many incorrect passwords. So they created a small scrip that would just spam a selected iCloud account with a few thousand common approved passwords and then start brute forcing. Obviously brute forcing isn't actually feasible depending on the password, but the list of several thousand common approved (by approved I mean meeting iCloud requirements) passwords would probably get into a sizable number of accounts.
      </p>

       We don't know how the photos were hacked. But
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       this was the case, the stumbling upon the API vulnerability in iCloud doesn't mean you have access to the NSA archives or some shit. It just means you found a vulnerability in iCloud to brute force. Hacking isn't what you see in the movies.

       I think it's good that someone hacked iCloud. This will breed mistrust in offsite data storage and will (hopefully) remind people how vulnerable this stuff is and how we're being exploited, data/privacy-wise.

       I would if I thought it would change anything. Mac fanboys/girls can be so obtuse that they literally believe everything Apple tells them and think the company can do no wrong despite what evidence to the contrary is shoved in their face. They just stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes, and go "LALALALALALALALALA".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are vulnerabilities that can be exploited with the Android OS and Google services as well, but just the fact that the AOS is build on the Linux kernel, is open source, and allows you to flash custom ROMs and take security measures into your own hands, makes it the far better choice. Most intelligent, security conscious people already know this and naturally use Android. Most iPhone users are generally most concerned about image and following trends.

       I'll never understand why anyone uses Apple mobile products.

       A long long time ago I was a Macintosh Evangelist. I had a Mac Lisa if you can believe it. Back then there wasn't a very good Desktop Linux Distribution, everything was basic and hardware support was nonexistant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched as Apple went OSX and I thought them using BSD was amazing; but I think that is right about the time the company really stopped being a humanist endeavor and became the grimy, dirty pit of pretty engineering it is now. iTunes and the licensing, and the incredibly poor ports of their S/W to other OS's really killed any interest I had in them at that time. Linux was blooming, and never looked back.

       Now Apple is just another vertical marketing nightmare to anyone who wants to have any control over their devices. And they outright sold backdoors and didn't put up much of a fight there. Even if their hardware is still beautiful [and it is] and their OS still innovative [their gesture stuff is so good] - I won't do business with the company.

       I was required to work with Mac desktops for many years in graphic design, and I can appreciate the hardware for how it was able to handle image processing. Nowadays, I just see the company in much the same way you do, and given the fact that there's some really incredible hardware out there (laptops, tablets, etc..), far superior to Apple's IMO, that can run Window, Linux, Mac OS, Android, etc., Apple has become somewhat irrelevant, and I think they realize that.

       There's a warning going around on Facebook to keep off the London tubes today, but to be fair that's always good advice to keep away from such locations
      </p>

       "Don't travel on the tubes tomorrow. Every single police officer in the met has been called into work from 4am onwards, even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight home.

       and it was

       over there. The only difference is in China, it was all linked back to 1 actor and that dude had to
       <em>
        flee
       </em>
       the country to Canada due to death threats from the mafia. Every1 involved basically had their careers ruined.

       This is not news to them; they already know. Its news to the general public who rarely pays attention and stays on task for longer than a day or so when information is concerned.

       Nasty huge events are already rolling, and doubt this scandal will change the general population's awaraness of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a staged operation, what I'd worry is that it will make stricter monitoring and censorship of the net palatable to the consumer masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possibility is a nasty under the table blow from Apple's competitors to discredit their cloud services. As a big product unveiling is coming next week, this is just perfect.

       why? if Joe Blow's barbecue photo reel was leaked, there'd be a blip on the news about changing your icloud password and that'd be about it. celebrities are more important than we are, duh.

       They had to replace a lot of people at the NSA. They're getting desperate to find people who can understand the tech, don't have moral qualms about working for the organization, yet still somehow do their job honestly. They can pretty much pick two.

       I suspect it's just as likely that many of these leaks are not coming from the top of the vessel but from pinholes near the bottom.

       The idiot sociopaths can lobby and legislate all they want, but at some level a human with intelligence and a soul still operates the machinery. I think some low level techs just had a fapfest.
