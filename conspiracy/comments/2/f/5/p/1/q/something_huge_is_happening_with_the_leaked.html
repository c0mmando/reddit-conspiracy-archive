    <div class="md"><p>If it was iCloud, they probably used the iBrute exploit which was published for any script kiddy to use. Pretty much the find-my-iPhone API wouldn&#39;t trigger a lock out with too many incorrect passwords. So they created a small scrip that would just spam a selected iCloud account with a few thousand common approved passwords and then start brute forcing. Obviously brute forcing isn&#39;t actually feasible depending on the password, but the list of several thousand common approved (by approved I mean meeting iCloud requirements) passwords would probably get into a sizable number of accounts.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how the photos were hacked. But <strong>if</strong> this was the case, the stumbling upon the API vulnerability in iCloud doesn&#39;t mean you have access to the NSA archives or some shit. It just means you found a vulnerability in iCloud to brute force. Hacking isn&#39;t what you see in the movies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would if I thought it would change anything. Mac fanboys/girls can be so obtuse that they literally believe everything Apple tells them and think the company can do no wrong despite what evidence to the contrary is shoved in their face. They just stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes, and go &quot;LALALALALALALALALA&quot;.</p>

<p>There are vulnerabilities that can be exploited with the Android OS and Google services as well, but just the fact that the AOS is build on the Linux kernel, is open source, and allows you to flash custom ROMs and take security measures into your own hands, makes it the far better choice. Most intelligent, security conscious people already know this and naturally use Android. Most iPhone users are generally most concerned about image and following trends.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never understand why anyone uses Apple mobile products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A long long time ago I was a Macintosh Evangelist. I had a Mac Lisa if you can believe it. Back then there wasn&#39;t a very good Desktop Linux Distribution, everything was basic and hardware support was nonexistant.</p>

<p>I watched as Apple went OSX and I thought them using BSD was amazing; but I think that is right about the time the company really stopped being a humanist endeavor and became the grimy, dirty pit of pretty engineering it is now. iTunes and the licensing, and the incredibly poor ports of their S/W to other OS&#39;s really killed any interest I had in them at that time. Linux was blooming, and never looked back.</p>

<p>Now Apple is just another vertical marketing nightmare to anyone who wants to have any control over their devices. And they outright sold backdoors and didn&#39;t put up much of a fight there. Even if their hardware is still beautiful [and it is] and their OS still innovative [their gesture stuff is so good] - I won&#39;t do business with the company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was required to work with Mac desktops for many years in graphic design, and I can appreciate the hardware for how it was able to handle image processing. Nowadays, I just see the company in much the same way you do, and given the fact that there&#39;s some really incredible hardware out there (laptops, tablets, etc..), far superior to Apple&#39;s IMO, that can run Window, Linux, Mac OS, Android, etc., Apple has become somewhat irrelevant, and I think they realize that.</p>

<p>The other possibility is a nasty under the table blow from Apple&#39;s competitors to discredit their cloud services. As a big product unveiling is coming next week, this is just perfect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had to replace a lot of people at the NSA. They&#39;re getting desperate to find people who can understand the tech, don&#39;t have moral qualms about working for the organization, yet still somehow do their job honestly. They can pretty much pick two.</p>

<p>I suspect it&#39;s just as likely that many of these leaks are not coming from the top of the vessel but from pinholes near the bottom.</p>

<p>The idiot sociopaths can lobby and legislate all they want, but at some level a human with intelligence and a soul still operates the machinery. I think some low level techs just had a fapfest.</p>
