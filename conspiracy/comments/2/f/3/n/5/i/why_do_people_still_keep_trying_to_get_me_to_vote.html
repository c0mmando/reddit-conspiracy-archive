        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The way things work on the hill is by way of seniority. Those that have been there the longest get the most say. You would have to vote them all out vote, which will never happen all at once. Those at the top would still be there because of seniority. Our system is broken and can not be fixed. So why do people still try and get me to vote? Even people with money can only do so much, and all their doing is trying to make us a collective like china. In the USA we have always promoted individual freedoms. Why when we have all the technology are we not still promoting individual freedoms. It all reminds me of this story I once read in it. It talked about the power that be letting a lion loose and and not stopping it until the people cried out for a savior. And the that be would then stop the beast. Give order and commands. They don&#39;t stop giving order or commands because by the time people see whats going on it is too late. Well I gone abit out there but you should get my point.Why does it matter to try to vote them all out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government itself is the problem, period. Everyone world wide has been indoctrinated to believe that government and authority is the answer to keeping the human race under check. It is the most dangerous superstition in the world. To think that putting the same flawed human beings in control to keep you safe from the flawed humans is ridiculous. People that answer a tough question with, &quot;Just go out and vote next time&quot; is just them repeating what they were taught without even trying to comprehend what that means. </p>

<p>Many of people here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> still believe in government and authority even after seeing the truth. The indoctrination is too strong and embedded in everyone&#39;s minds. We are fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a defeated attitude. On a personal level I&#39;ve never been more positive, and I just went through a divorce. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the real world man. I&#39;d say 80% of the population still believes in letting other mortals claim to have the right to rule them, and still believes in giving &quot;authority&quot; to a man wearing a badge like they have some superior ability to pass judgement on others. </p>

<p>When it comes down to it all the conspiracies on here are plotted and derived from governments, which you&#39;d think that would tell people something but it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m just done trying to convince people about it, that&#39;s all. I&#39;ve tried to explain to everyone I know personally but no one will listen, or they will just nod their head with a sheepish face in agreement but then talk about how &quot;crazy&quot; I am once I leave the room. It&#39;s like me gathering up a room full of children and telling them that Santa Claus isn&#39;t real. With the total indoctrination of government, yes, we are definitely fucked. Even if there was a collapse and the US government was toppled the people would just place another &quot;king&quot; on the throne to keep oppressing them. I get it, &quot;Well if you just give up it&#39;s sure to never get better&quot; but to keep living in denial isn&#39;t very good for the soul either. I&#39;ve just come to terms and accept that government is here to stay and there is nothing I can do about it. That&#39;s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good thing to be aware of the world we live in and what is going on. If I knew I could actually help wake people up I&#39;d be doing it right now. It is really frustrating believe me because I&#39;ve tried and I just come out looking like a nut. But without money, popularity, and influence it is a tough road to travel down. </p>

<p>To me right now it&#39;s more about finding personal happiness for yourself. By doing that will bring a small portion of right to this world, and being happy will therefore might just influence some goodness to others. Also keep in mind the powers that be want us all to be as unhappy as possible. Beat it.</p>

<p>I do believe depopulation is one of their goals. </p>

<p>The terrorists and ISIS are just the same damn pawn game used to move the other pieces across the board so they can get closer to completing their evil agenda. Try to remember when you heard about &quot;terrorists&quot; before 9/11. The group ISIS is the remix of the same song, they are Al Qaeda. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMjXbuj7BPI&amp;amp;list=UUEHsSWvrGVSIA63OV3J6vhA">The covert origins of ISIS</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still would do no good.If they are new, they have little to no say in anything. The people that have been in office the longest have the most say. Kind of like how a frat house works. The tea people that got voted in was because a lot and I mean a ton of money was thrown at them. Rich people hate government to.Who knew. But even then they can only do so much. And the NSA is killing them so. Voting does mean nothing. it&#39;s a lie.And right now they can control about a yoyoflop which is more data than there are people in the whole world. So there is on limit to what they can do. They just can&#39;t get caught. And to be clear they don&#39;t care one way or the other if it work or not. They have only a few goals and will make sure they are solid. The only way to stop them is to make more technology then they can control. Wait already happening. So just wait it out. I just like to bitch online. And to see if they are watching. They do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL That I know for a fact does no good. All the people who run in my area are lawyers(kansas). And of those all of them judges help pick who is going to run.In which they go by who bring in the most money.On top of the they have to go with the cops and make sure none of them get in to trouble.So the cops don&#39;t start in on them.So there is no winning in small town unless you have money to fight back(side note in the USA small town make up a large part of all the towns).All one big circle jerk. I hate lawyers really bad. Bad bad.  And on TOP of THAT the people with the best placement to make real change ARE lawyers. But to get anywhere of real import you have to play the game. Which by that point they are to far gone to help. SOOO hate lawyers bad. </p>

Because OUR Laws number in about 10,000 or so. And Lawyers do this so only thous in the know know how to work the system.

<p>Sure it can, but you have to DO SOMETHING. Saying &quot;Forget it!&quot; does not fix the problem.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>Family matters? I think everyone will tell me that.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s...bad?</p>

<p>Leave to where? What technology?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To &quot;leave&quot; and do nothing to them is the worst thing you can think to do to them?</p>

<p>I have no idea what you&#39;re saying anymore. Is English not your first language?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked me that on so many different tabs. Yes English is my first language.  And technology my dear wantons. Governments around the world are losing control. And it will not be stopped. Barring the end world. 
when I get this in my hands which could be in about 10 years. But I can wait. I will no longer need a government and well they can really tell me what to do at that point either.

    <div class="md"><p>No real A.I. is still a few years away. And anyone plus would be very uncomfortable with a thinking being in control . What we have going on here is a new form of infrastructure. A UBER fact checker. That can validate,cross check,reexamine, and control small details with pin point real time knowledge. AS for our governments the people making this stuff could care less about them. And have thrown them under the bus to say. What good is a government if everyone has the same knowledge? What use is money? And what is murder if no one can be killed.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Still would do no good.If they are new, they have little to no say in anything. The people that have been in office the longest have the most say. Kind of like how a frat house works. The tea people that got voted in was because a lot and I mean a ton of money was thrown at them. Rich people hate government to.Who knew. But even then they can only do so much. And the NSA is killing them so. Voting does mean nothing. it&#39;s a lie.And right now they can control about a yoyoflop which is more data than there are people in the whole world. So there is on limit to what they can do. They just can&#39;t get caught. And to be clear they don&#39;t care one way or the other if it work or not. They have only a few goals and will make sure they are solid. The only way to stop them is to make more technology then they can control. Wait already happening. So just wait it out. I just like to bitch online. And to see if they are watching. They do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good thing to be aware of the world we live in and what is going on. If I knew I could actually help wake people up I&#39;d be doing it right now. It is really frustrating believe me because I&#39;ve tried and I just come out looking like a nut. But without money, popularity, and influence it is a tough road to travel down. </p>

<p>To me right now it&#39;s more about finding personal happiness for yourself. By doing that will bring a small portion of right to this world, and being happy will therefore might just influence some goodness to others. Also keep in mind the powers that be want us all to be as unhappy as possible. Beat it.</p>
