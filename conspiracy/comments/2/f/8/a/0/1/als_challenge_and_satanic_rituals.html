       I just had a post come up on my news feed that was saying the ice bucket challenge was a satanic/illuminati ritual. I can't honestly say I believe it, but it could be worthy of a discussion. The related articles had a couple more stories like it and one was a story titled "fire and ice cleansing before the sacrifice" or something to that effect. These are all kind of wild stories and they lose me because any football coach that has had water dumped on them has been "baptized" or what about people that have taken cold showers? Any way, does any one here want to chime in?

       From the start I felt something...
       <em>
        odd
       </em>
       about that fad.  Yes there is the symbolism of the baptism. The added element of the pain, the ice. The fact this 'viral' thing was becoming huge, with big celebrities enacting it as if under actual coercion, not just because some friend 'challenged' them. Then the guys at No Agenda came with a deeper analysis linking it to early religious rituals of penance via physical suffering and later explaining it as kind of a 'moral license', relieving one's guilt over not helping others or society at large via meaningless gestures that gave one allowance to continue committing 'sins'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then... the ISIS snuff video. I saw the weird contrasts. The media exposing '
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       ' as barbarous savages, committing the worst atrocities, meanwhile here '
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       ' are, selflessly enduring a minor sacrifice, helping others, giving and being
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       .

       This is the most insightful analysis I have read on this whole ice bucket fiasco. I say you're absolutely spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody in the brainwashed masses, unfortunately, will view what you are saying as coming from crazy town because it calls out the hypocrisy in this ritual which makes them feel bad, defeating the purpose of the ritual.

       Why are you asking such a profoundly ignorant question as if you know absolutely nothing about Christianity or the bible?

       Knowingly or unknowingly moving your body in a certain way absolutely does not do anything towards your standing with God.

       I consider satanic rituals to be self-evidently bullshit. But I still want to hear what other people have to say about it.

       Think of how many human sacrifices have taken place, I'm certain many of them were unaware of the actual meaning of their sacrifice and simply just confused and terrified of their captors. But they clearly were victims of the ritual, and that clearly does not hinder the efficacy of the ritual. I would even argue that it empowers it, as now the actions taken by the person (e.g dumping ice water on head) are not consciously understood but they are told it's for something that is completely illogical. How does dumping ice-water on your head actually help anyone? Yes, one can argue that it's a means to gain awareness to the condition. But generally, I would believe that the means to do this would be more or less relevant to ALS itself and in this case it's completely irrelevant so if it were a ritual ALS would be the 'Patsy' so to speak and those who accept it and practice the ritual on themselves are the victims, whether they want to believe it or not.

       I think you are confusing the notion of ritual. The enactor isn't the only component, in fact the sacrifice would be the victims themselves (dumping the ice water). "How does dumping ice-water on your head actually help anyone?" - This was rhetorical.

       No, I'm explaining the philosophy and mechanism's behind ritual by utilizing historical parallels as a blueprint for the underlying structure of almost any act. I'm simply saying that IF this were true, this is how it WOULD work. BTW if it were a high level ritual, you can be assured the ALS Foundation would most likely be a pawn in itself. I remain impartial to the accusation, I only want to point out the relevancy IF it happened to be true.

       Wow, just wow, that in this day and age this Satan-crap is still believed. Even back in the days when thy did do rituals, it was more to piss off the god-lovers rather than actually asking Satan for anything. Hence the satirical butt-kissing of the devil, the drinking and the nudity.

       Satan isn't children posting videos dumping ice water on their heads. Satan is greed and manipulation, hypocrisy and the corruption in using religion as a weapon. Satan is the greed behind the ALS foundation taking most of the money that is donated and not using it as the donors intended. An anthropomorphism of the dark within the hearts of man and the world. There is no power in the physical act of a ritual, evil is in the intent. Rituals are superstition, it's the desire for power beyond what you could responsibly use that is the true evil. The hubris of thinking that you would be a better god.
