       Yes, and I keep trying to shake it off.  I have a terrible feeling some awful  catastrophe is going to happen for several weeks.  I tell myself it's my depression and when something bad does happen, like a recent death in the family I feel like "okay, that was it"  But it wasn't, the feeling comes back.

       Well... frankly, I was surprised to recently learn that there is Scientific truth to this from non other than Princeton Univ. researchers. 
    Not that the media would EVER cover something positive. This research is an ongoing project titled the Global Consciousness Project (Google it you will find what I am citing they keep the data fairly current) 
     This research has validated that people in the aggregate must share (on some subconscious level) a sixth sense. People globally seem to send out measurable vibes minutes prior to major global events that have occurred. This has been detected before both natural and man made tragedies. They have proven time and time again through retrospectively analyzing the data collected and comparing the data against historic events from as small as a local community to the whole planet. 
    I've learned at this point in my life that you are not the CRAZY one. Those that choose not to trust their gut almost always regret it later. 
     I am with you though. Approximately 2 years ago all of my priorities realigned without me consciously thinking about it. I went from being  a pretty successful mid level Exec. at two different fortune 500's over the prior decade into a guy in an entry level job at a tech co. and "PREPPER" with no career aspiration literally overnight.
       <br/>
       I started seeing through all the B.S. That we allow to drive our daily decisions. I stopped watching TV and began reading about this countries founding from Original Sources in the founders own words. We are nothing but a shell of their vision at this point and we are living ALL of the fears and ideals that they warned is to avoid which is ironically what is causing the fall of the empire like the creation of a central bank...that has taken 70 years, but that alone has done more damage to this country. Nixon taking is off the Gold Standard. The Fed. Gov't becoming too powerful and the States forgetting that they are more powerful that the Fed. Gov't. States can ignore any Federal law they wish to protect their people from as long as the Law is not an item SPECIFICALLY states as enumerated to the Fed. Gov't BY THE STATES. 
   It is coming, and will unravel 2015 into 2016 and will be painful.  Honestly believe it could lead to a second American Civil War or New Revolution entirely. 
   Think that's a crazy statement? Consider this, in my entire life, I have NEVER seen local Militias show up and stand down a Federal Law Enforcement Agency. Have you? Not until the Bundy Ranch and Texas  border. What about the blatant disregard and suspension of the 4th Amendment. It's not a conspiracy anymore. The Gov't is openly spying on all of its people. If you dare have a data center offering encryption to protect your customer Identity, than you will be raided and fined daily until you give the Gov't the Encryption key to the entire code enabling them access to everyone's data on the network. See Lavabit! The owner who is a Patriot shut down the business and destroyed the servers. That way when he finally complied with the order nothing was available for them to snoop. We are now a TAX SLAVE country. Most are comfortable just going about their daily lives until the government comes for them. Instead of trying to fight them now in the court of public opinion.  We need to TAKE back our rights that they Fed is supposed to protect for us and not take from us as they have. 
I dont have faith that anything can stop what's coming, so if you have not done so yet, go get your bullets, Bread, guns and band aids. 
Good Luck

       Interesting article, there. Though, i refuse to admit it is true, as i dont beljeve correlation equals causation. But, entertaining the idea, i found that your conclusion is actually the opposite of the one i drew from this article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He concluded that 80% of the major events of human drama occurred during the 5 years around maximum in sunspot activity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The mkst recent solar maximum occured very, very recently. Like last year. It may still be technically occuring, but i think the apex has passed. Regardless, we are
       <strong>
        well
       </strong>
       within his "five year" parameter. Also, i found this line in the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Upon close examination of the data, a pattern begins to emerge wherein wars are most likely to start in key points of the sunspot cycle. This is when the geomagnetic activity is changing most rapidly on the upsurge of solar activity,
        <strong>
         <em>
          or the downward part of the cycle
         </em>
        </strong>
        , when sunspots are rapidly diminishing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, even if the apex has passed us, we are well within the range to fit this pattern for ww3 to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         BUT
        </em>
       </strong>
       , thats assuming this correlation to equate causation.

       Really great breakdown of the article.  I don't disagree with your assessment.  It was the first article I found on google and hoped it would be good enough to get the point across.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started looking into heliobiology/heliopsychology/bioelectromagnetics a few years ago and read quite a bit about it.  Saved all of it to a different computer.  When all put together it lends a better picture of causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ~40% increase in psych ward admissions after geomag storms (england research, I believe).  The federal reserve did a study and found that geomag storms altered and lead to a predictable trading behavior on the stock exchange.  There's numerous articles on PubMed tying in solar cycle/storms to effects on circulatory system.  The list could go on and on but I'm on mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, see here:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Chizhevsky#Sunspots_and_mass_excitability">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Chizhevsky#Sunspots_and_mass_excitability
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can get Chizhevsky's papers in front of you, well, it may be a bit more convincing.

       Ill look into it. Afterall, our brain patterns and behavioral mechanisms are driven by electronic communications between the synapses of our neurons. So the idea is plausible, at the least. I just havent found enough to sway my current belief on the matter, as of yet. Though i still remain open to the idea.

       Yeah the US economy is collapsing, but central bankers won't be giving up power willingly. I fear for the US, but if we can make it through this, much better times are coming.

       I think the overwhelming feeling comes from how obvious it is getting. You don't even have to be a "conspiracy theorist" at this point. It is scary how obvious they are acting.

       I think we have all been waiting on it. However this feeling is getting to be a bit more "real". A lot of odd shit is going down and it seems like there are so many issues going on across the geopolitical world than any action will likely be a surprise. I am betting on power grid failure. Fuck up the power it fucks up communications. Communications are an important thing.

       Nothing will happen in a non-wrecked country this 9/11. Something bad will go down in a country that has nothing but dirt, dryness, crumbling bland concrete buildings, and dust. But who cares about that since bombs and "lalalala BANG" are a standard part of their culture now.

       As a life-based civilization, we owe it to the universe to not let these death-based food eaters make us become pessimistic!

       Thinking that the world will end makes it happen for you as an individual. You spend $$$ on a bunker instead of living life.
