    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, i tend to believe obama when he says this.</p>

<p>You see, obama is smart, clever, witty, and deceiving. He uses words intentionally and smartly to disseminate delusion. Take a look at his word choice. He says &quot;No<strong><em>body</em></strong>&quot; is listening. That would seem to mean that a human being is actively assigned to your phone calles and listening on every discussion you make. </p>

<p>However, this excludes acknowledgement thst every call you make is screened by and archived by incredibly powerful computets with incredibly advanced and complex algorythms. </p>

<p>So, no, nobody is listening in on our calls. But some<strong><em>THING</em></strong> is. </p>

<p>See how that works? Hes being truthful by omission, a deceitful and clever way to attempt to make us believe there is no NSA surveillence threat.</p>

<p>Look, im all for the mentality to provide citations and sources and shit. But when another person is obviously making a hypothetical statement, it would be disingenuous and a bit of an attempt to use dichotomies to discredit or negate the purpose of what is being conveyed.</p>

<p>Hypothesis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>involving or based on a suggested idea or theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing in the definition makes it absolutely pertinent to exclude truth within a hypothesis. </p>

<p>Id make the suggestion to harp on citstions and sources when it isnt obvious he is stating his opinion and perspective on a generalized view on a population as a means to get his point across. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If you like your plan, you can keep it&quot; Didn&#39;t work out the way he planned it to work out. See, the problem really isn&#39;t Obama, it&#39;s the shadow government that is actually pulling the strings. Obama is just the PR person who speaks on behalf of those who are really in power. Furthermore, he has shown again and again that he isn&#39;t really a man of his word. Just look at how much of his platform has turned into actual policy. And no, you can&#39;t blame it on the Republicans. At least not <em>entirely</em> as Democrats tend to do (Honestly, Red vs. Blue is just a nice way to refer to the War Party. Both D and R are the same on the big issues and both parties endorse perpetual wars.) </p>

<p>BTT, I don&#39;t believe him the slightest. I am pretty sure that the NSA has comprehensive records of our phone calls, mail, email probably even our conversations in public. We&#39;re living in a police state. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves. I like to refer to our current situation as &quot;civil fascism&quot; we do not live in a military state per se, but certain aspects of fascism are definitely already well incorporated in our society, all in the name of &quot;national security&quot; and the &quot;War Against Terrorism&quot;. Among these, probably most prominently, is the existence of the police state, which can track virtually every way of communication. However, it seems to me that Average Joe doesn&#39;t pay attention as long as he is able to drink his victory gin and smoke his victory cigarettes in the evening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it there&#39;s only two possible situations, and both are equally viable. Situation 1: The NSA is tracking and recording ALL technological data possible, and storing them in giant hives, wherein the information gets sorted for further operations. Situation 2: There is no mass surveillance at all, but only targeted surveillance on citizens and HVT&#39;s alike. I&#39;m not saying that all citizens are surveilled, only ones that draw attention to themselves (drug dealers, activists, journalists, etc. The second option is used as a fear mongering technique using controlled opposition. Snowden: they&#39;re spying on you!; Obama: no we&#39;re not!</p>
