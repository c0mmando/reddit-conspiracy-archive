I&#39;ve had a very strange feeling, like a blank mind, zombie like almost, just knowing something huge is about to happen and bring us to a reality of &quot;holy shit&quot; I just wasted 4 years of my life going to college, to be under a nation martial law and tyrannical takeover and possibly thrown into a freaking camp, paid for with my own tax paying money. Does anyone else have this strange feeling? What can we do to avoid being taken hostage in our own country if said happens? Militia activity will be increasing I believe. I don&#39;t think America and some of the military will comply with those orders if given. An all out civil war? Revolutionary take over? Input please.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sympathize.  I&#39;ve had that sense of impending doom for the last year now.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve become determined to learn at least why and by who&#39;s hands I may fall, whether I can stop it or not.  Knowledge really is power though, because the more I&#39;ve researched and learned, the less helplessness I&#39;ve felt.  If the need arises I am willing to fight against anything, but until then I will remain alert and weary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had that sense of impending doom for the past two decades. You can&#39;t live your life in fear; that&#39;s a waste of your life. Knowledge is, as you say, the answer. Understand what a fast collapse means; understand what a slow collapse means. Prepare for both, but enjoy today; learn to be happy in the face of collapse. It sounds trite or maybe meaningless, but once you have secured food and water, and security, and you have a plan, it becomes simply a matter of following the plan. No matter how freaked out you get, it will pass; if you&#39;ve made a good plan, it does not need to be changed because your spidey sense is tingling any more or any less; and so your task is to simply follow the plan. You can prepare for drastic change, and change your life, while finding happiness and satisfaction. It is not the same sense of happiness or satisfaction that some people get out of shopping/material things/drugs but it is real, and it endures. You sleep well each night knowing that you are doing the best you can for yourself and your family.
onwards,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been slowly but surely gathering supplies and needs for a possible &quot;bugout&quot; or a indefinite stay at my residence. Weapons, ammo, non perishable food, armor plates, vests etc etc I just really hope I never have to use any of it. I think shows like walking dead and that sort are telling you how to gather or what to do a predictive programming. All these series on collapses and doomsday lately are making me think that it is for coming and hinting to everyone. Just my wild opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skills and knowledge are also valuable. How to grow a garden, how to catch a fish or rabbit and clean it, how to build a water filter out of garbage, how to repair a motorcycle, how to sail a boat. If you think you might enjoy any of those things, you have found a path to thrive in collapse, and there are many more; find yours. You may be right: the end is near! But really, people have been saying that for thousands of years. I think it&#39;s more likely that this is just the beginning of the end; worrying doesn&#39;t do anyone good, and it distracts you from your plan. Enjoy your life while you still can! The world still has great beauty and abundance for all who look. Keep gathering supplies, keep preparing; it&#39;s good to have something in your back pocket,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there great and making people think its working, through the news reports and then psyoperatives spreading the message  though the social media networks. You almost get the impression its wide spread.</p>

<p>Ill bet that more and more people are turning away from that kind of news but its hard to see that with all the false accounts spreading fake messages.</p>

<p>If you really think about it its almost a kind of black magic. hook people with fear and deliver a message under that spell to keep the masses consumed with creating divisions between each other.</p>

<p>There is no point in putting your attention on that, it will just draw you into dis-empowerment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have had some concerns. But I wouldn&#39;t say it was from a &quot;feeling&quot;. It&#39;s because there&#39;s a lot of shit going on right now and because of the way some things are getting hyped by the media to increase fear. But, we&#39;ve gone through these things before. Cuban missile crisis, media hype and run-up to first gulf war, then 911 and anthrax &quot;attacks&quot;, then the lies and hype leading to the Iraq war. And now all this with ISIS. In all of the previous Middle East crises, and other things like bird flu epidemic, I kind of went onto alert, but none of these things resulted in a major shit-hits-the-fan martial law scenario. So maybe you could cool it with the fear a little bit. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t wasted four years by going to college. Life is for living. Sometimes major events happen that overtake the plans for our lives, but no one has a crystal ball. So there&#39;s no point not going on with life as normal. We wouldn&#39;t question a Vietnam vet about why he bothered to start college when he knew he might be drafted, right?</p>

<p>You never know what day will be your last. Your life could be turned upside down or cut short for reasons completely unrelated to geopolitical conflict. So live. You could get involved in prepping, but even then, that might be a big waste of time. </p>

<p>As far as the specifics about what you&#39;re worried about, it sounds like you&#39;ve been taking a lot of stock into what other people write on the internet. No one knows what&#39;s going to happen. We can see trends that indicate the state is concerned over the possibility of civil unrest. But all the other things you mention are extrememly specific and no one predict things with that specificity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That odd feeling is your subconscience nagging at you because you know things you aren&#39;t conciously processing. You took history, you can read the news.  Step way back and set rhetoric aside for logic.  There won&#39;t be martial law, but there will possibly be tyranny. Ask yourself how ISIS happened. What happened to Iran in the late 70&#39;s? The wealthy and bizarrely faithful are turning this country into a theocracy, inch by inch, law by law.  And see comment by zyklonbeast below. Its true.  Keeping the populace in a state of fear makes them more compliant.   What you can really do, is be as prepared for natural disaster. Be able to care for yourself and your loved ones. Natural disasters will always be with us. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t travel on the tubes tomorrow. Every single police officer in the met has been called into work from 4am onwards, even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight home. They think there&#39;s a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the west end area. &quot;</p>

The people need to be numbed with another black and white false flag attack, were a little overdue anyways. Dissent is already happening. Some people in some parts of the country are focusing too much on what is wrong with the government, something the government definitely doesn&#39;t want. I&#39;d say we have something coming. Dick Cheney said there&#39;ll be another 9/11 in the next decade. Supposedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you see war propaganda in August that means public opinion is being shaped in time for September when the politicians get back from their Summer holidays.  This is what was done before September 11th, it&#39;s being done now too.  Expect a false flag soon (could even be a big one) and a new war.</p>

<p>Whereas Israel actually wait for the Summer to start their wars, as they need the Western politicians to be away on holiday, so you&#39;ll see their war propaganda is always timed for just before the major Western leaders go away.</p>

<p>Timing gives us so many clues as to what the coming plans are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people have been feeling what you describe, as I have.</p>

<p>I struggled with that feeling for about two weeks, and I decided to take action on it. Gave up the city life, found an area that&#39;s low population and less stressful.</p>

<p>When I shared my concerns with others, they gave me reasons why things are not so bad. Some have been more receptive to my feeling.</p>

<p>Recently, I listened to an old talk by Terence McKenna, in which he describes that psychedelics and other forms of altered consciousness allow us to &#39;talk&#39; to higher dimensional intelligences. It has been speculated that the ego, the voice of the &#39;I&#39; is fairly recent phenomenon. Prior to it&#39;s arrival, the voice of the superconscious would be heard like the voice of the God.</p>

<p>TLDR; Trust yourself and your inner voice, and don&#39;t let it be clouded by ego fears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be in NY, could be Russia in Ukraine, I just had these recurring nightmares ver the past few months of me witnessing the mushroom cloud and I just feel this event it&#39;s imminent.</p>

<p>Back in JAnuary, I was certain the events in Ukraine back in November last year would escalate to the point where it&#39;s basically Syria in Ukraine, I could find a comment on one of my banned accounts of me stating it.</p>

<p>It just feels like the world&#39;s been a completely different place for the past few weeks.</p>

Now that they have given the go ahead for when it&#39;s happening I can schedule a week away for the economic reshaping of the state.</p>

<p>Turns out its cheaper to nuke it and start over folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you consider a few? Free-floating fear is really just part of &quot;Their&quot; game. If there is a big conspiracy trying to change the world, one of its simplest methods would be to frighten people to the point where they think resistance is futile and become politically paralyzed. I see you are Polish. So fair enough feeling like this in your case, as you are a LOT nearer to this shit than most of us! (I&#39;m in UK). :(</p>
