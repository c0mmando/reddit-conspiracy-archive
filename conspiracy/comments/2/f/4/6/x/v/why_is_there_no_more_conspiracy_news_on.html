If you want to believe that contrails are evil &quot;chemtrails&quot; and that mixing soil (that&#39;s usually around 71,000 mg/kg aluminum) with water and then being surprised that there&#39;s more aluminum than in just water, be my guest.

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever geoengineering is currently being discussed and/or tested doesn&#39;t involve spraying anything in the troposphere except to REMOVE cloud cover at those altitudes. Persistent artificial cirrus clouds caused by massed contrails is itself a possible contributor to global warming. The theory is that this cloud allows sunlight through to hit the ground, but blocks infra red heat from radiating out into space and this causes the atmosphere below to heat up. Cirrus Stripping is a proposal for dispersing this artificial cirrus and natural cirrus. But there are problems. More sunlight would have serious effects on the climate. Like all these geoengineering proposals, they haven&#39;t gone past first experiments. There is a global ban on any full-scale weather altering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people have started to realize that the chem stuff is Government bullshit..  This means fake rumors created to distract the public from other issues..  Co-intel disinformation.</p>

<p>They took the old weather control spraying experiment program, which dates back to the time of JFK, and turned it into something else, creating paranoia and mass hysteria. And suddenly everybody is walking around watching the sky all the time.</p>

<p>The interesting thing though is why they did it, and what they&#39;re hiding..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of more sophisticated ways and much cheaper methods, to spread what they want.. Water supply is one of them.. And if it should be airbourne, the machines which can spread this from the ground allready exists. And allready have been tested. Remember there is allways somekind if logic and economic aspect to what they&#39;re doing.. Why choosing the most expensive and complicated way, involving tenths of thousands of people from airplanecompagnies to mechanics to pilots constantly working to kill us all..? Or do whatever their thing is..  What ever they&#39;re up to you can be damn sure they&#39;d pick other and much more discrete ways, involving as few people as possible..</p>

<p>The chemtrail conspiracy is probably a &quot;dangle&quot;, made to discredit the people into conspiracy. Once you&#39;ve touched the subject and the truth about it some day is revealed as a hoax, ALL your credibility is gone, and no one will listen to all your other theories (where some of your theories might be true)..  And people will no longer buy Alex Jones DVDs and books, t-shirts, coffeemugs etc etc..  And this is the Agenda my friend.</p>

<p>So be carefull with the subject..!  Trust me I&#39;ve been there myself. I suspect there will soon be some kinda a main stream bbc documentary about the trail phenomena, and the Scientific logic explanation, which will end up making a fool out of all of us in here and seriously slow down the &quot;wake up&quot; proces of our fellow humans..</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably some fuel additive like Addblue they put in it to give the engines better mileage. And those chemicals happens to react in a different way in certain temperatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a result of poor sampling and interpretation of results. They collected sludge, not water. The number should be compared to expected values in soil, not water. Kind of an embarrassing error, but it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty of doubt and there is no proof that anybody has sprayed anything. Taking water samples from puddles will not give an accurate result, but that&#39;s what these people have been doing then claiming they have evidence of pollution. Nobody has ever taken a sample directly from a so-called &#39;chemtrail&#39; and analysed it (or if they have, they quietly shut up about it when the results came back as &#39;Water, with a tiny amount of soot&#39;). This documentary is a heap of unscientific garbage, and if you look in the YouTube menu bar on the right you&#39;ll see half a dozen videos which debunk it point by point.</p>
