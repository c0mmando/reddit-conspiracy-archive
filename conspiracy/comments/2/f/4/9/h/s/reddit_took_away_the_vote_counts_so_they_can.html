       Try censorship, dude.  Not advertisers.   Reddit doesn't need to turn a profit.  They've proven this year after year of losing incredible sums of money.  Reddit is the new propaganda platform.  Far more ratings hsn any TV program or movie.  this is priority #1=. The removal of critical topics.  Not the promotion of ads.

       I had an idea earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't RES just track votes for us...? It would certainly take a lot of space to save all that data, but if every person using RES had their votes tracked, and RES
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       displays vote numbers for what other RES users had submitted...we'd have a pretty good system. Right?

       Okay, so why not an alternate program then? All it would do is aggregate the data you submit to it. You click an upvote, the app pulls that data and sends it to the main server. No need for integration with Reddit itself. No need for Reddit itself to even know anything is happening because it's all client-side.

       That would technically work, but the data you get would be very self-selected and biased due to nature of it. The only way to get good data is to get all of it. The only way to do that is to own the service.

       Post upvoters are not made public, so there would be no accountability. This currently makes reddit more prone to gaming than Digg with its 'patriots', since users not part of the site staff would be made unable to detect fraud (except through public user histories and posting trends).

       Wow, happy I don't go on the front page, I have a few subreddits I visit and that's it. I don't care about the "trends" on here to anything like that.

        Reddit took away the vote counts so they can manipulate popularity
        <del>
         for advertisements
        </del>

       Fixed.

      <p>
       Back in the day, there were only a handful of major news outlets that controlled/flavored virtually ALL of the national and world "news" that was available to the public at large - CBS, NBC, ABC, Reuters, Associated press... everyone else got their "feeds" from these sources, so controlling "popular opinion" on any given topic was simply a matter of maintaining editorial control over these feeders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet changed all that, and the new game requires different and more creative strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sites like Reddit have the potential to call attention to issues that TPTB would PREFER be ignored, and under a system where posts/comments are (supposedly) ranked by the votes of other users, the ability to influence (rig) said votes is priceless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Removing the up-vote/down-vote count helps to hide said manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you trust such a covert system in political elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why trust it here?

       Personally, I was kind of outraged when they first took the downvotes away, but I noticed that I had a habit of looking at the score a comment received before reading it and thereby forming a prejudice about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g., seeing a highly upvoted post and thinking it's righter than a downvoted post, which I had more of a tendency to be skeptical about.
      </p>
      <p>
       With topics I have more informed opinions on, the vote counts wouldn't matter so much as to whether I thought it was righter or wronger, but with topics I was not an expert I would defer to the vote-counts to get a better idea of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, popularity of an opinion doesn't necessarily predict rightness, and everything controversial seems to attract downvotes simply on account of questioning the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's removal of the downvotes and obfuscating the counts has had the effect that I don't look to the scores so much before reading, or at least give less credence to the score as a measure of rightness, so for me, I feel I am less affected by the popularity or lack of it of opinions here. A good thing.

       When the admins took away the vote counters, redditors should have stopped buying Reddit gold in protest.
