<p>It&#39;s made so that the current girl they&#39;re using to produce the shit with doesn&#39;t have to do anything to stay relevant herself, they pay somebody else to do all that shit, just like the 8 other people who actually write, play, and record the music and lyrics.</p>

<p>Iggy Azalea and Katy Perry don&#39;t have to do jack shit besides what they&#39;re told, which is the whole point of the pop industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on screen and look sexy for us&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they only use women who look/sound amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say what you want about mainstream music [or lack thereof] and how it has degraded exponentially as of late, which I totally agree with..</p>

<p>If you really think Katy Perry is just &quot;showing up&quot; and everyone else is actually doing the work, then you are sadly mistaken my friend.  I don&#39;t care for her music all that much but she is so talented it&#39;s fuckin&#39; stupid.  </p>

<p>Couple this with the fact that she graduated school early, just so she could go on the road with her parents because she knew what she had wanted to do since she was like.. 10?</p>

<p>She was rejected for six years straight from all record companies [and this was after HAVING a record deal when she was 16 or some shit].  </p>

<p>To be able to drag yourself through that, year after year after year.. you have to realize - she embodies immeasurable talent, but works on her craft like she&#39;s a washed up saloon singer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I am saying in essence is give credit where credit is due. </p>

<p>Were people to actually check the album credits, they would find out that katy Perry hardly does anything besides sing and write lyrics with the assistance of other writers. </p>

<p>She is a very talented singer and can write and play basic pop music on guitar and piano.</p>

<p>She is not, however, a composer or producer, which makes her mostly a product as she requires other people to write, perform, record, mix, and master the music. </p>

<p>She was rejected for six years straight because she was trying to remain a christian artist.</p>

<p>She succeeded in getting a deal when she turned her back on God and in her words verbatim,  &quot;I sold my soul to the devil&quot; , search YouTube and hear for yourself, I&#39;m not joking about this. </p>

<p>She is only succeeding as an &quot;artist&quot; because she&#39;s letting the music industry whore her around on stage just like miley Cyrus.</p>

<p>Fuck the mainstream music industry, it&#39;s evil as shit, controlled by actual Satanists who push their occult messages blatantly in pop music, like the horrifying &quot;die young&quot; trash they are using Katy Perry to condition kids with. </p>

<p>Seems to me that Russia wants their land bridge to Crimea pretty bad and they&#39;re prepared to sink pretty low in order to throw off any outrage that might arise in the west. By the time this story dies down, Russia will have their land bridge.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think you should be able to store private things on what you buy period end of line. If I paid 800 dollars for a phone or computer I expect it to be mine. Not just a device where a company like the NSA can come in and take a look around at private things. That is not right I am paying for my product me and me only can decide who gains access. That is what I think it should be anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely but you&#39;re hoping for utopia and that just ain&#39;t gonna happen, especially with how easy it is to get into &quot;secure&quot; systems.  </p>

<p>I imagine you feel the same way about your house or apartment.  But you lock the doors, right?  Why? Because there are plenty of people in this world who are scumbags who will steal from you any chance they get.  It&#39;s the same with digital information.  If you don&#39;t want it stolen, use strong encryption.  </p>
