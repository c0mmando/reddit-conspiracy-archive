       SO, as long as people in our government don't pull all of our air defenses to the one side of the country, we should be able to deter any such attack w\ foreign airliners?

       I don't see them ever getting close to juicy targets, european capitals etc. Way too much ground to cover and plenty of nations with well developed airforces to contend with. They could make a play for a middle-eastern target though, like Israel maybe. At this point anything is wild speculation, really.

       That is true but has happened before. Somebody had to order the American air defense to stand down on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't bet on Israel getting attacked since they are most likely the financiers of ISIS.

       I would like to respectfully disagree on this. They didnt have to necessarily order a stand down, so much as facilitate criminal negligence or to hesitate just enough. But, other than that, im with you.

       I watched it. Secretary Mineta appears to be referring to an order to shoot down any plane that appeared to be out of normal control. Not a "stand down" order.

       That's what I thought at first as well. He actually talks about two orders, and the 'shoot down' terminology is used when talking about Flight 93 (which contradicts the "Todd Beaman 'let's roll' story", but that'd for another day I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at (and I hope you watch it one or two more times and really listen) is that he tells a story about the first order, where an unidentified man updates the Vice President while they are all in the PEOC regarding Flight 77's approach. After it is 10 miles out (and remember, Flight 77 is in the process of this point of pulling off an incredible 270 degree spiral turn and descent going well over 500 mph at almost ground level) the man asks the Vice President if the 'orders still stand?' Cheney responds with 'of course they still stand... Have you heard anything to the contrary?' And soon after, Flight 77 allegedly crashes into the recently modified E ring of the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask you this - if the unidentified man was referring to a shoot down order at 10 miles out, and the 'orders still stood,' why did Flight 77 still hit the Pentagon (the headquarters for the largest military on the planet, by the way)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please watch it again with this in mind and think about it.

       Watched it again, thought about it. Still entirely unconvinced, seeing as how
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44459345/ns/us_news-9_11_ten_years_later/t/kamikaze-f--pilots-planned-ram-flight/">
        F-16s were scrambled to bring the planes down
       </a>
       , couldn't get airborne in time, and even then, the only plan was to ram the planes as they were completely unarmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a plane, traveling at approximately 400 MPH is only 10 miles out, it'll get there faster than any fighter jet can get into the air. Those things take a long,
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       time to get airborne. Even in a video game simulator, it
       <a href="http://kotaku.com/5874174/watch-grown-men-spend-40-minutes-trying-to-fly-a-video-game-fighter-jet">
        takes three grown men 40 minutes to try and figure out how to get it started
       </a>
       . A fully-trained pilot could probably do it in 20, tops, and then it's gotta have fuel and gotta get into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is, I'm completely unconvinced. This would be the biggest scoop in the world, and no reporter at a reputable news organization has managed to break it. The government can't keep anything secret without leaking it, not even the Manhattan Project. So why would this be any different?

       That means i will respect your personal synopsis (summary) of it. Meaning, i will offer you the benefit of the doubt that what you might summarize is actually what is contained within the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, regardless of this dudes testimony, i was originally only saying that a "stand down" order is not necessary for the resultant incident of 9/11. They couldve achieved the same results by sitting on their asses and not giving any orders, or by giving orders that wouldnt directly affect the outcome. That was all. I wasnt saying you were wrong, i was just pointing out that a "stand down" order isnt/wasnt necessary.

       Personal preference, really. But also because i do all my reddit perusal on my phone, and i dont want the videos to drain all my battery life. I find i can get much more things accomplished through discourse rather than observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly just dont find much value to the videos on reddit, as it is much harder to quote videos, and thus facilitate dialogue on the subject matter. But, i will still support others who find value in them. To each his own, you know?

      <p>
       You're still not making any sense. So, if you found that video tomorrow, while browsing YouTube, or someone else told you about that video, you'd watch it? But you refuse to watch it because it was linked by a reddit user? How is that logical, at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: just wanted to add, I'm not the person who linked that video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no, if there was no attempt to stop the military from intercepting those hijacked planes, then the normal protocols would have been followed and the planes would have been shot down. Period. You don't have a clue how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you would accept someones summary of a video instead of seeing it for yourself is mind blowing to me.

       I have no doubt about that. Its just a personal preference, thats all. I favor discourse over watching videos. Plus, i feel my time (and battery life on my phone) is better invested in active discussion rather than watching videos all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       When i am home and on my computer, however, bored with the television, ill watch some stuff on youtube, but its mostly music videos, looking for inspirations for my own personal compositions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have nothing against youtube videos linked from reddit, mind you. If yall find value to it, thats fantastic. I prefer to do my research and investigations by reading rather than watching.

       I just feel like you're limiting yourself.  By not watching the video and asking for a TL;DR, you're essentially interpreting someone else's interpretation of the source instead of seeing it first hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to tell you what to do or how to think or anything - I favor discourse over watching videos as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as an example: I watched a video last week where a former Israeli soldier gave a lecture about his experiences in the IDF and gave some heartbreaking and maddening insight into the "conflict" in the Middle East and some of the hows, whys and whos.  It's a video that I would never be able to do justice in a reddit comment.

       Thats fair. And in these cases i usually move on to another discussion, because i have run into many folks who say, "Just watch the video" and never end up wishing to discuss the subject matter. Why waste my time if the end result is devoid of discussion? This is particularily frustrating to me when its like a hr long video, you know? So ive decided to avoid watching these videos altogether and focus more into the efficiency of discourse. If that means its the end of an interesting discussion, well, then its unfortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, seeing how the dude who linked to the video seems genuinely interested in furthering discourse, ill probably end up watching it at work tomorrow (i just got off work, and i do about 90% of my redditting while at work). Especially knowing beforehand that it is only a 3-4 min video as he pointed out in another comment to me, that wouldnt drain my precious battery life too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time i feel it might be worthwhile.

       Not exactly. I know others will watch the video, and in the event that some random dudes analysis is off kilter of the actual content contained therein, i trust others would speak out.

       Plus, if the individual offering the link to the video in question was truely interested in discussion, i believe they would be more than willing to offer their honest analysis on the subject matter.

       That was my plan, after you watched the source material. But I'm not going to waste my time if you can't be bothered with a 3-4 minute video. This could be a great discussion - but I'm not spelling things out. You get more out of seeing source materials and formulating your own opinion. Others' analyses definitely can contribute, but without both of us watching what Norman said, how can we have any productive discussion?

       Fair enough. If you dont mind, ill watch the video tomorrow morning while at work, since i do most of my redditting at work (and i just got off work). And knowing its only a 3-4 min video, and knowing you are genuinely interested in furthering this discussion on it, i feel it would only be fair and worthwhile to watch this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many times have i run across folks who say, "just watch the video" and then they disappear without any further discussion on it. It becomes particularily frustrating when you invest in a video thats like an hr long and then they dip out, you know? The end result has always been a drained battery, no discourse, and a wasted investment of time, as i am mostly interested in discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, like i said, ill watch it tomorrow at work (or tonight if i find some freetime thatll allow me to invest the critical thinking and logic required for digestion of such material) and we can resume then? I feel like thats fair.

       Very intetesting testimony there. It actually sort of coincides with something i heard about the scrambled jets... Ler the official reports timeline, the jets that were scrambled shouldve had no problem intercepting the planes in time, had they been flying at full throttle. Yet, they never did arrive on time. But thats a different discussion i suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did notice this guy admitted that he never heard what the order given actually was, though. I honestly still feel like a shoot down order was given, but the planes were intentionally delayed either by their flight path, destination, or otherwise. I didnt catch this man saying under oath that he knows for sure a stand dowm order was given. Though, i feel like it is almost implied (unless i missed something in the video).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also shocking to me that he didnt even hear about flight 93 until after it crashed. They knew it had deviated off course for some time. This also coincides with my suspicion of delayed (intentional, perhaps) response to the protocols of such an incident. The correct authority figures werent notified for one reason or another in due time, though they had plenty of time to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       My honest stance on 9/11 is that it was an organic attack, perpetrated by terrorists, however haphazard their plans mightve been, but succeeded only because it was allowed to succeed. Much like pearl harbor, and for parallel reasons --- to garner support of the american people for war. It proved to be a wonderful justification in TPTBs perspectiive.

       Solid analysis. I am unsure how long you've been looking into this stuff  but you seem to have a nice grasp of some things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you brought up Pearl Harbor, I feel I am obligated to mention The New Pearl Harbor documentary, which asks 50+ questions regarding the events of 9/11 (and Manetta's testimony is just one of these questions). It's a fairly long time investment (its in YouTube in 3 parts, and spans a little over 5 hours), but I have had friends that treated each one long a feature film and watch one part per night and finish in a weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous parallels between the Pearl Harbor surprise attack and 9/11. I highly suggest checking it out if you haven't already, and appreciate you watching the video above and commenting back. Its nice to see that here.

       Basically since it happened. Though i was only like 14 years old, i was totally wrapped up in it. I saved newspaper articles amd everything. Made a binder. Not long afterwards i started rethinking it. How was this possible? Ive seen tons of movies about plane hijackings, and i knew thst our government had certain protocols for this exact event. But, my government failed. I wanted to know why. More importantly, i wanted to know why nobody lost their jobs. That began my journey down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the pearl harbor connection, i thought about it before it was formerly introduced to me. They had radar back then, yet a bunch of planes conducted a surprise attack, originating from across the pacific? Ive learned a lot since, but i still reserve my beliefs in a compartmentalized fashion. For instance, i dont believe in the whole controlled thermal nuclear detonation stuff (i just recently heard about this one), which i find is laughable. But the thermite idea holds the most plausibility, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, i feel like it was originally an organic terrorist attack. It was faulty, and shouldnt have succeeded. Yet it did with amazing success. So i tend to feel that they had help in fscilitating the attack, rather than it being 100% a false flag. Does thst make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       My most surprising shock was the non-compliance of FAA protocol regarding planes devisting from their flight path and loss of communication. Per protocol, they shouldve scrambled jets immediately (or at least much, much sooner) with the right authorites being notified. Per the official timeline of events, there are so many holes and inconsistencies that just dont make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, my biggest question is why did nobody lose their jobs for criminal negligence, at the least? Somewhere along the heirarchy somebody didnt do their job. And this should be easily discerned. But we have nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why i connect 9/11 to pearl harbor, personally.

       We agree on most of the big parts at least, which I think is a great point in discussion that's refreshing to see here when oftentimes posters will be arguing about those nuclear detonation theories or any other silly disinfo that curious people unfortunately fall for (which then makes the rest of us look like idiots.. it's perfect really).
      </p>
      <p>
       I too, think it was an organic attack, but most certainly either facilitated or investigations towards the prevention were sabotaged in some way. Those 'in-the-know' ensured it would happen, quickly established a patsy, capitalized on the situation, and enacted a variety of projects and protocols designed to make billions by capitalizing on the American War Machine (this should sound familiar to anyone who's read Smedley's book), restricting freedoms in America (PATRIOT Act) to control its population more, and then go on an international war tour for natural resources in the Middle East while global goodwill was at its peak.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most troubling things I found about the last decade is the similarities to the playbook for Nazi Germany (ding Godwin's law, ding Godwin's law). Those 'in-the-know' ensured it would happen, quickly established a patsy, capitalized on the situation, and enacted a variety of projects and protocols designed to make billions by capitalizing on the

       (The

       ENABLING Act) to control its population more, and then go on an international war tour
       <del>
        for natural resources
       </del>
       funsies in

       Europe while
       <del>
        global goodwill was at its peak.

       the world watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I saying that America or its political leaders are Nazis? Not even close.  It's clearly a playbook that worked before, so why not try it again? Political ideologies really don't matter when you just focus on the outcomes and what has transpired lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       My nephew's at the point in the American education system where he's learning WW2 history and asked me about how the German citizens were OK with how their government conducted business the whole time. And I think I finally have an answer for him next time I see him. I'm just going to ask him to look around and wait until he figures it out himself (while giving him a nudge if necessary), because I find the journey to discovering these things is the only way to 'wake up,' it's nearly impossible to convince people. They need to want to know and discover it themself.

       As an analogy, i could point out that just because one reads and then utilized the concepts contained with the book called "the art of war" that this doesnt make them chinese. Just like you said, its a successful method of obtaining things for your advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how you put things. Very clear and concise. I also believe the journey is whats important for one to "wake up." Reminds me of the debate in psychology class about nature vs nuture. As humans, we all are inherintly curious and skeptical of the unknown. But if our life experiences set us toward a certain path, it is incredibly hard to force the reins towards another direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the lesson your nephew (and many youngsters) must learn involves how politicians speak towards your interests. Sometimes thats an honest gesture. Sometimes there are ulterior motives. Also, hindsight is 20/20. Hitler built up the german confidence when it was shattered. He earned the respect of his populace first. He was suave, charismatic, charming. He said what they wanted to hear. He was even elected (if my memory serves me accurately). Then, once he had all the legislation in place, and enough blind and faithful followers, he flipped the switch towards what he had wanted all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same could be said about our current system of governance, at least speculatively (not yet definitively) so. All the patterns ive noticed seem to be headed down a road where the constitution becomes more and more forsaken in favor of more oppressive legislation. 9/11 and the patriot act helped illuminate this for me. Though, i love my country and the foundational beliefs it was built upon so much, i struggle to believe we are on a collision course with tyranny --- the very evil our fore fathers fought to eradicate. Though, patterns are patterns, and currently it seems that tyranny is on our doorstep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time will inevitably tell. In the meantime, i constantly try to fit the pieces together. Which brings up another frightful point: propaganda is so effective, that it makes it hard to believe anything but the official narratives. So, its almost like an all in or an all out kind of situation. Thus, i prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

       It really is unfortunate that this conversation is most certainly burried in a side-thread on r/conspiracy of all places - because it's one of the most refreshing conversations I've had on this site since I started lurking years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your final sentence - it is much what I'm struggling with now. Preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. At least, that's what I used to be doing. The planning itself was more theorizing and planning steps and things to do should some unfortunate things happen (and I think it's coming sooner than later, not to be a pessimist or anything).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have realized that preparing for the worst and hoping for the best is in it of itself a selfish thing (at least how I was going about it).  The way those 'in-the-know' got into power in the first place is building up trust and focusing on the youth. There is an entire generation (my nephew's) who are almost at that age when
       <em>
        something happens
       </em>
       , for us it was 9/11. What will
       <em>
        theirs
       </em>
       be?
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope is that it is when it does happen, people like you and I can use it as an opportunity to start educating those around us (as well as the youth) of the farce of the event itself. These beheading videos have been a nice primer on how to show my friends and family what the news says happens, and then what the video actually shows.  You can see the gears slowly start moving - and some will inevitably start to ask themselves:
       <em>
        If the news, my source for factual information, is was at the very least not completely truthful regarding this story... what else have they said to mislead me?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's all we really need, in my opinion. The 9/11 event was most certainly a master stroke that caught most by surprise and the populous bought it hook, line and sinker and haven't really thought about it since. If you ask a random stranger on the street about 9/11, regardless of the research you have done, and the details that you know -
       <em>
        the mere mention of it
       </em>
       causes most to immediately write you off due to how effective of a
       <em>
        psyop
       </em>
       it was. Partly this is due to how long ago it was, how dramatic it was, and its effects and ripples throughout the past 13 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once the populous starts distrusting the Official Version of things, the pendulum will shift.  And there's some optimism to balance this stream of thoughts out.

       Personally, ive been preparing by gaining skills and knowledges i otherwise wouldnt have had interest in. Particularily primitive survival skills, fire building, food and water procurement, water filtration, even agricultural tidbits, martial arts and self defense, basically, intellectual preparations. I have even gone as far as learn other languages, i am currently learning tagalog, but i have also started russian and i already speak german and a little spanish. I will soon begin arabic, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is im focusing on mental preps rather than the pysical ones, as intellectual properties cannot be forcfully taken, and they do not expire. Any physical preps i do only support these things, like magnesium fire startes, sharp, durable knives, even dryer lint for kindling. I have also started to take back control of my health, through diet and exercise, as the malnourished, overweight, obese, sickly, and unfit will perish first in any shitty situation. Plus, it has the added benefit of taking back sovereignty over my own body away from the vice grip of big pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is similiar to the message awhile ago from the CDC about the zombie apocolypse. Prepare for that, and inevitably you would be prepared for hurricanes and other natural, more realistic, disasters. Its the same kind of concept, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       On to your last statement, i agree, while remaining reluctant to bekieve we will get that far. If our governments and the alledged powers that be truely are malicious folk, they woukd certainly be observing this trend amd would set the powder keg off before we have a chance.
      </p>

       Heres to optimism! But unfortunately i have a feeling the pessimists might win this time...

       I'd think it would be more likely to see someone try to fly 200 ft off the deck across the Mediterranean to strike Rome. The Vatican would make a juicy target and spark a true religious war.

       Israel is too well defended. They have a navy on high alert right now (busy blowing up Palestinian fishing boats) and an air force and ground to air defenses keyed-up for any intrusion.

       You think so? The Vatican is it's own country isn't it? Besides, how much 'more' at war could ISIS be with the rest of the world? I mean, they already stated they want every last person to conform or die. Doesn't give much latitude in interpretation of that message.

       Who is "us"? I'm not part of the intelligence community so it's not my job to worry about national security here in sweden or elsewhere.
If we - as in the public - in your mind is the last defense against ISIS and their agents, we're all completely fucked.

       I find it very hard to believe this is the case.

       Us = whoever is their target. But it also contains the general populations that may become victim to embellished fear mongering in light of this "threat."

       Im ignorant to the policies amd ideologies of sweden, but here in america there are more guns than people, and plenty of folks willing to throw down to protect ourselves. So, naturally, id disagree to the notion that we would he completely fucked, especially concerning the fact that ISIS is hugely outnumbered in any situation. They may get the first attack as a suprise sucker punch, but i heavily doubt they would be able to perservere in any elonged conflict on american soil.

       I saw a video of ISIS executing large amounts of innocent people at an airport... and the uploader provided an aerial shot (similar to what google maps look like) showing how large the airport is and how many aircrafts were there. I couldn't remember how many though.

       If you tip Morocco + terrorism, you'll see that Moroccan army installed anti air defense in case of terrorism actions !
Algerian Stats also did this. 
According to CIA and Maghreb Amy (Algerian or Morocco), those countries might be the target

       I would like to respectfully disagree on this. They didnt have to necessarily order a stand down, so much as facilitate criminal negligence or to hesitate just enough. But, other than that, im with you.

       Personal preference, really. But also because i do all my reddit perusal on my phone, and i dont want the videos to drain all my battery life. I find i can get much more things accomplished through discourse rather than observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly just dont find much value to the videos on reddit, as it is much harder to quote videos, and thus facilitate dialogue on the subject matter. But, i will still support others who find value in them. To each his own, you know?

       Basically since it happened. Though i was only like 14 years old, i was totally wrapped up in it. I saved newspaper articles amd everything. Made a binder. Not long afterwards i started rethinking it. How was this possible? Ive seen tons of movies about plane hijackings, and i knew thst our government had certain protocols for this exact event. But, my government failed. I wanted to know why. More importantly, i wanted to know why nobody lost their jobs. That began my journey down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the pearl harbor connection, i thought about it before it was formerly introduced to me. They had radar back then, yet a bunch of planes conducted a surprise attack, originating from across the pacific? Ive learned a lot since, but i still reserve my beliefs in a compartmentalized fashion. For instance, i dont believe in the whole controlled thermal nuclear detonation stuff (i just recently heard about this one), which i find is laughable. But the thermite idea holds the most plausibility, imo.

       Nonetheless, i feel like it was originally an organic terrorist attack. It was faulty, and shouldnt have succeeded. Yet it did with amazing success. So i tend to feel that they had help in fscilitating the attack, rather than it being 100% a false flag. Does thst make sense?

       My most surprising shock was the non-compliance of FAA protocol regarding planes devisting from their flight path and loss of communication. Per protocol, they shouldve scrambled jets immediately (or at least much, much sooner) with the right authorites being notified. Per the official timeline of events, there are so many holes and inconsistencies that just dont make sense.

       But again, my biggest question is why did nobody lose their jobs for criminal negligence, at the least? Somewhere along the heirarchy somebody didnt do their job. And this should be easily discerned. But we have nothing.

       Thats why i connect 9/11 to pearl harbor, personally.
