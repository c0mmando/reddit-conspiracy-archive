You look at places like China, who no longer accept the fiat currency, just finite resources and precious metals, they know what&#39;s going on... They know the fed is single handedly destroying the economy, with the 19 trillion dollar debt they have acquired, the $85 billion dollars they print every month and lending it out to banks at basically zero interest rates...  To be honest, I have a very rudimentary understanding of finance, and the stock market, however, it&#39;s really fascinating so I&#39;m hoping to see some good posts here...</p>

<p>So has anyone else been investing in gold/silver/precious metals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple ounces of gold and about 150 ounces of silver.  I have also been gathering my skills in growing food and animal husbandry after I moved out of the city and onto some land in the country.  </p>

<p>I am not sure what will survive but I am fairly sure that anything associated with the US dollar will lose atleast 60% of its value in the comming future.  That means stocks, bonds, mutual funds and anything not based on real assests.  </p>

<p>I would say invest in ways you can get food, energy, water and shelter when things go south.  Then start to stock up on commodities like, salt, sugar, seeds, spices and other foods that may store for some time.  If you have extra left over grab a bit o silver and or gold but I dunno if this is a good idea or not yet.  I have seen so much advertising for both of these commodities that I am starting to wonder if there is much valitity to the claims.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dollar will indeed collapse. It is inevitable. Every fiat currency goes to zero. Every one in history has. You see the dollar weakening every day with every deal countries ink allowing them to trade in currencies other than the dollar. These are just nails in the dollar coffin and the dollar falling from center stage as the world&#39;s reserve currency. Someone mentioned the stock market. Terrible place to put your money right now. It is an artificial bubble created by the FED. In a 3 year period from 2009 to 2012, 95% of income gains went to the top 1%(<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/some-95-of-2009-2012-income-gains-went-to-wealthiest-1/">http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/10/some-95-of-2009-2012-income-gains-went-to-wealthiest-1/</a>). The stock market will crash and crash hard. This is an elitist world, and when the dollar and stock market crashes, megacorps and mega automation corps will be the only ones left standing. Gold and silver&#39;s historic role as money will be insurmountable. Of course a world currency will probably be created. I digress. Now, precious metals. Silver is more volatile when it comes to price, but history shows that gold and silver were usually at a 16/1 ratio. I think it is at a 60/1 ratio at the moment. If old ratios came back into being, silver would be 80 dollars an ounce. Both are great to own, its all about preference. I buy silver, and try to every week. </p>

<p>I think it will be safe mainly because it can be traded all over the world for almost any major currency. This would imply some safety unless every single economy went down which does not seem that likely to happen. Why do you think it won&#39;t be safe? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;The Monetary Economy&#39; is really just a fase put in place around the world to keep us as the populous in a lower state of living. I&#39;m sure you sure how bit coin fluctuated dramatically in price recently. It&#39;s just as volatile and unpredictable as the rest. Ask yourself what&#39;s real. Your house, your clothes, your food and even your car are all real .. Money isn&#39;t real it&#39;s made up and controlled to a degree where 1 dollar isn&#39;t worth 1 dollar.

    <div class="md"><p>If some predications regarding the stock market hold true buying into blue chip stocks could still be a poor choice. If you invest tomorrow and the market drops 40-60% you won&#39;t have the assets to buy back in as stocks (supposedly ) start to march higher. If you are holding gold and the price doubles (because it is still perceived by most as a store of wealth) then you would have double your &quot;money&quot; to invest when the dust settles.

<p>Look at the Weimar hyper-inflationary episode and you will see that all paper assets (including stocks) and even property, lost almost all their value. Meanwhile gold became invaluable - in the sense that <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/GermanyHyperChart.jpg">no amount of Reichsmarks could buy an ounce of gold</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you defining as civilisation ?? Post Egyptian and Sumerian &#39;Civilisation&#39; ? Pre domoniatic nomads wouldn&#39;t have seen much use for gold. Aboriginals in Australia had a &#39;civilisation&#39; for 40 000 years that didn&#39;t value gold to any degree of status.. There&#39;s two off the top of my head. I think of all things real materials and skills are the way to go but we get caught up in this gold complex. Although legend has it the Annunaki came to earth to mine gold for their atmosphere so I don&#39;t really know it&#39;s true worth. I know from a universal perspective it&#39;s rare and valuable unlike say diamonds and maybe our ancestors knew this but otherwise we have lost all meaning and idea of the true value of gold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, there is clearly a global attack on the US dollar as a reserve currency (with Russia and China trading in their own currencies and  increasing gold holdings). Several countries have talked of using a basket of currencies for trade, so the descent of the dollar could be fairly rapid. </p>
