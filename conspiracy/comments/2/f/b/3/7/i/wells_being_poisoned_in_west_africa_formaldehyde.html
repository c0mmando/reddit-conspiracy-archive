       This is the way to control an Ebola outbreak, you simply fake it
      </p>
      <p>
       The poison is even going into bottles of mineral water according to the chap they caught
      </p>
      <p>
       "A man in Schieffelin, a community located in Margibi County on the Robertsfield Highway, has been arrested for attempting to put formaldehyde into a well used by the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports say around 10 a.m., he approached the well with powder in a bottle. Mobbed by the community, he confessed that he had been paid to put formaldeyde into the well, and that he was not the only one. He reportedly told community dwellers, “We are many.” There are  are agents in Harbel, Dolostown, Cotton Tree and other communities around the ountry, he said."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "The man also alleged that some water companies, particularly those bagging mineral water to sell, are also involved. The poison, he said, produces Ebola-like symptoms and subsequently kills people."

       Except it's not controlled nor is the WHO making an assumption that it's being controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       You linked to an unsourced and painful article. Please link me the scientific papers where formaldehyde produces Ebola-like symptoms. I'll wait. Only relevant search on Google: "ebola+formaldehyde" produces this reddit post and the article you linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, how would this make Ebola a false flag? Wouldn't this simply be a terrorist attack by a militant group (assuming your article isn't completely an absurd sham).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even going to go into why trusting an unsourced and poorly written article is a good idea.

       Nobody said that the WHO has make an assumption that this was being controlled, there would be no need for the WHO to be made aware of which areas were being poisoned or that is was deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article is the source, it will be used by other articles as the source.  There's an original source to everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would make Ebola a false-flag as this is a controlled poisoning rather than an outbreak of a disease.

       Yes but my point is that the only proof I've seen of any outbreak is in MSM articles that are just stating it as fact.  I haven't personally seen even one picture of a victim.

       When is that picture from?  I'm not denying that ebola exists nor am I even denying that there's currently an outbreak.  All I'm saying is that I haven't seen any proof that there is one or, if there is, that it's as bad as everyone has been saying.

       I was skeptical about this at first. Then i looked into the symptoms of formaldehyde poisoning. Bleeding from mucuosa, vomitting, diahrrea, pains, coughing, renal failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remain skeptical to the idea that this ebola outbreak is a hoax. But i can see the plausibility of some cases actually being formaldehyde poisoning rather than ebola infection, particularily in those cases that were found negative for ebola...

       So 5 days ago in Nzerekore a market was sprayed with 'disinfectant'  (likely Formaldehyde), this caused a riot as "some also reportedly feared the spray would spread Ebola".  How many of these people who were sprayed will go down with Formaldehyde poisoning and be diagnosed with Ebola?  This will then cause more 'disinfectant' to be sprayed elsewhere, so we're seeing the DDT/Polio scam continued.

       This reminds me of how they used to recommend DDT for avoiding Polio, parents would spray DDT around their houses and even on their food to 'kill Polio'...DDT poisoning had the same symptoms as Polio.

       Good point, so if the Ebola is actually Formaldehyde poisoning and the Formaldehyde is being sprayed on whole crowds then yes, so-called 'Ebola' is airborne.

       Unfortunately there are powerful people who will benefit from a perceived Ebola outbreak, it means they get to make a vaccine, that means they can start up highly profitable autoimmune diseases with the vaccine, leaving people on expensive drugs for life.  People will rush to receive an Ebola vaccine as the Ebola propaganda is scary.

       He is not asserting that it's the government spreading the disease. He is stating there is NO DISEASE! That the formaldehyde is just causing symptoms of such and the government is faking a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       You infer that governments can and do spread disease. Which I concur. However this is not the case here.

       I don't know if this is true, but I strongly suspect something is wrong with the Ebola story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing about this secret cure is an alarm bell for me... when the story came out about that I just thought "give me a break."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I say, I have no idea what is going on, but at least with respect to this secret cure, it makes more sense that it is not Ebola, but some kind of poison that there is an antidote for.

       Whole crowds are being sprayed with a disinfectant (likely Formaldehyde), they are rioting as they believe what they're being sprayed with is causing the symptoms.  The sympoms of Formaldahyde poisoning are bleeding from mucuosa, vomitting, diahrrea, pains, coughing, renal failure.

       Absolutely, also we've had so many films and so much propaganda preparing us for this.  Ebola has had so many years to have a huge outbreak, but it never happened, now in 2014 with so much going on in the world the Ebola outbreak also appears and is incredibly convenient for a number of global agendas.
