       "Stagnant." I think the best option is to walk away from all the honeypot data collection garbage that is all-pervasive. It's had a chilling effect on communications and it seems that was the intention of TPTB.

       Hijacking this comment to get this visible-- I've been going through the new+controversial sections this morning, and it seems like a lot of good posts are down voted so they don't get visibility. It's on us to sift through and find the good stuff so that everyone on here can see it.

       No, he is saying that there is opportunity in any crises and that people have modified their online behaviour as a result. He is suggesting that the result was probably a contigency at one point.  To not have a plan for that contingency would be uncharacteristic.

       Personally i feel that the propaganda against russia has propped up because the kremlin allowed snowden to seek political asylum. With the monopoly that is the UN member states and NATO basically being a majority of US puppets, they want to send a message that they won't tolerate letting him "get away".
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA leaks made the US and also the UK in terms of government look like school kids. Snowden basically gave them a wedgie, at least thats how the US/UK are feeling over the leaks.

       No. He's saying that Snowden is a "false flag". Snowden was allowed, or directly instructed, to reveal some of the capacity of the NSA to the public. This was done as a sort of "pressure valve" to get people used to the idea of 24 hour a day surveillance.

       I think there are much easier ways to spark global conflict than disappearing a plane with one set of people on it only to shoot it out of the sky halfway around the world with different set of people on it.

       That is very interesting.  VERY. 
I admit that if it was true, we have very bad things going to happen. I mean, if us/europe tries to blame russia for this plane...
      </p>
      <p>
       Two question though: 
1- What with the passengers who boarded in Amsterdam?
       <br/>
       2- If statement by Russian military about rotten corpses were true, they should publish some photos, make sure it spreads all over the world.
       <br/>
       Why they didn't?
       <br/>
       And do not say that is because western media, because they don't controll russian media.

       2 week syndrome (probably a better term). A problem of MSM if that it can only "hold" a story for so long, as they are considered entertainment by the board directors. People (well, some) need constant shifting stories  because of their short attention spans. 2 weeks of cablegate? Nah, let's go report on some penguins at the zoo. 2 weeks of NSA leaks? Nope! Time for the cat show!... 2 weeks of the Iraq war? ah no. I already KNOW ABOUT THIS, IT'S BORING IMA CHANGE THE CHANNEL. MSM needs ratings, constant new headlines, no matter how lame they are when replacing important "2 week" long events.
      </p>
      <p>
       After "2 weeks", the russia thing will be boring, and to boost ratings they'll have "2 weeks" of which ice cream melts slowest in direct sunlight. Something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the UK and child abuse investigations... I recall it was about "2 weeks" of Jimmy Saville. "2 weeks" of freddy star accusations, "2 weeks" of rolf harris, "2 weeks of westminster paedo ring". Now it's gone quiet, and currently it's nearing "2 weeks" of russia propaganda. Actually i consider MSM as entertainment because it's a mockery/pantomime of journalism.

       Both the NSA and militarization of police are very big problems in this country.  Michael Brown is just the most famous victim of the latter.  What happened to him could happen to any of us, if the FEMA camps don't get us first.

       To a degree.  There have been plenty of white people murdered by police.  I can think of two white people in my home state that have been.  I've read that in rural areas mentally handicapped people are murdered more often, regardless of race. There have been 75 people killed by police SINCE Michael Brown was.

       Man if all this shit was going on in Russia and people were just talking about the NSA, people would say no one was talking about Russia. There's a lot of stuff happening right now, and new information should be at the front. If there were new NSA leaks, they would be on the front.

       I apologize for not having the source handy :(.  I do believe I read in one of the articles about Ed Snowden, that Greenwald (spelling?) said releases would be periodic, on purpose. So that it is not forgotten. There will be more to come.  A wise strategy I would think.

       Yes, actually. This didn't start two years ago, mind you. The NSA has been around since the 60s (this is off the top of my head, could be even earlier). This isn't something I pulled out of my butt. Like I said, the NSA has been around for a LONG TIME. Something tells me that won't change your mind, though.

       The thing about propaganda is that it doesn't have to be widely believed to work. It can work simply by planting seeds in people's minds, letting their imaginations do the work.

       nothing new.. but nothing's changed either. The topic is just slowly fading into the background like white noise, eventually so much time will pass that the emotionally charged aspect of the argument (which is generally relied upon to motivate people to demand change) will fade. This is exactly what they could have hoped for, releasing information in stages to as not to overwhelm and create a critical backlash.... a lot of people say Snowden is a limited hangout and his purpose was to do just that, release the information over time expecting to rock the boat but not sink it... Just goes to show the NSA what they can expect to get away with in the eyes of the public :/

       Except if Snowden releases all the information at once, nobody would have a use for him, Russia or the United States. His life would be put immediately at risk. He has little incentive to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you guys are pretty imaginative around here, but stretch your imagination as much as you can and come up with the ONE THING that would sink the U.S. that hasn't been released already and that wouldn't likely drive more people mad working for the NSA like Snowden did, prompting them to release the info, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are left with are things like the United States govt. is being ruled by a shadow govt, Half-Life style by aliens. John Candy, the comedian, was a secret US CIA agent, or  that Tupac is still alive and living in Michigan. Everything that could sink the U.S. stretches credulity too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I'm limiting myself and not giving enough credit to the 'evil U.S. govt.' and perhaps there is a greater evil. If the U.S. thought it was in danger from its own populace, let alone from other countries from the revelation, why hasn't the U.S. invaded Russia to capture him? Or captured the Guardian guys when they had a chance when they could have potentially had the data?

       it's good to question, I honestly don't have any better answers than you do my friend. I was careful to phrase my sentence, "a lot of people say Snowden is a limited hangout..." for just that reason - I'm personally caught on the fence.. what I distrust is the fact that he has indicated his belief in the official narrative of 9/11, which is a big red flag for me because anyone with half a brain can see that those "facts" don't make sense or add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       "sheeple", "waking up", "sleeping masses" - these are all very negative black and white terms in my opinion.. We're progressing towards answers on a mass consciousness level, but on a personal level everyone must find their own truths in their own time. Those who would consider themselves "awake" seem very ignorant to me, because in a sense they're defining their awareness and limiting it to that stage of progression - there is always more to learn and discover! Like the Socratic Paradox, only the wisest man will know that he knows nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally, don't believe it will be one thing in particular that "sink[s] the U.S" - I think it will be many many things, speaking to many many people on all levels. There will be no one uniting core issue, but there will probably be a straw that breaks the camel's back. Everyone will have their own personal motivations/objections to the current socio-political/economic standards, and we're already seeing many of these issues come to the forefront in the way of localized political protests/movements. The lack of privacy, forfeiture of second amendment rights and lack of government transparency will likely be a key factor, but not the only factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I agree with you - Snowden is worth more alive than dead, so long as he retains this information.. especially if Greenwald has all the documents and intends to publish them if anything were to happen to Eddy. But then, what is the eventual outcome of this whole situation? Will it just be sat on indefinitely to secure his own personal security while the actual crimes themselves continue to be perpetrated not only on the American people, but worldwide?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a sad state of affairs... something's gotta give.

       I'm not entirely sure if it's deliberate. I mean there was less attention from the "conspiracy community" than I thought when the Snowden/Greenwald stories came out. Maybe people always assumed they were being spied on? I mean people who are doing seriously nefarious stuff never really used spyable (?) technology before and people who don't know/understand/care are going to keep using the technology anyway. The minority of us who actually care are not exactly going to keep things like Ferguson or Russia invading a fucking country from the TV for two seconds to tell Americans that their government does some shady shit. Most people's conception of government is state police so they probably already have a negative attitude towards the government and assume it does shady shit that they can't stop anyways.

       Maybe I can help with a tiny bit of perspective. I used to work in IT. I was the one instructed to installed some spyware on the office computers. All IT staff has been there, I think. You are told to keep quiet about it, which in the end doesn't matter. If you tell people about it, they just call you paranoid or you get "well I don't do anything wrong".  They don't WANT to know the scope of it, because its too frightening. The possibilities are so great, it is overwhelming for most people.  All the people I have discussed it with refuse to believe that anyone would use the capabilities unscrupulously.

       Funny, I have a friend who works in an office and has complete knowledge that her boss can see everything she does on the computer. She says the boss has even typed words on my computer remotely before. I guess you either dismiss it with humor or fear if you don't actually have the fortitude to deal with the scope of the spying capabilities as you said.

       Sorry for taking so long to reply, been busy. Now here, is an opportunity to have a good time! When you know for sure IT is doing its spot checks or the boss is watching, its a golden opportunity to have one of those instant messenger conversations purely designed for mischief!

       you'll also note that the "Isreal is horrible for bombing and killing civilians" uprorar is now very neatly back into it's traditional "those terrorist hamas" place.

       To me the whole deal with Russia feels the same as if Texas decided it didn't want to be a part of the US.  What do you think the US would do if Texas up and decided that?  Pretty much the same as what Russia is doing with Ukraine.

       Ukrainian crisis: Ignited by the US gov to force Russia into aggressive-defensive action so they could have a reason to place economic sanctions in order to counter Russian dedollarization efforts. In the long, also benefiting NATO. Seems as if the US are trying to take the economic war route for now. I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see "protests" in China...
People are not talking about the NSA because well..they are monitoring us, and the MSM is on State Department payroll. They will talk about whatever they are paid to talk about. The NSA is just an enormous violation of human rights.

       I don't think the US gov had anything to do with this. Its not in our interests to tangle relations over oil supplies. What does make sense (I admit I haven't looked deeply into this): the Russian economy is stagnating. Crimea is hugely profitable and a valuable tool in political economics. This is the oldest ploy known to history - when you run out of resources, steal your neighbors.  Have we already forgotten the incursion into Georgia? Putin isn't stupid. If you don't have many home resources to support your populace, you grab everything you can get for trade.

       Well, Im sorry to say this but the US government did have alot to do with this. It is greatly within their interests to isolate Russia. Its become their foreign policy. Just as a quick example, that I am a Ukrainian video that went viral, was created by a shady NGO funded by the US government. 
I urge you to watch this video:

       Ya know all those CIA coups that you read about in your history textbooks? Yea, those still happen, I can't understand why people don't want to believe that. And Russia, has plenty of resources, if anything, they are the resource powerhouse of the region. They didn't take Crimea for resources. They took Crimea, for its strategic importance, and they saw an opportunity to take disputed territory, before fell under NATO influence.

       Thank you for taking the time to answer and supply resource material. Much appreciated. I did not mean to imply the US gov is not involved - if anything involves large amounts of money, guaranteed they have their hands in it.  What I was trying to communicate (poorly) is that its not a government ploy to get the NSA out of the news cycle. The American attention span is notoriously short. Ever noticed every channel runs the same stories? Compare the words they use (the Daily Show did a skit on this once)- its obvious they are all reading from the same basic script. And lets face it, for the average american it is much more horror-thrill to bemoan the evil Russians than to look into the surveillance scandals. The majority of Americans are not going to publicly admit that they simply cannot grasp the gravity of it. Some that can are too frightened of the possibilities to deal with it. Better to stick their head in the sand. News of shenanigans abroad give them the diversion they want and need.

       Please do research! If you look into it a bit more you will see that the US government had a lot to do with it, just some googling and listening to recorded phone calls :) Trust me, its not just Russian propaganda.

       nothing new.. but nothing's changed either. The topic is just slowly fading into the background like white noise, eventually so much time will pass that the emotionally charged aspect of the argument (which is generally relied upon to motivate people to demand change) will fade. This is exactly what they could have hoped for, releasing information in stages to as not to overwhelm and create a critical backlash.... a lot of people say Snowden is a limited hangout and his purpose was to do just that, release the information over time expecting to rock the boat but not sink it... Just goes to show the NSA what they can expect to get away with in the eyes of the public :/
