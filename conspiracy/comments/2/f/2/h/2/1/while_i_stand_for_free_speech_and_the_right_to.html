       That's exactly why conspiracy theorists are so uncredible. You
       <em>
        speculate
       </em>
       to make up facts, but refuse to believe any actual facts. You'd believe if some "cop who was there said there were no bodies", but an actual witness who says the opposite? Fuck them!

       Just because it's disturbing doesn't make it real.  There are some very disturbing fictional works (movies, music, books, tv, games, etc).  How terrible the incident is doesn't have any bearing on the authenticity of the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that people cried, doesn't mean that any kids died, and even if they did, doesn't make the official narrative any more true.

       Are you retarded? Why would you even make that claim? You think they faked it and shipped all the families to Bora Bora? I know plenty of people that attended funerals. And the parents are still here.

      <p>
       How could anyone even remotely think that is a plausible conspiracy theory?

       A false flag for gun control? It's been almost 2 years, and gun control measures have been shot down all over the country. You're telling me that the government is smart enough to pull off this massive conspiracy but incompetent enough not to see it through?

       Bill O'Reilly was also disgusted by the 9/11 false flag and claimed it would be painfull for the relatives to have doubts. In reality quite a lot relatives demanded a real investigation and thought themselves it was a false flag after extensive research. Who cares what emotional dishonest appeals Bill O'Reilly shouts out?

       You come in here, not to add anything positive to the discussion, but to try to shut it down.  You say that we are wrong for asking questions.  You call people names, you attack the community.

       You gave no sources except your step-mom which could be entirely made up (even if she truly is an FBI agent, that means almost nothing). And because I like to rely on tangible evidence that must mean my IQ is deficient?

       Gross generalizations and personal attacks, real solid worldview there. Like I've said, I'm not 100% one way or the other on the whole school shooting "hoaxes" because I think that would indeed blind me to other evidence.

       You pose such great arguments and defense I think that I changed my official position on the said events which you know so much about and my opinion about. I don't know of something did or didn't happend but I do know that it's plain to see that there is plenty to be skeptical and suspicious about having nothing to do with your geographical location or employment of said family members. I hope you can remove the wool from your face someday and shed your appreciation for ignorance.

       Is she willing to share any information we haven't heard before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, just being there doesn't prove anything.  Can she make affirmative statements as to what she saw?  Did she see anyone shooting?  Was she there before or after the shooting?  If before, why was she originally there?  Did she review the security tapes from the cameras?
      </p>
      <p>
       All we want to hear are some affirmative statements about the events.  If she really knows something this would be a great opportunity for you to correct any misconceptions or confusion and answer some unanswered questions.  If you are just going to complain about the community and call people names you should probably leave this subreddit.
