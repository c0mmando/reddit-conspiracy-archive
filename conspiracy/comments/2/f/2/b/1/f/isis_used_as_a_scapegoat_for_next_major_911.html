       What do you all think about this ? I personally believe this will happen on or before the anniversary. Or possibly after when no one thinks anything will happen. Bam. They hit. Car bombs? Or MH370 used as a flying nuclear missile? Chicago? What's your input?

       Just seems telegraphed what with the reports of an insecure boarder, ISIS operating in Mexico, and Rick Perry, Bilderberg attendee, talking about the possibility of it.  I said Houston because it has the tallest skyline (three tallest are banking buildings), and I think largest population I didn't even look.  I went there once.  If it makes you feel any better, I live in Minnesota, and I bet there is something planned for here too, because of the canadian boarder and the twin cities.

       I'm not so sure it will be a traditional false flag, I expect a series of real terrorism to erupt at some point. Of course, the shadow gov is behind ISIS in the first place so it's a false flag in that sense

       I don't see how you conspiracy types are saying ISIS is a made up group of people-- what would be motivating them to behead their fellow Muslims if they were just a group devised by the west, which would actually make them less scary.  No ISIS seems to be real, that's what makes them pretty damn terrifying.

       And what would be the strategic angle of your hypothetical staged group, if anything it makes life more awkward for the US since we oppose them in Iraq and but support them in Syria?
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't deny that they way terrorist organizations are structured definitely allows for the possibility for terrorist to be in reality being controlled by a totally different entity, one that perhaps the rube terrorist lower down in the group would be opposed to. And it's pretty easy to imagine how controlling a terrorist group could be beneficial for a state, just read Orwell.  However is that really plausible in this case?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I have to say is only Islam would have a population of people ready and willing to serve and die for people whom they really have no clue of their true identities.

       Osama bin Laden was rich ass Saudi and the guy who funded terrorism resulting in the 9/11. The roots of extremist islamic jihad comes from Wahhabism, which originates for Saudi Arabia. ISIS is obviously funded by Saudi Arabia. And yet, we are invading countries that had
       <em>
        absolutely nothing
       </em>
       to do w/ international terrorism like Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq, while still sending billions in hardware each year to the Saudi's. Does that make any fucking sense @ all?
       <br/>
       ISIS is just the excuse for more American intervention in the Middle East to control the oil supply. It started w/ the invasion of Iraq. It continued with Libya. It's hapenning today in Syria. And it ends with the invasion of Iran. And it was

       That guy would've probably been the best candidate we could've elected given the recent batch of prez candidates choices we've had, too bad, I really wonder what stopped him from gaining widespread support-perhaps he was too blunt for the elites liking.  Obviously he is a member of the relative elite at least, but he doesn't seem to BS his audience like every other recent Prez candidate, clearly the guys running the show weren't enthused by that

       Rampant facism/communism for the 0.001% would be a better way to put IMO but anyways, what makes you think we are overlooking these things? I see tons of posts in here about banks and the reason we dont talk about the last one is because its not diminishing its gone. There is no dichotomy here do not create a false one.

       They want so badly to justify war with Iran.  They are going to use the "nuclear weapons" talking point, but that's pretty played out.  Then they could use a false flag orchestrated by israel, but people are becoming more an more aware of that scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks more and more like ISIS is going to be used to take down the regimes FOR us.  But if they are enough of a threat- terror/domino effect, then we can use them to justify dropping bombs and troops where we want them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the false flag is a really necessary piece of this puzzle- just the "threat".  But yeah, if you're listening to Cheney and the other neocons who are so excited about ISIS, it sounds like it's not out of the realm of possibility.

       It really bothers me that the feds are letting the border go to shit. They dishonor sir john drake sloat in his claiming of california for the united states. What's the point of fighting for a country when that country has no dividing line?! Is the disintegration of our border for a reason?

       Borders are the one place I understand being restricted. If you had open and free borders, anyone could just walk across as a john doe. If you're going to immigrate to a country, it needs to be documented.

       I think the theory that it's going to be a nuke attack via MH370 to be complete hogwash.  How'd the terrorists get the nuke?  I don't care how much money they stole (were funded) no terrorist organization has the resources to build a nuke and no state with one is going to hand it over.

       The ISIS attack is going to be outside the United States but against US interests.  It really doesn't take much to get the US into war let's not kid ourselves.  The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a bunch of boats shooting at a navy ship!

       OP here. These are some great ideas, criticisms, and general concerns. I've had a very eerie feeling lately. I just wish WE could do something about it, but realistically I know we can't. It's disheartening to say the least. Even the politician you agree with and are for if any is as crooked as the rest and that's unacceptable. It will come down to a civil war in America to make a change a Revolutionary type overthrow like in the 1700's. Militia activity is about to rise and I'm for that. I don't even want to bring children into this world we live in today. These are some rough times in the coming years. The dollar will fall. Economic collapse is imminent. China owns our debt so that will be lovely when that day comes. Maybe a nationwide Purge is an idea? Hell what do you guys/gals think?

       You have to remember that according to the Precepts of the Talmud, the Central Banking Jewry has full right to kill / depopulate you, and nothing is off the table, you already see it all: 
chemtrails, fluoride, vaccines, GMO, economic crashes, debt, inflation, media lies, diseases like ebola, false flags, terrorists, wars, taking away guns and Constitutional Rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you surprised at all?, you see their true ideology right there in the Precepts of the Talmud.
The Central Banking Jewry is doing all these things because the US Dollar is fiat and will crash, and to keep their power they will try to take all Constitutional Rights away.

       I've been thinking this for weeks now ,especially after the fake beheading video. I told my sister this and she asked where I thought it would happen,and without thought I immediately thought Chicago or Seattle. Don't know why,just a gut feeling

       9/11 style attacks are incredibly complex, costly endeavors...it's still fresh in our memories. All they need to do is get on TV, spout fear, and that is sufficient.  I doubt we'll see another massive (I stress massive) attack for a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything I bet we'll see an attack foiled by the Feds based on internet intelligence, thus justifying NSAs programs further.

        The 9/11 attacks cost somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to execute. The operatives spent more than $270,000 in the United States. Additional expenses included travel to obtain passports and visas, travel to the United States, expenses incurred by the plot leader and facilitators outside the United States, and expenses incurred by the people selected to be hijackers who ultimately did not participate.

       I was wrong, I was just vaguely remembering a news article - it only cost 500k:

       I  feel the opposite. I think there is a good chance of a massive attack, 100x worse than 9/11 possible at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it is biological, nuclear, etc. is up in the air but I think with the ever growing skepticism over our government, the dollar, and everything else in between is more of a reason to have a catastrophic event to create fear and panic so that "we will be begging for a new world order".
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is an attack foiled by the Feds it will likely be bullshit and would have been instituted from higher ups in the first place and foiled by people who don't know what's going on in reality.
