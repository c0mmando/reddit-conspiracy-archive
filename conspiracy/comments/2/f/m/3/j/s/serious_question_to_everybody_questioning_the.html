    <div class="md"><p>Some people in our government (parts of the fbi/cia/nsa, and dick cheney) knew about the attacks months in advance. They realized all the things that 9/11 could justify and decided to allow it to happen. Word spread among dick cheney and his friends, and that&#39;s why we see red flags in their handling of policy and money leading up to 9/11.</p>

<p>What I DON&#39;T think happened (unlike the majority of this sub i expect), is that there was any controlled demolition. I&#39;ve watched and read a ton of things from Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 truth, but after reading some stuff on r/changemyview on WTC7, I don&#39;t think there was any controlled demolition.</p>

<p>tl;dr: gov&#39;t allowed it to happen. that&#39;s as good as an inside job to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They whole &quot;planted explosives&quot; theory is a distraction, and I suspect it was deliberately encouraged on the Internet by Israeli agents to direct attention away from the actual Mossad involvement in the planning and execution of the terrorism on 9-11. When we waste time talking about planted explosives (which only a moron could believe), we are not talking about Mossad planning and Saudi financing of the operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan funded by Halliburton and the development of a global surveillance apparatus are the first two things that come to mind. One can argue that these things would have happened regardless of 9/11 (especially the NSA shit), but it would be a lot more difficult to &quot;justify&quot; these programs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why were these important enough to risk the alternative, which is Americans finding out that you allowed the murder of thousands of civilians?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really much risk associated with allowing it to happen (the rewards, however, are enormous). It would be very difficult to PROVE that anyone had prior knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real quick:The US and Saudi Arabia have a &quot;special&quot; relationship. They agree to trade oil in the US dollar, we offer them protection. SA wants all of the countries that would be a threat to them done away with. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran etc...Was plotted by US and SA, they needed an excuse to start invading and destabilizing these threatening countries, kid of like pearl harbor, (also a false flag) used a pretext for war with Japan. They needed a target, hooked up with Silverstien, who wanted to get rid of the WTC buildings due to problems with asbestos and stuff that would be too costly to fix. He insured the buildings for more than they cost to collect insurance money. Israel was also in on it because they are always being threatened by these same countries. Saudi highjackers were payed handsomely(or their families were) and there you have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. He wanted to make his money back(and then some), by collecting insurance monies. The way it stood before the buildings came down, they would have to be taken down anyway to fix these issues, and it would have costs him too much money. Those towers were not well built at all. Plus, the US need some kind of &quot;target&quot;, and the WTC towers seemed to fit the bill just fine. Do some research and come to your own conclusion like I did. Sorry, but I refuse to just stand by and let this corrupt government tell me what to believe. If you believe the official 9/11 story, well, then their plan is working to a T.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High-ranking Saudi families decided to commit a major act of terrorism. They financed the operation. Mossad learned about it and infiltrated it. It was decided in Israel that a major terrorist event would forward Israel&#39;s plans in the Middle East, so Mossad was told to aid and assist the terrorist group planning the 9-11 attacks. Mossad was able to draw upon US intelligence sources for vital information, when they fed to their agents, who gave them to the Saudi terrorists. Mossad was also able to insure that the terrorists were not arrested after they entered the United States, while they were still preparing for the 9-11 attack.</p>

<p>The attack was carried out. It was largely successful. Mossad documented the fall of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The Sauds put pressure on US officials  to allow top Saudi families to leave the US and return to Saudi Arabia. The Israeli government put pressure on US officials not to pursue inquiry into the &quot;Dancing Israelis&quot; and their Mossad connections. The Israelis were allowed to return to Israel. The US government, from the highest levels, assisted in a coverup <em>after the fact</em> of the involvement of Saudi Arabia and Israel in the 9-11 attacks.</p>

<p>There were no planted explosives. The buildings (all three of them) collapsed due to the impact of the two planes, and debris, and fires.</p>

<p>There was no certain prior knowledge of the attacks at the Pentagon, the White House, or the CIA. That is, they did not know in advance the exact date and nature of the attacks.</p>

<p>George W. Bush was not aware ahead of time about the terrorist attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NEVER, in history has fire brought down to buildings like that, EVER, until that day, explain that please. Also, EVEN IF, the 1 and 2 fell due to the &quot;high temp jet fuel burning&quot;, explain building 7. Just debris caused this building to fall? LMFAO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Saudi portion of this I&#39;m willing to believe. But why would Israel want to go as far as aiding and assisting these terrorist groups? For that matter, why would Saudi Arabia even want them to? I think that&#39;s a bridge too far. But I also believe the moon landing happened (on the moon, not in a tv studio)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Israel is more afraid of these countries than Saudi Arabia is. The plan was concocted by SA, the US AND Israel. They ALL three benefited from the &quot;attack&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudi Arabia doesn&#39;t even recognize Israel as a country. So they are suddenly going to join forces with them AND with the United States, to cook up a plan for terrorists to attack the US, because it will do what exactly? What countries are we talking about that Israel is more afraid of than Saudi Arabia? Sorry, but you&#39;ve lost me on this one. I&#39;m all for a good conspiracy theory but this one just doesn&#39;t hold any water.</p>
