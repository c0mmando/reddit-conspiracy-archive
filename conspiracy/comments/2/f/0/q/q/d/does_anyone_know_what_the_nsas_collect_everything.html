       Okay. Here is my point.If everything is collected then everything is known.Everything! You can hide nothing even in shadow.Because you can even see shadows move. And it is already too late by like 10 years. They have been feeding these computers for 12 years now. They know whatever their was to know about everyone. And add all that info in to a  super computer x that with a quantum computer and then divide the info with a self learning machine with the add values that all humans say are the best"Honor,truth,integrity,kindness that knid of thing" and get the truth of the world. Not the lies, not just what they want you to know. But the truth. And the craziest thing of all the people that are pushing so hard to do this  "all the people in power" POTUS,Congresses around the world whatever they are called, Representatives, Mayors,Councils,Cops have the most to fear from this. If I was to do this I would give them all this technology then say do whatever you want I got your back. Then sit back and watch. Because if you think about that is what is going on here. All these people use government issued phones and computers and when they don't it is even easier to see what they are doing because of the shadow effect. Hmm? I sometimes think it is not the dumbing down of America but of our leadership so the wouldn't even think to know how to stop it.

       Yes. But I think that my point. And living off the grid anyways makes you a terrorist or those people that they call prepors or something. Saw it in the news that cops want people to turn them in. And U-abomber I thought covered that bombing thing.

       Just to reiterate: my point was purely that if you want to live off of the grid, you can. No armed force is going to come, pick up your belongings and move them back into the city. And if people report you to the cops (which I believe is unlikely), so what? As long as you aren't doing anything seriously illegal they have no reason to bother you.

       More bored than anything else So I am not picking at you just answering. We live in the land of 10,000 rules and laws. You,me, everybody does 3 very serious illegal things a day. A day. Without ever knowing. And the way things work for the cops is the more people they bring in the more they get paid. Don't get me wrong there are some good cops. But If you are some weird freak in the wood that makes one person.Just one. Uneasy they are coming. I have never really done anything in my life to be afraid of the cops for. But they scare the shit out of me.

       If it really is that bad then citizens arrest a cop, use the system against them. And you have the right to resist unlawful arrests in America.

       If you're living in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, why exactly are they coming way out of their jurisdiction to bother you? I know you said they get paid per arrest but that isn't cost effective when there are certainly criminals in cities. For them to hike a hundred miles into a forest you probably did something. And even then it seems paranoid.

       Too much of a contradiction for me to even reply to. I've done a lot of illegal shit but I know my rights (and the statue of limitations) so I'm not afraid of cops while I walk down the street. If a cop attempts to talk to me without a warrant I just keep walking.

       Oh nice, I'm actually in Seattle. There's so much wilderness here, most people don't even understand the scale without having been to Washington. There are so many different places here that you could live your entire life and not be bothered by anyone. Pretty unique in my opinion.

       The tough hiding places are.hmm how to put it. Are.. Is ... You have to have a TON of cash like more money than god kind of thing. And all that means is that you are going last. There is no hiding anymore. It is to late. You can thank the people who made DARPA for this. This is their baby. And I am not against this. All for it really! Of all the ways we could go with this kind of power. This is the best. We are going to be all gods, Not just the same old same old"gods and clods". All humans are equal. I don't care about the planet or the cosmos. Just that ALL humans have the same rights as everyone else.

       Exactly - if you have a ton of cash and weapons you're probably
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       on the Man's radar.  If you're

        not,
       </strong>
       well then your absence will have been noted.  I'm saying it's pretty impossible to be invisible nowadays.  So our best bet I suppose is to be as vocal as possible, spreading as much information as widely as possible as quickly as possible.

       I don't think lost is the right word. They didn't just lose that plane whatever it was called. They just are not telling you. I learned in the army " if telling someone the truth gains you nothing or lieing then say nothing" Them telling you they "lost" it or that they "don't know" is like them saying It is not high on our list of to do. Plus you just can't lose a tanker they have more black boxes on them than planes do. And more than a fews ways to send a S.O.S. out. You don't just lose something like that.

       OK , Hid it for political purposes, although there is a news article saying that it was "lost", "missing" The point is  and I agree, if they want information they can get it and we cannot.

       That's our all powerful psychopathic overlords. I think we must find ways to disclose the sociopath  behind the curtain to take away his power.
