You can hide nothing even in shadow.Because you can even see shadows move. And it is already too late by like 10 years. They have been feeding these computers for 12 years now. They know whatever their was to know about everyone. And add all that info in to a  super computer x that with a quantum computer and then divide the info with a self learning machine with the add values that all humans say are the best&quot;Honor,truth,integrity,kindness that knid of thing&quot; and get the truth of the world. Not the lies, not just what they want you to know. But the truth. And the craziest thing of all the people that are pushing so hard to do this  &quot;all the people in power&quot; POTUS,Congresses around the world whatever they are called, Representatives, Mayors,Councils,Cops have the most to fear from this. If I was to do this I would give them all this technology then say do whatever you want I got your back. Then sit back and watch. Because if you think about that is what is going on here. All these people use government issued phones and computers and when they don&#39;t it is even easier to see what they are doing because of the shadow effect. Hmm? I sometimes think it is not the dumbing down of America but of our leadership so the wouldn&#39;t even think to know how to stop it.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But I think that my point. And living off the grid anyways makes you a terrorist or those people that they call prepors or something. Saw it in the news that cops want people to turn them in. And U-abomber I thought covered that bombing thing. </p>

No armed force is going to come, pick up your belongings and move them back into the city. And if people report you to the cops (which I believe is unlikely), so what?

<p>If it really is that bad then citizens arrest a cop, use the system against them. And you have the right to resist unlawful arrests in America. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are some weird freak in the wood that makes one person.Just one. Uneasy they are coming. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re living in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, why exactly are they coming way out of their jurisdiction to bother you? I know you said they get paid per arrest but that isn&#39;t cost effective when there are certainly criminals in cities. For them to hike a hundred miles into a forest you probably did something. And even then it seems paranoid. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Too much of a contradiction for me to even reply to. I&#39;ve done a lot of illegal shit but I know my rights (and the statue of limitations) so I&#39;m not afraid of cops while I walk down the street. If a cop attempts to talk to me without a warrant I just keep walking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - if you have a ton of cash and weapons you&#39;re probably <em>already</em> on the Man&#39;s radar.

<p>OK , Hid it for political purposes, although there is a news article saying that it was &quot;lost&quot;, &quot;missing&quot; The point is  and I agree, if they want information they can get it and we cannot.</p>
