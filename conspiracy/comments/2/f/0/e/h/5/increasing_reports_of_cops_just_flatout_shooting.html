        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is this for real or is it just some BS?  Frankly when communities have to sue the PD because so many pets have been killed by them, it does seem like they are doing it in at least somewhat intentional way.  So does this strategy really come from the military or counter-terrorism tactics?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for any info.</p>

<p>Edit: PS, I got an insta ban from r/military for asking whether it was a counter-insurgency tactic to kill dogs/livestock/pets emphasizing that I had heard some posters claim this, and wanted to verify whether it was true or not- NOT that I was saying this for sure.  Personally I don&#39;t know military tactics which is why I asked however apparently it is not allowed to have certain questions.  Shoot the messenger much?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Killing somebody&#39;s beloved pet is a great way of getting a law-abiding citizen to really, really hate the police, so it seems to me that this is part of a strategy whereby Police departments are deliberately antagonising - provoking - ordinary citizens. </p>

<p>The citizen has a difficult choice when their pet is killed: </p>

<ul>
<li>Brush away your tears, swallow your pride and accept you are powerless to do anything. You are now law enforcement&#39;s bitch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
<li>Retaliate and become a police statistic. Your punishment will serve as an example to others who are tempted to stand up for their rights.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do they shoot your dog? To intimidate! This is what is going to happen here soon, but worse. You will start hearing of people losing it and burning their (Police officers) entire homes down, with the entire family in it.</p>

<p>After about 25 of these, the police will start thinking before they act, because they will know they (and their families) may be next. But this is when the Feds step in.</p>

<p>So, I have to ask, what would you do if it was your senior mom, your 12 year old son, you 6 year old daughter, your 8 week old baby?</p>

<p>Would you take it or take their family as they have done yours? This is what creates what we know as &quot;Insurgents&quot;. It&#39;s not religious or political, its because they lose family members unjustly and decide to let them feel the pain they inflicted on them.</p>

<p>They are trying to create US insurgencies...plain and simple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a matter of time because the government wants this to happen so they can crack down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fools game at best, and one I will not play. I would rather use my voice and wake up more people in hope that the masses will garner enough strength to say no! </p>

<p>It&#39;s well within the power of the people to take this country back, but the veil has to be lifted so they can see. </p>

<p>That is our job at the current time. I have had my time in war, know the taste, smell, fear, anger and everything that goes with it, and I refuse to be a part of starting it when there is even the slightest hope of a peaceful resolution.</p>

<p>My children and grandchildren are here, and any hope we have is via our voices, not our rifles.</p>

<p>If you start a war against the people, you have sinned against your people. I am not saying there is not a time for war, but we are not there yet.</p>

<p>Next is that you can&#39;t win a war against our government. They have access to the printing press and debt.</p>

<p>You throw stones, they send in an Apache gunship. you fire a rifle, they send in an FA-18 Super Hornet, you build an IED, they drone you.</p>

<p>Again, you are playing a fools game and had better wake up before you do something really stupid. You will be dead, labeled as a terrorist and they will continue business as usual.</p>

<p>This is probably a natural result of the individual officer&#39;s zealous reverence for his own regalia. Dogs do not revere or even recognize the significance of the badge. A dog responds to aggressive threatening behavior in the same way, regardless of the lustre of the aggressor&#39;s brooch. For this reason, dogs are the arch nemeses of costumed authoritarian psycho/sociopaths and must be eliminated as a priority.

<blockquote>
<p>The incident was related to me separately by three state and local officials who worked with the community in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. One confirmed that he interviewed an eyewitness, a young woman, and pressed her on what exactly she saw. &quot;She said that the officer just let the dog pee on it,&quot; that official told me. &quot;She was very distraught about it.&quot; The identity of the officer who handled the dog and the agency he was with remain unclear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In western countries, and the US in particular, pets are considered members of the family.</p>

<p>As such, this is a HORRIBLE way to exert dominance. </p>

<p>Remember, when attempting to pacify a belligerent population, heavy handed methods are expected and necessary, however there is a line beyond which the methods to pacify only serve to further radicalize not only any opposition, but noncombatants as well.</p>

<p>The harassment of minorities/poor, convoluted incomprehensible laws, all the stupid fines and whatnot, all of that is tolerable. That serves the purpose you are proposing.</p>

<p>The killing of family members/beloved pets does not serve this purpose. It endangers it. Severely. Because if this becomes an extremely accepted and popular practice you change a very specific dynamic.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about if a cop is going to arrest someone or crack a head here and there, you start planning on where you&#39;re going to bury the body when (not if) you have to defend your loved one&#39;s lives.</p>

<p>I do not have children. I do not plan to. However, I love my dog. I rescued her when she was a tiny, mangy, starving, worm ridden savage. I took her in, I raised her, taught her, fed her, loved her, and if I think I can protect her from something coming down the pipe... well lets just say I value the life of the dog I have invested so much time and emotion in much more so than that of any random stranger. I&#39;ve done bad things in my life, most of them for no reason other than it seemed like a good idea at the time. I would have no problem doing another bad thing for such a good reason.</p>

<p>In the recent past I would&#39;ve called the PIGS (yes, it&#39;s time to revive that 60s expression), but now I really want nothing to do with them.  They can kill me or my dog at any time and pay no price, so I stay as far away from them as I can.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue I have with the PIGS expression is that while it may describe some people anger towards police injustice, it also has a ghastly tie in with the Manson murders which really makes it not a great word to bring back.  Plus it doesn&#39;t do much but fan the hate, I like KRS-One&#39;s statement on the matter he starts out by saying rapidly &quot;Officer,Officer,Officer&quot; and then slowly transitions the word to &quot;Overseer&quot;- which concerning Ferguson is a dead on observation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rather widespread reports of dog killings and other police, eh, injustices are mostly a police conditioning tactic. Stated slightly over-simplified, it&#39;s telling cops, &quot;Do what you gotta do to protect yourself and get your job done, even if it means it might be wrong/illegal because its your duty to maintain the peace/order,&quot; and, &quot;If you fuck up, you didn&#39;t fuck up because you were doing your job. We&#39;ve got your back.&quot;</p>

<p>It also has side-effects of steadily increasing the number and intensity of people to hate or think disfavorably of cops, and others. Killing 4, 5 or 20 birds of varying sizes with one stone/tactic is a common occurrence in their progression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are probably right on, it all comes down to a certain attitude and way of looking at problems that goes to absurd lengths to minimize risk for cops(example cuffing someone that has just been shot 6 times) while maximizing the risk of dealing with cops for civilians.  That is probably what is all behind this, however it would add some extra ammo and irony to anti-police state commentators if there just happened to be a counter insurgency tactic in some military handbook that advised killing people&#39;s pets and livestock while moving through populated regions to create an element of fear, dominance, and unpredictability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I realize it was a somewhat crazy question which I asked simply because I had seen that other people had suggested that it may be more than simple random police on dog violence.  However the fact is that there are several posts on here that suggest that in fact violence against dogs has been used as a political tool in several cases, Diego Garcia, perhaps in Israel, and during the Communist revolution.</p>

<p>While I admit myself can&#39;t really explain what anyone would get out of antagonizing American pet owners in such a manner, the fact that it actually has happened in the past should prove that it&#39;s not just total idiocy just to ask this question.</p>

<p>Plus in terms of craziness-- if someone told you that small American town PDs were going to be purchasing Apache helicopters, tanks, rock launchers, machine guns, and mine resistant mini tank like vehicles from the military in droves 1 year ago, I guarantee you&#39;d have tried to claim they were nuts.</p>
