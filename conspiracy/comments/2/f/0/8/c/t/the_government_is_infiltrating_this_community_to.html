<p>They&#39;re probably doing it in other subreddits to, to even further spread their rule and keep the average sheep to obey the government.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the other subreddits don&#39;t like us, the government could even be paying people to make conspiracy theorism look bad. Even though we&#39;re the only true adherents to facts and evidence in this modern world, the rest of them are just willing to listen to CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The single most important thing we can do on social media is to break political correctness. We need to violate it every chance we get, and we need to mock it when others attempt to apply it. That is the control mechanism that the elite are using on us to prevent a free discussion of ideas on the Internet. They can&#39;t censor all of us, so they have devised a strategy whereby we censor ourselves. That is political correctness -- self-censorship, reinforced by peer censorship, on any topic the elite decide must be off-limits. They use their control over media to indicate to the general population which topics are taboo, and the public has been so well trained, they almost immediately begin to attack anyone who discusses those topics.</p>

<p>Attack political correctness. Attack censorship. Stop censoring yourselves and say what you actually think and believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could only support this if your &quot;attack on political correctness&quot; doesn&#39;t include denigrating groups of minorities.</p>

<p>To me, this sounds like a thinly veiled call to bigotry, especially since it&#39;s coming from you.</p>

<p>We need, absolutely, not to cause further divides in our communities. Honestly, if there were any plan I&#39;d be wary of, it would be one like yours. The ruling class don&#39;t want you to get along with the different people you live around. It&#39;s an ancient tactic, divide and conquer. Minority populations deserve the same respect we give to everyone else, abandoning civility because of misinformed notions is only going to cause rifts and break society faster.</p>

<p>Treating everyone with genuine kindness, having empathy for all peoples and not immediately fearing your fellow citizen will go so much further towards undermining the plans for societal domination, than would abandoning civility in attempt to say &quot;fuk censorship!!!!1&quot;</p>

<p>edit: however, if it were an attempt to destroy the political correctness of american exceptionalism in this country, in an attempt to get the citizens to see that we do live in a corporation-controlled shithole, well I could easily get behind that.</p>

<p>Every small minute difference between the truth and a lie is interpreted by our brains</p>

<p>It&#39;s why it&#39;s so difficult to write convincing slang into a movie or sitcom or why fake anything is do difficult </p>

<p>Our brains know when something &quot;isn&#39;t right&quot; No one can articulate the sea of thoughts and deductions that comprise our thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Thin Grey Line</p>

<p>Human perception is a mess. I&#39;ve been around enough to know I can&#39;t, necessarily, trust even my own eyes. In this state it&#39;s easy...it&#39;s even <em>appealing</em> to think &quot;someone&quot; has <em>the answers</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m easily confused and led astray by my own interpretation of events. I rely on my fellow human beings to lend context. My default assumption is that in this soup of billions of people we&#39;re all very much pawns in a game that may, or may not, have a puppet-master.</p>

<p>I&#39;m puzzled by people who seem to think they are smart enough to positively identify the puppeteers yet not be one of them. These would have to be people capable of controlling 9 billion human beings. I don&#39;t tend toward that direction. I think the entirety of life on earth is extremely absurd and nonsensical. I used to ask the question &quot;why am I here&quot; but lately all I can wonder is &quot;what the fuck&quot;. How in the hell did 10 trillion cells, each as complex as a small city, form into a self-aware being called Jerry? Shit I can&#39;t even answer that and that is the core of &quot;me-ness&quot;. At my core I&#39;m an indecipherable monstrosity of complex interactions and I&#39;m just one of billions.</p>
