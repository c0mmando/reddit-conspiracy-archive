        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the &quot;ooparts&quot; stories like the hammer in rock. I&#39;ve seen the evidence for sphinx being tens of thousands of years older than the pyramids. I&#39;ve seen the Egyptology dipartment in Egypt continually deny discovery ventures and swooping in and covering up stuff or stealing and putting in warehouses. Now the recent stories are miners finding buildings deep in rock when mining for coal. But what I don&#39;t understand is why the secrecy what would it effect hiding it or lying about it. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s like super technology ( which I don&#39;t really believe) it&#39;s not like they can use it without anyone knowing about it. Also if ancient technology is just lying around I&#39;m 100% positive that sometime in history to today someone not powerful would have gotten their hands on it.   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;( edit) so I&#39;d say as a conclusion through all your posts a suppressed alternate history is due to some secret knowledge or technology. However if it is a technology it can be removed but artifacts and the history shouldn&#39;t have a problem being revealed because you took the rare weapon or dishwasher out. So I am swinging towards knowledge of some kind. Now For suppression because of government and religion I have argued that it&#39;s in history already government and religion is corrupt. Hence this sub reddit exists. So In that being said a prolonged history of super intelligent ancients or dumb ones will not change our out looks on government and religion because we already know (and were still not uprising). Also showing more history of governments/religion rising and falling cuz of corruption won&#39;t change  anything either because with the little history we have now we still know government/religion is corrupt. If u still have arguments to make ill still throw rebuttals at you so feel free your posts show up in my messages.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">42</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/runawayaurora.html">runawayaurora</a> 2014-08-30</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading a lot of your replies, and I think you have a fantastic inquisitive and questioning mind, paired with having done some research - you&#39;re making some great points and rebuttals... so let&#39;s look at it another way shall we? </p>

<p><strong>Warning: Wall of text incoming! I probably could have said just as much in half the time, but I really got into this explanation and have been in a hospital bed for weeks, so this was an interesting outlet for my boredom.</strong></p>

<p>Suppose we have a nice little society going on, much akin to the one we have today. Sure, it has it&#39;s issues but for the majority of individuals they see technological progress, scientific revolutions, they&#39;ve got work in the week to feel like they&#39;re contributing to the bigger picture and church on sunday to feel like they&#39;re connecting to a higher power. Now within this infrastructure, linear sustainability issues develop - maybe even like what we see today - poor agricultural management, reliance on a limited fuel source, economic instability etc. And somewhere along the line, those in positions of power/wealth, realized they could maintain that status by instigating one of the most profitable outcomes - War. It&#39;s good for the pocket book of those selling the war machines regardless of the outcome, but it&#39;s great for a country&#39;s image and nationalism if outcome is a &quot;win&quot;, or can at least be portrayed as such (coughvietnamcough). They&#39;ve long realized the history books are written by the winners. </p>

<p>Now to continue this analogy, lets suppose things get a bit carried away. The technology has progressed to the point where instead of swords and shields, they&#39;re shooting guns and mortar, and then dropping bombs and exploding mines, and finally - you have nuclear development. Somewhere a long the way they found themselves becoming more and more attached to this dangerous source of energy/protection, and instead of continuing to develop and refine it, they spend billions and billions arming ourselves for &quot;protection&quot; and creating the infrastructure to harness it without any longterm plans for it&#39;s toxic byproducts. Suddenly, the world is at a warring standstill, because the reality has quickly become: if one bomb drops, many will follow. With launch pads and targeting coordinates covering the globe, it would certainly spell disaster for the Earth and it&#39;s inhabitants.</p>

<p>And then one day, someone, for some reason, pushes the big red button. Countries retaliate, the masses fall into chaos, the majority of the population is instantly annihilated and much of the remainder will perish in the ensuing nuclear winter. This goes on for generations, we are a survivalist species now - gone are the days of waking up for school, gone are the days of abundance and variety, gone are the days where any choice was made that didn&#39;t directly affect whether the withering, remaining population lived or died. </p>

<p>But <em>somehow</em> there remains a collection of individuals who retain knowledge. Maybe these clans survived by inhabiting the supposed self-sustaining secret underground military bases, maybe they were in a remote area that, although becoming more hostile never became unliveable, however they did it - they did. They&#39;re the last &quot;keepers&quot;. They have access to the books they&#39;ve hidden away, and they pass on their ability to read, to write. In their libraries they have access to textbooks, to studies, to papers - they hold in their possession what remains of the technology of that civilization. They&#39;ve never seen a lit cityscape but they possess all they need to create a circuit, a lightbulb, a generator... Compared to the way the remainder of the civilization is upholding, they live relatively comfortable lives, and they use their time to learn...</p>

<p>That knowledge is their power. They keep it for generations, which puts them at a huge advantage over those that have never seen the written word, those that have never imagined a lightsource aside from their fires and the sun.To the outsiders, these individuals would appear as magic, as almost godlike, instantly creating a hierarchy - just as we&#39;ve seen over and over in our limited history. They rise into power, and they control the information. Amongst themselves, they decide how society will be established/maintained. They begin to see themselves as deserving of that reverence, they see their knowledge as bestowed, they see themselves as more inherently worthy, and they see themselves as deserving of respect - while the society they&#39;ve moulded continues to grow due to the information that they choose to disseminate. They see themselves as <em>responsible</em> for all that comes into existence on the earth, and those who would participate in their creation are fortunate souls that would occupy themselves with the menial tasks as they see to the oversight and continued expansion of their society. </p>

<p>This society develops based on the bubble of information they provide access to, they were the keepers of the information, now they&#39;re the keepers of order within that society. The hierarchy has been well developed by this point, there are poor and there are rich - however that may be defined in this new society. But alas, there must be poor, there must be &quot;ditch-diggers&quot;, there must be a bottom base to a pyramid, if there is to be a pinnacle. And they wish to remain at that pinnacle.</p>

<p>But what is this? A lonely adventurer has returned from a survey of land to be expanded onto and has found something not yet seen before. He brings it back to the keepers, and excitedly presents it before them - old machinery he had accidentally excavated in his travels... but how did it get there, if the keepers did not put it there? Machinery is a recent development in their society, through information and discovery slowly revealed by the keepers they had begun to rebuild old technology. But they&#39;re still clumsy, working metals by hand and hammer, and this new find is the cold smoothed surface of stainless steel - with precision parts and impossible detailing... The excited discoverer has told his colleagues and the news has spread, the masses are a buzz but now they are fearful and untrusting. &quot;Where did this come from?... Who made this and how?.... Is this the work of some power higher than their keepers?... What <em>other</em> information is being kept from us for their gain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;BLASPHEMY!!&quot; cry the keepers, oh no, this will not do - they will not allow themselves to be ousted. &quot;He&#39;s insane!&quot; They cry out, in fear themselves, &quot;He&#39;s a hoaxter! Do not be led astray by this fool!&quot; and they destroy the machine, from which they could have learned. They destroy it because it carries more truth with it than they would like, and their truth is the only truth - their truth keeps them seated high above their creation, <em>their kingdom</em>. The discoverer is discredited, shackled and jailed, he is mocked and pitied. </p>

<p>As the society grows, evolves and changes, the history books are written to reflect that which those in power wish to be known. Any discovery not fitting the storyline will be tossed out, until it reaches a point where it MUST be acknowledged. We have seen this in our own history with religion and geocentricity, and the mockery of Copernicus presenting heliocentricity - eventually confirmed by Kepler and Galileo... There are many many more examples, but this one is distant enough from our present to be portrayed in a more honest way in the history books.</p>

<p><strong>And thus the technology is repressed to fit the narrative of control by those in power.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol thanks for the compliment. honestly I joined reddit cuz I want to bounce opinions and argue and this has been the first argument I&#39;ve had in a month since I started that actually had people express themselves and back their opinions. It always turned out with grammar nazis or insults . I laughed at the Vietnam. Uh yea so technology seams the most likely for suppression because that would probably cause one swift change in mind. I think that&#39;s why Darwinism was allowed during it&#39;s time period cuz it wasn&#39;t a big deal at that time but cornepicus and Galileo were. The other thing I&#39;d conclude would be I don&#39;t think it&#39;s religion anymore that controls though it is substantially large. I think it&#39;s just the fattening up and very simple lives of the common that don&#39;t rise . Now with that being said this shit sucks. Forever trapped in the minority of conspirators and people who want knowledge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could not agree with you more. I enjoy engaging on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> even if sometimes it&#39;s &quot;a little out there&quot; - the contributors are generally well informed, critical thinkers who enjoy playing devils advocate and arguing all angles. </p>

<p>I also think you&#39;re right in regards to religion not being the controlling factor anymore. I would say straight up cold hard cash is. We idolize money, epitomize it by the idea of &quot;the american dream&quot; - which is an unattainable reality for the 99.99%, but it&#39;s existence keeps us reaching ever upwards and creating a competitive me-vs-the-world mentality that has us clambering over our colleagues and friends for that advantage... while those who control the majority of it, continue to alter the system to their favour through lobbying/bribing/buying out - and making it next to impossible for the rest of us to have any kind of self-reliance.... going so far as to limit our ability to even provide for ourselves agriculturally through recent passed laws... At the end of the day, I completely understand the motivation, and businesses are in business to profit - to produce quarterly results and increase shares, not to cater to the average joe... although that&#39;s not what their marketing would have you believe... We&#39;re literally being emotionally and psychologically manipulated every day into believing this or that about a corporation and it&#39;s products - it&#39;s literally cheaper to spend more on their marketing budget than it is to produce a better product or perpetrate their businesses with a sense of morality in regards to social/economic/environmental impact... but the reality is, we also continue to allow this because they cater convenience to us, after slave-waging us so we&#39;re to exhausted to care by the end of the day...</p>

<p>It&#39;s really sad we&#39;ve had to endure this bullshit as long as we have, but I truly believe we&#39;re making progress - people like you and I even TALKING about this stuff rationally is proof of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish that was all we needed but seeing the rest of the country (I live in the us) it&#39;s hard to believe people are changing . Also the new fun thing is misinformation and the leader that are being followed on youtube saying stupidities . I feel like one step forward two back. Not even the other day there was some article on cracked that was wrong yet it was for my case. I was arguing with me people on my side because they were blindly following making people like me look like an idiot. It&#39;s like that Facebook post some Christian chick said&quot; take that atheists the god particle exists&quot; I can&#39;t stand it. If there are fucking aliens or some shit I wish they can make a survey to filter out reasonable people and we can go somewhere else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not so sure about the religion part. I&#39;ve been reading quite a bit lately on reddit about where that money is being funneled. By such as the Koch brothers, the Green Family (Hobby Lobby). I stumbled onto the Blackstone Fellowship reading an article about a Superior Court justice declaring that freedom of speech only applies to christians. For many years I too thought that greed was the overriding factor in this decade. Now I am leaning more toward the idea that some amassed great wealth with the direct goal of gaining control of society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just say I was catering my replies to the OP of this post specifically. I&#39;m more inclined to agree with you, and would say it was like a combination of the ideology of those that positioned themselves to perpetrate these systems of control (rothschilds, rockefellers, sachs, kochs more recently, etc) , their amassed wealth and the paradigm they established under the guise of a free money market... trickle down effect being the false belief systems that we&#39;ve all been indoctrinated into regarding money, and thus our seemingly inherent greed. If you ask me, I think that greed and corruption are inherent in the system itself, not in the people... although for years I would throw out statements like, &quot;it&#39;s human nature&quot;, I&#39;ve come to an understanding that it is most certainly not in our nature to be competitive, but we were bred into a competitive environment due to the perception of limitation (i.e. not everyone can be a millionaire, there&#39;s not enough food to feed the world, fuel is a limited source, etc etc). How do we manage to navigate our days by holding two opposing ideas like, &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot; and &quot;I cannot be successful without a lot of money&quot; in our heads, without going crazy?! We are a schizophrenic society! </p>

<p>Religion wise, the general population would say we&#39;re referring here to &quot;the church&quot; - i.e. Catholicism and the Vatican. Which more or less DID run the world until the scientific age began several hundred years ago.. And even then, wealth was a big part of it - but control of information/fear was certainly their biggest asset. Then you see these centralized banking schemes begin to really take a foothold in the 19th century, and the constituional charter in the U.S was supposed to eradicate those types of institutions in the west.... but through strategic moves and lobbying, families (specifically the rothschilds/rockefellers) funded the creation and political backing of the Federal Reserve... Centralized Debt-based Banking reared it&#39;s ugly head again and now officially dominates the global economic market.. </p>

<p>I was avoiding bringing in the whole shadow-gov/brotherhoods because it was more conspiratorially minded than the thought experiment I proposed, and most people don&#39;t equate those ideas to the religious factors that motivate them- but you have a completely valid point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao do u speak English fully properly? Do you encoreperate slang when you speak ? When I type in a forum am I gonna type like I&#39;m handing in a research paper ? Am I gonna type so I&#39;m understood and that&#39;s all for ease? Stop being a dousche I&#39;ve been getting compliments for my points so it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about you just choose not to listen or you just argue to be an asshole. Instead of posting one word explain urself. No one knows whatever celebrity or watever your naming . I&#39;d rather hear your opinion</p>

And speaking of cockiness, your response to that post is exactly why I&#39;m coming off as cocky to you. Instead of just quickly looking up the name and seeing who it is (which would have taken 2 minutes) you instead replied by saying <em>&quot;who the fuck is that?&quot;</em>. How do you think people on here are going to react to a response like that? Do you talk like that to people in real life? I&#39;ve been in this group long enough to know that the poster&#39;s in here are mainly mature, respectful, and polite. We have respectful discussions about topics that often get looked over by the mainstream, and we&#39;re respectful to each other, for the most part. </p>

<p>This is where you&#39;re completely off base. This isn&#39;t a discussion where we spoon-feed you our findings and information, this is where we have an open discussion about a certain topic, and share information with each other so that others, like yourself, can learn and engage more often with our discussions. In learning, we&#39;ll give links, names, topics, etc, so that you can go read about it, or watch youtube links, and learn more for yourself. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard the explanation for that, when the Bible was translated to English (since it was originally in Hebrew) there where some words in Hebrew that English didn&#39;t have, one of these words was the one about the &quot;7 days&quot; but it was more of &quot;7 periods&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One reason is that science has become the new religion in many ways. Scientists are becoming more influential and as that happens hey start doing things more like the churches did. Things such as ostracizing people with different thoughts on reasons certain things happen the way they do and stuff like that. While I agree that a lot of alternative theories seem kind of whack some of the electric universe theories and what not seem to be well thought out and not crazy. Also climate change and most of the other science related posts in here.</p>

<p>I mean, it just makes sense that we would harness the energy that literally exists all around us and has allowed life to perpetuate instead of trying to create unsustainable, crude combustion style devices... but having a limited fuel source creates a regulated market, again - at their control. Supply and Demand. If we looked at solar energy, wind, EMR, geothermal, tidal, hydropower - these sources are literally inexhaustible - but where there is continuous and unlimited supply, there is no need for a market to meet demand.... </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they had microscopes or hadron colliders, but I do know that some ideas have been known for eons. For example, the Hindus were aware of the great year, a concept Plato understood as well. Have humans been around long enough to document this cycle? possibly. We only know what has survived. There are hints that astrology (not the daily horoscope) is the measurement of the sun&#39;s behavior in these cycles. Of course you will find this in the occult. Are there a select privileged few that hold these secrets and more? Yes. Why would they keep them? To control the population. Control of the herd is crucial for any society. </p>

<p>Do I believe there are underground cities? Yes. Because there are. Does Shambala exist? I cannot dismiss that fact that a powerful govt, under the Nazi regime spent the resources to try to locate it. does remote viewing exist? I cannot dismiss the idea that both Russia and the US have invested into this. </p>

<p>Anyways, the only conclusion that I can say with certainty is there is more than meets the eye.</p>

<p>there are more sources out there. When I started down this trek, I studied Hinduism since that was the oldest.   They have many deities, which are in fact just different aspects of one god.  </p>

<p>the vibrational sounds from some words can affect the pituitary and pineal glands.  You can try it our for yourself. Chant the alphabet and make a note to which area your body vibrates. But a reminder, small actions done over time equal greater results. So if you decide to stick with a chant be aware that you can create a daily psychological state, not all of them are good. </p>

It is less susceptible to the environment, but it still is influenced by it. you can find information out there but ultimately it is on you.

    <div class="md"><p>well they operate upon free will. they make it out there to us but dont support it. so in the end they dont look bad amonst them selves by saying &quot;we gave them a chance, the info was out there&quot;. thats why you see so many symbols around, they are literally saying &quot;we are here&quot; in your face but people go &quot;those are just coincidences&quot; or &quot;it wouldnt be so obvious is it was true&quot;.</p>

<p>freemasons feel like good guys giving us the info but not confirming it. its upon our trust and free will to decide what is true and isnt. its obviously out there when you know. </p>

<p>reminded that not all freemasons are bad but for the most part that is why the info is out there and not hidden. for sure they hide real stuff like rituals and bloodlines and stuff. but that itself isnt even that hard to find clues about. </p>

Imagine if it got out that we were genetically modified from homo sapiens crossed with &quot;alien&quot; DNA. It would be crazy.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s this about the coal miners finding something? Hadn&#39;t heard about that yet.</p>

<p>So, if there were advanced ancient civilizations that were capable of building these massive monuments that stand the test of time, then something happened to them, and I think cyclical geological disasters play a role in that every 10,000 years or whatever it is. So civilization goes up and advances to a point and then it all crashes back down to zero, and maybe this has happened a number of times. That&#39;s why we had to finally build something(stone) that would last longer than a century or two post-disaster.</p>

<p>I think the difference between us now and us then is that we utilize oil and it helped spark a exponential population boom which could never be dreamed of by our ancestors. So, if you&#39;re like David Icke or someone like that you&#39;d think that TPTB would welcome a geological disaster or are even trying to foster one to &quot;cull the herd&quot; and go back to zero because they think population is getting out of hand. So, do they and their secret society network have any passed down knowledge of these ancient technologies? Maybe. And I think it&#39;s at least plausible that it connects with ETs somehow.</p>

<p>Not sure where I&#39;m going with this. Kinda rambling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok the context of the post is why cover up a history. Your reply religous ignorance my rebuttal if it is religious ignorance the one thing that is completely against values for religion is evolution and creationism in religion and in science everything stays the same ( gravity,astrology,bacteria,weather,thermal dynamics etc EVERYTHING) so if evolution goes against creationism or religion, and history goes against religion and it is covered up.

    <div class="md"><p>Science is necessary so it must trump religion for us to have a modern society  but religion has a hold on the minds of a plurality of the population so both must be accommodated. </p>

<p>The dualism is hard to sustain but it must be sustained in the current situation.</p>

<p>Therefore the fundamentalists can still fund raise and campaign on the maxim that &quot; evolution theory is the work of the devil&quot; with a straight face, but they can&#39;t actually quash it&#39;s scientific basis. Science is by default anti religious  but religion within government  still controls much of the funding of science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like your only furthering my point are we arguing the same point. If religion is the majority and religion controls the government then killing the people who aren&#39;t in religion would be done or shutting them up since it&#39;s such a small majority . I wouldn&#39;t give air time on tv to a evolution scientist or let it be taught in the text books. So again y cover up a longer history if things against religion are allowed.

    <div class="md"><p>Roaches in the computer don&#39;t know what they&#39;re crawling over until it zaps them. Maybe though, there is something that elucidates towards the idea that that warmth isn&#39;t actually natural, its something created by another something that they have no idea existed. Perhaps there are myths passed down in the form of religious stories that explain how these things came to be.</p>

<p>I always like reading Genesis with a modern point of view. I mean, creating another human from a rib bone? Sounds like genetic cloning to me. Fiery wheels in the sky? To the uninitiated human in the past, this could be a rocket or a comet - even a meteor. Maybe it was some sort of flying something?</p>

<p>But to your question, why hide it? Because knowledge is power. And right now the power is in the hands of a few groups of people. Religion has its leaders, political movements theirs, etc.. etc.. If there was a paradigm changing occurrence; like if extraterrestrial tech was found or proven, then it would throw the current status quo out the window. Things would inevitably change and humanity MAY JUST STOP looking at its feet and instead, look up. Maybe we&#39;d stop fighting each other. Maybe we&#39;d decide our banking system is fucked and we should get a new one to support a galactic species. Maybe we&#39;d also decide the way we have our systems of government is also not conducive to being galactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If things are in public view, regardless of the content, can it then be considered truth? </p>

<p>I think that is something that only the beholder can answer. I would assume that since humanity has some sort of collective consciousness, that things like technology achievement will happen regardless of any attempt at suppression. If someone invents something in one part of the world, it is only a matter of time before a similar thing is &#39;invented&#39; in another part. </p>

<p>There is most definitely MANY things that are kept &#39;secretive&#39; from the public, from things like government data to things found on this planet once we had satellite tech. Does that make it &#39;wrong?&#39; Well, not really, but it certainly can paint it in another light. </p>

<p>What you are sort of asking, at least as I reread your comment, is pretty much like The Matrix. </p>

<p>When Neo figured out that he was in a computer simulation, what then was truth? Everything that was experienced in the matrix was false - it was an illusion. Although some could be considered &#39;truthful&#39; (i.e., agents are part of the code, physical laws can be broken, the machines do exist), it took him figuratively &#39;dying&#39; to realize this fact. </p>

<p>If the things we experience daily are uncovered and therefor not true, then we truly live in the matrix.</p>

<p>Time will tell. In Star Trek lore, the Earth went through WW3 and billions of people died. Afterwards, the people who were left went through a period of rebuilding and during this, they became galactic and no longer needed governments and banks as we have them today.</p>

<p>Not saying its true, but its a plausible outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a premise; I&#39;m working on it for [WP]:</p>

<p>Homo sapiens are the genetic ancestors of earth-bourne primates and an elder species we&#39;ve discussed called &quot;the tall-whites&quot;. They are blonde/white haired tall nordic looking aliens of the 12 species we&#39;ve communicated with.</p>

<p>An unknown species used some of their stolen genetic code for research and infiltration purposes. They developed human life here on earth, using local genetic code along with the Tall-Whites. The Mayans worshiped them. They either lost their war, got sick, or were driven off by other, more benevolent species. Before that time, they had great events sending their various races of mankind against one another in war. And then the Olympics.</p>

<p>At various points in history different species have had a guiding hand. The Illuminati is made up of the very few humans &quot;in the know&quot; and a varying number of other species. In general, the overarching purpose of this governing body is to prevent wantonly aggressive species from developing certain technologies. One strategy is increasing the Darwin effect and cultivating wars to weed out the aggressive, and to keep population curtailed.</p>

<p>Now that we as the general Human species are developing genetic technologies, it is only a matter of time before life extension becomes an important problem.</p>

<p>Global Warming is allowed to continue, it will severely lower our population. The hardiest will continue. That said, they are actively preventing us from full scale nuclear war - because they take some responsibility in our uneven socioeconomic development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, some say it goofs with theories of evolution a bit. I personally don&#39;t think that&#39;s such a big deal, it can still fit as far as I can tell. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a lot of land ownership predicated on who &quot;got there&quot; first. Here in the US, in Europe, and especially in the Middle East. And if it turns out that a totally different people were the original inhabitants and, in fact, a totally different perceived race that what we are taught were, for example, written about in the Bible, it would turn some things upside down.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t believe anything would need to be covered up, but it happens all the time. Until it&#39;s revealed, I won&#39;t really know why, either. But it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s happening. Destruction of art, noses removed from statues, not DNA testing due to the wishes of whomever (or DNA testing and not publicly releasing the results)--this stuff happens all the time. There were pyramids all the way up and down the Mississippi River - now, if they haven&#39;t been destroyed completely, they&#39;re just &quot;Indian mounds.&quot; </p>

<p>We seem to be fundamentally unable to acknowledge that &quot;ancient&quot; humans were just as bright, if not brighter, than we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t read that first link too long what u mean by tenure tentanus. What I&#39;m goin to tell you is I used to be a crazy alien person and what not. I also went crazy about ancient aliens but the thing is now seeing all the bullshit and crazies u need to sift through a ton of nonsense. Also the fun thing to do with conspirators is they only explain one side or have no knowledge of the other. For instance your article says that humans have a mixture of different species of human like bears have different species but they are all bears. So an alien theorists uses words like humanoid and mystery fourth person and u get an instant alien boner.but u fail to realize that it&#39;s a mystery so it can be as much a unicorn as an alien and humanoid is another word for bipedal or human so it&#39;s always fucking smoke and mirrors</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google claims modern humans have been around for about 200 000 years.  If you want to extend what you consider a human to be, near-humans were using &quot;complex&quot; tools for over 1 000 000 years.</p>

<p>If we are to accept the consensus of institutionalized learning, &quot;civilization&quot; doesn&#39;t emerge until something like 10 000 years ago (also approximately the time after our most recent ice age.</p>

<p>The implication being- as far as I can tell, is that over a million-year timeline we used nothing but bows and arrows and collected berries in our hats for the first 99% of that timeline, and only moved into cities in the last 1% of the story.</p>

<p>Even if we blame the biological crudity of our ancestors for this lack of progress for the first 800 000 years or so, this is a bit hard for me to believe.  If &quot;genetically&quot; modern humans were around for even only as long as 100 000 years, why would we only have gotten the tiniest bit more advanced in the last 10th of that period?  Also, what would have precipitated it?</p>

<p>Our ability to investigate evidence from prior to the most recent glacial melt would obviously be challenged by such a destructive (to archaeological clues) event as an ice age and it&#39;s withdrawal, so it fits that we would be hesitant to make claims about that period without evidence.  Yet, to posit claims such as the absence of evidence proving that humans had essentially nothing prior to 12 000 years ago (which our institutions do) seems to be the opposite yet is somewhat nicely challenged by areas such as Gobleki Tepe.</p>

<p>I would say the simplest answer to your question is that having an unchanging world view is the least work, and we&#39;ve inherited plenty of answers (right or wrong), so we&#39;re not compelled to dig deeper unless one is unusually curious or skeptical of the preexisting story we&#39;ve been provided.</p>

And the thing with history is if I got a paper that says there was nothin on earth before my civilization and you find a fucking carriage and hammer and shit carbon tested older then u can&#39;t argue it. That&#39;s fucking physical evidence. If u come in a laboratory to test an experiment u retry it again and again until the result consistently happens proving whatever your doin .

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon dating is done by analyzing the radioactive decay of a carbon13 atom.  The reason it can be dated is because the rate of decay is supposedly fairly constant or known, and the carbon is in the remains of something that was alive at one time, and it&#39;s decay supposedly began during the lifetime of that lifeform.  Fossilized objects might not be able to be carbon dated, as the formerly living cells have been petrified into stone.  You probably know all of this.</p>

<p>History is supposed to be based in science, yet there is the presence of a lot of supposition and also traditionally accepted ideas that are difficult to challenge (often for political reasons).</p>

<p>The truth and the physics involved cannot be cheated, yet you could always put a gun to the head of whoever is printing the results of the test.  Look at Galileo, he could prove heliocentricity mathematically, and they could tie him up and burn him.  It&#39;s an ongoing struggle with scientific objectivity and established authority when political interests conflict with evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if we&#39;re talking about an event that can literally move the mantle of the earth then why not just assume it rotates a full revolution so that what was on top cycles against the mantle and get&#39;s pulverized and then rotates back up to the top. Microbes and some animals etc would survive, but not many. It would basically be like a reset button. Or maybe &quot;rotation&quot; is the wrong way to think about it. We already know about plate tectonics, it&#39;s good science, and that tectonic plates sort of slide around on top of the earth&#39;s mantle (I guess Asthenosphere if we&#39;re being precise but i don&#39;t want to pretend I&#39;m a geologist, I&#39;m not). So maybe every 1,000,000 years (or whatever) the plates suddenly &quot;unstick&quot; and start to slide very freely. So imagine that what is currently North America slides under Europe and what was under Europe now moves back to the surface.</p>

<p>In that case anything already encased in rock would have a decent chance of surviving, including fossil fuels, fossils, etc. But anything on the surface would, of course, be pulverized.</p>

<p>How would you detect this? I don&#39;t think that after 100,000 years a fast and sudden move in the tectonic plates would be differentiated from slower moving drift (which we can already measure by the way, we know it happens).</p>

<p>how do you get to a conspiracy from this? Pretty easily I suppose. If technology exists to suddenly loosen the tectonic plates and cause massive movement of the lithosphere that would quite neatly destroy everything with very little drama. No one would know what the hell was happening. Alternately one could suppose a natural process wherein the earth somehow stores energy in an unseen way (no one is looking, really) until it is all suddenly released in a very violent movement of tectonic plates. Akin to a glass plate that will keep absorbing sonic energy right up until the point it shatters into a million pieces.</p>

<p>In any case, would this expunge all evidence of prior advanced civilizations? I don&#39;t think so but that evidence may be well hidden and very subtle. Remnants of deep mines or underground structures may remain but good luck finding them.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where the rulers are sure to loose every time because of uprisings... one press of a reset button and you&#39;re free to try and rule again and again and again; until you get it right. Until you can suppress them fully.</p>

By knowing history u understand fundamentally that hums and are evil fucking cock heads and seek power and control. So no matter what history repeats solely on the fact that humans are huge dick heads and they will sell out their own people. So to that id say we all know humans are dicks already what is more history of humans being dicks gonna do</p>

<p>How so? Use cryptic language that only the &quot;elite&quot; understand so that you can hide messages in plain site, like ancient civilizations where only certain people could read and write.</p>

<p>The point of covering up history that would reveal how intelligent humans are is to continue the LIE that humans are stupid and &quot;evolved&quot; from lesser stupid beings.</p>

<p>That is all a bullshit lie meant to trick people into thinking they&#39;re stupid.</p>

<p>Much like the &quot;Humans only use ten percent of their brain&quot; MYTH that the &quot;elite&quot; made up to trick the average man into fully believing that he&#39;s stupid and there&#39;s nothing he can do about it.</p>

<p>Also, XXL tin foil hat?</p>

<p>This MIT experiment <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100708230258/http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/">proved that aluminum foil hats actually increase amplification of the 1.2ghz , 1.5ghz, and 2.6ghz frequency bands by 10-30db</a>, so please stop perpetuating the tin foil hat conspiracy bullshit myth meant to marginalize conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Remember how in school they tried LYING to you about everybody thinking the world is flat?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about conditioning people to believe that they&#39;re stupid so that they won&#39;t get in the way of the power structure.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I&#39;m just an idiot, I can&#39;t do anything about it&quot;.</p>

<p>Please, wake up people, open your eyes to the lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution is easily disprovable by yourself. The reason it is taught in schools is that the elites don&#39;t want you to think there is someone or something more powerful than them. They want your worship and your obedience. If you believe in God or any other type of authority outside of government then you might distrust them. Before you give the standard anti- religion manifesto, God and organized religion are two different things. Organized religions have been used since Egypt to promote ruler worship not God. Pharaoh was a god-king. Even Christianity has suffered from people interjecting their own authority over God&#39;s. Just look at the Catholic Church. Destroying belief in God and attacking Christianity as backward serves the elites in where you are going to place your source of authority. Who decides what laws are good? Who decides what history to teach? In a confusing world people will latch onto their government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If things are in public view, regardless of the content, can it then be considered truth? </p>

<p>I think that is something that only the beholder can answer. I would assume that since humanity has some sort of collective consciousness, that things like technology achievement will happen regardless of any attempt at suppression. If someone invents something in one part of the world, it is only a matter of time before a similar thing is &#39;invented&#39; in another part. </p>

<p>There is most definitely MANY things that are kept &#39;secretive&#39; from the public, from things like government data to things found on this planet once we had satellite tech. Does that make it &#39;wrong?&#39; Well, not really, but it certainly can paint it in another light. </p>

<p>What you are sort of asking, at least as I reread your comment, is pretty much like The Matrix. </p>

<p>When Neo figured out that he was in a computer simulation, what then was truth? Everything that was experienced in the matrix was false - it was an illusion. Although some could be considered &#39;truthful&#39; (i.e., agents are part of the code, physical laws can be broken, the machines do exist), it took him figuratively &#39;dying&#39; to realize this fact. </p>

<p>If the things we experience daily are uncovered and therefor not true, then we truly live in the matrix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i.e. Tesla. Free energy, EMR drives akin to what nasa just released regarding their microwave propulsed EMDrives, inherent understanding the potential that lies within the earth itself... His work was discredited, he was ostracized by the scientific community, called crazy and even had assassination attempts on his life... his workbooks went missing before any even knew he was dead, so obviously there was information contained within them that has been repressed for a reason.</p>

<p>I mean, it just makes sense that we would harness the energy that literally exists all around us and has allowed life to perpetuate instead of trying to create unsustainable, crude combustion style devices... but having a limited fuel source creates a regulated market, again - at their control. Supply and Demand. If we looked at solar energy, wind, EMR, geothermal, tidal, hydropower - these sources are literally inexhaustible - but where there is continuous and unlimited supply, there is no need for a market to meet demand.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if we&#39;re talking about an event that can literally move the mantle of the earth then why not just assume it rotates a full revolution so that what was on top cycles against the mantle and get&#39;s pulverized and then rotates back up to the top. Microbes and some animals etc would survive, but not many. It would basically be like a reset button. Or maybe &quot;rotation&quot; is the wrong way to think about it. We already know about plate tectonics, it&#39;s good science, and that tectonic plates sort of slide around on top of the earth&#39;s mantle (I guess Asthenosphere if we&#39;re being precise but i don&#39;t want to pretend I&#39;m a geologist, I&#39;m not). So maybe every 1,000,000 years (or whatever) the plates suddenly &quot;unstick&quot; and start to slide very freely. So imagine that what is currently North America slides under Europe and what was under Europe now moves back to the surface.</p>

<p>In that case anything already encased in rock would have a decent chance of surviving, including fossil fuels, fossils, etc. But anything on the surface would, of course, be pulverized.</p>

<p>How would you detect this? I don&#39;t think that after 100,000 years a fast and sudden move in the tectonic plates would be differentiated from slower moving drift (which we can already measure by the way, we know it happens).</p>

<p>how do you get to a conspiracy from this? Pretty easily I suppose. If technology exists to suddenly loosen the tectonic plates and cause massive movement of the lithosphere that would quite neatly destroy everything with very little drama. No one would know what the hell was happening. Alternately one could suppose a natural process wherein the earth somehow stores energy in an unseen way (no one is looking, really) until it is all suddenly released in a very violent movement of tectonic plates. Akin to a glass plate that will keep absorbing sonic energy right up until the point it shatters into a million pieces.</p>

<p>In any case, would this expunge all evidence of prior advanced civilizations? I don&#39;t think so but that evidence may be well hidden and very subtle. Remnants of deep mines or underground structures may remain but good luck finding them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well they operate upon free will. they make it out there to us but dont support it. so in the end they dont look bad amonst them selves by saying &quot;we gave them a chance, the info was out there&quot;. thats why you see so many symbols around, they are literally saying &quot;we are here&quot; in your face but people go &quot;those are just coincidences&quot; or &quot;it wouldnt be so obvious is it was true&quot;.</p>

<p>freemasons feel like good guys giving us the info but not confirming it. its upon our trust and free will to decide what is true and isnt. its obviously out there when you know. </p>

<p>reminded that not all freemasons are bad but for the most part that is why the info is out there and not hidden. for sure they hide real stuff like rituals and bloodlines and stuff. but that itself isnt even that hard to find clues about. </p>
