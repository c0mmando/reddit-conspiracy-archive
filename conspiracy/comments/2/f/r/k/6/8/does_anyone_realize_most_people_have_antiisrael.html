       I have anti-Israel sentiment today because of their "military operations" in Palestine for the last several decades. I feel that my sentiment is justified. If Israel wants the sympathy of those who finance their campaigns (unwillingly), then maybe they ought to work harder to treat their neighbors as fellow human beings.

       Yes, and their military operations are being done that way on purpose, so your sentiments can feel justified. It's called "being manipulated". The Bible said it's what would happen, and it's what's happening. Don't feel bad about it, most people are falling for it, too.

       So you're saying people should cheer the death of children because The Bible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool prophecies, though--I can see how it's describing an EMP and everyone running out of meds. But your interpretation seems full of holes. Especially as the prophecy is
       <em>
        Jerusalem
       </em>
       and all who uphold it, not the "Israeli government." There is a difference, and it's important.

       No one is supposed to cheer, they're

       to hate, because that's what the Bible said people would do, there is no changing that. I'm quoting scripture, I'm not interpreting anything. Were there meds and EMPs 2000 years ago, or are you that misinformed?

       Do you not know what prophecies from dreams

       I don't understand what you're even talking about. Prophesy is prophecy - you don't need to have seen something in real life to dream about it. You should stop trying to interpret Biblical prophecy if you don't get the basics.

       Which part is my interpretation? A tattoo sounds like an interpretation, which is what you said. Actually, most of what you're saying is your own interpretation, nothing you have said has any basis in scripture which is all I'm quoting.

       I was being a smartass about the EMP, but based on the manner in which you're arguing and the things you're trying to poke, I'm guessing you're just here to disrupt?

       Asking for a source when you posted the source yourself:  "And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people:
       <em>
        all that burden themselves with it
       </em>
       shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there something in my post history you're hoping to push off the spool? Why all the baiting, insults, and trolly argumentation?

       Again, you really need to work on your reading comprehension. Did you read the link he/she pasted? It's interesting stuff and exposes a
       <em>
        real

       conspiracy, not this shitty thread you started. I didn't call it crap at all or accuse him of being unemployed (I was referring to the people behind the Operation)--I gave it an upboat, if you really want to know.

       The Bible also tells of the restored Ottoman Empire, aka the Islamic State and the reinstatement of the Caliphate. We live in Revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't believe it was God, then understand the people in power have the desire to fulfill the prophecy furthering their own agenda anyways. Believe it or not, there are people who would wish to use Revelations as an instruction manual to bring about the end times on purpose... and those people are likely the same behind the curtain.

       I entertain the idea that perhaps it will get so nasty, fallen angels disguised as aliens will come to 'save' us from ourselves and make us immortals. That is to say... the antichrist just might be 'aliens.' They certainly have been prepping us really hard to accept aliens as truth. Just look at the Ancient Alien series. Aliens have been propaganda all along so they can slip it in and we'll
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       fall to our knees - every religion across the globe as well as all the dissenters. We think it's a conspiracy, but they're playing us... Just like Glenn Beck and dare I say Alex Jones.

       I've said it once, and I'll say it again: It doesn't matter if
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       believes,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       believe, and that's enough to be concerned. Denial is an ugly thing.

       Yep. If evil in power believes in God, even just to work against Him, then we better know God, huh? :D

       I had a dream, over 15 years ago, that startled me out of my sleep, and I felt very disturbed when I woke up, because it just seemed so real and frightening.

       There was a power in charge that had the technology of a searchlight that they could cast on you to see your thoughts, and thereby evaluate your loyalty.  The name of the power was Zog.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time, I thought maybe I got that name from the Superman movie, where the villain was named Zod.  I think there was a scene where he President exclaims, "Dear God...", and the villain corrects him, saying, "it's Zod".
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later, I learned that Z.O.G. is an acronym used by anti-Clinton right wingers, typically from the message board Free Republic, for "Zionist Occupied Government".

       You've got it backwards. There was always a reason to hate Israel. The leaders of Israel have never stopped murdering Arabs and stealing land from the Palestinians, not from the day the country was established. Today, their crimes are so numerous, so obvious, so manifest, that all the Israeli propaganda in the world can't cover them up. So people are doing what they should have done since 1948 -- they are hating Israel.

       Wow. Between that and the 4chan anti-SJW crap, this unemployment crisis is having a hell of a horrible impact on the Internet.
