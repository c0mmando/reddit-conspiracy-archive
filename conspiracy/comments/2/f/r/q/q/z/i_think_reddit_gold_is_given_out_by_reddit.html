    <div class="md"><p>It all works very similarly to a lot of those &quot;free&quot; browser games that have bonuses and better items for people that pay for them. At first no one participates in that crap so the staff create a couple of fake accounts loaded with the bonus items and use it to start competing against that legitimate players. Once the legitimate players realize they have no chance against a boosted opponent they must also spend money to compete. Obviously reddit has no competitive angle (albeit some morons that actually think karma means something) but has the same premise. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;re a free thinker. Probably one of the reasons you thought about the bs reddit gold scam in the first place. But A LOT of others do, just look at ANY of the fads of the last, i dont know 100 years. Anyone alone will tell you that shit is stupid trendy and a waste, but put them with friends that do it and its the coolest shit ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the comments&#39; content that even matters, but rather, users seeing that comment guilded and getting a warm fuzzy and thinking, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll guild someone, too!&quot; The goal is to increase incoming funds, not to specifically reward individuals for good content. (So, if it&#39;s happening, you&#39;d see it on top comments without a lot of replies, so it wouldn&#39;t get buried but would still be seen by many eyes.)</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not really an investment in users - guilded users get features, not cash--the cash goes straight back to Reddit; it doesn&#39;t cost Reddit a lot to provide Gold features to guilded users; the money goes to help run the site itself. It&#39;s like in-app purchases in games--this and ads are how game developers get paid (except game developers tend to only get 70% of the investment back from Apple/Android/etc), which is why, besides the whole ethics part of it, you don&#39;t see indies engaging in that sort of monetization &quot;nudge.&quot;</p>
