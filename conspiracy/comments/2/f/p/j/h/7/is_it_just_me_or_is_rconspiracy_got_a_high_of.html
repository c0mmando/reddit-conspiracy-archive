<p>As Obama is about to send our forces back into Iraq (and on to crush Assad) under the <em>pretense</em> of &quot;fighting ISIS&quot;, costing us hundreds of Billion$ and killing god knows how many innocents and our own troops... I would say that these matters are hardly &quot;bullshit&quot;.</p>

The problem I have is that people just re-post unoriginal ideas, they don&#39;t even plagiarize them, they straight up just re-post it without putting any of their thoughts and opinions in them. If I wanted to read what the Huffington Post thinks about the situation in Iraq I&#39;d go to their website, I subbed here hoping for some intelligent conversation on various conspiracies and all I get is re-posts of current events that just boil down to &quot;Obama is literally Satan&quot; as if we don&#39;t get enough of that by turning on the television </p>

    <div class="md"><p>completely fair. I like the approach of assuming the responsibility for your own actions (this is not a criticism at you). Meaning, as a community, I find it more productive to flat ignore those that are quite obviously oblivious to the proper way to discuss topics, rather then waste the energy trying to show them the error of their ways. </p>

<p>So yes, I agree the sub has gone off course from its prior days, but that just means there is more that I graze over or laugh at. I don&#39;t mean to diminish your desire to point it out, just give my perspective as to how I choose to personally handle it. I assume that at this point (and this time of year <em>cough 9/11 cough</em>) we are going to see this sub thriving with cointelpro.</p>

<p>id also assume most of the people here that actually care, are bright enough to know how to find information beyond what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> tells us. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been &quot;invading Syria&quot; by proxy since the civil war began - or before. </p>

<p>Bolton said in meetings with Israeli officials that he had no doubt America would attack Iraq, and that it would be necessary thereafter to deal with threats from Syria, Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>Text: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with the French TV station LCP, former French minister for Foreign Affairs Roland Dumas said:</p>

<p><em>‘’I’m going to tell you something. I was in England two years before the violence in Syria on other business. I met with top British officials, who confessed to me that they were preparing something in Syria.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;This was in Britain not in America. Britain was organizing an invasion of rebels into Syria. They even asked me, although I was no longer minister for foreign affairs, if I would like to participate.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Naturally, I refused, I said I’m French, that doesn’t interest me.’’</em></p>

<p>Dumas went on give the audience a quick lesson on the real reason for the war that has now claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p><em>‘’This operation goes way back. It was prepared, preconceived and planned… in the region it is important to know that this Syrian regime has a very anti-Israeli stance.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Consequently, everything that moves in the region- and I have this from the former Israeli prime minister who told me ‘we’ll try to get on with our neighbours but those who don’t agree with us will be destroyed.</em></p>

<p><em>It’s a type of politics, a view of history, why not after all. But one should know about it.’’</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[commentary and opinion below Dumas&#39; statements is irrelevant]</p>

<p>Before you attack the source, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeyRwFHR8WY">here&#39;s a video of the Dumas interview</a>. </p>

<p>Certainly the original intent was to create discord and chaos within Syria, and then to arm and back &quot;rebel forces&quot; to unseat Assad, replacing him with an Israel-friendly puppet regime. And there is no doubt that the US was indeed arming and supporting Assad&#39;s enemies as early as 2012:</p>

<p>LA Times - <strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/sns-la-fg-cia-syria-20130622-story.html">June 21, 2013: U.S. has secretly provided arms training to Syria rebels since 2012</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON — CIA operatives and U.S. special operations troops have been secretly training Syrian rebels with anti-tank and antiaircraft weapons since late last year, months before President Obama approved plans to begin directly arming them, according to U.S. officials and rebel commanders.</p>

<p>The covert U.S. training at bases in Jordan and Turkey, along with Obama&#39;s decision this month to supply arms and ammunition to the rebels, has raised hope among the beleaguered Syrian opposition that Washington ultimately will provide heavier weapons as well. So far, the rebels say they lack the weapons they need to regain the offensive in the country&#39;s bitter civil war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ISRAEL has also been involved in training/arming Assad&#39;s enemies:</p>

<p>Jerusalem Post - August, 2013: <strong><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Syrian-rebel-forces-trained-by-West-are-moving-towards-Damascus-324033">Report: Syrian rebel forces trained by West are moving towards Damascus</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Le Figaro reports <strong>rebel soldiers trained by US, Jordan, Israel</strong> crossed border to Syria on Aug 17. </p>

<p>Guerrilla fighters trained by the West began moving towards Damascus in mid-August, French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>Le Figaro reported that <strong>this is the reason behind the Assad regime&#39;s alleged chemical weapons attack in Damascus on Wednesday morning, as UN inspectors were allowed into the country to investigate allegations of WMD use.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The rebels were trained</strong> for several months in a training camp on the Jordanian-Syrian border by <strong>CIA operatives, as well as Jordanian and Israeli commandos</strong>, the paper said.</p>

<p>The first group of 300 handpicked Free Syrian Army soldiers crossed the border on August 17 into the Deraa region, and a second group was deployed on August 19, the paper reported.</p>

<p>The paper quoted a researcher at the French Institute for Strategic Analysis as saying <strong>the trained rebels group was passing through Ghouta, on their way to Damascus.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the CIA/Mossad trained &quot;rebels&quot; just HAPPENED to be in GHOUTA on the VERY DAY that SOMEONE launched a chemical weapons attack IN GHOUTA - even as UN weapons inspectors (guests of Assad) were on the ground to investigate PRIOR allegations of chemical weapons use - a few short miles away in Damascus.</p>

<p>Is that a COINCIDENCE or what???</p>

<p>You may recall that that particular incident - <em>blamed on Assad</em> - &quot;crossed the Obama red line&quot;, and that the US was on the verge of launching an all-out attack on Assad via sea and air forces to &quot;punish him&quot;.</p>

<p>But something smeled fishy: British Parliament balked (embarrassing Cameron), the US public also smelled the stench of treachery, and US politicians also backed off. Then came Putin with his plan to disarm Assad - and Assad&#39;s instantaneous agreement, and suddenly Obama, Netanyahu and a handful of NeoCon Hawks were left standing with their dicks hanging out.</p>

<p>Worse still, <strong>Assad kept winning</strong>, and the &quot;rebels&quot; were becoming more and more fragmented with infighting and disorganization. It looked like the plan to topple Assad via a CIA/Mossad staged &quot;revolution&quot; was all but finished.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the mess in Ukraine/Crimea emerged (with a LOT of help from the CIA), and suddenly Putin was too preoccupied with the mess plopped on his own border to pay much attention to the Middle East.</p>

<p>THEN a virtually unknown &quot;terrorist&quot; group emerged from the shadows - calling itself ISIS - and proceeded to raise HELL in the region of Iraq and Syria - creating a new EMERGENCY that threatens FREEDUMB and MUST be dealt with. Right?</p>

<p>And the emergence of ISIS was very convenient for Netanyahu, Obama and the so-called &quot;Western Powers&quot;, because they had shot their load with the attempted false-flag CW attack in Ghouta, and there would be no way to drum up popular support for another direct assault on Assad (who is STILL holding his own, BTW).</p>

<p>So, first the &quot;West&quot; had a plan to oust Assad via covert revolution. But the &quot;rebels&quot; failed.</p>

<p>Next they tried to become involved by using a false-flag CW attack that would be blamed on Assad. THAT FAILED.</p>

<p>Putin was being a nosy pain-in-the-ass, and had to be distracted. THAT SUCCEEDED (so far).</p>

<p>But hopes for reorganizing and realigning the &quot;rebel&quot; groups to topple Assad were a non-starter: They lack central leadership, and spend as much time jockeying for position and attacking one another as they do fighting Assad - AND if we hand those clowns the weaponry they would NEED to beat Assad, they are likely to turn it against us.</p>

<p>Isis is the perfect solution: They come pre-demonized right out of the box: Islamic fundamentalist radicals that irrationally murder anyone and everyone - men, women and children for any reason (or no reason). <strong>ATTACK ISIS</strong> should be an easy sell to the public - and if not, I&#39;m sure that events can be arranged (<strong>cough</strong> - new pearl harbor - <strong>cough</strong>) that will have the public SCREAMING for us to &quot;get involved.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether any significant number of US troops &quot;on the ground&quot; would be necessary, but I DO feel confident that if the US and &quot;West&quot; becomes involved, they will NOT leave without making sure that Assad is history, and that an Israel-friendly puppet show is in charge in Syria. After all, that has been the goal all along, hasn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Wild speculation you say? Okay, fine. Look at the evidence I&#39;ve posted, <strong>post evidence of your own</strong>, and we&#39;ll see how it all plays out.</p>

<p>And yes, if I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ll admit it.</p>
