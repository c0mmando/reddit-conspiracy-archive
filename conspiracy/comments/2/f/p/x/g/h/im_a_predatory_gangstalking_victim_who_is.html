        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Stop Gangstalking Awareness group will become a leading influence to educate and inform the public about the reality and dangers of Predatory Gangstalking. The objective of this organization is educate the public about this real sabotage technique that can happen to anyone by a variety of illegal, seemingly legitimate, and even governmental organizations. If you are not aware of predatory gangstalking, please educate yourself by searching online. However please be warned alot of information online can be diluted or misleading. This is where Stop Gangstalking Awareness comes into play.. Below you will find a brief synopsis of what gangstalking is.</p>

<p>&quot;Predatory gangstalking is the complete destruction of a single targeted individual by utilizing mind games, manipulative tactics, and group stalking. The level of predatory gangstalking can range anywhere from as little of giving a target a sense of paranoia via isolated groups, to a complete infiltration of a targeted individuals physical, mental, and social well-being. Predatory gangstalking can strip a targeted individual of his/her career, family, friends, privacy, mental and physical health, and even leave a target in complete distress and devastation to the extent of experiencing PTSD or commiting suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>Our website is <a href="http://www.stopgangstalking.org">www.stopgangstalking.org</a> and as you can see the website is still in progress. This site is to be used for the public to receive unbiased and informative information about gangstalking to make an informed decision themselves about this sabotage technique.</p>

<p>Anyone looking to learn more or assist in this movement, please comment or PM me. I can tell you from first-hand experience of being a victim that this needs to stop. Awareness will be key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why include the word stop at all?  It&#39;s irrelevant to your objective of increasing awareness.  The desire to stop it will come from awareness.  It&#39;s redundant. </p>

<p>&quot;Stop prion-rape awareness&quot; sounds silly, for example, and could be more effectively labeled &quot;prison-rape awareness&quot;. Stopping it is the obvious intent of increasing awareness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that gangstalking actually exists, but in the vast majority of cases, you are dealing with paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<p>I understand that the supposed point of gangstalking is to &quot;make the victim feel crazy&quot;.  But have you acknowleged the possibility that you are actually crazy?</p>

<p>Schizophrenia affects over 1% of the population.  I have known some very intelligent and capable people in my life who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and left untreated, it is an extremely destructive illness.  It affects the ability to organize thoughts, and can make it very difficult to maintain work and relationships.</p>

<p>Even if you yourself are indeed being gangstalked, have you realized that many of the people in your support group are actually suffering from schizophrenia?  Do you provide resources for those who might seek treatment?</p>

<p>Additionally, paranoia breeds paranoia.  If you are acting strangely because you think people are paying too much attention to you, it&#39;s going to cause people to pay attention to you.  It&#39;s ultimately a self fulfilling prophecy.  You&#39;re paranoid because you think people are watching you.  People ARE probably watching you because you&#39;re paranoid.  If I were the FBI, I&#39;d be monitoring gangtalking support groups because 1- if they are actually being gangstalked, I&#39;d want to know about it, and 2, there are bound to be mentally unstable people in the group who may potentially pose a threat to the public (not that they actually do, and I don&#39;t mean to perpetuate the stereotype that mental illness is inherently violent or dangerous).</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to be accusatory here, but I&#39;m wondering if these are things you&#39;ve taken into account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. In a support group you will encounter people who authentically suffer from schizophrenia. If you or anyone that you know seems to be experiencing these symptoms, an immediate health evaluation will help protect a victim of becoming gangstalked and help someone with mental-illness receive the care they need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done some research on gangstalking, targeted individuals, v2k, electronic harassment and such, because i think it is an issue that this particular community has to deal with.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that the majority of people who have these issues are suffering from schizephrenia.  I have trouble understanding the best way to help schizephrenic people other than to ask them to seek therapy and perhaps acknowledge that they may not be thinking clearly.  I have a friend suffering from the disorder who believes that he is developing a technology and that the reason he hasn&#39;t made progress is because groups of people are targeting him and stealing his designs.</p>

<p>The reality is that he doesn&#39;t have the technological understanding or experience to design the product he is devoting his life to- this is a delusion he has created and the paranoia is a rationalization to excuse his lack of progress.  He is not a stupid person, but he is suffering from an illness which causes delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gangstalking is very real.  It started with me moving into the Cleveland area, and followed me into the Chicago area.  There&#39;s only so many times you can take a public bus and the guy who sits in front of you starts talking about your life before you start to realize something is going on.  Especially when he&#39;s talking aloud to no one.</p>

<p>There are several groups that do this.  The most common is a simple asshole that goes around spreading lies about you.  This may sound trivial, but I witnessed a young man and his family go through Hell about a rumor that even I believed, until it was revealed to me years later that it was all a lie by the very person who started it.</p>

<p>Another is religious/social groups that act as a cult.  These groups work under a specific person that tells them to target someone who they determine should leave the neighborhood (typically for racial reasons).  The members of this group take turns harassing the target until they move.</p>

<p>The third, and the most damaging, is the CIA.  This typically happens because you, unknowingly, moved into an area that has a high concentration of operatives and they want you out before you figure out what&#39;s going on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Additionally, there have been suggestions that certain electronic devices are in use, which can make people who aren&#39;t consciously &#39;in on it&#39; act in gang stalking ways when interacting with the target - promoting a hostile demeanour even if it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve met or suggesting certain actions or reactions, etc.. Which means that it&#39;s not necessary to have an entire cult or group involved; it&#39;s only necessary for a few controllers to follow around the target with the devices in order to manipulate ignorant third parties into gang stalking behaviours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone you meet. When utilizing gangstalking to make a victim appear schizophrenic a variety of tactics can be utilized to adjust the victims perspective so that it seems to him/her that in fact everyone is involved. This can be a higher level of gangstalking and typically the gangstalkers intention in this scenario is the complete devastation of a victims life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s not necessary to create the actuality of &#39;everyone you meet&#39;, just the <em>perception</em> of this for the victim. It&#39;s a psychological tactic, perceptions are everything.</p>
