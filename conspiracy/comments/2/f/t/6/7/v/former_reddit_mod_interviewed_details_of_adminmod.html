<p>listen to 9:30 for the next 2 minutes if you don&#39;t want to listen to the whole thing</p>

<p>10:30 - &quot;I was told if I released this I would be marked as someone who was helping in the distribution of child pornography on Reddit.&quot;</p>

<p>The guy made a firefox/chrome addon that would encrypt PMs, modmails, and even image posts, and that was the response of the admins.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>There are multiple &quot;levels&quot; of mods, unofficially, depending on the size of the subreddits they moderate and the goals they have as a moderator. The &quot;higher&quot; mods have frequent interactions with admins, via IRC. Admins will ignore doxxing and harassment of mods who do not follow the instructions of admins, i.e. what content is removed from their subreddits.</p>

<p>The mods who are not in the &quot;special circle&quot; are not going to know the circle exists, so if asked about &quot;secret&quot; meetings with admins, they&#39;re going to deny them.</p>

<p>The mods who have &quot;free reign&quot; over their subreddits are those who share common goals with the admins. If you have a goal of something the admins don&#39;t particularly care for (such as <a href="/r/netsec">/r/netsec</a>, encrypted communication, etc.) , then the admins will helicopter over the subreddit, watching for content that might get popular, to shut it down quickly.</p>

<p>Obviously, admins can remove any content at any time from any subreddit, however mods can view a list of any deletions done by admins. The guy in the recording claims content removed by admins from his subreddit(s) did not show up there, so it is evidently not functioning, either intentionally or otherwise.</p>

<p>Going back to the private IRC chats, there are multiple &quot;tiers&quot; of private IRC rooms and servers. It&#39;s all about making the mods feel as though giving information up the ladder will get them something - more respect, more access to &quot;private&quot; chats, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Some insight from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that the mod who was interviewed and &quot;fired&quot; wrote <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1zvcph/march_8th_2014_rconspiracy_darkness_cannot_drive/">this</a> about us.</p>

<p>And when he opens his soundcloud interview talking about a mod threatening to sue reddit I&#39;m pretty sure he was referencing our good friend bipolarbear.</p>

<p>For the most though, the way the hierarchy is described is correct.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are some mods who have lived and worked IRL with Ohanian and Erik Martin; they&#39;re the inner circle. Mot likely working for their PR firm, Antique Jetpack.</p>

<p>Then there are some mods who have been around for so long that they&#39;re let in on some of the &quot;secrets&quot;.</p>

<p>Then there are other groups of mods who have also been around for a while, but don&#39;t get to be privy to the &quot;secrets&quot;.</p>

<p>The most important thing for the mod inner/outer circles is secrecy. They hate leaks and they don&#39;t associate with anyone who values community input. There is 100% an &quot;us vs them mentality&quot; amoung those type of mods.</p>

<p>There are some groups of power mods who oppose the agenda of the admins and inner circle mods, but they are always 1 step away from being ousted. The <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> situation was an example of the inner mod types (agentlame and davidreiss) battling with the outsider mod types (q, maxwell, anu). There is one admin, in particular, who will remain nameless, who&#39;se job is basically keeping track of these various mod factions and making sure the admin friendly groups stay in control.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on people like VA and PIMA, boh of whom turned on the insider mods and paid a very high price for it.</p>

<p>People call the internal politics of the reddit meta high school like; but it&#39;s really a lot more intense than that moniker would lead one to believe.</p>

<p>So all in all, take xaviermendel&#39;s comments and perspective with a grain of salt, but he does have some good insight. </p>

<p>Buying reddit gold would be a rather shitty way to &quot;game&quot; reddit. So hopefully nobody thinks i had anything to do with this shit. However we do plan on buying reddit ads :( </p>

<p>Is there a way to give back my reddit gold? haha</p>

<p>Gaming reddit by establishing &quot;credibility&quot; with gilded comments is the <em>exact</em> intended purpose of gold.</p>

I personally think reddit is trying to pivot currently and they could careless about the democratic nature of their discovery algorithm, this is why they&#39;re trying to hide vote ratios and vote transparency.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very interesting!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been working on an idea myself, although more oriented towards letting the community gather evidence and research, for any given topic. It would make it easier for newcomers, say; someone new to 9/11 conspiracy theories to look through all research/evidences collected and ranked(credibility ranking) by the community, instead of wading through all the rubbish which is out there on the web. I would also love to include tools like event-timelines, &#39;persons of interest&#39;/witnesses encyclopedia, &#39;evidence rebuttals&#39;, to mention some..</p>

<p>If you guys could create an API which I could hook into (ie. for user accounts and posts), that would be even more awesome! :) </p>

<p>Things make so much more sense now. You no longer have to ask yourself how so many people are mods for so many major subs.</p>

<p>This feels very much like how the press is handled today by the govenrment. You want to ask the president or a whitehouse employee a question? You better play ball and stick to these approved questions. If you don&#39;t, you simply don&#39;t get a press pass and no one knows any different.</p>

<p>The public thinks the media just sucks now, but they actually have their hands tied so that any good journalists can&#39;t even get in the game. Just like mods.</p>

<p>Going back to the private IRC chats, there are multiple &quot;tiers&quot; of private IRC rooms and servers. It&#39;s all about making the mods feel as though giving information up the ladder will get them something - more respect, more access to &quot;private&quot; chats, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this gives you some insight into the type of personality who becomes a high up mod. They seek attention and power over anything in their life.</p>

<p>EDIT: After listening to the whole thing I can probably give two TL;DRs. 1.) Reddit is all about the money. All of the actions the admins take are to try and please the highest bidder. 2.) The mods are being manipulated as much as everyone else is. The admins have it set up so the &quot;good&quot; mods that do their bidding get the power and the ones who don&#39;t play along are marginalized.</p>

<p>FINAL EDIT: Listen around 46:00. Get them all in one little area where we can claim they aren&#39;t being censored, and we can track everyone who is talking about this subject. Remind you of anywhere?</p>

<p>That was one of the parts the perked my ears up too. There were a couple of teasers in there for me. I just got done listening to the whole thing and besides the topic you mentioned, the flagged words,terms and sites that can get you shadowbanned/flagged, that are maintained in a secret list inside the bot/system was one worthy of further discussion imo. </p>

<p>Man it would be sweet if this was an encrypted sub, that extension he made sounded really interesting. Of course it would make mods have more power over their sub than admins (potentially) so I can see why TPTB at reddit would not like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.. Reddit isn&#39;t a way of life so I find this farce a little silly but in all I honestly don&#39;t care. Same deal a couple of years ago when someone stole all my gold in my guild bank in Warcraft. It struck me as silly because.. well you know, I have a life..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparing all of this to your experience in <em>World of Warcraft</em>?  </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s some high-level intelligent thinking right there.</p>

<p><em>Guys!  GUYS!  Proven corruption among the operators of this website which heavily influences important issues &amp; current events discussed in the media/on the internet is sorta kinda like that one time someone stole gold from me in a video game!  Its no big deal!</em></p>

<p>Terrible analogy.  Embarrassing, really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t like my analogy. My point is some people take this site far too seriously. Anyways, I&#39;m happy enough with what I&#39;ve achieved in my life not to feel embarrassed by anything I see or write on Reddit. Good day and try to remember to breathe ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your on minus points, but you do make a decent point. Not chastising users for having no life, which is a bit out of line and - well, you&#39;re here - but this is just a wall to write on, it&#39;s not unique or special or anything, and the sands and tides of time will wash it away just as many boards have been long forgotten before.</p>
