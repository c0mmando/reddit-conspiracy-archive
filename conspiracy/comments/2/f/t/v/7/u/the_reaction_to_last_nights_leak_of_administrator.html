        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was big news. A rogue moderator leaks numerous details about corruption by admins and mods on Reddit, including admins trying to blackmail him, mentioning that there is a moderator that the admins won&#39;t speak to without a lawyer around, and tons more information that makes the Reddit administration and power-moderators look like some twisted mafia. </p>

<p>So what happens? How do the users react? Or rather, how do they want you to think the users reacted? </p>

<p>Anyone who expressed concern over these leaks? Massively downvoted. I know one of my accounts had at least 30 downvotes on every post I made about it. Anyone who had anything bad to say about the admins or mods, anyone who said that the admins need to come forward about this, anyone who said that this was actually a serious issue... was downvoted. </p>

<p>But what sorts of comments reached the top of almost every thread on the subject? </p>

<p>&quot;Who gives a fuck? Do people seriously care about Reddit drama?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not watching a 50 minute video lol&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s their site and they can do whatever they want with it! You don&#39;t have free speech here!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;lol here comes the conspiratards! M I BEIN DETAINED!?!?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If you care about this then you&#39;re an idiot!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There is no censorship or corruption on Reddit. You must be crazy if you think that!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wow the guy in the video sounded like he was totally stoned! Who would listen to a crackpot like that!?&quot; </p>

<p>These comments reached hundreds of upvotes. Comments that try to convince the readers that nothing is wrong. That they shouldn&#39;t trust what the video says. That this isn&#39;t an issue and nothing about it has any validity, and if you think there is, you must be crazy and/or stupid. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all very Orwellian. There is nothing true unless we tell you that it&#39;s true. Believe the hivemind, and the hivemind says that nothing is wrong. You can see that people who dissent are being downvoted. You wouldn&#39;t want to be like them, would you? It&#39;s all that sort of thing. It&#39;s insane. </p>

<p>This is all very similar to what happened with the Zoe Quinn scandal that happened over the past few weeks. We know for a fact that she slept around and got favors and positive press for it. There&#39;s simply no way to argue it, there&#39;s a mountain of proof. Yet anyone who brings up the subject is bombarded with downvotes and comments that insist that none of it is true, and the entire thing is just some attack on her by crazy, sexist 4channers, which is obviously completely bullshit. </p>

<p>Someone, some group, has a level of pull on Reddit. Whatever they want being said is going to reach the top of the front page and comment sections. If they don&#39;t want it said, then there will be an organized effort by this group to suppress this information by any means necessary. Whether the admins or mods directly delete it (and ban the users who post it), or it gets brigaded by these shills who will downvote and mock anyone who dissents, they will find some way to destroy any opposition, and the hivemind will eat up the &quot;new truth&quot;, the one that they have constructed, that says that nothing is wrong and anyone who believes otherwise is crazy. </p>

<p>Reddit is dead. It&#39;s been overrun by lies, corruption and shills that are far, far crazier than anyone they claim to be crazy. Sociopaths who believe it is good to lie. That it is good to deceive anyone they can as long as they get paid, and their agenda is pushed. They are truly the most crazy of anyone. And they continue to push that insanity upon the general public. </p>

<p>This needs to stop, but really, it won&#39;t, and Reddit will fall. Soon, I bet. And then another site will spring up, just like Reddit did to replace Digg, and it will be just as filled with corruption as Reddit and Digg before them. And nobody seems to care...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What concerns me is that I&#39;ve seen many of those sorts of top comments all over reddit. I think to myself, these topics are important but the top five comments tell me not to care. It is really worrisome but not unexpected that people are gaming the system by taking advantage of herd mentality. For all we know the admins directly add upvotes to content they are told to make popular. If not directly then there is certainly an organized effort. It would be trivial to assemble a team motivated by the state or a religion to cast hundreds of false votes on content. Twenty people with VPNs and 4 accounts each could easily bury any post or comment that was recently posted. If they nip content in the bud then they can shape the discussion at will. If I ran an intelligence agency it is exactly the sort of thing I would do to help maintain narratives and keep plebs from thinking too carefully about current events. Even if only to counter act the same techniques used by competing nations to try to influence US social media outlets. We all know China tries to influence reddit with their cyber army, I&#39;m sure many other nations do too. Helping shape the minds of the next generation of American voters is a job many nations and intelligence agencies would be interested in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an idea for this which is why I believe one of the admins deleted my old account. </p>

<p>The site would be full of sub-forums as reddit is except far more transparent. Allowing you to see who has up or downvoted a topic or comment. Also comments would be divided into 3 seperate categories. For/Against/Neutral. You cannot comment against in the &quot;for&quot; and vice versa. You can cross quote to each but cannot argue in one. If you upvoted a topic you also will not be able to go and downvote in the &quot;against&quot; comments. This would give people the ability to speak their minds while removing shills ability to derail conversations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the For/Against/Neutral idea. Combine that with the removal of down votes and you have a winner. That way no ideas can be buried- no matter how big or small. A thread reaches the front because of its interactivity, not its voting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah voting posts up or down is a bad idea. Majority rule doesn&#39;t mean the best ideas are going to become paramount or visible. It just means the people that have the most to gain will be the best at  persuading people to vote or downvote. The idea that people are commenting on it and interacting (Participation) is what should make the post popular or not. It&#39;s similar to my idea for a new proposal I am working on to create a <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">new society</a> based on Participation, Accountability, Skillfulness and Trustworthiness.</p>

<p>My suggestion is we build a site like this, but we link it into my proposal and design whole new society around it or beside it, where people and ideas that influence the operation and cooperation of the society gets traction based on their/its P.A.S.T. When we have a society that is created around participation and ideas an proposals are being submitted vetted by the society to create transparency we have a win/win situation that can shift us from a top-down governance to a vertical cooperative community driven society.</p>

<p>happy more people wake up to reality.</p>

<p>there are a couple of stuff that you&#39;ve got wrong. Reddit didn&#39;t got corrupt, was born like this. Reddit is part of a secret program to control the internet (well the people using internet) Right there near facebook</p>

<p>And is pretty fucking successfully.</p>

<p>Is not corrupted from inside, is like this for a clear reason.</p>

<p>Reddit is dead. It&#39;s been overrun by lies, corruption and shills that are far, far crazier than anyone they claim to be crazy. Sociopaths who believe it is good to lie. That it is good to deceive anyone they can as long as they get paid, and their agenda is pushed. They are truly the most crazy of anyone.
