       Where's all the outrage for this kid? He HADN'T just robbed a store and roughed up the clerk, he HADNT charged at officers, and yet no one seems to care? Why is Mike Brown's death SO much more important? Just because he's black? Every single day I see shit in the media about how unfairly black people are treated in comparison to whites and I'm absolutely fucking sick of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally saw a Raw Story headline earlier today being mad that a girl WASN'T shot by police because she was white!! They were
       <em>
        mad
       </em>
       that she wasn't
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       shot. WHAT THE FUCK??

       Divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It serves the purposes of those that rule to see society divided into self-segregating, squabbling groups that distrust and hate one another. It makes the whole of society
       <strong>
        much
       </strong>
       easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw much attention, outrage and aggression result from the Ferguson incident because said attention served the purpose of deepening the divides that create intergroup strife/tension, making us easier to manipulate and to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no divisive mileage to be gained from the SLC incident, so there was no media-manufactured OUTRAGE. No firebrands or agent provocateurs were called into action.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a society of
       <em>
        consumers
       </em>
       (of everything from goods to entertainment to information), we have been conditioned to be extremely manipulable - we are told what foods, fashion, music and celebrities to "like", which trends to follow, which political "causes" to support, what to laugh about, what to cry about, what to get ENRAGED over, and (when there is lack of media attention) what to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did we get here?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you read-up on
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">
        Edward Bernays
       </a>
       . Also, the documentary
       <strong>
        <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-century-of-the-self/">
         The Century of the Self
        </a>
       </strong>
       is very enlightening.

       Watch who's pulling the strings.

       Thank you!  it is not crimes against blacks or whites.  It is crimes against Humanity.  I'm all for any outrage towards police who overstep their bounds.  The reason Mike Brown and Treyvon Martin are household names is because the media uses those cases as a means of racial segregation.  The powers that be want people to take on a tribalist mindset, and rather than focus on this officer killed a man, it is this WHITE officer killed a BLACK man.  It is all bogus.  People should be outraged when any innocent person is slain, but whatever the color of your skin, by focusing on the race of the victim, rather than the humanity of the victim, you play right into their hands.  Divide and conquer.  Rather than being outraged by media bias coverage, we should all use these events to unify against a common enemy.

       Part of the reason there is outrage in Ferguson is a long building issue between the people who live there and the police departments. For example, the officer who shot Michael Brown used to work for another precinct in the state that had to be shut down because it had developed such a toxic reputation for inciting racial tensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So part of the reason Ferguson is getting so much media attention is that we're literally seeing the result of many many years of building racial tension between the predominantly black citizens and the strangely predominately white police force. The media capitalizes on this because drama = ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there's the fact that the police force in Ferguson has been downright hostile and violent towards any and all members of the media, which of course is only going to entice more media attention. I guess no one told these officers in Ferguson about the Streisand Effect.

       I'm not saying Ferguson shouldn't have been covered, just that this one should have been covered also. I don't think that's too crazy. The media makes it all about race when that isn't the case. Cops all over the place are abusing people of all colors.

       No, I absolutely agree with you that it should be covered. The main reason it isn't being covered is because it didn't draw out huge protests from the people living there, or the victims family or friends. I guarantee you if there had been drama worth putting on video, the media vultures would be circling overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's no drama, no conflict, they're not going to report on it. There's almost no real investigative journalism anymore, just antagonistic journalism. The "Reality TV" production format slipped into the journalism industry so if there's no drama on set, they'll find it or make it.

       If you really think there's a bias in favor of the black community in the media, well, I guess I simply disagree with you on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protests or not, racial tension makes for better TV ratings. It pulls in people who are looking for a place to vent their racist feelings, it pulls in people who're looking to fight for a moral cause, it brings in people who're simply interested in seeing a conflict play out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also take into account the fact that the protests over Dillon Taylor were not stopped by police, the protesters involved in fighting for justice for Dillon were not being marched on by what amounts to a paramilitary police force. And more than anything, that's been the story at Ferguson, the massive and frankly unwarranted level of police force being levied towards the protestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a million other things other than the simply race of the victims at play, here.

       Something that you don't hear reported in regular media is that the stores who were looted by people taking advantage of the protests were also assisted by members of the community who were part of the protest in cleaning efforts the next morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a nice article that covers the Ferguson community helping a store owner who had been a victim of looters:

      </p>
      <p>
       I will not defend the looters, they took advantage of peaceful protests and a legitimate movement to put pressure on a corrupt police force. But don't paint the entire community as criminals when its clear that isn't the case.

       If we're going to be honest here, the police did nothing to stop the riot that erupted from the protests in Ferguson and did everything they could to exacerbate it. And on nights where there had been no riots at all, the police in Ferguson still continued to use excessive force on the protestors. There is plenty of footage of Ferguson officers challenging the crowd of protestors to attack them, calling them animals, et cetera.
      </p>
      <p>
       And need I remind you, Ferguson in particular has a long history of injustice towards the black community from white police officers. Henry Davis is another perfect example. The city of Ferguson has been plagued with racial bias against the predominantly black community for
       <strong>
        years
       </strong>
       . Do not act surprised that the community is angry and there are those within it who don't want justice as much as revenge. I don't condone the acts of looters or rioters but I understand their frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the protestors in SLC had an armored paramilitary police force threatening them and maneuvering on them, if SLC had a history of a predominantly black police force having regularly beaten and charged innocent white civilians with trumped up charges, there would be more going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will riot over things as benign as their favorite sports team losing a game. Do not act like their anger is unnatural or unwarranted.

       And I've already established that the community of Ferguson came together when they found out local businesses had been damaged by rioters to rebuild and clean up their mess.

       How many football fans come out to help clean up and repair local businesses when some of them go off rioting?

       I don't disagree with you that Dillon's murder should be getting more media attention. And I disagree with the mentality of the media as to why they're not covering the story. But you're not taking into account the context and you're oversimplifying the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just Michael's shooting that has attracted media attention, it's the history behind his shooting surrounding the neighborhood. Michael Browns shooting was merely the catalyst to years and years of tension having been built up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dillon Taylor's murder isn't the latest example of a long history of racial tensions between police and community. Dillon Taylor's supporters and protestors have not been targeted or abused by a militarized police force. Those that are covering the story of Dillon Taylor's murder hasn't been bullied and attacked by the paramilitary police force.

       one of the Ferguson protesters mentioned "starving the beast" in an early interview to a TV crew.

       I imagine it's the latter. Besides, the answer to your question has been given. One case involved systemic abuse of power that was grossly wielded to inhumane proportions, and the other was a case that while unfortunate and tragic, was still handled appropriately.

       I'm talking about public outrage. You don't see it talked about about on reddit or Facebook or anywhere yet anytime a black person gets in trouble with police Michael Browns name gets thrown around like he was Jesus Christ and the cop was satan.

       Why the fuck do you think the police chief in Ferguson released the video of Brown in the convenience store?  Yes, it was irrelevant to the shooting, but he was apparently trying to reduce outrage outside of Ferguson.

       No, but the killing of Taylor happened while Ferguson was still a red hot story, and there were no people spilling into the street in SLC, so I can understand how it didn't get national media play.

       No, there have still been protests and vigils (peaceful) for Taylor in SLC.  Part of the reason to me is the difference in demographics.   Also, Taylor was apparently White/Hispanic.   Whites aren't going to protest, and maybe there aren't enough Hispanics to motivate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's your point with all this?   It feels like you're implying something about the Ferguson protestors.

       YOU'RE the one who's repeating the "official story" that brown robbed a store, roughed up a clerk, and charged an officer. suddenly that doesn't matter? there is a very serious problem with law enforcement in this country, and a very serious problem with racism. often the two issues overlap. you do understand that the only reason the media cares about brown was because of the protests and police response, right?

       I'm not so sure about that. It does seem that the media are too quick to inflame racial tensions by using incendiary language to describe white injustice toward blacks more often than black injustice toward whites.

       how often does black "injustice" toward whites occur in a system dominated by white people? white injustice toward blacks is what black people refer to as "every fucking day of normal life in America."

       Granted. White injustice toward blacks is on an institutional level and has been throughout our history. Black injustice toward whites is more often committed by groups of outlaws. It’s still ugly though. Also, in our time, institutionalized abuse by those in positions of authority is spreading out to include a more equal-opportunity selection of citizens.

       very true. if more people fought against injustice against minorities before it reached this point, we wouldn't be where we are today. some people are saying that it used to be a race thing, but now it's a class thing. it's ALWAYS been a race thing, and it's ALWAYS been a class thing. the people who want to address inequality as related to class but not do anything about racial inequity are playing a game of racist jenga. it's so much easier to fight for equality for all than it is to parse the fight in a way that's personally convenient.

       Yep that's what I wrote. Some people think the things I mention justify killing Michael. I don't agree. I think he could've been tased or pepper sprayed. I mentioned it because people made an outrage over it even though he HAD done those things, yet this kid at the time has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and was shot and killed and no one batted an eye except locals.

       Along with the racial division issues, I think right outside St. Louis was an advantageous locale to roll out militarized Police for nationwide eyes. There's a good mix of white/black lower and middle classes, it's near a big city yet still in the heartland. If they tried that shit in LA, where there were police protests going on
       <em>
        at the exact same time
       </em>
       , you'd risk full scale riots that might truly galvanize intense, possibly even violent resistance. It had to be a place that was big but not too big, and somewhat isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aren't enough protestors in slc for it to be an interesting story. Good TV needs conflict.

       I call bullshit. Nothing in your original post mentions Police Brutality. Yet you mention race multiple times.

        Every single day I see shit in the media about how unfairly black people are treated in comparison to whites and I'm absolutely fucking sick of it.

      <p>
       Are you sick of the media saying it because it's false or because you're just tired of hearing it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        anytime I say that a million minorities jump on me about how much white privilege I have and how I "just don't understand."

      <p>
       So is your problem with the media or minorities? Your posts come off sounding like you're some victim of media bias while minorities are fairly covered, which is laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what exactly are these people brainwashed of? Thinking that police brutality has disproportionately effected communities with large numbers of minorities? That happens to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know who controls the media so why are you expecting anything from them anyway? Get off your ass and make solutions instead of bitching about the problem.

       The media portrays minorities as doing no wrong and being victimized by everyone. The media portrays white males as racist pieces of shit who hate minorities and don't care about anyone but themselves. When a black man gets shot by a white cops there are riots and looting and more media coverage than 9/11. When a black off duty nonuniformed cop shoots a white unarmed veteran - NOTHING.

       Michael Brown's case is being covered because of the public outcry not the death itself. There have been literally dozens of stories of minorities being victims of police brutality that get absolutely zero coverage. That Dillon Taylor case makes me sick to my stomach the same way Michael Brown's does. I'm a minority...I speak out against Pigs of all colors and races. Why be pissed at minorities because of media coverage? You do realize how fucking little minorities own and operate media companies right?

       There is not a single minority on earth that would agree with your assessment of media coverage. You have a victim mentality my friend. You see what you want to see because of one special case but there's SO many cases out there of minorities getting totally fucked by the police that never see the light of day.

       YOU'RE the one who's repeating the "official story" that brown robbed a store, roughed up a clerk, and charged an officer. suddenly that doesn't matter? there is a very serious problem with law enforcement in this country, and a very serious problem with racism. often the two issues overlap. you do understand that the only reason the media cares about brown was because of the protests and police response, right?

       No, I absolutely agree with you that it should be covered. The main reason it isn't being covered is because it didn't draw out huge protests from the people living there, or the victims family or friends. I guarantee you if there had been drama worth putting on video, the media vultures would be circling overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's no drama, no conflict, they're not going to report on it. There's almost no real investigative journalism anymore, just antagonistic journalism. The "Reality TV" production format slipped into the journalism industry so if there's no drama on set, they'll find it or make it.

       Something that you don't hear reported in regular media is that the stores who were looted by people taking advantage of the protests were also assisted by members of the community who were part of the protest in cleaning efforts the next morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a nice article that covers the Ferguson community helping a store owner who had been a victim of looters:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not defend the looters, they took advantage of peaceful protests and a legitimate movement to put pressure on a corrupt police force. But don't paint the entire community as criminals when its clear that isn't the case.
