<p>Where&#39;s all the outrage for this kid? He HADN&#39;T just robbed a store and roughed up the clerk, he HADNT charged at officers, and yet no one seems to care? Why is Mike Brown&#39;s death SO much more important? Just because he&#39;s black? Every single day I see shit in the media about how unfairly black people are treated in comparison to whites and I&#39;m absolutely fucking sick of it.</p>

<p>I literally saw a Raw Story headline earlier today being mad that a girl WASN&#39;T shot by police because she was white!! They were <em>mad</em> that she wasn&#39;t <em>also</em> shot. WHAT THE FUCK??</p>

<p>Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>It serves the purposes of those that rule to see society divided into self-segregating, squabbling groups that distrust and hate one another. It makes the whole of society <strong>much</strong> easier to control. </p>

<p>We saw much attention, outrage and aggression result from the Ferguson incident because said attention served the purpose of deepening the divides that create intergroup strife/tension, making us easier to manipulate and to manage.</p>

<p>There was no divisive mileage to be gained from the SLC incident, so there was no media-manufactured OUTRAGE. No firebrands or agent provocateurs were called into action.</p>

<p>As a society of <em>consumers</em> (of everything from goods to entertainment to information), we have been conditioned to be extremely manipulable - we are told what foods, fashion, music and celebrities to &quot;like&quot;, which trends to follow, which political &quot;causes&quot; to support, what to laugh about, what to cry about, what to get ENRAGED over, and (when there is lack of media attention) what to ignore.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>I suggest you read-up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>. Also, the documentary <strong><a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-century-of-the-self/">The Century of the Self</a></strong> is very enlightening.</p>

<p>Watch who&#39;s pulling the strings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!  it is not crimes against blacks or whites.  It is crimes against Humanity.  I&#39;m all for any outrage towards police who overstep their bounds.  The reason Mike Brown and Treyvon Martin are household names is because the media uses those cases as a means of racial segregation.  The powers that be want people to take on a tribalist mindset, and rather than focus on this officer killed a man, it is this WHITE officer killed a BLACK man.  It is all bogus.  People should be outraged when any innocent person is slain, but whatever the color of your skin, by focusing on the race of the victim, rather than the humanity of the victim, you play right into their hands.  Divide and conquer.  Rather than being outraged by media bias coverage, we should all use these events to unify against a common enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason there is outrage in Ferguson is a long building issue between the people who live there and the police departments. For example, the officer who shot Michael Brown used to work for another precinct in the state that had to be shut down because it had developed such a toxic reputation for inciting racial tensions.</p>

<p>So part of the reason Ferguson is getting so much media attention is that we&#39;re literally seeing the result of many many years of building racial tension between the predominantly black citizens and the strangely predominately white police force. The media capitalizes on this because drama = ratings. </p>

<p>Also there&#39;s the fact that the police force in Ferguson has been downright hostile and violent towards any and all members of the media, which of course is only going to entice more media attention. I guess no one told these officers in Ferguson about the Streisand Effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying Ferguson shouldn&#39;t have been covered, just that this one should have been covered also. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too crazy. The media makes it all about race when that isn&#39;t the case. Cops all over the place are abusing people of all colors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I absolutely agree with you that it should be covered. The main reason it isn&#39;t being covered is because it didn&#39;t draw out huge protests from the people living there, or the victims family or friends. I guarantee you if there had been drama worth putting on video, the media vultures would be circling overhead.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no drama, no conflict, they&#39;re not going to report on it. There&#39;s almost no real investigative journalism anymore, just antagonistic journalism. The &quot;Reality TV&quot; production format slipped into the journalism industry so if there&#39;s no drama on set, they&#39;ll find it or make it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really think there&#39;s a bias in favor of the black community in the media, well, I guess I simply disagree with you on that.</p>

<p>Protests or not, racial tension makes for better TV ratings. It pulls in people who are looking for a place to vent their racist feelings, it pulls in people who&#39;re looking to fight for a moral cause, it brings in people who&#39;re simply interested in seeing a conflict play out.</p>

<p>Also take into account the fact that the protests over Dillon Taylor were not stopped by police, the protesters involved in fighting for justice for Dillon were not being marched on by what amounts to a paramilitary police force. And more than anything, that&#39;s been the story at Ferguson, the massive and frankly unwarranted level of police force being levied towards the protestors. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a million other things other than the simply race of the victims at play, here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that you don&#39;t hear reported in regular media is that the stores who were looted by people taking advantage of the protests were also assisted by members of the community who were part of the protest in cleaning efforts the next morning.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a nice article that covers the Ferguson community helping a store owner who had been a victim of looters: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/09/04/345780992/the-ferguson-we-didnt-see-on-tv">http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/09/04/345780992/the-ferguson-we-didnt-see-on-tv</a></p>

<p>I will not defend the looters, they took advantage of peaceful protests and a legitimate movement to put pressure on a corrupt police force. But don&#39;t paint the entire community as criminals when its clear that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re going to be honest here, the police did nothing to stop the riot that erupted from the protests in Ferguson and did everything they could to exacerbate it. And on nights where there had been no riots at all, the police in Ferguson still continued to use excessive force on the protestors. There is plenty of footage of Ferguson officers challenging the crowd of protestors to attack them, calling them animals, et cetera.</p>

<p>And need I remind you, Ferguson in particular has a long history of injustice towards the black community from white police officers. Henry Davis is another perfect example. The city of Ferguson has been plagued with racial bias against the predominantly black community for <strong>years</strong>. Do not act surprised that the community is angry and there are those within it who don&#39;t want justice as much as revenge. I don&#39;t condone the acts of looters or rioters but I understand their frustration.</p>

<p>If the protestors in SLC had an armored paramilitary police force threatening them and maneuvering on them, if SLC had a history of a predominantly black police force having regularly beaten and charged innocent white civilians with trumped up charges, there would be more going on. </p>

<p>People will riot over things as benign as their favorite sports team losing a game. Do not act like their anger is unnatural or unwarranted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;ve already established that the community of Ferguson came together when they found out local businesses had been damaged by rioters to rebuild and clean up their mess.</p>

<p>How many football fans come out to help clean up and repair local businesses when some of them go off rioting?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with you that Dillon&#39;s murder should be getting more media attention. And I disagree with the mentality of the media as to why they&#39;re not covering the story. But you&#39;re not taking into account the context and you&#39;re oversimplifying the situation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just Michael&#39;s shooting that has attracted media attention, it&#39;s the history behind his shooting surrounding the neighborhood. Michael Browns shooting was merely the catalyst to years and years of tension having been built up.</p>

<p>Dillon Taylor&#39;s murder isn&#39;t the latest example of a long history of racial tensions between police and community. Dillon Taylor&#39;s supporters and protestors have not been targeted or abused by a militarized police force. Those that are covering the story of Dillon Taylor&#39;s murder hasn&#39;t been bullied and attacked by the paramilitary police force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Along with the racial division issues, I think right outside St. Louis was an advantageous locale to roll out militarized Police for nationwide eyes. There&#39;s a good mix of white/black lower and middle classes, it&#39;s near a big city yet still in the heartland. If they tried that shit in LA, where there were police protests going on <em>at the exact same time</em>, you&#39;d risk full scale riots that might truly galvanize intense, possibly even violent resistance. It had to be a place that was big but not too big, and somewhat isolated.</p>

<p><strong>Headline</strong> - <em>Brother of fugitive killed by Salt Lake City police says he wasn’t armed</em></p>

<p><strong>Opening Sentence to Article</strong> - <em>A wanted <strong>fugitive</strong> fatally shot by Salt Lake City police</em></p>

<p>He had a warrant for robbery; unarmed robbery, considered a non-violent crime. Spinning the story in this fashion will cause most law-abiding citizens to not bat a second eye at this, yet instead thinking <em>&quot;Well, that&#39;s what you get when you run from the law...&quot;</em>. This is the problem with media coverage, and it&#39;s sickening to say the least.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no drama, no conflict, they&#39;re not going to report on it. There&#39;s almost no real investigative journalism anymore, just antagonistic journalism.

<p>I will not defend the looters, they took advantage of peaceful protests and a legitimate movement to put pressure on a corrupt police force. But don&#39;t paint the entire community as criminals when its clear that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also they&#39;re not opinions they&#39;re facts lol. Dillon Taylor was shot by a black officer and there has been next no no mainstream media coverage about it.</p>

<p>This white unarmed veteran was shot by an off duty nonuniformed black officer. Next no no mainstream media attention.</p>

<p>Yet how much has Michael Brown&#39;s death been in the news? And why is it that in every headline race is mentioned?</p>
