       It is clear that the image of his head is taken from a picture where he is laying down on his back; the head is cropped from that angle and pasted on to the picture of the body.

         the head is too bright compared to the rest of the image

         the head was taken from an image were the rest of the body extends toward the viewer, and is still attached, which is what is holding it at that natural angle

         The blood goes over his right eye, but there is no blood in his eye itself; this means it had to be closed when the blood came across, yet the eye is open.

       I would like to remind everyone that the CIA does actively recruit cinema and theater majors from colleges. Theatrics and misdirections are part of their operating procedure. Even without looking at the evidence, this is totally the type of thing they would do.

       This reminds me of a point critical of the Nick Berg video from 2003. Eerily similar, and also, totally fucking fake.

       "Providing another basis for their findings, in the course of such an assault, an individual's autonomic nervous system would react, typically doing so strongly, with the body shaking and jerking accordingly. And while Nordby noted that "they rotated and moved the head", shifting vertebrae that should have initiated such actions, Simpson said he "certainly didn't perceive any movements at all" in response to such efforts."

       Sorry dude, I'm fairly certain they fucking cut his head off. There would be no reason to say otherwise. We can all agree it is too dangerous now for him not to be dead. So since he is dead, why wouldn't they cut his head off?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they didn't cut his head off (although we are all agreeing he is still dead), then they simply faked it to scare us which is consistent with their message and motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think trying to wonder if its a real head or not is going to provide any answers, even if you find Sotloff drinking coffee in a Starbucks (actually, that would probably be the only thing that could provide answers, if he would be stupid enough to talk).

       Nobody's agreeing that he's dead and nobody's agreeing that his head's chopped off. The video was released by the Islamic hate mongering propagandist group SITE Intelligence. It's another fraud.

       Sotloff could be a fake identity created and managed for a long time, to be extinguished, and the real person could be living happily again under his real identity.

       Did you see the picture of Foley smiling, during the making of this video?  Do you think you'd be smiling if some was going to cut your head off?

       Look at Sclotlof's wikidpedia page - all entries begin in August of this year.

       Look at Scotlof's TIME Magazine articles - all are three months of activity two years ago.

       I think he's a pseudonym. The guy in the video is an actor pretending to be this pseudonym.

       If they cut his head off why didn't they just show them cutting his head off?
      </p>
      <p>
       They had a two-camera set-up.

      <p>
       They could have easily demonstrated that they really did cut his head off.

       I heard something about how IS(whatever you wanna call them) don't show the heads coming off because it can turn off potential western recruits. People like seeing "Fuck yeah, our religion can capture americans and kill them if we wanna!" but don't like the graphic "Holy fuck they just literally cut this human being's head off".

       If they're operating under the idea that beheading poeple will alienate western recruits then they simply wouldn't behead people. Showing it is irrelevant if they're still doing it. Not that I think ISIS is anything but a CIA front for wagging the dog.

       Maybe the self-censorship allowed the video and the message to be distributed through more channels. They already are miccing and editing with effects, why not think about distribution as well?

       I wonder who their agents are?

       I'll bet they're in talks with some studio about a reality TV show or something by now.

       Or maybe a romantic comedy with Michael Cera.

       You are. We are not. Because we didn't see it happen, and our newsreaders and newstypers are telling us so.. Which makes at least myself highly skeptical.

      <p>
       This we agree on - but the 'they' you believe is the big scary brown people of ISIS, when most of us here think otherwise. Considering this video was leaked by the same group who leaked bin Laden videos 3 years after they stopped appearing on the news, some of us are skeptical of its authenticity.

        I don't think trying to wonder if its a real head or not is going to provide any answers, even if you find Sotloff drinking coffee in a Starbucks (actually, that would probably be the only thing that could provide answers, if he would be stupid enough to talk).

      <p>
       He might be dead, he might not be. I don't know for sure, because I didn't see him die and haven't seen him appear alive since the video. But that doesn't really matter. What matters is the message, and when I ask my friends and family about it - they are content to glass the place. Which means these videos were far more effective than all that Syria-Sarin gas crap from last summer.

       I don't think there has ever been a case where the US has invaded another country based on a couple of American hostages being killed, at least not in this century or the one before.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was engaged in military operations against ISIS weeks before the James Foley video appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US doesn't need to stage a few US journalist executions for a pretext to invade Iraq or Syria, they already are engaging militarily in that region.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot see the sense in going to all the trouble of staging these videos, and to apparently stage them really badly as well.
