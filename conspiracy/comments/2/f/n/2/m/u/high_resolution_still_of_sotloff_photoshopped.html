<p>&quot;Providing another basis for their findings, in the course of such an assault, an individual&#39;s autonomic nervous system would react, typically doing so strongly, with the body shaking and jerking accordingly. And while Nordby noted that &quot;they rotated and moved the head&quot;, shifting vertebrae that should have initiated such actions, Simpson said he &quot;certainly didn&#39;t perceive any movements at all&quot; in response to such efforts.&quot;</p>

<p>Unless somebody <em>really</em> wants war with Syria,/Iraq again and we are over a year overdue. The Syrian-rebels-have-Sarin! Story didn&#39;t work and we need something more emotional, which affected Americans. This is perrrrfect.</p>

<p>This we agree on - but the &#39;they&#39; you believe is the big scary brown people of ISIS, when most of us here think otherwise. Considering this video was leaked by the same group who leaked bin Laden videos 3 years after they stopped appearing on the news, some of us are skeptical of its authenticity.</p>

<p>He might be dead, he might not be. I don&#39;t know for sure, because I didn&#39;t see him die and haven&#39;t seen him appear alive since the video. But that doesn&#39;t really matter. What matters is the message, and when I ask my friends and family about it - they are content to glass the place. Which means these videos were far more effective than all that Syria-Sarin gas crap from last summer.</p>
