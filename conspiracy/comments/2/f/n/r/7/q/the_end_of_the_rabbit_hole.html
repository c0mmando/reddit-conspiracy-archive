       I hope to continue to press this idea to new minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to tell you a bit about what I've learned, b/c I have pursued these rabbit holes with a level of determination I doubt few others go to.  For 3 years I have read and studied interesting subjects for about 16-20 hours day, often neglecting Holidays entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes this inolved examining the 'galactic plane' conspiracy, and the '180 days' conspiracy... Both of which are an utter waste of time. Yet during others, I learned that the moon landing was most likely faked, jfk wasn't killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, the Mossad (Jewish SS) blew up the twin towers, and the FBI even arrested them b4 releasing them months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't wish to talk about Conspiracy. Instead, I wish to help everyone here learn to move forward in a productive manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing is first. There is a Jewish Conspiracy against all of you. 
These videos explain everything.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are well aware of this, please allow me to continue:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Jewish Religion, the Rabbis are called, NASI's; this means, Prince. The Hebrew translation for Rabbi is, "My Master". For now, let us ignore the clear master-slave nature of this religion, and instead focus on the religion's success. Nearly 60% of all billionaires are Jewish. This is not just a criminal conspiracy in action; it is also the result of successful people. I believe this success is owed in many ways, to the trust placed in the Rabbis.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Jews, the Rabbis serve as a trusted source of information. I am not saying their teachings are correct. Only that you can see they have the best intentions for their Jewish counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all other peoples, we lack any sort of guidance from wise elders. These men do exist. They have become quieted from talking to the weak. If one does not have a group with which he can associate, he will lose faith in helping anyone at all. &amp; so I elect to create a system of individuals who can help lead the anti-zionist movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, these individuals MUST NOT spend their time "hating on" the Jews. Or dwelling on conspiracies. Instead, they must spend their time doing TRUE DAMAGE to the Jewish Conspiracy, by helping the strong and the awake, to change and improve their personal lives.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Learning about these conspiracies will do nothing positive, if the people learning of them, have not lifted their minds into the level of Gods.
      </h2>
      <p>
       The Jews are encouraged to each play a role in the subjugation of all others. They are taught that they must raise their moral character, their respect for others (only jews), for meditation, and for self respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upbringing of children for the past 2 millenia has been atrocious. The Jewish goal is to damage as many children as possible, so as to keep them subjugated. While this clearly runs counter to the thought all Jews are superior, why else would you need subjugation then?  Therefore, it should be your goal to follow the teachings of the blatantly wise.
      </p>
      <h2>
       People such as Stefan Molyeux, who is a teacher to me, are good examples of what we can attain.
      </h2>

       Virtually all of his videos are extremly worthwhile. I've watched nearly every video of his from the last 2 months, and, as a wise person, I can promise that you will benefit greatly from his teaching.
      </p>
      <h2>
       I will teach you one of the things I have deduced for myself.
      </h2>
      <p>
       SECTION: HAPPINESS (SELF-RESPECT)
      </p>
      <p>
       Comes from achieving/surpassing one's goal, a quality performance, and/or helping emotionally stable people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A goal may be a financial, social, or a personal gain.
It must involve rising to or above your potential, and cannot harm emotionally present/stable people. (Fools are not people. One day they may attain that, but there is only the Holy moment of NOW)
      </p>
      <p>
       Quality performance, is a performance which exceeded your current, believed abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotionally present people are emotionally logical and empathetic.
The opposite of an emotionally logical is sociopathic. (People who make communication feel like work, are not emotionally present, or remotely logical).
      </p>
      <p>
       SECTION: MISERY (RESPECT-BY-OTHERS)
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing others to control your level of happiness will destroy you. Your greatest achievements will go unnoticed, and your worst failures will haunt you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, it will force others to have a level of power over you, which will cause them to dislike you, and treat you as a weak person. This is a natural, organic reaction - to destroy the weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst of all, you will be bound by the principals, intelligence, and abilities of other people. This means that, either: a). if your potential is higher, it will never be reached, b). if your potential is lower, you will never find comfort, The weakest among you, will pull you down, and destroy you. This is how society has operated for Millenia. Now we have global communication, and everything will change.
      </p>
      <p>
       SECTION: NASI (KNOWING) Nasi meaning Prince Rabbi meaning My Master
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar structures of teaching:
      </p>
      <p>
       Praeceptor-Ipsumus (PI) meaning master teacher or master of the game. By using a struture similar to the Jewish one, I believe we can disseminate learning and understanding to the human population.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Knowledge should come from our (must be exalted to you personally) exalted ones, not 'media sources'. We should follow the explanations and presentations of wise elders who have helped us before. Not random 'media channels'. &amp; always, ignore anyone who intentionally lies, or is not emotionally present.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Strict obedience is always pure idiocy and slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews will write TLDNR, b/c they will.

       case in point.  There is a mirror on the moon you can bounce a laser off and detect it when it comes back, don't know how that could be pulled off if we haven't been there! Oh lizardman right...

       It's a retro reflector, not a mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
       A retro reflector will reflect light directly back at its source, no matter the angle.  A mirror would need to have an exactly perpendicular angle for the light to be beamed back to its source.

       I am a Jew, actually, which is why I found your posting so confusing.

       How do you find a post you did? Look through your history. At the top of the acreen is your name. Click it, and you can see all the posts and the comments.
