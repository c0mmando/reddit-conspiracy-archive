    <div class="md"><p>These people....i don&#39;t understand why perfectly intelligent people think they can take something as abstract as the mind and get it boiled down to definitive mathematics. Its cold hearted that these people disregard what actually makes someone human and are obsessed with finding the perfect model and equation for control. How curious, they come up with entirely opposite views of society as cold, manipulative and selfish, but then when they do the experiments...surprise people are kind, trusting and loving. God forbid people are just allowed to be free, that&#39;d be chaos /s. </p>

<p>When and why did that become a popular and accepted belief?</p>

<p>I think that this war on terror is an attempt to get everyone having the same common goals so they can continue to run their &quot;free&quot; society using game theory.</p>

<p>I think the solution to your confusion was relayed at the end of The Lonely Robot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>â€¦ And a new discipline called behavioral economics is being studying whether people really do behave as the simplified model says they do.
Their studies show that only two groups in society actually behave in a rational, self-interested way in all experimental situations.  One is economists themselves.  The other, is psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Thats why i think its naive to accept science and math as the end all be all for everything. The brain has chemical processes but to act like theres really a &#39;normal&#39; mind is bs....really if you can get through life without psychiatry youre normal....but as soon as you go theres more han likely a &quot;problem&quot; to be found.</p>

<p>would it be feasible for a class action lawsuit against the COG of US and the five-eyes and major corporations for contravening our rights and rigging the entire system against us - it would lead to a redistribution of wealth in a legal sense, a &#39;legal&#39; revolution.   it would afford negative freedom without resorting to the violence of positive freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d give it a B+. An interesting take on how we got to the point we are at today, although I am not sure how causally accurate it is. I did enjoy the parts about John Nash and game theory. I also liked the explanation of how R.D. Laing unintentionally revolutionized the medical field. I found the music and cinematography to be overly dramatic at points and thought the whole three hours would be best edited to the length of a normal feature film. The movie will definitely make you question what freedom in the West really is and why ISIS has become such a strong opposition to this ideal in the Middle East. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like almost anything Adam Curtis has done since Century of the Self.  Even the film, &quot;All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace&quot; was good although it was really a reprise of &quot;The Trap&quot; with some confusing bits about African Warlords, Coltan based hegemony, and AIDS thrown in, I can see how the message of Machines gets diluted and falls apart unlike the stunningly brilliant conclusion of the thesis of Curtis&#39; magnum opus, &quot;The Trap&quot;.</p>

<p>I also recommend &quot;It felt like a dream&quot;.  This was an unnarrated collage of archival footage from the 60s,70s and 80s, that I didn&#39;t understand at first glance.  But a bowl of cannabis later, a closer rewatch of it seems to describe the buildup to the nostalgic, possible future, neon psychedelic escape from <em>the Trap</em>, that never happened, because of Reagan era authoritarians / statusquotarians / antidisestablishmentarians, the mind parasite infected republicans (joking).  It seemed to hint at the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/11/mixtape-of-the-lost-decade.html">19A0s</a>, an era which was akin to a pocket universe that collapsed in on itself  (Terence McKenna called this the archaic revival, the brief emergence of the feminine partnership society soon re-replaced by parternalistic dominator culture), leading to the droll authoritarian machine-controlled ecclesiastical moneyverse that is our new global culture &#39;new world order&#39; that did actually happen...that we are living in now, especially.  Post 911 even more so, as the shadow government of the continuity of government plan is in effect since the attack on the pentagon on 911 and so the intelligence agencies are independent and above the rulings of congress (ie: shadow govt).  Oops.  Oh well.  Curtis touches upon this in power of nightmares and the trap; although he suggests it was a long buildup of our reliance on machines and systems theories derived from game theory based authoritarianism and social psychology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s informative and insightful, but seems designed to make one comfortable with the subject matter, it also starts with its premise at the cold war, which seems to lack context from WWII.   it also ignores organized crime and the justice system.</p>

<p>what has happened is that while we all live in a world of prisoner&#39;s dillema and competition against eachother, powerful psychopathic groups have been colluding to play a meta-game on us.   fortunately they are also part of a meta-meta-game and not being able to control it will be its downfall.   I hope it&#39;s not nuclear.</p>

<p>This doc portrays communism as corrupt dictatorships, while seeming to make an inevitable bargain that we need to have both positive and negative freedom, and that there is no such thing as public good.   I disagree.   </p>

<p>Restricting people from gaming the system, or destroying the environment <em>is</em> in the public good.   </p>

<p>there is an alternative to representative democracy, and we have the technology to do it, using bitcoin technology for direct democratic government (as is being tested in some countries)</p>

<p>you&#39;ll still have people being duped and lobbied, but it won&#39;t be like in the former soviet states where oligarchs snapped up all the shares at bargain prices.  </p>

<p>now they&#39;ll have to use actual logic and reason to make their case.  if they try to fudge the numbers, we can fix that too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR:
overall, a very confused message.</p>

<p>&quot;The Trap&quot; refers to Isiah Berlin&#39;s idea of negative freedom.  He suggested the safest form of freedom was being free from being controlled by some authority.</p>

<p>As opposed to freedom to do other things, mainly wealth and money.  </p>

<p>So the trap is people settle for being free from violence and being told what to do, when they should be seeking to have the highest form of freedom that wealth brings you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s various criticisms of economic theory, and Western foreign policy as it relates to capitalism.  </p>

<p>The US government supported the Shah of Iran, it supported the Contras in Nicaragua, it supported capitalistic reforms in the Soviet Union, it invaded Iraq and deposed the government.  </p>

<p>He asserts that these sins were rooted in flawed economic theories. The are all pretty standard.  Nothing I haven&#39;t heard before.  Though I suspect that for many people it will all be new and blow their mind.</p>

<p>What happened was that freedom is not a dream. Stop trying to make it one.</p>
