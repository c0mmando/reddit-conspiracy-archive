        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-09-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/downtherabbit.html">downtherabbit</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So about a year ago, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cs9ts/my_best_friend_was_born_into_an_illuminati_family/">a user posted onto /r/conspiracy about TPTB</a>. One thing that he said that stuck out to me was that there are basically 13 board members that head TPTB and that one of these was a person who has been alive for century&#39;s.</p>

<p>That little tidbit has always stuck with me as a bit weird.</p>

<p>Then at the start of this year I got a hold of a book titled &quot;Gnosis of the Cosmic Christ: A Gnostic Christian Kabbalah&quot; which is written by Tau Malachi. In a part of the book it outlines the story of Jesus and Lazarus, how Jesus brought Lazarus back from the dead. The book puts forth the idea that Lazarus, along with Mary Magdalene, were the only people who Jesus imparted his most sacred knowledge. The book goes on to call Lazarus the &quot;Secret Saint&quot; and states that one theory on him is that he &quot;remains living upon the earth until the time of the second coming&quot;. </p>

<p>After reading the book, I couldn&#39;t help connect with what it says about Lazarus with the Muslim theory of end-time, Masih Ad-Dajjal.</p>

<p>The Dajjal is basically the Anti-Christ from revelations. The theory basically goes like this, you will know the coming of the Dajjal when these things are fulfilled. </p>

<p>-People will stop offering the prayers</p>

<p>-Dishonesty will be the way of life</p>

<p>-Falsehood will become a virtue</p>

<p>-People will mortgage their faith for worldly gain</p>

<p>-Usury and bribery will become legitimate</p>

<p>-There will be acute famine at the time</p>

<p>-There will be no shame amongst people</p>

<p>-Many people would worship Satan</p>

<p>-There would be no respect for elderly people</p>

<p>The theory states that these will need to be fulfilled for the coming of the Anti-Christ. The theory also states that the Dajjal will appear somewhere between Iran and Syria (Iraq) with 70,000 Jews to fight alongside him against Jesus and Imam Mahdi. The theory also states that one half of believers (Muslims) will come forth with black flags of Makkah (which is the flag ISIS uses) and the other half will wield white flags (surrender?). Some versions of the theory also state that some Muslims will be fighting on the wrong side (ISIS again) while the others will be fighting along side Muhammad Al-Mahdi.</p>

<p>The theory states  that before the coming of the Mahdi, the Sufyani will come and attack Iraq under black banners. And that before the end-times finished Baghdad will be burnt to ash and everybody will see red in the sky (an atomic bomb?).</p>

<p>Mahdi is the reason I connected the Islamic end-times prophecy to what I&#39;ve read in the Kaballah book I picked up because of recurring theme, resurrection. Some sects of Islam say that the Mahdi, has been living for centuries and hiding behind the scenes controlling political matters, they call him the &quot;Secret Imam&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess my point is, it seems as if what is happening in the middle-east seems to be an effort by TPTB to fulfill a prophecy, whether or not the prophecy is true and Lazarus has been running around earth these past 2000 years influencing politics it just seems so weird to me that they prophecy is being fulfilled. </p>

<p>Does anybody have anything to add, any knowledge about revelations/the dajjal that might be applicable to what is happening now In the middle-east.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really believe in the Occultation or that Jesus is coming back in the flesh, but why do TPTB seem to want to fulfill the prophecy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting imo.Not to stray off topic, but it intrigues me as the ancient sumerian texts describe the lifepsan of the annunaki to be in the thousands of years rather than the human lifespan of roughly 80 (on average, give or take).</p>

<p>I have always subscribed to the idea that all of the major religions (particularily the abrahamic religions) essentially say the same thing. And, as it turns out, the ancient sumerian texts serve as a logical precursor to such ideologies. So, i cant help but to speculate whether or not the &quot;secret imam&quot;, lazarus, and this &quot;Mahdi&quot;, and the annunaki might be one and the same, just described from different perspectives.</p>

<p>How do you feel about this, OP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a little familiar with the Sumerian/Annunaki story and how it mirrors what is written in Genesis/The book of Enoch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t but there has been a high number of red moons recently compared to the average.</p>

<p>I always found it interesting that the moon is locked in phase with the Earth and we only ever see the one face of it and we haven&#39;t observed the same thing anywhere else in the universe. Same thing being that the earth rotates but the moon does not. Other examples of tidal locking have been observed throughout the universe but those cases have both bodies locked in such a way that a line can be defined between the two bodies that never moves, not the case with Earth and our Moon. </p>

<p>EDIT: Not to mention the Apollo mission transcripts where the Astronauts clearly state that they can hear a weird sound coming from the dark side of the moon even though sound doesn&#39;t travel through a vacuum, then the fact that one of those astronauts promptly converted to Islam once returning to Earth. I make the Islam connection because there is a Hadith about Mohammed where the moon appeared to split into two and then there&#39;s always that line on the moon that makes it looks as if at one point the moon was split into two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how your mind works. I would love to have coffee with you and continue this talk. How close are you to Dallas, TX? :-) </p>

<p>Seriously though, you&#39;ve given me the right kind of pause. I&#39;ll look into that. I just got home from work and I&#39;ve been listening to a compilation of Bill Cooper&#39;s 9/11 predictions on YouTube. As I was asking God about ISIS, a giant bird flew right on front of my car while I was traveling on the highway. There is a lot of synchronicity—and crazy stories about birds giving me &quot;signs&quot; in the two years I&#39;ve been awake—so my &quot;Spidey Sense&quot; is now officially activated. I believe ISIS will be the boogeyman that they blame their next false flag on. I hope it isn&#39;t tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t really fulfilling prophecy. If you look at what is prophesied, what is it? It is things the religious have always feared or opposed, and things that follow a corrupt government.  Governments ALWAYS end up corrupted.  Always.  </p>

<p>The fact is that this &quot;prophecy&quot; has been &quot;fulfilled&quot; a dozen or more times in every culture since the beginning of human society.  This is documenting the fall of modern society which would give rise to the next great society.  </p>

<p>That someone said it would happen when it has been witnessed many times before is not prophetic but and understanding internally of societies cycle of existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the prophecy outlined in Revelations is pretty analogous and can be applied to just about every oppressive regime that has existed.</p>

<p>For example, the number of the beast, 666 is widely accepted to be referring to Nero Caesar who was an oppressive dictator that crucified Gnostics for their belief in the Demiurge. </p>

<p>But the Islamic prophecy is so much more defined than that of revelations and I feel as though what has happened since the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire fits the Dajjal prophecy more so than any other time in human history. </p>

<p>Hopefully its all just bullshit but it does seem as though there are people in the world that seem to want to fulfill this prophecy. The thing that always strikes me as weird is that TPTB are heavily influenced by Gnostic doctrine and its like, if the people who run the show all believe in esoteric teachings, then maybe there is something to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslim here. Maybe I can teach you a few things from my limited knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Khawarij</strong>
There is a group called &quot;Khawarij&quot; who were described by our prophet (pbuh) as extreme in pretty much any category. I can&#39;t quote the transmission right now but he mentioned people, who would pray so much, your prayer would seem insignificant, who would fast so often, your fasting would seem insignificant but they read the Qur&#39;an and it won&#39;t pass their throat (i. e. they recite but don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t act according to it) and they kill the muslims and leave alone their enemies (today it would be the Zionist state of Israel for example). If our prophet (pbuh) were alive today, he would fight against them (that&#39;s his words).
All these criteria fits <strong>ISIS</strong> strategy and behavior. That&#39;s why most of our scholars warn us about them.</p>

<p><strong>Ad-Dajjal</strong>
Massih Ad-Dajjal (the false Messiah) will first claim to be Jesus (pbuh) and later, after he shows some of his miracles, he will claim to be god himself and will have many followers. At that time, the Mahdi is already here with the united muslims (different story). He can&#39;t kill Ad-Dajjal so after 40 days of Dajjals ruling on earth, the true Messiah, Jesus son of Mary (pbuh), will return and kill him. It&#39;s just a rough summ-up.</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>
Some you listed are new to me and I don&#39;t know if all of them are true. I&#39;ll just list a few that will happen or already happened:</p>

<p>-Time will pass faster (felt by humans)</p>

<p>-Someone who walks-by a grave, will wish to be in it&#39;s place (increased suicide/depression)</p>

<p>-Fornication on the streets by some</p>

<p>-A great war. One army from the east, one from the west and one muslim army</p>

<p>-That war will cause even birds to fall from the sky (don&#39;t remember all of it)</p>

<p>-Someone who speaks the truth will be called a liar, someone who lies will be trusted</p>

<p>There are many more. I just listed a few.</p>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some sects of Islam say that the Mahdi, has been living for centuries and hiding behind the scenes controlling political matters, they call him the &quot;Secret Imam&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a shia-sect who says that. Their picture of Mahdi is just weird and doesn&#39;t make sense at all. In fact, if you look deeper into it, you would just have a good laugh and WTF moments.</p>

<p>Some specific details might be difficult for some (many) to grasp - true - but the ultimate and final point of the information itself - that this life is nothing to attach oneself to, that there is a Universal Existence that everything is one with, and that one would do best in life working toward knowledge of and union with that Source - seems to be a truth readily available and indeed self-evident to anyone with a sufficiently discerning level of critical-thinking ability.  The information contained within and as a whole, therefore, is hardly anything to be considered &quot;literally crazy&quot; when understood properly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people would worship Satan  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every mainstream religion is effectively worshipping what can be described as Satan. Consider the amount of people worldwide worshipping Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism. They are all effectively the same religion.  </p>

<p>They basically reused and twisted a whole bunch of gnostic texts to turn it into their own making. You&#39;ll find that gnostic followers were hunted and demonized by all the main religions because the writings were much older than the &quot;established&quot; religions (Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism.), yet contained many closely linked stories. Like the virgin mother. Gnostic texts basically exposed the major religions for what they are. Frauds.  </p>

<p>If there&#39;s a satanic cult out there today... the followers are oblivious to it and think they are praying to the messiah, the whole act of Satanism is about inversion. What more power could you get from worshippers thinking they are praying to the &quot;opposite&quot;.  </p>

<p>So anyone waiting for the &quot;apocalypse&quot; because it doesn&#39;t appear that Satanism is a very huge thing... it&#39;s all around you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you.</p>

<p>I feel as though every single religion has been infiltrated and the doctrine has been changed to fit into a system of control. </p>

<p>The fact that Gnostic doctrine was almost wiped out due to the early church and ever since the ideas that Gnosticism puts forth have been suppressed from the mainstream ever since has always made me feel as though there is actually something to Gnosticism. If it weren&#39;t for the discovery of the Nag Hammandi Index we would no just about nothing about the early Christians and what they actually believed. And the discovery itself is weird. The scrolls were found buried alongside a corpse, one theory is that two people buried the scrolls together then one killed the other and buried them alongside the scrolls to make sure nobody else knew where they were buried. </p>

<p>As a general reply to your post, The Powers That Are Leaving are <strong>DEFINITELY</strong> beholden to <em>or</em> intentionally following the king james bible. It appears that the bible IS the script to some degree OR they are mimicking the bible as its either a good script (for whatever their criteria of a good script would be, unknowable to us) or they want to agitate and provoke Christians and also Muslims to a lesser degree as the script advances.</p>

<p>In addition to the bible a huge body of other spiritual &amp; religious knowledge and their texts are represented in a variety of ways (check out &quot;secrets hidden in plain sight&quot;, the youtube video[1]) and once you include all these the only word that applies to my understanding is just plain &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;esoteric&quot;. Astrology and the zodiac are the foundation to most of the material in religious texts which was brought to public attention with the first Zeitgeist[2] movie.</p>

<p>Very astute observations. I very much like these kinds of connections that rely on some kind of familiarity with culture(s), symbols &amp; a little bit of myth.</p>

<p>I think that if the towers were vaporized in-front of our eyes (pretty obvious to anyone not terrified of the truth) through the use of an engineered and actively directed hurricane as a &quot;static field&quot; of energy combined with &quot;directed energy&quot; of some kind to then disintegrate the metals (in the same fashion as demonstrated by the &quot;hutchinson effect&quot;) that fall inside that interference pattern of the two fields then you can be damned sure that someone living on earth that is 2000 years old is at least a possibility if not a probability. Our lack of knowledge, sometimes willful ignorance and active adversaries looking to keep us in the dark should always leave every <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> reader knowing that <em>we don&#39;t know shit</em>.</p>

<p>Although there are conspiracy theory&#39;s that eating monoatomic gold and drinking the blood of virgins and children prolongs ones life (David Icke type shit), although I don&#39;t prescribe to those theory&#39;s. </p>

<p>I do believe there is something to Amagdalyn/Vitamin B17 though, simply because of the fact that its medical viability has been suppressed by lack of testing and genetically modifying it out of almonds. Not to mention the people who have been arrested for promoting the idea that it cures cancer, if I started a campaign tomorrow that claimed that eating red herring cured cancer, nobody would give two shits, but if I started one that claimed eating small doses of bitter almonds alongside with having a non-acidic diet I would be arrested. And then there&#39;s the fact that in many places the sale of bitter almonds is illegal. And there are cases of tribes in south america who incorporate the compound into their diet have a zero rate of cancer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the supposed benefits of eating bitter almonds with a none-acidic diet? I&#39;ve heard a little about the benefits of a none acidic diet, would it be essential to follow if eating these bitter almonds?
Done a couple of googles and any mainstream information is quiet against the use of it and pushes it&#39;s toxicity as a negative point and disregards any cancer killing potential outright. But if what you say is right then it would certainly benefit tptb to do so.
Do you have any links where I could learn more?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to eat the bitter almonds with non-acidic foods and specific enzymes, papaya(sp?) is great to eat alongside bitter almonds as an example. Otherwise yes you can get sick. Also, I think you are only meant to eat one or two a day. If your blood is too acidic the Amagdylin would get broken down before if gets to the free radical sites and are less effective and can make you sick.</p>

<p>Bitter almonds have a tail that is essentially cyanide. but not totally. The theory I have been told is that when the amagdylin comes into contact with a specific enzyme that is only produced by free radicals they interact and create cyanide, which kills the cancer cell at the site.</p>

<p>There is a great book on the subject called &quot;B17 METABOLIC THERAPY&quot; compiled by Phillip day which gives an outline on a diet that can help. </p>

<p>I am by no means saying that vitamin B17 is a cure, only a preventative measure and can help cancer patients have peace of mind ô¿ô. Please don&#39;t arrest me. There is no substitute for chemotherapy, if you have cancer please go get chemotherapy and radiation therapy do not believe in alternative measures ô¿ô. Please don&#39;t arrest me.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am no doctor and cannot give people medical advice, if you are really interested, get the book. It was compiled by a group of doctors, goes through everything scientifically and has many examples of case studies in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting indeed. I am not an Atheist. I do believe in a higher power. That being said, I don&#39;t buy into a single bit of organized religion. All it is, and all it has been, is a means to control all of us. And for centuries it has worked. My believing in a higher power has nothing to do with religion, it has to do with spirituality which in my opinion, is way different. I know &quot;churchies&quot;, and in their eyes, I may as well be an Atheist since I don&#39;t prescribe to the bullshit that churches ram down our throats day after day. </p>

<p>Point is: believe what they believe or be cast out. That to me, is one of the best pieces of evidence that they know what they preaching is bullshit. After all, if someone believes in a higher power shouldn&#39;t that be more reason to support them and not cast them aside?</p>

<p>None of this seems very far fetched to me, especially given the circumstances in the world now. As to what will happen? Its anyones guess. But I firmly believe we will see the &quot;apocalypse&quot; in our life time (I am 32). It just seems, and feels, like things are sliding into place far too easily and seamlessly for something big not to take place relatively soon. </p>

<p>I&#39;m <em>certain</em> that ants in a colony aren&#39;t aware that their lives are subject to the whims of a human some thousands of times bigger and more intelligent than themselves.  Ask an ant why a human maintains a colony and I doubt they could ever provide an answer that other ants would accept.</p>

<p>Not the same.  You&#39;re assuming they want what we have for themselves.  I&#39;m not so sure.  Even if they did, perhaps they&#39;ve realized that killing 90+% of a population isn&#39;t the best way to secure that population&#39;s resources (assuming they want our resources).  Maybe its easier to let that population do all the digging for you?</p>

<p>I mean, honestly, <strong>if</strong> they wanted resources, a species with the capability to travel across the stars will certainly have access to the vast reserves of resources on all the dead rocks floating across the universe.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure there is? </p>

<p>I used empire building as an example of analogous human recreational activity.  I didn&#39;t say they were building an empire for themselves.  I love the total war games, but I don&#39;t derive any immediate benefit from building a virtual empire other than entertainment.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;nefarious&quot; intentions...I don&#39;t have any nefarious intentions when I step on an ant hill...but it does entertain me to see their progress as they rebuild.  And I can pretty much guarantee you, if I see an impressive anthill while I&#39;m out walking my dog or whatever, I&#39;m gonna step on that shit.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m wrong assigning human intentions to a hypothetical alien race, but if I am, I think you&#39;re equally wrong assuming that an alien race can&#39;t share <strong>any</strong> of the motivations that drive humans.</p>

<p>You seem to be trying to use &quot;logic&quot; to prove that aliens can&#39;t be here because they don&#39;t <strong>need</strong> anything from us.  I know a lot of alien conspiracies like to think they need us for something or other.  I think thats a major flaw you share with alien conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Tangent:  Suppose the pyramids <em>were</em> built by aliens...why do the need a grand purpose?  Humans carve their names into trees every day.  Why cant the pyramids just be the &quot;alienz wuz here&quot; of some interstellar race?</p>

<p>No shit.  I addressed that in the next sentence.  The sentence you quoted was intended to address the theories that they actually are here for our resources.  Like, why wouldn&#39;t they kill us if they wanted our resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Well the absence of wholesale extraterrestrial destruction of the human civilization does not prove anything other than that aliens are not actively engaged in the wholesale destruction of the human civilization.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t prove that they aren&#39;t here behind the scenes manipulating human society.  Or actively controlling the advance of human civilization.  Or helping us &quot;build an empire&quot; (read: expand everywhere on earth and build up our cities and shit).  It certainly doesn&#39;t prove that they aren&#39;t malicious in any way.</p>

<p>I never once claimed that they were actively destroying our civilization, so if you were only trying to talk about things that are currently happening, I&#39;m not sure why you would have mentioned that in the first place.</p>

<p>Again - I don&#39;t necessarily support any of these theories.  This all traces back to you inaccurately claiming that logic rules all of these things out.  You have offered no logical reason any of these things could not be happening.  Only evidence that you haven&#39;t seen them happening with your own eyes. </p>

<p>I have not actively seen government officials getting together to discuss ways to sway public opinion, but I&#39;m certain it is happening.  By your logic (it seems), the fact that I haven&#39;t actually seen it with my own eyes logically proves that it isn&#39;t actually happening.</p>
