       It is all just a farce dude. All of this shit is created bullshit. The internet is the new Bible point to shit someone wrote or said and it is fact. If there is an attack on U.S. soil you can blame the ONLY people who have ever attacked the U.S. on soil, the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you awaken spiritually and mentally you will get it, in the meantime keep on that hamster wheel. Keep checking the "news". Ain't nothing new in the news it just gets more elaborate every year. If you can really step back and look at the BIG picture and start pattern matching you too will start to see the pattern of bullshit of fighting both sides etc etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: No TV for 3 years, no clicking ANY website without first mentally saying "okay what bullshit am I going to see now"? Study the Trivium, Quadrivium and logical fallacies and 85% of the news will just become laughable.

       Everything that makes it to the air is controlled, even live TV. There's not a single thing on television that isn't screened and there is no message they wouldn't want you to hear that ever makes it through. I don't watch television anymore, but when I happen to catch bits of it the propaganda is overwhelming in every category.

       I don't understand, what is it about ISIS that subscribers to this forum don't believe in?

       Is it that they literally don't exist and everything we see across the whole spectrum of the mainstream, alternative and citizen media is made up? Fake interviews and first hand accounts, staged images and videos?

       Are all the videos available throughout the web of the atrocities that they have committed not real?

      <p>
       Were they created directly by the Americans?
      </p>
      <p>
       By directly I mean the CIA sat around a table with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and said, "right, what you're going to do next is lead a radical group of Islamic extremists that we have recruited and paid for to take territory across Syria and Iraq so that we can justify another full scale military intervention in the region".
      </p>
      <p>
       And if so, how the f*** do we know that to be true?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that ISIS are an indirect symptom of the Iraq War in 2003 and the political voids that have been left in Syria since the crisis began their?

       there are distinct parallels to what we're seeing today with ISIS in the mainstream media with the kind of bullshit we saw with Al Qaeda back in the early 2000s. This is Donald Rumsfeld refering to a secret
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGhGHxw0mSo">
        Al Qaeda Cave
       </a>
       built straight out of a comic book. Not a single one of those "caves" were ever discovered by coalition forces. I was fooled once by the war mongering bullshit the MSM provided. I'm not gonna be fooled again, which is kinda redundant, b/c the US government has been using the same playbook since Vietnam. In Vietnam it was the Gulf of Tonkin and the commies. In Gulf 1, it was Saddam Hussein taking babies out of incubators. In Afghanistan it was this secret evil organization Al Qaeda that had cave bunkers with ventilation systems. In Gulf 2, it was Saddam Hussein again, this time looking for WMDs. Enough is enough. I have no proof that ISIS is or isn't a CIA created boogeyman, but all you need to do is look @ the bullshit thrown @ us for EVERY last war we've fought to realize this is probably bullshit.

       As in the case of al Qaeda, the CIA directly trains, arms, and funds these groups without them knowing, in order to manufacture an Islamic enemy in any country the USA and Israel would like to invade for the purpose of resource acquisition and political control. They have been doing this since their inception in 1947. Operation Cyclone funded the mujahedeen in the late '70s in order to bait the Soviets into Afghanistan in a "Vietnam-style trap." This was the origins of Al Qaeda, a bogeyman that has run out of gas for the last decade and a half, and so now we get ISIS—terror for the new gen.

       You say to manufacture an Islamic enemy. But I'm under the impression that groups like Al Qaeda and other Islamic revolutionary units came about as a result of Western intervention in Middle Eastern affairs since the end of WWII and onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I.e. the US and the rest of the West have been meddling with the Arab World, propping up corrupt regimes, notable examples include the Shah of Iran from 1953 to 1979, and Prime Minister Anwar Sadat in Egypt from 1970 to 1981, and countless others such as Saddam Hussein.
      </p>
      <p>
       And out of that, revolutionary groups sprung up in opposition initially to the local enemy, the corrupt Middle Eastern regimes, but by the 1990s these groups starting looking to attack the enemy afar, i.e. the US and the UK among other Western nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was nothing unusual about the US funding the Mujahdeen to help them fight of the Soviets, they became the Taliban of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Queda roots lie in Egypt during the 1970s when Ayman Al Zawahiri, the real leader of Al Queda, was imprisoned in Egypt and tortured by the corrupt Western backed regime, along with his followers. They would later be known as Al Queda, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Al Queda still exist.

       Holy shit yes, exactly. I'm very sick of hearing how everyone
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       that ISIS was deliberately made by the CIA or Mossad. Firstly, no one
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       this. Even if it is true, there is 0 hard-line evidence to suggest that Western intelligence intentionally armed and directed ISIS in its campaigns. ISIS arose out of exactly the same kinds of situations you just mentioned. Syria for a while began to look like a proxy war between the West and Russia. The Syrian city of Tartus houses a small Russian naval base, and is Russia's only direct connection to the Mediterranean. Russia was a staunch supporter of Assad's regime simply so things in Tartus could be business as usual, and if a US backed revolution occurred there, you could imagine the US deciding that that little naval base in Tartus just doesn't need to be there anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the US did what it does best in the Middle East: throw money at a problem, and install a leader to do what they want to see happen. That's what happened in Iran with Mossadegh, with Sadat in Egypt, and to an extent what happened in Iraq (until the whole WMD Invasion of Iraq thing). That's what they tried to do in Syria: find groups of rebels who had the same ideas for change in Syria that America did. And thus comes the whole "we armed ISIS! We trained them!" Which, to an extent, yes, we gave weapons and training to Syrian rebels hoping they would overthrow Assad and Syria would be a nation in parallel with Western foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the part that went awry: the Syrian civil war didn't end. Not even close. It became an absolute fucking bloodbath. And all that support of the US meant nothing. The US gave rebels a bunch of guns and said "here, go get 'em" But what the US didn't seem to place much importance on was that these rebels were fighting amongst themselves nearly as much as they were fighting Assad. Factions were springing up left and right under new banners and new visions of a new Syria. One of them happened to be ISIS, and some of the rebels that formed ISIS happened to be some of the rebel leaders the US gave weapons and training to. Syria must have looked like a lost cause, but Iraq on the other hand seemed plenty vulnerable. And thus their trail of destruction began (certainly spurred on by robbing a bank in Mosul).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm essentially saying is that there doesn't seem like any "master plan" here. This is business as usual between the West and the Middle East. Arabia is and has been one of the most unpredictable places historically for a number of reasons, and that clearly hasn't changed. What I do believe is this: 1) ISIS certainly does make a good boogeyman, and there are plenty of war-hungry people that want to see shit get ugly. 
2) We did give them weapons, but probably gave weapons to dozens of rebels in Syria. The assumption that this was calculated to spring off into a radical splinter faction that wrecks Iraq seems unlikely (it'd be brilliant if it was, but I doubt it)
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think the US has the wherewithal to possibly control this much. ISIS seems plenty organic on its own. BUT, it certainly is very convenient in a number of ways that a radical Islamist militia in the Levant has sprung up and is sending beheading videos and death marches. The truth is stranger than fiction I think

       Al Qaeda is a military intelligence creation. Sure, they exist, but not separately from those who created them.
      </p>

       The official narrative states that we funded Islamic terrorists to fight the Soviets and are now experiencing the blowback from that era. In actuality, they are doing exactly what they were designed for.

       Is that just a shared assumption on forums like this due to a specific world view? Or is there verifiable, concrete evidence that shows this to be the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand if it is presumed that that is how Al Qaeda came about and the intentions behind their creation. I don't think it's a tinfoil hat theory or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it would be easier to get on board if there was some verifiable substance to that theory. Unless of course it's not a theory and it is fact, of course that would require some pretty good evidence though.

       It's verifiable, but you'll have to do your own research; only you can say what is truth and what is a lie. I recommend the work of Michel Chossudovsky for the history of state-sponsored terrorism, but there are many others.

       At the very least, we are the cause of ISIS.  These are the same people we were arming a year ago in Syria to take down the stable Assad government.  Course as usual, like with Iran, they "cure" is worse than the "disease".
