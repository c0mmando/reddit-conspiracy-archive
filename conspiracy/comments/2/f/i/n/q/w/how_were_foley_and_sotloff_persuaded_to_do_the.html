       If someone was going to kill you, would you fight to the death, or would you do what they were wanting, and then pose peacefully for them to saw your head off?  Sotloff was even a rugby player. You don't think these guys had any fight in them?

       If you're going to die, why cooperate? Why not fight it out?

       You can simulate a sense of defeat yourself.

      <p>
       Go 48 hours without sleep, food and little water and you'll start feeling pretty lifeless and unmotivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then imagine the stress of impending death and possible beatings prior to your execution and you're probably not going to be feeling up to a fight.

       Maybe they did struggle, or said something objectionable - The captors could've just beat them till they say what they need to with a bunch of different takes, only showing the successful one.

       If they really were captives, they would have been tortured for months or years. They don't kill someone who is still feisty, they beat them down mentally/physically/emotionally where they don't have any interest in fighting back.

       I've wondered this too, especially when they have them lying down in a row on the floor, then the terrorists start shooting them one by one... next..next..next.. I wonder, how can they continue to lie there on the ground and just wait for the bullets?
If you know you are facing certain death, I think I would like to at least make a last effort. Would be even better if they all got up and made an effort together.

       See... it may even come down to fear of the unknown. Those extra few seconds of precious life may be worth to them to just wait it out. They probably don't have the training to say "fuck it, let's see what's on the other side" and do something to get it over with more quickly. Or perhaps they won't let them get it over with more quickly, as their time is when the captors decide. So many options.

       Pure speculation as this is a big unknown.
It could also be because they are in shock and don't know how to react and may not have seen this type of brutality at this scale.  But people that see the videos are made aware of the horror these people can commit and can start to form our thoughts on best ways to react to this kind of situation.  If it were to happen, I doubt anything would fully prepare someone for this.

       Here's an option I would prefer.
Bullies in large groups armed with weapons will always be able to over power un-armed citizens. I hope the people get tired of being murdered like this by cowards and fight back and if you know they are known for their brutality and are going to murder you anyway, I would think it would be better to go down with a fight than to lay down and wait to be slaughtered.

       They didn't die.
      </p>
      <p>
       The character of Scotlof was likely a pseudonym designed to be tossed when needed. The actor playing Scotlof did not die. He was an actor. The video does not show anyone dying. You don't need to kill your hired actor. You just say you did. But the people claiming to do the kilings are also likely hired actors (they don't act like any real terrosists I've seen on video).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that this is all theater and these are actors reading a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real deaths are the ones by the military in response to this stage play.

       No proof, but that's torturing 101. ISIS definitely won't hold back on tortures. Have you ever had a hangnail? Imagine 20 nails getting ripped off now. You're going to do what the fuck they say. Still no? You got 10 fingers and 10 toes too. No more piggies going to the market. Not to mention, you're surrounded by AK's and crazy people.

       I don't think it works like that... have you ever had a gun, let alone a war machine, pointed at you? Plus you can get your ass kicked to the point of incapacitation without dying. These guys are good at killing and torturing people. If they want you kept alive, they would keep you alive.

       At some point they would wish for death just so it would all stop if they were being tortured.
They could have also been convinced to sacrifice themselves just through brainwashing.

       Why would you fight to the death? Survival instinct is built in, and regardless of logic,
       <em>
        you do what you have to do to live as long as you can.
       </em>
       The end result might be the same, but that wasn't up to them in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't have the benefit of hindsight on this one, they just did what they could to live until they were killed. The decision wasn't theirs in the end, it was taken from them.

       Well torture certainly works. But a thought that I had about the odd idiosyncrasies of the video and the masked man is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the guy behind the mask is just another ISIS prisoner?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can make someone read those statements and die peacefully, they could probably make someone "do the killing."
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we never see the masked man do any actual cutting or killing makes this a possibility. I'm not saying I believe that, but it's an interesting thought I keep having nonetheless, and shows how easily people can be manipulated.

       Well, we're all subject to constant manipulation. When you are aware of it, you can avoid some of it. But even being conscious of certain manipulation doesn't really make it any less effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know. These people claiming to be "ISIS" are doing some fucked up shit. I don't deny that "radical Islamists" exist. Where one reality meets another is something I honestly don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the video's purpose is to "get a rise" from Americans, I would say it worked, no matter who made it or leaked it. Most people I know saw the story, refuse to watch the videos, and firmly believe it was jihadists and they all deserve to die. So whatever end that purpose is trying to attain I guess is still somewhat up in the air. I would expect more and more airstrikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as one individual, it really doesn't matter if you are manipulated enough. Gaining the approval of the masses is pretty much all that is required. Once the majority is set, any dissenting opinions are just overlooked, mocked, or ignored.
