    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Pure speculation as this is a big unknown.
It could also be because they are in shock and don&#39;t know how to react and may not have seen this type of brutality at this scale.  But people that see the videos are made aware of the horror these people can commit and can start to form our thoughts on best ways to react to this kind of situation.  If it were to happen, I doubt anything would fully prepare someone for this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s an option I would prefer.
Bullies in large groups armed with weapons will always be able to over power un-armed citizens. I hope the people get tired of being murdered like this by cowards and fight back and if you know they are known for their brutality and are going to murder you anyway, I would think it would be better to go down with a fight than to lay down and wait to be slaughtered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t die.</p>

<p>The character of Scotlof was likely a pseudonym designed to be tossed when needed. The actor playing Scotlof did not die. He was an actor. The video does not show anyone dying. You don&#39;t need to kill your hired actor. You just say you did. But the people claiming to do the kilings are also likely hired actors (they don&#39;t act like any real terrosists I&#39;ve seen on video).</p>

<p>This is theater.</p>

<p>Remember that this is all theater and these are actors reading a script.</p>

<p>The only real deaths are the ones by the military in response to this stage play.</p>

<p>What if the guy behind the mask is just another ISIS prisoner? </p>

<p>If they can make someone read those statements and die peacefully, they could probably make someone &quot;do the killing.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that we never see the masked man do any actual cutting or killing makes this a possibility. I&#39;m not saying I believe that, but it&#39;s an interesting thought I keep having nonetheless, and shows how easily people can be manipulated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we&#39;re all subject to constant manipulation. When you are aware of it, you can avoid some of it. But even being conscious of certain manipulation doesn&#39;t really make it any less effective. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know. These people claiming to be &quot;ISIS&quot; are doing some fucked up shit. I don&#39;t deny that &quot;radical Islamists&quot; exist. Where one reality meets another is something I honestly don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>If the video&#39;s purpose is to &quot;get a rise&quot; from Americans, I would say it worked, no matter who made it or leaked it. Most people I know saw the story, refuse to watch the videos, and firmly believe it was jihadists and they all deserve to die. So whatever end that purpose is trying to attain I guess is still somewhat up in the air. I would expect more and more airstrikes.</p>

<p>As far as one individual, it really doesn&#39;t matter if you are manipulated enough. Gaining the approval of the masses is pretty much all that is required. Once the majority is set, any dissenting opinions are just overlooked, mocked, or ignored. </p>
