        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I say anything this is obviously completely hypothetical.</p>

<p>This Ebola outbreak is very serious and is getting more so every second and while we (Humans) are responding to it, we aren&#39;t responding in as bigger and well organised way as one would expect for such a serious outbreak of this species threatening disease. </p>

<p>We have also had links posted here recently concerning certain patent&#39;s on various types/strains of Ebola and how they were developed by certain government agencies etc.</p>

<p>As we know Africa is a resource-rich continent in a near perpetual state of wars, famines and poverty. Recently this has begun to change with countries like China investing in infrastructure in return for rights for mining etc. African countries are beginning to settle down and evolve into more civilised societies.</p>

<p>The chances are some wealthy influential people would see this as a potential loss of profits, raw materials, even a threat to national security.</p>

<p>What would be the chances of Ebola being intentionally introduced to Africa to hinder expansion and development whilst wiping out great amounts of the population enabling, potentially, much easier control over resources and potential profits? </p>

<p>Thanks for entertaining my thought.</p>

We, as America, have cured two of our own, but were they really sick? Do we have ACTUAL proof they were ill, infected with Ebola?

I watched part of the interview with Matt Lauer and the doctor that survived looks so well, healthy, he doesn&#39;t appear to me that he just fought off EBOLA. I&#39;m sorry, maybe I was misinformed.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you&#39;re absolutely right from a holistic, population health perspective. The U.S. definitely doesn&#39;t do a very good job with &quot;bread and butter&quot; medicine (diabetes, infant mortality), given the funds we put into it.</p>

<p>From a clinical research and emerging/experimental treatments perspective, however, my point still stands. Think Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Clinic, and others.</p>

<p>What proof are you looking for? I&#39;m sure you could try to contact the family, or Dr. Lauer himself if you wanted first-degree evidence. Or maybe physicians/researchers involved with his care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I watched part of the interview with Matt Lauer and the doctor that survived looks so well, healthy, he doesn&#39;t appear to me that he just fought off EBOLA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you have expertise in infectious disease and medicine, your perception that he didn&#39;t really look sick doesn&#39;t provide much merit. Ebola <em>does</em> ravage your body, but when you&#39;re one of two patients with a lot of media coverage, you are going to get the best possible care known to man. Depending on when the interview was, he could have been well out of the woods (so to speak,) in terms of disease timeline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, looks can be deceiving. He might appear to be feeling awesome and stufr, but he could also still be feeling like shit. Especially with the help of meds. Pkus, everyone reacts to disease differently, and this is certainly true for recovery from them as well.</p>

<p>But, i think what he was trying to get at, is whether it is possible thst he had never contracted ebola in the first place (or maybe had gotten some other bug) and those in charge with the official statements only made it seem thst he had ebola to disseminate an encouraging (though in this hypothetical, a false) mesaage that ebola cam be cured quite well, or at least garner hope towards that direction to avoid panic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, one cannot outrule that possibility, but I don&#39;t think evidence points in that direction (in terms of Dr. Lauer&#39;s history, the story, my understanding of pathology, etc.)</p>

<p>Additionally, for an experimental treatment that&#39;s never been tested on humans to get green-lighted at the 12th hour most definitely required a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebola-virus/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20031241">definitive diagnosis</a> from lab tests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I compiled a series of posts about this on <a href="/r/RedPillPolitics">/r/RedPillPolitics</a> relating to how the Bush Administration caused a panic over bird flu in order to transfer billions of dollars to their friends at the company Gilead Sciences.  I just kind of organically started investigating them when I was looking at large financial companies and what they are investing in.</p>

<p>These companies and their friends in government appear to be doing the same thing:  If you have a product, then you have to make a market for it.  You can do this by using the government to cause the populace to be fearful (like we are seeing with ebola).  This fear makes people more open to being manipulated into a panic.  In that panic, you can make it appear as if you are saving them by giving a government contract to a friend to solve that problem and it is all paid for by you, the taxpayer.  Don&#39;t worry, the banks will be sure to get their cut for &quot;administering the funds&quot;.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t government corruption grand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So fewer people would question it compared to a completely new disease or strain, this also raises the question why if it has been smouldering for 40 years there is this massive outbreak?</p>

<p>You suggested wiping out the population would remove labour for the extractive system but if the extractive system they created started working equally well for competitors then perhaps they would profit more by removing their system to implement another? </p>

<p>I disagree. While unlikely, there still exists the possibilities that big pharma as well as several other agencies have a gain in this. And, of course, true to conspiracy theorist mantra, if there is a gain, there is a motive.

<p>Im sorry. I thought you were interested in discourse. Why would you offer your opinions on the matter and not accept the fact that other people might not share your concepts? The only conclusion i can come to is that you expect others to take your opinions as fact and to immediately disregard all other possibilities just because EidolonofNight says so.</p>

<p>Just because there exists a logical, reasonable explanation does not negate the fact that the reality of the situation could, indeed, lay in that which seems less logical, and less reasonable, but still just as possible.</p>

<p>I like to keep an open mind on things and i choose to accept other peoples opinions to be just as valid as mine. </p>

<p>And if you view this forum so negatively (&quot;for paranoids with cognitive deficits&quot;), why do you come here? For intellectual conquest to suit your arrogance? Or for discussion on alternative explanations whilst keeping an open mind?</p>

<p>It turns out there is evidence of financial gain concerning this outbreak. For instance, the UN recently announced that it would take about $600 <strong><em>million</em></strong> dollars to control this outbreak. Taken together with the confirmed fact of government scams and frauds and government wasteful spending, its not too faarfetched an idea to entertain that facilitation of a natural outbreak to increase its severity to result in financial gains for certain groups to be possible. Even if it is less likely to be the case, the possibility is there. That is why i dont immediately discredit another persons opinions on the subject matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Nice rebuttal. It was full of supporting facts and evidence to support your position. You are awesome in the art of debate. /s</p>

<p>Ad hominem does not support your position, and it hurts your credibility. Care to try again, but this time in a more civil manner condusive to constructive discourse? Or do you refuse to do that because someone counters your ill-supported comments with supported claims? (Despite having admitted sharing some of your opinions, btw. Seems you have conviently forgot to consider those sections of my comments in favor of irrational ad hoc behavior)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time, knowledge, either way, you have proven you are not interested in discussion. You have convinced me that you prefer others to unquestioningly abandon their own thought process in favor of your opinions with blind faith as if you are the top expert on this subject matter. </p>

<p>Im not in favor of oppression of free thought in others. Therefore,  i agree to respectably depart from discourse with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It turns out there is evidence of financial gain concerning this outbreak. For instance, the UN recently announced that it would take about $600 million dollars to control this outbreak. Taken together with the confirmed fact of government scams and frauds and government wasteful spending, its not too faarfetched an idea to entertain that facilitation of a natural outbreak to increase its severity to result in financial gains for certain groups to be possible. Even if it is less likely to be the case, the possibility is there. That is why i dont immediately discredit another persons opinions on the subject matter.&quot;
-What the fuck are you talking about? Nothing you have said comes close to tickling the dick of sanity or coherence. You flacidate the natural understanding of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be the other guys friend. But ill give you the benefit of the doubt and explain once more. But first, i will tell you that i do not believe this speculative notion to be the case surrounding this ebola outbreak. I only acknowledge its possibility.</p>

<p>Governments and agencies have been known to waste funds for their own financial advantages. The federal reserve and irs are examples of such corruption. Viewing this topic from this perspective, it is conceivable that an entity (with capabilities to such things) could have helped facilitate the spread of this current outbreak (either by purposely stalling or stifling the appropriate response, or even through mailicious intent, or even by intentionally limiting medical supplies, or various other methods) and could have helped this outbreak to become worse than what it would have been otherwise. It is also possible that the motive to do so would lie within justification for accruing more government grants in research, or even to justify the passage of more oppressive legislations. </p>

<p>Again, i do not belief this is what happened/is happening. I am only acknowledging that this scenario is a possibility. I also admit that it is far more likely that this is a natural outbreak, exacerbated by financial hardship and poor practices made worse by cultural paradigms. </p>

<p>I was only highlighting the reasons why i believe that this scenario could have happened, despite being way more unlikely than what i stated in the previous paragraph. </p>

<p>Id like to remind you that you are in r/conspiracy, and this is what we do here. Amongst other things, we speculate on alternative explanations for incidents occuring around the world. Now, some folks here take it a little far, and say stuff like &quot;this is <strong>definately</strong> happening because..&quot; Thats not what im doing. Im just speculating on other alternative explanations for the severity of this outbreak by pointing out possibilities, however unlikely they may be (especially when compared to the natural order of things). Believe it or not, some folks have the capacity to speculate about alternative possibilities without investing their beliefs into such speculations. </p>

<p>If thats not your thing, thats okay. I can respect that. </p>

<p>we aren&#39;t responding in as bigger and well organised way as one would expect for such a serious outbreak of this species threatening disease.</p>

<p>Ebola is by no means a &quot;species-threatening&quot; disease, which is the reason why researchers/clinicians around the world are not responding to it as you suggest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, was just saying that Spain&#39;s healthcare system is tip-top and in so far as the administration of a drug there&#39;s very little to suggest that outcomes would be less positive due to simple things like hygiene or medical professionalism.</p>

<p>I assume the individual was either in a more advanced stage of illness or simply less lucky than their American counterparts rather than any failings of healthcare providers.</p>
