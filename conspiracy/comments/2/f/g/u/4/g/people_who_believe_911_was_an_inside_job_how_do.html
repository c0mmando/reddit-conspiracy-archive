       The most common argument I hear for 9/11 not being an inside job is that the govt. is terrible at keeping secrets. Sam Harris made this point and Neil Degrasse Tyson said something similar about the moon landing conspiracy in their podcasts with Joe Rogan.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I personally think they absolutely could keep it quiet enough, Both Tyson and Harris are highly intelligent and respected people. What is your argument against that?

       People who saw stuff did come out.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once again we find that the argument of the peculiarly unskeptical skeptics is not just fallacious, but factually incorrect. There have, in fact, been numerous whistleblowers with documentable evidence of the frauds and lies that have been constructed around the official 9/11 narrative. This leads those who use the “But someone would have talked” argument in an uncomfortable situation. Either they are incompetent—boldly pronouncing on issues they have not bothered to investigate—or they are lying. The next time someone attempts to use this argument in your presence, it might be worthwhile to inquire which term applies to them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And if they want to know why someone directly involved would not come out... well for one, if you're involved in such a massive crime the odds are you are so broken and so far gone from humanity that it makes no logical sense for you to ever come out. There is also something called the division of labor. People in the military are involved every day with things they are not aware of. They get handed some documents and are asked to deliver it, or are sent on a mission with no explanation of what the purpose is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the old MKULTRA experiments. There were hospitals set up as CIA fronts that were doing experiments on people and the doctors involved had no idea they were part of a government program. They didn't need to know so they were not told. They could have not blown the whistle because they did not know enough to do so.

       Wow I had no idea that there were that many whistleblowers. It certainly makes sense why many people (including myself) haven't heard about them before. I suppose that just because someone comes forth as one, doesn't necessarily mean the govt. is going to let them get any attention.

       that's what they want you to believe.  for how many years was the manhattan project kept "secret" ?  (with 10's of thousands of contractors involved.)

       if you are waiting for dick cheney to admit he enabled it ?  or if you are waiting for larry silverstein to admit he engaged in one of the most horrendous acts of "insurance fraud" in history... don't hold your breath ;)

       Also to add to that. The NSA most likely has every dirty bit of info on anyone involved. If they don't they can fabricate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say someone comes out today. Tomorrow he is discredited in the media, the government says he never worked for the government and is just a crazy lunatic, and magically his computer and home is full of illegal shit that gets him sent to prison and labeled a fringe anti-government terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the eyes of the public we now have a criminal lunatic terrorist who hates freedom telling us how 9/11 was a fraud. Nobody will believe anything he says.

       For some reason the quick demonization of people standing up against corruption/government reminds me of district 9. If the msm can convince everyone in a matter of 30 minutes that someone is not to be trusted because they have done x, y, and z, how is anyone supposed to expose the truth?

       The Manhattan Project is a really bad example to use. There was plenty of foreign espionage involved there, and the truth got out after only a few years. 9/11 was 13 years ago, so there would have to be another reason.

       A few things, the operation (if there was one) could have been compartmentalized. Many people involved with each performing such a small part they didn't even realize what they were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may have left a surprisingly small number of individuals who had much knowledge of the entire operation. These people would being living with the knowledge that they were responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, creating an environment of fear and paranoia that has lasted for over a decade, setting in action events that have costed people many of their rights, at least one war that resulted in many more thousands of lost lives.

       I try to understand the type of person that could come up with a plan like this. This is assuming that they were one of the people who "knew everything". It's amazing to think that there are people who can think this stuff up, and then
       <em>
        actually carry out

       and as far as the us goes, you have got to understand this isnt something thrown together, the american gangster shadow state has been growing with impunity since ww2, by now people have spent their entire lives 
in it.  its their way of life, the most powerful secret society network in the history of the world.

       it could be controlled by aliens for all we know.  i just dont agree with even noam chomsky when he says the cia is controlled by the president, as if there is not some huge monstrous nasty cancer thing that has been growing on and becoming independent of the cia.

       ive heard it called the enterprise or safari club, unwelcome guests podcast has some great episodes on it esp by this guy mark gorton.  max blumenthals book goliath demonstrates the madness inside israel, that is totally sufficent to inspire such fanatically murderous crimes.

       There have been AT LEAST 20 people (if not more) that have come out:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Thomas Drake
       </li>
       <li>

       <li>

       <li>
        Hundreds of firefighters that tried to get their eyewitness testimony to secondary explosions into the report
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These people are just ignored and called crazy and then Sam Harris says "see no one has come out".

       Funny that you should mention NTD. Did you know that he
       <em>
        witnessed
       </em>
       the towers come down. You can read his account from the day after. He literally calls the blast that brought down wtc 1 a "demolition style explosion". Google "neil tyson 911 eye witness" to read his account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neil Tyson DeGrasse eyewitness account:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4) As more and more and more and more and more emergency vehicles descended on the World Trade Center, I hear a second explosion in WTC 2, then a loud, low-frequency rumble that precipitates the unthinkable—a collapse of all the floors above the point of explosion. First the top surface, containing the helipad, tips sideways in full view. Then the upper floors fall straight down in a demolition-style implosion, taking all lower floors with it, even those below the point of the explosion. A dense, thick dust cloud rises up in its place, which rapidly pours through the warren of streets that cross lower Manhattan.

       The government creates a lie, sells it, and keeps repeating it. Also the fact that basically every person on this planet has been indoctrinated to think that government is the answer to all that ails you is what keeps them believing it. It's like a person that can't believe that a former lover could betray them.

       anywhere likes their government, even when they do get something right occasionally (more by luck than anything). People are always complaining about their governments. The people you're referring to to are a tiny, tiny minority.

       Keep it amongst as small a group of people as possible. And have those people know that tabs are being kept on them and they will be killed if they try to come clean. I dunno what exactly I believe happened, but if it actually is that big of a conspiracy, I think they could easily keep people quiet.

       What about your family? What if someone from the CIA or whatever showed you a picture of your kids sleeping in their beds or you and your wife sleeping in bed? They know where you live, they know how to get to every one you love, and they obviously have no problem killing innocent people. And they're not just going to kill them, they're going to kidnap, torture, rape, etc. and there's literally nothing you can do to keep it from happening.  I'd keep my mouth shut, and so would 99.9% of people in that situation.

       When people do come forward they are ridiculed or dismissed entirely. E. Howard Hunt is a good example of this. It is said that he was part of the CIA hit team that whacked JFK. Hunt held his tongue until his deathbed when he finally confessed, giving details of the plan and those individuals/organizations involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       His confession was regarded by the media as just another senile old fool manipulated by an opportunistic son.

       The main way our government protects classified information is through compartmentalization.  As an example, a person with a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._security_clearance_terms#Security_levels">
        Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information
       </a>
       (TS/SCI) clearance is not necessarily privy to all things Top Secret.  That person would still have to have a need to know in order to be read into a particular program.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, it is quite common for GS 13 Jones in office A, and GS 13 Smith in office B to be working on the same project without knowing what the other is doing, or the true scope of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who says this kind of secret could not be kept, fails to grasp how the US fedgov compartmentalizes information.

       Someone involved would have come clean by now. You mean the ones the government hasn't killed? I mean what about all the mysterious "suicides" of people that were 9/11 truthers and died in mysterious circumstances?
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of that there have been multiple people that have come out and said it was an inside job. Who do they expect to come out and say something? You would need someone who had intimate knowledge and would be respected for saying 9/11 was an inside job? Cheney and Bush? lol

       What happened to Edward Snowden when he released leaks that thousands of his co-workers saw on a daily basis? He became the face of change, i still hear people talking about a pre and post-Snowden era. Basically put, the person who comes forward will stick out like the biggest soar thumb in existence,
       <em>
        and whats even worse
       </em>
       , they know that they wont have the entire population to back them up like Snowden did because half the population (or more) doesn't believe 9/11 was an inside job. They would be more screwed than Snowden is right now.

       If nobody can keep a secret then why did mafia bosses prevail for so long?  Even street thugs understand fear and intimidation goes a long way keeping mouths shut.  Yeah, plenty of witnesses dissapeared, were killed in unfortunate circumstances, but it gets the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly,  the mechanism for exposing the truth is rotten to the core.  Our television, newspaper, media follow a carefully scripted narrative which is seldom deviated and when it does the plug is pulled.  The fact remains, it is no secret - just ample deaf ears.

       The goverment is made up of micro clicks, small groups of people making back room deals. There is a great chance that many people participated in it without knowing what they were doing overall. Just like building the first nukes, no one knew what they were doing in the desert building a new city.

       First thng to realize is that the people we elect are not the government - they're policy makers. The fact that they can't agree on policy is why political inniovation takes so long and is seldom adequate. Because they are in competition with one another, there are no secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Government is composed of beaurocrats and agencies that are unelected, have a weak public agenda and a strong internal agenda, and which are nearly impossible to amend or destroy. If elected people were involved those would have, by neccessity, been few in number. Unelected people on the other hand have access to funds and efficiencies of which the public are not aware.

       The argument is that the conspiracy would take hundreds of people to know what's going on, and someone would leak. But how you decide how many people would need to know if you don't actually know what the conspiracy was? What if it were simply remote control of the planes? How many people would need to be aware of that? A couple dozen?
      </p>
      <p>
       My response is that, to claim you know how many people would be required to do it, means that you claim to know exactly how it was done. No honest truther who cares about what really happened  is making this claim. So in that sense, it's a red herring argument.

       It raises an important point, though: Before long, it'll be trivial for a government to create video of

       that will be indistinguishable from reality. And legions of AI shills that are indistinguishable from real people. Maybe democracy will always be doomed by technology in the long run.

       ABC is the only channel that captures the second plane hit into the South tower, all the rest were running Pentagon footage, and the ABC footage looks fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       the TV companies have cameras on tripods filming the WTC within minutes of the first plane strike, but its very odd footage. a mix of stationary and video window zooming, plus some secondary camera footage, then the helicopters start filming. and some of their footage looks very odd too, almost impossible rotations of scenery.

       one criticism of the assorted Utube videos could be that the quality is low, hard to interpret what happened from low res and fuzzy footage, but the TV on that day was low res and fuzzy, the Utube videos are just showing what the NYC MSM showed. CGIed footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       the TV quality video from their own channels on the day is low quality, the video looks like its deliberately reduced in quality, exactly as if you were covering up CGI.

       Think about Donner that LAPD.... we have no idea what he was really doing but whatever it was, they hunted him down like a dog to make sure he never opened his mouth. They even burned up the cabin.

       If someone in the know were to go on tv to talk, the tv wouldn't show it and soon officials would claim the guy was ranting because he was about to get busted in a pedophile ring. That would shut me up.

       The Manhattan Project is the best example of a massive conspiracy being kept completely secret. Hundreds of thousands of people, an entire city, for several years, kept the most dangerous secret of the day. We pride ourselves on that history, yet deny that the same phenomena could ever be employed against us.

       I don't know how much of any specific conspiracy that I believe in but I do know this - on the Monday before, I was going to work listening to NPR and there was a story about how military bases were stepping up their security. They said there was no known threat - it was 'just being cautious.' That was the first thing that popped into my head once we realized what was happening.

       Here's one for ya the government only admitted to area 51's existence a couple of years ago! Pretty sure it's been there for decades. It's pretty clear at this point in history of all we've learned about government corruption that they will do what they want and don't care what people think or say about it. If they think a person is very influential and a threat to their schemes or plots.......blam car accident, robbery/murder, they disappear.

       It's odd you say that because you would think that with a little research you would know that the government admits the m to the bases existence. The name Area 51 isn't an official title for the base so they don't claim it as their name when asked.

       It's part of Edwards Air Base. It's also known as the Groom Lake airport. Area 51 is just a nickname that originates from a local map. Even a basic search will tell you that. It is a top secret facility and it did to advanced research. So they don't like to talk about what's going on because you don't have a clearance and you're a crazy nut bag. The only people spreading this myth are locals who own conspiracy related stores and theme shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The professional military doesn't have time for that bullshit so they don't address questions regarding area 51. It's stupid and you're asking them to break their contacts to secrecy by asking what's going on. Some of the most well known spy planes have come from there.

       Well if you had researched it the cia actually did name it area 51 originally.And the only nutbags are the ones who think their beloved gov't is all about serving the people, when their own self interest and that of Corporations is what they are really serving.

       Wow I had no idea that there were that many whistleblowers. It certainly makes sense why many people (including myself) haven't heard about them before. I suppose that just because someone comes forth as one, doesn't necessarily mean the govt. is going to let them get any attention.
