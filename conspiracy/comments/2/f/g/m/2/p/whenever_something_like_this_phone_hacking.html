    <div class="md"><p>People are on drugs.  Literally.</p>

<p>First, the hunger games was a book meant to install fear in people.  Fear that scarcity of resources would lead to a gladiator-based economy and a return to the Roman Bread and Circus.</p>

<p>Second, Hollywood casts a skinny homely chick in the role of leading female gladiator.  The machinery goes to work popularizing her beauty.  She&#39;s not beautiful.</p>

<p>Eventually, Hollywood &quot;leaks&quot; nude &quot;selfies&quot; of this skinny chick.  Millions of porn-addicted men now fap to a non-shapely, too-skinny, not-attractive female body.  They feel they aren&#39;t worthy of her, because she is celebrity.  In reality, they could pick up a better looking chick at a bus stop...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read the Hunger Games, so I don&#39;t know if it is propaganda or not, but I can see where you are coming from. It won&#39;t really be scarcity of resources though, just that they will be tightly controlled and manipulated through corporations controlled by the U.S.F.G.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lawrence is definitely beautiful. She&#39;s by no means a super hot, 10/10, but she&#39;s a good looking woman, and rather down-to-earth. She&#39;s a distraction though. </p>

About a month ago I heard that they had 10 days to figure out how to cool a reactor before it reached dangerous temperatures. <em>never heard the outcome of that one.</em></p>

<p>Then yesterday I heard that they were building a dump facility that was <strong>~29x</strong> bigger than <em>some</em> baseball stadium. &lt;--- Might have facts wrong but I heard it has way bigger than some sport thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone with a degree in CS and worked for years in the IT/Security industry, it is <em>highly</em> improbable that these were obtained through any sort of hack. The difficulty in even identifying the accounts of this many people on this many different devices &amp; sources is astronomical. Then actually breaching these accounts is pretty much impossible for anyone outside the NSA.</p>

<p>It is already documented that the NSA techs regularly pass nude photos of people around the office. We know that they have the capability of typing in anyone&#39;s name/email/phone# and bringing up every electronic communication they have had in the past several years. It is far more likely that one of these guys went through and collected all the celeb nudes they could find, put them on a USB stick, shoved it up their ass, and smuggled it out.</p>

<p>The other probable explanation is a trading ring operating on the deep web went through some drama and one of the members decided to sell their stash to screw over the other members.</p>

<p>What makes it so hard to hack both an iphone 4 and galaxy S4?</p>

<p>I thought it was all an icloud hack, that&#39;s what the media seems to be saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Individual phones can be targeted and hacked, no problem - especially if you have hands-on capability.  The issue is doing it <em>systemically</em>.  And even if you managed to crack the entire system (no small feat, and worth millions of dollars on the black market as a zero-day exploit with actual real-world business uses for gigantic financial gains and insider information from anyone, rather than just wasting its existence on a distracting set of leaked photos) and have access to literally everyone&#39;s data, you now have the problem of trying to figure out whose email is really going to the specific target you have in mind.  That&#39;s going to be hard; even if Jennifer Lawrence uses something obvious like <a href="mailto:name@apple.com">name@apple.com</a>, there&#39;s going to be thousands of people with the same name, and thousands more with fake emails.  The number of variants is staggering…  and that&#39;s assuming (which is almost definitely an incorrect assumption) that the account is not abstracted or difficult to guess at all.</p>

<p>Or because they only used up and coming/current hotness in this leak because it was who the greatest number of people would know, and therefore effect.</p>

<p>Look up &quot;Underground celebrity nude trading ring,&quot; apparently it&#39;s something that has been going on for quite a while, open to people that &quot;buy&quot; their way in with their own unique photos, and the fact that such a deluge of &quot;desirable,&quot; (in relation to who&#39;s popular at the moment) photos has been released like this is a bit sketchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never understood what makes celebrities &quot;desirable&quot; in the first place. Think about whatever &#39;hottie&#39; is popular this week; you&#39;ve never heard a single word out of her mouth that wasn&#39;t written by someone else, and you&#39;ve never seen her without the benefit of her makeup-squad. So just what are you attracted to?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In an age where you can actively select what you want to read watch and hear, how exactly can you honestly say anyone is drowning out anything? It&#39;s like when Fox claims &quot;the mainstream media won&#39;t cover this story&quot; They are the mainstream media and they are covering it. It&#39;s juts sensationalist BS. In this day and age you have complete control of the media and information you hear. You act no one is capable of paying attention to more than one thing at a time. It&#39;s moronic and complete bullshit to try and create a conspiracy where none exists. Sometimes shit just happens.</p>
