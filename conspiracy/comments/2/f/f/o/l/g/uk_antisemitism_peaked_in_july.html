       Is there a difference between being anti-Isreal and being anti-Jew?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would consider myself to be anti-Isreal, but do not think of myself as anti-semite, I don't have anything against the Jews right to exist, but Isreals right to kill people in a land they have 'stolen'? That I don't agree with. If any other group of people had been treated the way Palestinians have been treated, I'd expect them to react in the same way. Can you imagine how the people of London would react if (for example) a large group of Jehovah's witnesses forced everyone out of their homes because London was their 'promised' land?
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither side has the right to kill the other, I'm not defending Palestines actions either, but 'Isreals' offensive against them is just that, offensive, they should expect backlash from the world, there is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       justification for what they have done, and what they continue to do. Stop using the excuse of the Holocaust that happened to you for creating your own today.

       Everyone's been carefully trained all their lives to not criticize "the Jews". You can criticize just about every other group. You can sure as fuck criticize the hell out of white males. Oh, yeah. You can criticize Christians. You can even criticize Muslims to a limited extent. But if you criticize the Jews, people will come out of the woodwork wagging their fingers. Why? Because they have been
       <em>
        conditioned
       </em>
       by the media to do so. They don't even really know why they are doing it. They think they know why, but all they have in their minds is what has been planted there by the media propaganda, and the media is controlled by ... who? The Jews. But I'm sure that's just a coincidence, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about criticizing Israel without criticizing the Jews is that Israel is wholly and completely a Jewish project. Jewish terrorists manipulated the British and other Western nations into allowing the Jews to take ownership of a huge part of Palestine, without the consent of the people actually living there. Then the Jews who inhabited and ruled Israel set about stealing more Palestinian land, and killing the Arabs who lived there if they resisted in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those were Jews doing that. And all the Jews around the world support Israel overwhelmingly. Why not? A little terrorism, a little bullshit, a little manipulation, and the Jews got a free country, for nothing. Nobody else has been given a free country. I'm still waiting for mine. The Jews got this big prize if only they would please stop blowing people up and murdering them. But they never really stopped, did they? They are still murdering the Palelstinians. They've even got assassination squads who travel all around the world, murdering individuals that some Zionist Jew in Israel decides he wants to kill today. Who knows, maybe he's got a list and he throws darts at it. Who will I have assassinated today?
      </p>
      <p>
       And we can't criticize these fuckers? These liars? These murdering weasels? These utter and complete bastards who do this land stealing? This murdering? We can't speak the truth about them? Because they control the media, and the media has brainwashed us all that it is some huge taboo to
       <em>
        say the fucking truth about them
       </em>
       ?

       FWIW, we're not allowed to criticize black people either. (Not that I would want to! Step off! LOL) But it's taboo for much the same reason. We feel bad for what happened to them.

       This is a bit off the topic, but still related. I think this statistic is a powerful indicator of how strongly the media can influence public opinion. What happened in July to cause a "peak" in anti-Semitism? The recent conflict in Gaza immediately comes to mind. More than the conflict itself, I believe that the media coverage of events influenced public opinion of Israel in a negative way.

       It does seem strange that if the media is really controlled by Jewish interests (as so many have stated) the recent coverage by the MSM has been almost anti-Isreal. That would seem to indicate that they aren't, unless it's all part of the
       <em>
        plan

       Every time any part of the media refers to anything that isn't in lockstep with the Zionists, people such as you, who defend the tribe right or wrong, say the same fucking thing. And it's bullshit.

       Yes, the Jews control the media. That can't even be doubted. The evidence is overwhelming. Does that mean
       <em>

       You cannot be an anti-Semite if you oppose Israel or Zionism, as the Palestinian people are the true semites. There are descended from semetic people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jewish movement originally came out of Khazaria, further north-east than where Israel is located, closer to Iraq and Turkey. If anything, those who call you an anti-Semite for opposing Israel's barbbaric existance, then they should really be calling you an anti-Khazarian. Except -- you cannot be anti-Khazarian because then you would have to oppose everyone from that region.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term anti-semitism has lost it's meaning, hijacked by occultists, used to direct blame, and means nothing.

       I had read elsewhere (I forget where) about the palestines being semetic. I had also read about Judaism coming originally from Zoroastrianism somewhere in Persia/Syria (not heard of Khazaria, I'll have to read up on that). But I think you are overlooking the importance of identity when you say the phrase anti-semitism means nothing, you may as well say that calling yourself Christian has no meaning when the true teachings (if there ever were any) of Christ have been lost or warped out of all recognition by the 'Christian' churches over time. It has meaning, just one that, as you say, is twisted to mean what Isreal needs it to be in order to quell rational discussion and ferment hatred of those who would oppose them. That isn't to say it has no meaning, just one we don't agree with.

       Having just re-read what I posted, I can understand where that misconception could arise. What I mean is I don't have anything against the Jewish religion having a right to exist, I didn't want to get jumped on by the few who spoil for a fight accusing me of being anti-Jewish.

       Then I guess my next question is "Do you believe that an officially Jewish State has the right to exist?" If not, do officially Arab or Muslim states have the right to exist? Regardless of he history or activity, do you believe in the basic concept. If you don't think a Jewish state should exist but that an Arab or Muslim states should, that makes your viewpoint anti-Jewish.

       No, I do not believe
       <em>
        any

       religion should be allowed to dictate how a country is run, how its laws operate or what a populations 'moral' values should be. Otherwise you end up with states where the treatment of sub-sets of the people are treated horrifically (women in islamist states for example).

       Alright. That's good to hear. If you don't want to be called anti-Semitic, believing in some countries right to exist but not Israel is not a thing you should do. Every state should be judged equally and fairly.

       Well, I'm a Zionist Jew so I'm pro Israel. I think Israel has several major problems both internally EDIT: Sorry, bumped the button. both internally and externally. Internally, the orthodox wield small but powerful institutions of government like residency and marriage. Externally, well, there's several hostile nations to contend with as well as a problem with Gaza and the West Bank that won't go away no matter how many missiles we shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree the most with people that say we're overly religious. Israel elected a female Prime Minister, something that many countries in the west have yet to do. It's not required you keep kosher or wear a long beard and curls or anything of that sort. In a lot of ways it's more secular than the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Israel needs to be a Jewish nation because nowhere else is. We have countries where other groups form a majority, and it never works out well for us. Sending Jews back to Germany, as Helen Thomas suggested, would be entirely terrifying for most Jews to even picture.

       All nations have problems, both internal and, to varying degrees, externally too. But from my view, most of Israels external ones stem from the massively aggressive way that Israel was born, and through continuing conflicts (not that Israel is always the primary aggressor) since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Israel could (hypothetically) be moved somewhere else in the world, somewhere more accepting, would it go?

       Yes, the Jewish people should have the right to live in peace, as do all peoples, but they don't have the right to just take-over a land that is already occupied. Its akin to me moving into my neighbours front room, shooting them when they try to take it back, then trying to take-over the kitchen too.

       We don't really choose how we begin, do we? Neither states, nor people, have much of a say in how they are created. Israel had a much more violent birth than most, but I believe, down to my toes, that if the Arabic people living there had just accepted the partition plan back in '48, there would be peace in the middle east today.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the entire country could pick up and move? I don't know. A lot of it depends on where, I guess. It's in the spot it is for a reason--historical/religious connection to that bit of land. But the original Zionists like Herzl actually looked at places like South America or Africa as possibilities for a new state. I'm a religious Jew, and I believe the temple in Jerusalem ought to be rebuilt, so Gaza and the West Bank hold virtually nil interest for me. Give them statehood if they'd like, but hold them up to the same standard of other states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't taken over and occupied in the way you're describing. It'd be more like a landlord kicking someone out of an apartment so another tenant can move in. Yes, it's sucky for that person, but it's not illegal in itself, if they follow the rules of how to kick someone out of an apartment.

       The three branches of the Abrahamic religions have all claimed that spot as their own through divine right, maybe the solution would be to make the entire area of Jerusalem state-less, controlled by the UN (or something). The 'state' of Israel hadn't existed as such for nearly 1500 years, why did anyone think it would be a good idea to resurrect it, or that the population in the area would accept it?

       If the temple is rebuilt and Jews have access to it, I'm fine if the rest of the city is run by McDonalds. UN control is doubly fine by me.

       People have been aiming for a Jewish state since the 1880's or so. The idea behind it is that Jews were so spread out, it made us vulnerable in a way few non-Jews can understand. When the Holocaust occurred, much of the world said "Yes, okay, we need to do something." That something ended up being the creation of a nation-state. That way we would have our own laws, our own borders, all the stuff a Westphalian state should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should take a read on how, once the state of Israel came into being, the reactions by some of the neighbouring countries towards their Jewish citizenry. Many were simply kicked out, had their homes seized by the state, etc. Again, the fact that happened is another indicator of Israel's need to exist.

       But Israel, along with British and US help, went about it in a completely ham-fisted way. Israel was all but dumped into the middle of a hostile area, given a boat-load of guns and told to get on with it. Is your religion, any religion, worth all the death. If God is really looking out for his people, be they Jewish, Christian or Muslim, would this be the answer he was looking for? At some point, one side has to be the 'bigger person', swallow their national pride and say "you know what? We're out of here.". Unless that happens, war will continue, people will die
       <em>
        for no reason
       </em>
       other than what some bloody books say (which were all written and re-written countless times until the original meaning was lost) is the correct way of believing in what is essentially
       <em>
        the same God
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You are hoping for the re-building of the temple, I assume to herald the end of times and make way for the Moshiach. But doesn't that require that all Jews repent (what have you all done recently that requires repenting??), and return to the land of Isreal? That would require the best part of 14 million Jews (currently. That figure will surely rise) more than doubling the Jewish population of Israel. With ideas like that, you will never see peace, you can't acheive peace, you need the land that Palestine sits on to accommodate the influx of Jews and they are not going to give up even more of it without a fight. All that Israel is doing is provoking an already angry state.

       In regards to whether this conflict is worth fighting for in a religious sense: I don't think anyone should die for their religion. But have a sense of perspective--Syria killed, in the last four years, many more Muslims than Jews have killed since 1948. There really isn't any reason to go to war except in self defense and the problem with that is that both sides have a narrative that is based on the fact that they always operate only for self defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews don't really consider G_d as the same person in Christianity and Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The coming of the Moschiach is something nobody's sure about. We don't know how to call him or whatever-- every sect has their own theories. I personally think it's based on the temple being built, but that's just me.

       I'm sure that each religion would consider
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       God to be different to all other faiths', but that doesn't change the fact that you all stem from the same essential base. In the same way that humans have all stemmed from an original source and changed, diverged and evolved into a multitude of differing races, each with their own customs and traditions, so too have the Abrahamic religions diverged from each other and formed their own 'cannon'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self defence is one thing, but actively seeking to inflict as much damage as possible is different. Yes, the Syrians are doing a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of crappy things, but so are so many countries in the world. We're human, we divide ourselves into groups based on skin colour, national pride, religious differences even within the same damn religion (Catholics and Protestants, shiites and Sunnis, Pharisees and Sadducees to name a few) or any other difference from another group, then wage war with each other over who's way of life is better. We are incapable of peace, it will
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       be achieved as a long term prospect. We are nothing more than animals fighting over territory, mates, food or watering holes, we just dress it up to give it reason.  Israels losses number less than a hundred, Palestines nearly 2000. (I haven't seen the news today, that was what was reported yesterday). It seems a massively out of proportion response to a small (but legitimate, granted) threat to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not what I was originally asking. Mind you, a lot of our discussion has ranged away from my original topic, but has been an interesting discussion nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to my original question; can one express critisism of Israel without being branded an anti-semite?  And as an aside, why did you censor the word God earlier? I thought it was the name of God you were supposed not to use?

       Saying that we share a G-d when each group would disagree kind of implies the existence of that being, meaning two groups are wrong. I'd say we all share an Abrahamic base, a monotheistic base, we have differing views on divinity.

       Israel, I'm not sure if you know this, is a state built to withstand a lot. Bunkers are virtually everywhere once you get close to the border, and the Iron Dome system intercepts a massive number of rockets (though not mortars). The amount of firepower directed at Israel--and not military targets, but small towns and kibbutzim--is astonishing. That's the reason for the disparity. Not the lack of trying. I'm disappointed in Israel for being so aggressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your original question way way back, yes, you can criticize Israel without being antisemitic. However, not all criticisms are not antisemitic. There are tons of criticisms in that regard. What I would do instead of saying you're criticizing Israel, which is a whole country, criticize a policy of Israel you disagree with rather than the country itself.

       I am VERY anti Zionist (against the state of Israel and it's survival no matter what) but am not anti Jewish. I have Jewish friends and they hate what Israel is doing and how it is making people feel like all Jews want to exterminate the Palestinian people and feel entitled to Jerusalem. Zionism is not specific to only Jews, many Christians are zionists as well, and I hate that I am apart of a country that helped ethnically cleanse 600,000 Palestinians to create Israel in the late 40's. So no being anti Israel or anti Zionist does not make you an anti Semite. The media wants you and the general population I feel that way so you are forced to support Israel or be labeled or feel like ou are an anti Semite. That's their strategy and to e honest it works. Anyone who goes on a MSM network and tries to have a real discussion about Israel and it's crimes are labeled an anti Semite and are ripped apart by the news anchors saying anyone who poses a discussion about the state of Israel doesn't believe in the holocaust and pulls that card on them. It works an that's why people avoid the subject in fear of being labeled an anti Semite or someone who doesn't believe in the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people need to know there is a MAJOR difference between being anti Israel and an anti Semite.

       I almost didn't post this for fear of being branded as an evil anti-semite, or being jumped on by the 'actual' anti-semites, so I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw your post which makes me feel less alone. There are so many posters on here that go on about the 'evil Jews and their holohoax' killing innocent Palestinians in persuit of the new world order, and so many others who are clearly so pro-Isreal that killing a bunch of kids in a school is justified, it seems as though actual, rational discussion is drowned out. You have to be either for them or you're a racist.
