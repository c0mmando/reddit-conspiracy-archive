       What were the real reasons? I'm sure it wasn't German U boats and lustitania like the textbooks and school has brainwashed us to believe. What drove us into war? Particularly US involvement

       Hitler and his Nazi party in Germany attacked and took over Poland, and then they got greedy and wanted more.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the gist of what started it, there are many more complicated factors that have to do with the length of it, and how many people died. But that's the TL;DR.

       The question was what started it, not the consequences or events past that.

       WW1 was started by one guy shooting another guy. After that it gets super complicated.

       No worries. I'm not a historian, all I know is from what I have read.

      <p>
       If you want a deeper explanation of every countries motivations and involvements, I can't help you there. There is tons online to read though, Wikipedia has the basics, and more can be found elsewhere. Hope you find your answers!

       Both WW1 and WW2 were wars about resources and empire.  So economics and power was what they were about.  Really nothing else.  The events that were significant to "history" might be considered catalysts but the conflicts themselves were both inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a few hundred years the wars of the 20th and 21st century will be called "The Resource Wars".

       The people of the United States were not really in the mood for war since it didn't affect them at all. So Pearl Harbour was allowed to happen to swing the public mood. Its all about gaining control of the world's resources so the rich and powerful can get richer and more powerful.

       Hitler and the nazi party were born from the heavy sanctions imposed on Germany after ww1. 
The idea was that Germany and Germans were being mistreated and abused by the rest of the world, particularly the French and Italians, who were taking a lot of coal and other resources. 
Germany was broke, powerless and hungry. And the nazi party grew in popularity because Germans wanted an end to the heavy economic sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler had two reasons for hating Jews. 
One was that a large % of them were considered to be like gypsies, as the nazis felt they were untidy and dirty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other was the fact that they controlled a lot of the banking industry.

       Pay careful attention to his discussion of the group known as the "focus" or the "anti-nazi-committte". This group of Jews was responsible for financing Churchill's extravagant lifestyle which he could never afford on the pittance of a salary which he earned.
      </p>

       You should also look into Charles Lindbergh's speech on Sept 11, 1941 where he names the culprits who wanted to push America into war.

       I just got finished watching that documentary about gold actually that was posted. But I also remember reading something about how the dollar was about to collapse or something like that. Any idea what I'm referring to?

       I vaguely remember something like that, but it has been awhile, the thing is that any major conflict like that usually has many smaller (mostly unknown to the public) reasons to keep going after the initial reason for (probably something public and big) starting the fighting.

       It was global power. When the Nazis came to run Germany, they threw the Jews out of positions of power and took back their own country, and it almost immediately began to prosper. Whereas before the Jews had kept it in poverty, Germany became an industrial powerhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Churchill and Roosevelt took notice. Neither wanted Germany to assume its rightful place on the world stage. They had staved off German power by WW1, and they knew they had to do the same to keep Germany down under the Nazis. They had to have another world war, so that Germany would not  develop an empire that threatened the empires of Britain and America.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what WW2 was really all about -- protecting the established empire of Britain, and the evolving empire of America, by preventing Germany from prospering. Of course world Jewery was strongly opposed to the Nazis as well, because the Nazis had taken control over Germany away from the Jews. They wanted Germany humbled and broken.
