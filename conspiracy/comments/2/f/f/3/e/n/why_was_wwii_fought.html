<p>That&#39;s the gist of what started it, there are many more complicated factors that have to do with the length of it, and how many people died. But that&#39;s the TL;DR.</p>

<p>If you want a deeper explanation of every countries motivations and involvements, I can&#39;t help you there. There is tons online to read though, Wikipedia has the basics, and more can be found elsewhere. Hope you find your answers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler and the nazi party were born from the heavy sanctions imposed on Germany after ww1. 
The idea was that Germany and Germans were being mistreated and abused by the rest of the world, particularly the French and Italians, who were taking a lot of coal and other resources. 
Germany was broke, powerless and hungry. And the nazi party grew in popularity because Germans wanted an end to the heavy economic sanctions.  </p>

<p>Hitler had two reasons for hating Jews. 
One was that a large % of them were considered to be like gypsies, as the nazis felt they were untidy and dirty. </p>

<p>The other was the fact that they controlled a lot of the banking industry. </p>

<p>Pay careful attention to his discussion of the group known as the &quot;focus&quot; or the &quot;anti-nazi-committte&quot;. This group of Jews was responsible for financing Churchill&#39;s extravagant lifestyle which he could never afford on the pittance of a salary which he earned.</p>

<p>You should also look into Charles Lindbergh&#39;s speech on Sept 11, 1941 where he names the culprits who wanted to push America into war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was global power. When the Nazis came to run Germany, they threw the Jews out of positions of power and took back their own country, and it almost immediately began to prosper. Whereas before the Jews had kept it in poverty, Germany became an industrial powerhouse.</p>

<p>Churchill and Roosevelt took notice. Neither wanted Germany to assume its rightful place on the world stage. They had staved off German power by WW1, and they knew they had to do the same to keep Germany down under the Nazis. They had to have another world war, so that Germany would not  develop an empire that threatened the empires of Britain and America.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what WW2 was really all about -- protecting the established empire of Britain, and the evolving empire of America, by preventing Germany from prospering. Of course world Jewery was strongly opposed to the Nazis as well, because the Nazis had taken control over Germany away from the Jews. They wanted Germany humbled and broken.</p>
