<p>for fuck sake.</p>

<p>ukraine internal forces want to fix the fucking shitfuck that is happening for months now by slowly trying to get some sort of peace and those fuckers from media just throw more gasoline on fire.</p>

<p>I fucking hate russians and putin as much as obama and the fucking us but I hope russian tanks will soon parade in London and shell down that fucking bbc hole of lying rats</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the question has been whether it was Ukrainian rebels or actual Russian soldiers who shot down the plane, this is merely inconclusive evidence that it might have been Russian soldiers. I had been leaning toward the rebels as the culprit, since the shoot down was a big mistake and I had, at least, a <em>little</em> confidence in the Russian air defense forces. But on the other hand, it could well mean that the command and control from Moscow on these &quot;Russian vacationers&quot; is rather weak, due to the need for deniability, leading to this disaster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>had to</em> find this tweet from the other day:<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/RusEmbassyUAE/status/507226671401824256">https://twitter.com/RusEmbassyUAE/status/507226671401824256</a>  </p>

<p>Also;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Pure Russian accents&#39;<br/>
The eyewitness told the BBC that the crew struck him as Russian soldiers: &quot;Well-disciplined, unlike the rebels, and not wearing the standard Ukrainian camouflage uniform sported by government and rebel troops alike.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but didn&#39;t that alleged ISIS executioner (jihadi john) speak in a fluent british accent and also was not wearing the standard Iraqi uniform? I guess that means that Britain was behind the &quot;beheadings&quot; of ISIS, because that logic is completely flawed.</p>
