        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nine long months ago I posted this self post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qh6zh/im_a_creative_directorui_designerdeveloper_in_sf/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qh6zh/im_a_creative_directorui_designerdeveloper_in_sf/</a> 
and, much to my astonishment people were beyond excited about the idea of having a reddit replacement exclusively for conspiracy, grassroots journalism, and alternative news. So I began to build Criticl.</p>

<p>On top of our product focus we wanted to paramount user privacy, user anonymity, zero censorship, total transparency and above all else, total content neutrality. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Creative Director / Engineer based out of San Francisco. I&#39;ve worked on apps for ESPN, Pandora.com, Grooveshark, Livestream and REN REN. I tossed and turned at night knowing that my healthy array of talent was being used exclusively to build products that more or less complicated our lives. Meanwhile, the world was literally stepping into the realm of ridiculous censorship everywhere; contrived content aimed at distraction or blatant disinformation, puff pieces aimed at subverting public opinion, or just a healthy mix of distracting cat photos sitting on the same line of importance as genocide.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the internet that I&#39;ve grown up with, which makes sense, given the media buy up of online communities and social assets. I can’t, in good conscience, continue to wield the amazing power of the internet knowing that I&#39;m creating chat apps and food spotting apps that detract from community.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I want the community to know that Criticl is your community, I have no agenda nor do I want to develop one. With that being said, I welcome any and all feedback you have regarding the web app (bugs, feature requests, suggestions, anything that will improve your experience.) Regardless of the number of users, I can promise you there will always be somebody to get a hold of, for anything. </p>

<p>To conclude, NOTHING will be removed unless it&#39;s explicitly against the rules (PORN.) Outside of porn, NOTHING will be deleted, ever. Our servers have more than three contingency plans in case shit gets hairy in the future. I’ll move out of the country to protect our content.</p>

<p>Join me please.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice site. Great idea. </p>

<p>The UI gets in the way. Reddit won out over the competitors because it&#39;s super fucking simple. I don&#39;t want a noisy environment filled with flashing gifs and rewards. I want headlines, votes, comments and threads.</p>

<p>Also email addresses shouldn&#39;t be required to join. </p>

<p>Other than that, great version 1.</p>

<p>Thank you for acknowledging that this is our MVP, not even our V1, performance will increase, design will simplify / focus in on key user experience.</p>

<p>As soon as we get our server situation taken care of you will notice HUGE performance increases. After that you should expect our IOS and android apps to hit the markets :).... For free of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your intro and started groaning &quot;oh yeah, another whoaverse. Some ugly reddit clone with no network effect...&quot; Then I was pleasantly surprised with a modern online magazine style blog layout. I stuck around and participated on the site for an hour or so BECAUSE the UI was so pleasant. Just a counter opinion to bitcloud&#39;s assessment. My friend also said &quot;oh that&#39;s nice! And also got on for a while because of the pleasant UI.&quot; Same friend never even entered whoaverse into their browser&#39;s address bar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, it could and should be a lot cleaner. I&#39;m on mobile and saw something interesting about us troops harvesting heroin. It wasn&#39;t readily apparent it was from youTube or I wouldn&#39;t have clicked it. Also there are too many clicks to get to content. It&#39;s just too much flash and not enough hard links and comments. Great idea though. But it looks too commercial for me to visit regularly. Also I hope people at least cross post so we don&#39;t lose good content here. I do love the idea of autonomy and privacy though, fantastic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on, are you kidding? I have no idea where you got that no JavaScript option ruins the internet idea, that&#39;s absurd. I run no-script and a lot of other people do as well. Most sites run just fine without it and the ones that require JavaScript to view I dont waste my time with. Most of my customers also run without JavaScript so I think you are completely wrong about that stupid percentage, but even if im wrong, its not very professional of you to blame people who dont use it. That was the same argument people used about Internet Explorer back in the days when other browsers started to gain popularity and look how that turned out. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need java-script to do most of what you need to do. Its important that you listen to the concerns instead of boxing people into specific categories that you don&#39;t like or not prefer. Its not going to get you anywhere.</p>

<p>You are going to be operating a site with privacy conscious people and the people that dont run java script for obvious reasons ARE the people that help others who dont understand this maintain their privacy. Its sounds really lame that you blame the whole issue on privacy conscious people and makes you sound like someone that shouldn&#39;t be operating a site like that.</p>

<p>It looks like you put a lot of work into it, but can I suggest you do the one thing that reddit does well and just list a large number of links sequentially with small thumbnails beside them? The pages seem to take a long time to load even if the loading graphic is pretty looking but I just want to see a long list of links instead of 3 titles with huge pictures before I have to scroll for a few more before next paging. It&#39;s difficult for the eye to scan the content when it has to jump from one part of the page to another. It probably looks better on mobile. I guess you&#39;re using bootstrap and trying to cater to all screen sizes but on large screens, I think it&#39;s not great looking.</p>

<p>If the content is user generated, yes. Otherwise, no and they have to respond to take down notices. Just warning you before someone starts hassling you. I don&#39;t think source citing gets around it and anyway, a site could be using an image illegally which you then pull so you would get the take down notice too. </p>

<p>I remember <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting">this post from 5 years ago, where MrGrim introduced imgur</a>.</p>

<p>There is some great analysis and discussion that goes on in some of the alternative subs on this site.  I would a place that offered that which was not overrun by trolls.  </p>

<p>Frankly the mods here do a really good job.  What I&#39;ve learned here is that not every opinion is equal or deserves equal time and there has to be moderation.  That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t room for a spectrum of opinions, but some opinions and the way they are expressed just exist to insult and detract from the conversation.</p>

<p>How will criticl be moderated so that it doesn&#39;t turn into tard trolling, sorcha faal disinfo and machinations of paranoid schizophrenics?</p>

<p>My advice would be to minimize the &#39;graphicality&#39; of it and focus on ease of surveying information and the steps to interact with the stories.</p>

<p>Also, please make target=blank for external links.</p>

<p>What would be great is transparency into the accounts voting; e.g., make all votes public as well as vote pattern analytics or something to weed out the shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gorgeous site. Obviously a huge labor of love!</p>

<p>Looks like you got most of the bugs worked out by the time I arrived. </p>

<p>I was able to sign up without email, but once I got to the page where I edit my user profile, every time I clicked save, the email field had a red star next to it and there wasn&#39;t any indication as to whether or not a) my profile info had been saved or b) it hadn&#39;t been saved, because I didn&#39;t enter my email. A little confusing, but nothing was broken and I was able to use the site, upload content, etc. Great start! </p>

<p>I&#39;ll echo what others are saying about design. Although it looks really slick, it isn&#39;t very functional if you want to quickly scan headlines for topics that interest you and discussions you want to be involved in.</p>

<p>If I could modify the ui as I would want, I would  provide two views:</p>

<p>a)  condensed - a reddit-like interface with just headlines and thumbnails</p>

<p>b) expanded - what you have now, but with smaller &quot;article boxes&quot; and infinite scroll</p>

<p>I would use a) on mobile and b) on my desktop / notebook. I do this with Digg&#39;s RSS reader (which has these two views) and it works really nicely. </p>

<p>Anyway - these are &quot;nice to haves&quot; - but already, this is an incredible first iteration. The functionality that is most important is the censorship-free nature of the site. Thank you so much for building this! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A real alternative needs to work at least mostly with javascript disabled. Sorry, I&#39;m not even going to enable javascript to see what it looks like (broken without JS). I&#39;ve been doing webdev since the mid 90&#39;s, and javascript is the single biggest crutch and purveyor of evil data analytics. Glad to see more attempts however, keep them coming. If anyone is working on something using python/open source, along with the approach of stacking javascript features on top of existing functionality, give my a shout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice site. I have a couple suggestions:</p>

<p>1) after the quick registration from the splash page it automatically took me into another area where i had to re-enter my password and save my info again. Maybe you could avoid this and send users directly to the home page. Im dumb so it took me a couple minutes to figure out I had to click the criticl logo to find the content.</p>

<p>2) After I figured all that out I made a post. When I submitted It then took me back to where you make another new post. Instead I suggest it linking to the content page. Possibly even the New posts so we can view what we just posted.</p>

<p>3) The content page boxes seem a little big. I think you could condense them down a bit. </p>

<p>Love it though. Great job. Will support 100%</p>
