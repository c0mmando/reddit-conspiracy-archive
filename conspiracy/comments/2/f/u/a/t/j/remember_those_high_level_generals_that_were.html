       Denver International s one likely candidate for a long-term subsurface survival facility. I believe that having these kinds of bases make war much more likely. Not as hard to push the button when you know you and your buddies will be just fine.

       You do know who TPTB are, right? As in, they're not the military leaders, nor would they appreciate a life buried deep underground inside a fortified bunker until the surface became habitable again.

       You're missing one, and it's because you're not thinking through it clearly, quite possibly because you feel dominated because of the position you've allowed yourself to be put into.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB don't need 100% domination. They don't care about domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like you don't need to dominate those who were born into less fortunate circumstances than you, so do TPTB not need to dominate you.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just need to maintain their cushy lifestyle. As long as you don't threaten that, they give precisely zero fucks about you. Just like you give exactly zero fucks about the thousands of children who starve to death in Africa each day.

       TPTB are not Hitler or Cesar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they're paranoid? What do you think they're afraid of?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are looking at things from the perspective of a frightened, childish person.
       <strong>
        They
       </strong>
       take.
       <strong>
        They
       </strong>
       use people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really. Look at the wealthiest people in the world. Look at the people behind the scenes pushing the buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people around here will say, "Rothschilds". What do they have to fear?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, let's try our mind experiment: we are the 1%.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sounds interesting... but we're not talking about the 1%. We're talking about the 1% of the 1% of the 1%. Let's talk about them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We've been screwing over humanity for not just our whole life, and not just our immediate families life, but for GENERATIONS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Have we? Aside from the harm inflicted upon humanity because of the control mechanism of religion that we work to keep in place, and the 99% seems to love them some of that shit, what harm have we done?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We know what happens to the blue bloods when the plebs revolt. We know what happened in every "revolution".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How many "blue bloods" were harmed during the American Revolution?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have to pay for security everywhere we go.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which costs peanuts compared to net worth and ongoing income.  To you and me, that's a bottle of water on a cross-country trip.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We're at the top, so of course everyone below us is fighting to take what we have. Lawsuits. Governments. Taxes. Charities. Family. Friends. Every single person in your life just wants wants wants what you have.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Lawsuits = taxes = governments, which TPTB control. When was the last time Rothschilds were successfully sued? The taxes of the 1% are the lowest they've ever been and a far lower percentage than on the 99%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charities don't take. They're given to. The big ones that TPTB give to are also controlled by... wait for it... TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Family, unless they've raised a homicidal maniac, they don't have much to worry about family-wise. Family already has access to the money. Friends, they keep a close circle of people as wealthy as they.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again... you're imagining shit from the perspective of a frigtened, battered child. That's not where TPTB sits or what they see.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So how to you secure what you have?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's already secure. It's not going anywhere. I already control the governments and thereby the military might of the world. I control politics. I control public perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all actuality, I already have totalitarian control. The reason it works is, you don't realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, if it felt like jack-booted thugs roaming the streets and shooting idiots more or less at random, you would rebel. You would fight. All that fighting would destroy the economy, which is something that actually could impact my position and stature if it kept up long enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want you to rebel, so I can't put physical tyranny in place over you. I want you placated. I want you to think you're happy. So I'm going to let you have a little bit, because it takes very little in terms of material things for people to be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to give you the illusion of self-governance. You can vote. It's not even rigged - whomever you vote for, that's who wins and who holds office. That is, of course, because I control all the candidates so it doesn't matter who you vote for. Sure, there are little differences - stupid social stuff like abortion or the % of social security tax that don't impact me in the least - but that through controlling your perception and natural divisiveness, I can make feel like big issues to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to give you a little pile of money to trade around amongst yourselves. Divvy it up however you want, those pennies mean nothing to me. Although because you really can't help yourself - because you MUST have that newest iPhone or whatever, it's still going to make its way into my hands because I hold a stake in the big companies that produce the trinkets I tell you to crave as well as the companies that finance your purchases because you lack the financial fortitude to save and must borrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also going to give you things to fight amongst yourselves over. Yesterday it was a genocidal maniac trying to lead a people you oppressed too stringently after a war. Today it's homicidal maniacs who'll do anything in the name of their god, just for a chance to bang a dozen mythical virgins in a mythical afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, yes, all that religion? That's the best control mechanism I have over you. Not only does it prevent you from killing me and taking all my stuff, but it also helps those petty politicians, pawns of mine, divide you and control you. Kill the other guy, he worships the wrong god. Vote for me, I worship the right one! This religion shit works so well at keeping the masses both divided and in control that it will also cause parents to disown their own children!
      </p>
      <p>
       With the level of intellectual power I already posses over you, why the fuck would I ever need to physically place my boot on your throat? This is much more effective, much more entertaining, and carries much less risk of actual, physical revolt.

       Nuclear war is not realistic in this day and age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most countries economies are linked in ways most people don't know. Putin decided to ban food from countries that sanctioned Russia, and their food prices skyrocketed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if they decided to Nuke the largest economy in the world? The US?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia, and almost every other country would be pushed in an economic depression that would likely last a hundred years, if not more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's assuming that the US didn't manage to get their own nukes off.

       Maybe not a nuke order but how about mobilizing against unarmed citizens of the USA, Palestine, Europe, etc. What if they were just purging those who think for themselves from the chain of command?
