       Seriously, forget about TMZ, there might be a cartel super pissed off, now that they have no leverage anymore.  They weren't candid, Erin Andrews type shit, these were pics taken on purpose, then stolen or leaked.  Sorry celebs for your loss of privacy (what was left of it), but congrats on your newly found freedom.

       Ok you found the one positive aside from the nude pictures themselves but can we talk about how terrible this is? This could lead to legislation that is sold as online privacy protection but is really about control of the internet. I'm afraid we are seeing the final days of freedom and anonymity online.

       If Britain's monarchy and parliament are capable of widespread pedophilia and coverups...why doesn't it stand to reason that American politicians are subject to the same denial and debauchery? But we know they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       United States citizens, under law by the Federal Government, are considered
       <em>
        currency
       </em>
       in foreign nations. Does it not stand to reason that young celebrities might be used to make money from anonymous elite? It has been done throughout history, yet people deny that it could exist today? Where human slavery can occur in places like Africa, Italy, France, Brazil, Mexico, China, Britain, Russia, and even America?

       Obviously it was terrible, but what's done is done... agreed?  Now that no one can go back in time, can we think about the possibility that some of these people may have been coerced into doing something against their will based off of the threat of having these photos released?  Now that they have been leaked, the celebrities are free.
      </p>

       This was obviously a media distraction to bring people away from the Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Israel stories, which have recently dominated the news cycle.

       I'm an honest person. I've considered using the pictures ex-girlfriends have given me as blackmail against them. I haven't and never have. I could have gained quite a bit (mostly in the form of goods or money or sex) from doing it. If I was a less moral person with more money...it'd be an easy decision. Those people have never experienced sonder. They're in the beginning stages of psychopathy.

       In a perfect society there will be no need for locks, we don't live in a perfect society. Victim blaming would be pinning it on thevwomen taking or allowing the pics to be taken. The blame is over being overconfident on technology, companies, crappy security or douchy partners that leak those private pics.

       An actual safe isn't impervious, and nobody has suggested that as a reason to use one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polaroid photos locked in a physical safe are more secure than electronically stored photos, as it requires a person physically enters your premises to gain entry to the safe ( breaking and entering ) and then breaks your safe open ( property damage ) and then takes your photos ( theft ).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why security exists, to TRY to prevent people from doing things they aren't supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't want to risk your nude photos being distributed online? Don't upload them, plain and simple.

       There is no reasonable expectation of security for transferring data electronically, do I really have to explain it to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day, to intercept telegrams, they would literally install a device onto the transmission line, which is why they call it wire tapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was in like 1924.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and try to fool yourself into thinking that people have made encryption methods that can evade the all seeing eye of the USGOV, they haven't. The DoD receives billions in funding, and have been researching online security since 84.

       You can have your "reasonable expectation of safety", but don't come crying to us when somebody thwarts those safety features.
