       Yesterday there was a thread top on the front page of Reddit with an unrealistic amount of upvotes for something which is an incredibly boring topic for the Reddit Hive-Mind, it's obviously been falsely pushed to the top by our corporate friends, they've found a new use for their marketing budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        61 percent fall in female genital warts due to free HPV vaccine
       </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
       Some real posters could smell something wasn't right
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i7D9DKq.jpg">

       </a>
       they've clocked that this repetitive pro-vaccine whitewash is a bit odd.  There were also lots of shills posting the Party Line and 'I LOVE SCIENCE!' to drown out the real posters who were posting stories about the horrifying complications which they've witnessed post-vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, after having read hundreds of studies and case studies on this vaccine over a number of years, I came in to sum up with my own conclusion, but apparently my comments were 'inappropriate', apparently only one side of the story i.e. pro-vaccine, is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going forward the most important thing is that as many people in
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       as possible realize what's going on and that these posts are just paid-for Big Pharma commercials, not real information with real posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, here's my comment on the HPV vaccine which they decided was 'inappropriate'.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Right, so apparently these ruthless corporations are willing to destroy their own Cancer Industry for the good of humanity....hmmm...anyone actually believe that? Look into the lifelong autoimmune diseases being induced by this vaccine, they are highly profitable diseases leaving people dependent on expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. Sorry folks, that's the only way this makes sense, that's the only way this jigsaw fits together properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into why Japan has stopped their HPV program, read up on why Spain, France and India are all considering a ban on the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe the Reddit Hivemind Hype, look into these topics yourself and keep away from corporate controlled sites like the CDC and FDA, that why you'll stay clear of propaganda.

       The best way to know I'm in r/science is seeing the mass graveyards of deleted threads.

      <p>
       Their mods seem more trigger happy than almost any other major sub. Not quite sure why, as the mods clearly cannot have expertise in every field of science they choose to filter the discussion of.

       I think that it has to do with the mass delusion that science "in practice" is about facts and thus to question the validity of a perceived "fact" is basically heresy.

       Science need to reassure the masses, so it's presented as "100%true" with no grey area. Most folks don't question "scientific information", the same way you don't question the word of "God".

       Actually, there are no facts without science confirming a measurement. Don't confuse fact, hypothesis, theory, and thesis. I'm guessing you don't understand any of it.

       You're making a philosophical argument about what constitutes a fact as if your opinion on what constitutes a fact is, in fact, factual instead of dogmatic.  What scientific instrument did you use to measure what makes a fact a fact?

       Actually, we're talking about science, so I'm telling you that in the scientific method, there's a difference between fact, hypothesis, and theory. Whether or not those classifications are valid is the philosophical debate, and not arguing what the classifications currently are.

       We are definitely living in an age where the worship of God is being replaced with the worship of so called "experts in their field".  This is just another example of blind religious faith in the claims of men.  Lots of hypocrisy going around.

       Sure, nothing wrong with placing more validity in the opinion of an expert over a layman as long as it involves a healthy dose of caution and skepticism.  Humans lie, regardless of education or status.

       Yes, my own aunt is a follower of The Church of Big Pharma, it doesn't matter how much evidence you show her to prove what she believes wrong, she'll always do exactly what the doctor says, for her he is a high priest who can make no mistakes.

       Ahh but thats the kicker isn't it. To pay off the massive loans to make it through med school most HAVE to shill pharma products. I know every time i go to a doctor they have tons of "samples" of some new pharma drug that they are hawking, for free at first of course.

       What you do is you go online and find out for yourself the exact mechanism for your disease. Then you find out what works on it. Then you go to forums where people have tried the treatment plan you are considering. Dont let a doctor tell you what to do. Let several doctors and a community of patients guide you into making an informed decision.

       Well, Doctors recommend what they can do for you, and rarely little else.  There can be a huge grey area of if taking their advice is worth the risks/rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I casually mentioned I had occasional breathing troubles due to a deviated septum and he casually offered to break my face to fix it.  I said no thanks. I was just mentioning it while I was here to see my options, it really isn't disturbing my comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       He agreed with my decision!  He said for most it isn't worth the money and time except for in the most extreme cases; but he still offered me the procedure regardless.

       Modern day doctors are little more than pharmaceutical sales persons, that is how they are trained, they are controlled by the information they are fed.  The pharmaceuticals are corrupt, they want us sick, they give false information to the doctor to make us sick and keep us sick.

       Well what you don't understand is that religion is a belief in something. Science doesn't say there is some invisible being and than tries to prove it. It's the other way round. First you find evidence then you test it and finally you can prove something. To me it is logical I don't really know you are thinking.

       If you believe something to be true only based on the fact that it hasn't yet been falsified, that is just as much a belief as believing in god which is something that
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>

       I don't believe in anything 100% I gather what I learn and then I can come to some conclusions. By the way the difference between science and religion is that science needs proof where religion doesn't.

       Science doesn't need proof, it just needs to be not yet falsified, that counts as "proof".  Religion has its own proofs, I suggest you read Aquinas, he, using a logical method, "proved" the existence of a higher power, but since its not "material" in nature, only rational, the "science" minded reject it.  Science is just Marxian dialectical materialism.

       Falsify me the existence of a walking plastic bottle? Don't you see what's wrong with your reasoning? To me you seem like indoctrinated religious sociopath. Don't act like you got all figured out because no one does, not science not religion.

       SCIENCE is a technique.  Its not a thing.  Science is a method of falsification, there is no "proof" required.  You have 5 senses that can determine what is there and what isn't, but that isn't SCIENCE, you fucking dolt.  I am not even religious, I just have common fucking sense.

       I do know that Polio was pretty bad before the vaccine was created and today, we rarely see people with Polio.

       Taking the stance that

       vaccines are bad is a dangerous proposition and sets you up for failure.

       I used to believe that most vaccines were good, however after spending a long time on this, going into great detail on every vaccines, I've found clear evidence that vaccines are simply shots in the dark, the evidence to back them up does not exist, and Big Pharma have no interest in cleaning them up as by causing an epidemic of autoimmune disease it sends their sales sky-rocketing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polio used to be harmless in the majority, with mild flu like symptoms in less than 5%.  Then some women stopped breast-feeding and modern medicine decided to remove part of the immune system which protects against Polio i.e. tonsils, this is when a very small % of people started to have problems with Polio.  The vaccine was produced, it didn't reduce the rate of Polio, so they started renaming Polio into a number of other diseases to cover up it's existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been admitted by the former head of Merck that some Polio vaccines have been contaminated with HIV and the Cancer-causing SV40 virus, so these have been doing a lot more harm than good.  Then we have the Live Polio vaccines which Bill Gates has been sending over to India, where researchers have been appalled by the fact that the vaccines are causing a disease twice as deadly as Polio and with exactly the same symptoms, but Big Pharma give that one a different name to make it look like their vaccine is a 'success'.

      <p>
       Please, PLEASE, just shutup, before you herd more mongoloids like you along.

       Mistoir didn't provide proof that they were all jokes being deleted.  I know from experience what gets deleted there as I've spent a lot of time over the years posting studies there which get deleted, keep in mind that in my OP I mentioned that the mods banned me for 'inappropriate comments' which were not jokes.

       are the top deleted comments. It may be less fun but you're more then welcome to just ask. The point isn't censorship its to keep the conservation from spiralling away from the science. For example I can't even remember what the original post was about but we had one thread a few months back that turned into nothing but x-men talk.

       A lot of the time it has to do with where the comment is. If the top or best comment for the entire post is like that things can spiral away from the science. If those comments are made further down they are more likely to be left.

       Well it is easy to delete wild speculation. I mean a post about quantum teleportation will have hundreds of replies containing everything from time travel to warp drive. They are usually are all deleted because they derail the discussion.

       Because the top comment could end up as "I can't wait till warp drive" instead of "as illustrated using  Feynman diagrams this particular event is impossible as far as all of science currently knows.  This post is from a science blog / advertising firm instead of a journal and should not be taken seriously."  This could go for anything where someone or corporation could financially benefit. Be it  medicine (HPV vaccines, anyone?) or technology (IBM just made a 7nm transistor, Intel is on shaky ground...) or anything else that hits gold in r/science. Wild speculation can allow a foothold for other non-science and nefarious intents. At best misinformation is spread, at worst we provide a blog with tons of traffic and ad revenue prompting them to continue with crazy posts, and at the very worst people read a snippet about medications or healthcare and take it to heart without ever seeing the dissenting opinions.

       This is really what all the science subreddits are about.  Citing already published materials.  there is no actual discussion of theories or furthering of knowledge.  the scientific method is non-existent there.

       The internet isn't the place to brainstorm new theory with the masses. Many of whom probably think they understand a theory, but have no idea and then proceed to get mad when you try and teach them the actual theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss theory, go to an academic forum or talk with professors and students.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to pick your battles wisely. Trying to talk about a non-tangible with people is difficult. On the internet, you need facts to back up what you say. Otherwise... nobody would know if you are a Phd in Physics explaining quark gluon interactions or just some guy who read an article somewhere and kind of remembers it.

       Human papilloma virus vaccine and primary ovarian failure: another facet of the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.

       Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?

      </p>
      <p>
       "We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles."

       Thanks for some great info/sources. I've been a little skeptical of this new HPV vaccine ever since
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gardasil-researcher-speaks-out/">
        that one research who spoke out.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The first study seems to be of only 3 women, but is still pretty interesting. The second really pounces on the effectiveness and safety testing the vaccine was put through, criticizing procedures and accusing it of selective sampling. That's a pretty big deal.

       Could you do that, maybe, post a study or two and enlighten me on this harmful ineffective HPV vaccine?

       "We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles."

       Reddit is just insanely hardcore pro vaccine. They are basically giving each other sticky high fives as how amazing science is at curing all these diseases, meanwhile the US has one of the worst infant mortality rates out of all the developed countries, one of the worst autism rates .. etc

       True, if we could take away all the shills Reddit would still be pro-vaccine, but discussion of the dangers would be allowed rather than censored, and people examining evidence of conflicts of interest and sinister agendas wouldn't be smeared.

       Everyone is aware of the dangers. People know of fevers and the effects fevers can have sometimes. Which can yes be pretty bad but they are rare and don't outweigh the benefits of practically eliminating a whole freakin disease. No one censors anyone talking about the small negatives of vaccines.

       I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed."

       "No vaccine is safe". Really? Polio has been eradicated. My kids will never have measles or chicken pox. 
I won't be giving my vaccinated daughters Gardisal, and we skip the flu vaccine, but let's have some common sense.

       false.  "polio" was reclassified into numerous other diseases around the same time it was supposedly "eradicated" due to the polio vaccine. In reality, polio cases just became reclassified as we learned more and more about subtle variations in diseases. 
What happened was that increased awareness of sanitation combined with a "reclassification" of what was known as polio led to the "eradication" of the disease. Right around the same time that the vaccine was introduced in the 50's, polio was finally reclassified as numerous diseases since we were starting to understand more about the subtle variations between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Polio" until that point had referred to a whole group of ailments...and shortly after the vaccine was introduced, cases that previously had been labeled as "polio" now were identified correctly. This led to a sharp drop in reported polio cases, when what was happening was that there were just as many "polio-like" cases that they just weren't calling polio anymore.

       Researchers reported:
      </p>
      <p>
       "while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated."

       It is because they use a live oral vaccine (OPV) in India.  OPV has been banned in most first world Nations because it was found to have some pretty severe side effects, NPAFP being one of the major ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmaceutical corporations are notorious for pawning off their dangerous, dated "cures" on third world nations, including Bayer knowingly selling HIV infected hemophilia medicine, and older MMR vaccines (banned in Europe for causing very dangerous fevers often resulting in brain damage and.. surprise.. ASD diagnoses) sold cheap to poorer nations.

       Well, for what it's worth, I was harangued by some vocal members of this sub because they didn't understand how salts/cations/anions work. Some people don't know the first thing about chemistry, yet spew uninformed opinion about basic things like how salts dissolve in a solvent. So there is both ends of the spectrum represented, though I never face a ban in this sub because of it.

       I'll agree with you that a lot of r/conspiracy users do the same thing and ignore evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does a user no good when they have made up their minds on a topic and is presenting it as an absolute when the evidence isn't conclusive either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I caution r/conspiracy users from doing the same thing as you'll look like an idiot if you're proven wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's best to keep an open mind and review
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       evidence and if the evidence is still inconclusive, don't try to make your views as an absolute.

       What's with the whole "I love science" proclamation I see all over the web?  Its like saying "I love the process of....."
Science isn't a thing, its just a process of gathering and sorting information.  In the end if a bunch of authority figures in a particular discipline collude to pass off false conclusions as fact, its not science anymore.  Scientists have families and debt, one would be a fool to think they won't lie to keep their paychecks coming.

       there is an issue with the definition of "scientific"
      </p>
      <p>
       evidently Dr Wakefield's original work was "scientific" enough to be published in a journal.
      </p>
      <p>
       that was later decided to be a fraud
      </p>
      <p>
       then the CDC published its own "scientific" research debunking any link between vaccines and autism, but the CDCwhistleblower just told us that the research was a fraud. #CDCfraud

       Here's the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) report for the HPV vaccine in 2012 , this is estimated to pick up less than 5% of vaccine damage as it's completely voluntary and vaccine damage isn't normally traced back to the vaccine as symptoms occur months/years after vaccination.

       Vaccine damage? How could they cause damage? You do that vaccines are just deactivated viral proteins. Your immune system simply sees these and makes antibodies for it. If what you say is true the same thing happens every time you are exposed to any virus. WHICH HAPPENS DAILY. What you are saying is completely illogical.

       Look into what an adjuvant does, in order for a vaccine to have a chance of working it also has to be dangerous i.e. to increase the chance of a desired immune response one must also increase the risk of an undesirable immune response which leaves the you with an autoimmune disease (the body fighting itself) e.g. Diabetes Type 1, MS etc.

       What the hell? This is even more evidence that you have zero idea what you are talking about. It in no way has to be dangerous. The body will mount an immune response to foreign proteins it encounters and then it remembers those proteins so in the future it knows how to fight them. This is basic biology. There is nothing special about the immune response against vaccines that would cause an autoimmune response of any sort. The flu or even a common cold can cause a much more heavy response than a vaccine does. It's ridiculous to claim any real danger of developing an autoimmune disease from a vaccine.

       Different people have different immune systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a percentage of people who get a flu vaccine and
       <strong>
        get
       </strong>
       the flu while others don't.
Getting the flu is one thing but getting Autism is a life long struggle.  I don't know if vaccines cause Autism or not but I'm keeping an open mind about the cases and evidence that I see where it is linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i do feel that the vaccine schedule is pretty harsh.  They give children in this country 49 doses of 14 vaccines before age 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the ripe old age of 2 months, a baby is given vaccines for:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rotavirus
Hepatitis B,
PCV,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If this doesn't alarm an adult or parent, then please go get these vaccines injected into yourself in one sitting because it's safe, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       But as an adult, why stop there?  The same adults should go back and get vaccinated at 4 months with these vaccines:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rota,virus
PCV,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And again, why stop there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back at 6 months and get these vaccines in one sitting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
Rotavirus,
Hepatitis B
PCV,
Influenza,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And no need to worry because
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       vaccines are safe, correct?

       Of course people get vaccines and still get the disease. People's immune systems aren't perfect and no one is expecting them to be. The facts are there is no linkage between vaccines and autism. There isn't even a hypothetical mechanism that could lead to vaccines causing autism. Harsh? Try the millions of pathogens children are exposed to everyday.

       No, I actually made up what I just said because you made a statement without providing any links.  Also, I found it odd that you replied to a post that was a month old and in addition to that, your user history shows that you have a 7 year old account in which you sporadically use.

      <p>
       <strong>
        BUT,

       if you click on that CNN link in my first post, you'll find this statement:

       UPDATE, September 6: It has been found that “Translational Neurodegeneration” broken their own rules when they pulled Dr. Hookers research paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       That link you provided is the one that has been found to have broken it's own rules when they pulled Dr. Hookers papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll go on to say that I've seen videos of actual families (plural, which means more than one family) that say that their once healthy child got some kind of brain damage as a result of being vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       GlaxoSmithKline has just been fined in China for bribery of officials and I found this statement in an article:
      </p>
      <p>
       UK-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is said to have purposely suppressed clinical studies and intimidated researchers who discovered that its pioneering diabetes drug, Avandia, significantly increased the risk of heart attacks.
       <a href="http://rt.com/news/drugs-fines-corporations-crime-671/">
        Link
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't find it beyond Pharma to have intimidated or bought someone off to get Dr. Hooker's article pulled, especially since it's been found that they went and broke their own rules in getting an article pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       When hundreds of millions of dollars are involved, the people's interest aren't what big corporations have in mind.  Profit is and it's been shown what lengths these Pharmas will do to get their product to market.

       I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed."

        Secret report reveals 18 child deaths following vaccinations
       </strong>

       "Eighteen babies and toddlers have died following childhood vaccinations in just four years, a secret Government report reveals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four deaths have been linked to suspected adverse reactions to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) triple jab, according to documents prepared for the Government's expert advisers on immunisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The controversial jab has been beset by fears of a link to autism and bowel disease, although since its introduction in 1998, yearly deaths from measles have fallen from 16 to zero, while the jab against meningitis C is thought to save 50 lives a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The report, covering the period between 2001 and 2004, details how one baby suffered a cot death following MMR vaccination in 2003. Two more infants were reported to have died after having the MMR jab in 2001, but the cause of death in both cases was unknown."
      </p>
      <p>
       When Japan stopped vaccinating the under-2's Crib Death completely disappeared in the country and Japan jumped right up to number 1 in the ranking for infant mortality rates i.e. they had the best infant mortality rate in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA gives the most vaccines per child (by a long way), they also have the worst infant mortality rate in the developing world.

       Even if there was a link between autism and vaccines and all the anti-vaccinators were right... It is still more then worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ever so small chance of developing something from it is worth the 99% protection from many of the diseases prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about anyone else... But seeing the effect of polio(which has effectively been wiped off the planet) ... I would choose the risk autism over that any day.

       Those diseases have much higher correlations with genetics, location and lifestyle then any Vaccine out there.

       How many lives were saved and spared the ravages of polio because of the vaccine?  It has been wiped out from many parts of the world thanks to Vaccine.  Small pox, same thing.  Ask people from 60-70 years ago if any are still alive and ask them if they would still vaccinate their children to protect them from Polio if it ment there was a very slight chance(and that is giving a lot based on the statistics) they could develope some other life long condition.  Death by Polio or a lifetime of dealing with Multiple Sclerosis?

       Are you serious? Autoimmune disorders caused by a vaccine? That's absolute bull shit. You are just making all these false accusations with no proof. There is no way a few viral proteins are going to cause autoimmune disorders. The immune system deals with viral proteins daily. There is no reason not to support this vaccine, the numbers make it obvious enough. Big pharma isn't some evil mastermind hoping to get everyone sick. That's just some twisted dark fantasy. This type of talk is just anti science bull shit.

       Cool there results really aren't that shocking but that has nothing at all to do with vaccines. In no way is a vaccine a continual large dosage of antigens. You really are just grasping at straws here. This is like hearing that 10 gallons of vodka will kill someone so you conclude one sip of beer must be deadly too. The logic doesn't follow and is just an insane extrapolation.

        The Japanese government withdrew its recommendation to use human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in girls last week, citing concerns from the public about adverse effects, according to news reports
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision does not mean that the vaccine itself is problematic from the viewpoint of safety
       </p>
       <p>
        According to a report in the Japan Times, 8.29 million people had received the HPV vaccine as of December 2012, and there were 1968 cases of concerning adverse events reported as of March 2013. Of these adverse events, 106 were described as "serious cases of pains or body convulsions, pains in joints, or difficulty in walking."

       I always get annoyed when the science ignorant public gets up in arms about vaccines, gene modification, studies, etc without complaining correctly.

      <p>
       Yes these adverse effects are terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       No they are not common.

      <p>
       Yes there should be more factors understood before administering a vaccine.

       These issues are common, no-one is actually going out in the field tracking these problems, the ones that are identified and linked to the vaccine will be less than 1% of the total, especially as autoimmune diseases like MS take at least 2 months to appear after vaccination, so it's unlikely anyone will make the link.

       That is a might big leap saying something like a vaccine causes MS. . Since we still don't know what even causes MS in any way.  MS is suspected to be an autoimmune disease... It's not confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also MS is not diagnosed with 2 months...it can take years to confirm a diagnosis.  After diagnosis you can look back years and see the symptoms and finally put the prices together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if MS was caused by vaccines it is a small price to not have to worry about so many other lethal diseases

       Vaccine-induced diseases such as MS, Diabetes Type 1, Motor Neurone Disease etc are lifelong, whereas Measles, Mumps, Chicken Pox etc are all mild short-term illnesses, there is no comparison.  The only people who want us to have the lifelong option are those who make money from selling us drugs.

       And where are the studies about how Vaccines cause these diseases?  Diabetes is more strongly correlated with Genetics and Lifestyle then any Vaccine.  No one knows the cause of MS yet so saying it is linked to Vaccines is perposterous, it has stronger correlations to genetics and location(Being further away from the equator increases the risk, usually meaning being in more northern climates and being caucasian).

       Let's use the Hib Vaccine and Diabetes Type 1 as an example
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have a study which shows that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008382">

      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a study noting that Finland has a much higher rate of Diabetes Type 1 than bordering Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15902849">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15902849
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a map of vaccine rates around the world, you'll see that Russia gives very few Hib vaccines, whereas Finland vaccinates at a high rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24519949">
        http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24519949
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll notice the the Finland vaccinates with Hib at 5.5 times the rate of Russia, and that Finland also has 5.5 times the rate of Diabetes Type 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this correlation also a causation? This study finds that in every country when the Hib vaccine was introduced the Diabetes Type 1 rate increased right after, they also conclude that the vaccine is doing more harm than good.

       That Finnish/Russian study does not even mention Vaccines.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This suggests that environmental factors contribute to this steep difference in the incidence rate between these adjacent regions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you are claiming that the evironmental factor is Vaccine...you are jumping to conclusions where are not there and ignoring everything else that can lead to diabetes that is different bewteen the 2 countries.  Like how the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage">
        Average Finnish have over triple the monthly income of the average Russian
       </a>
       therefore can spend more on things that lead to diabetes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next with the map...you ingore the fact that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hib has been virtually eliminated in developed countries
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If anything these maps show that Vaccines work.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is this correlation also a causation?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       FUCK NO!  That is now how correlation works at all.  We can easily blame the higher income for the higher instances of diabetes in Finland vs Russia...number back that up too...especially when you pull in other countries with higher incomes and Diabetes rates.  There is a correllation there too.  Looking at that Hib Map...is Russia and the poorest of countries do not have high levels of Vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correlation between genetics and lifestyle have a much high signifigance then any vaccine.

       The Finnish/Russia study is there to highlight the huge difference in the rates of Diabetes Type 1 on either side of the border.  They conclude it's an environmental issue rather than genetic.

      <p>
       I then show you that the Hib vaccine's been linked to Diabetes Type 1 already, and show you the map which highlights that Russia isn't vaccinating much with Hib, Finland vaccinates at 5.5 times the rate with Hib and has 5.5 times the rate of Diabetes Type 1.

       We've got all the information we need there, this would have to be a one huge coincidence for the Hib vaccine not to be causing Diabetes Type e.g. a 1 in 10,000 coincidence.

       One picture...it displays a snap shot of information.  While yes diabetes is higher in the country with high vaccination rates...it does not mean they are linked.  Correlation is not causation.  I can show a link bewteen caucasians and sunburns when they travel to a tropical location...that does not mean being caucasian causes sun burns.

       What information?  A correlation with no proof as to what is causing it.  There are so many factors you ignore since they do not fit in with your theory.  Where is the proof that his vaccine causes Diabetes?  I can just as accurately say it is the higher income that causes diabetes if I were to use your methodology.

       So the family doctor is going to work out that the Diabetes Type 1, MS, Autism, Asthma etc is from the recent vaccination?  They haven't been trained to look for this damage, the smarter more experienced ones do know this.  Nobody said anything about cutting ties, this is about not realizing these highly profitable diseases are being caused by the vaccines.  The doctors do what you train them to do, train them to recognize vaccine damage and they will recognize it.

       And yes they are trained to link diseases with recent changes in the life of the patient. And believe it or not, not every disease is caused by a vaccine. There are genetic predispositions to these diseases too.

       You will not get through to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he is right...let's say there is a correlation between Vaccines and some of the disease he is claiming are caused by it..IT IS WORTH THE RISK!
      </p>
      <p>
       Near 100% protection from polio, small pox, and other diseased where we can be vaccinated against is well worth the small risk of developing Autism or MS or Diabetes.  Risking a high chance of death vs a small chance of a lifelong condition...I will take MS please.  Though him claiming Vaccines cause MS is just insane being that we do have not even discovered what causes MS yet.  And I for one would give almost anything to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And claims Vaccines cause Diabetes...Sorry but the statistics just can not support such a claim.  We would expect it to be much more common in children...but it does not even break 1% of the population until the 20-25 age category.  and 20% for seniors...claiming a vaccine causes Diabetes when you are senior...completely ignoring everything else is just bad research.  If it were caused by a Vaccine in some small way we would see a more equal distribution accross various countries if it were caused by vaccines...but we do not see that at all.

       You obviously didn't read any further as I stated, them taking the oath isn't why I draw attention to it. The idea of medicine is to help others as much as possible.

       Some points:
      </p>
      <p>
       My last comment was about your bad logic and reasoning, not about doctors.  That you cannot see this and let it go is troubling, as your future job will require better reasoning skills than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My initial point was in support of many doctors, noting that some of the new up and comers are completely full of themselves.  Since you've admitted that you're in the process, you seem to be unintentionally supporting that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were so into healing you'd not be so determined to be an asshat.  Check yourself, 'doc.'

       Because its only words. I've been through the grill with my father and his car accident. After 12 operations, a leg amputation, and cancer, the only thing that saved him was clear thinking, a little bit of miracle, and some money. Their oath can go hang.

       Dickhead.
He's a cripple now because when he had 2 legs an idiot fixed the rods that were supposed ho hold his bones together wrong. Because he wasn't expected to live and was promptly to be shipped away to use for organs. He almost died in the hospital from sepsis because they haven't changed the bandages on his wounds. The cancer he got was from a myriad of screenings that they made because they didn't want to operate further without money. The amputation was because of a failed biopsy. What saved him was nothing related to the doctors, he was sent home to die.

       No really, what would have happened if doctors didn't try to help? Why would you keep going back if they were trying to cause harm? You're offended, that's good because hopefully you'll try to consider your opinion and why you hold it so dear when it's presented against an opposing view.

       You mean if they weren't doing their job? They'd be fired for starters.
Had they been true to their "oath" they would have also done rest of the work properly, when no more accountability or money was involved, avoiding the cancer from radiation and amputation from poorly done biopsy. And more private operations we paid out of the settlement money. Its only money, the world is a BUSINESS.

       Sounds like you have more of a problem with the American medical System and Health Insurance.  And issued with a few doctors who were acting in what they believed were the patients best interests.

       Are you getting paid for this, or have you no life? Yeah its anecdotal, I'm not trying to prove anything, god forbid. I'm writing about my experiences about the medical system which is deeply flawed IMO. If you don't like what I'm saying you can go circlejerk with your friends from wherever it is you came from.

       Your one experience with the medical system is a far cry from what it is actually like for millions of others everyday.  You Believe the system is deeply flawed...you are welcome to your opinion...but don't try to pass it off as a flaw with the system in general.

       Its 5 years of experience doing the grind. Take of it what you will, you're also welcome to your own delusions. It is what it is, but it isnt based on ethics and morals, and sure as hell not the Hypocrites oath. Its a buisiness and if you have money you're worth to them, if you don't, well just look at the millions of Americans without health insurance. The world is a business, have you just crawled out from a rock somewhere?

       Oh boo hoo...5 years experiencing the medical system in your small world.

       So you had a bad experience and think the rest of the system is exactly the same.  You have your own little conspiracy theory that makes the system fit in with your personal belief.

       The American system is flawed, no arguement there.  But to blame the entire system and all the doctors for your one personal experience...is utter nonsense.

       That is what you believe.  You can go out and find most doctors all over the world and yes even in the US take that oath very seriously.

       So you got a Medical Doctorate and administered the treatment yourself?  Or did you get polictical and get elected to change the system?  Did you pray for him to be healed and recieve a miracle from God?

      <p>
       Sorry I did not clarify...if you don't like the system...do something to change it.  If it is really that bad and you don't to anything to change it you are just as bad the people making the system the way it is with your silent compliance.

       Bravo. I've been posting real vaccine research/facts for years on this site and am happy to see another pariah joining the ranks. I'm despised in r/parenting too. You ought to go over there and introduce some of this info. The mods aren't quite as draconian as in r/science, and there are a couple of parents who know the game and will chime in.

       Because science.  Obviously.  And how dare you question science and the scientists who work so hard on science.  Are you a scientist?  No?  Then how dare you question scientific science - leave that to the experts.  And take this vaccine while you're at it.  And this one.  And this one.

       Do you mean Hep B?  It's because nobody wanted the vaccine, so they go for people who can't choose.  It's also an ideal time to cause some damage to the child's health without anyone realizing that the child would have been healthy, meaning pharma can make more money out of them than if they stayed healthy.

       Figured out as much. I was curious how they pass it through, what was the explanation, is there any? Is there even evidence the vaccine will last till puberty when you're supposed to have intercourse? It makes much more sense to vaccinate then, when the immune system is properly developed.

       If someone really wanted the Hep B vaccine, yes it's almost pointless getting it at birth unless your Mum is an IV Drug Abuser or a Prostitute.  The majority of vaccines (when they work) last for no more than 10 years.  If someone strongly wants a vaccine it's best to hold it off as long as possible, ideally until after age 5.

       So if one were prone to conspiracy theory, one could say that they were administering them to newborns to weaken the immune system, and pave the way for all sorts of immune diseases to come, because profit.

       Talk about making shit up, my hep B and mmr titers were tested in my late 20s and still were quite positive, as they were for many of my colleagues... And trust me this was because we work with potentially infected blood so anyone who is even borderline gets a booster... So we don't mess around with immunity status. All of us were still immune, consistent with published literature. There is some thought the pertussis wanes eventually and needs a booster, but it does cover the kids past the point were they will die from it and boosters are readily available. You clearly have not encountered people from countries were vaccination programs are weaker and have rampant endemic hep b or have measles outbreaks.

        The Japanese government withdrew its recommendation to use human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in girls last week, citing concerns from the public about adverse effects, according to news reports

        The decision does not mean that the vaccine itself is problematic from the viewpoint of safety
       </p>

        According to a report in the Japan Times, 8.29 million people had received the HPV vaccine as of December 2012, and there were 1968 cases of concerning adverse events reported as of March 2013. Of these adverse events, 106 were described as "serious cases of pains or body convulsions, pains in joints, or difficulty in walking."

       It's not a matter of who to believe, it's just the statistics behind it... if there was a shot that you could get which was proven to prevent heart disease completely, but had a 5% instant lethality, I'd line up for that and sign the waiver: Chances aren't very good that it would kill me (1 in 20) but there's a much better chance that it could stop what would kill me down the road.

       In the US, the ACS estimates that 12360 people will be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 4020 people will die from it this year. (
       <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervicalcancer/detailedguide/cervical-cancer-key-statistics">
        http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervicalcancer/detailedguide/cervical-cancer-key-statistics
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the Japanese statistics, for instance, 8.29 million people go the HPV vaccine, 106 people got serious adverse effects. Isn't that a .00128% adverse effect rate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay with that rate, but then I've already had the vaccine. I agree that people should be educated first about anything that gets stuck in their bodies, though. Then again, I also think that people should have complete control over what gets put into their body and what stays (pro-choice and affirmative consent), and that's not a terribly popular bunch of opinions at times.

       So that 0.00128% is just 1% of the reality.   So what a 0.128% chance of an adverse effect.  They sell medications what have a higher % of side effects that can be dangerous, a 1/10 of a percent chance that you might develope something...well worth the risk.

       Looking around at the very few people who have those conditions is in NO WAY proof vaccines caused anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those show much stronger correlations to genetics.  The Link to Autism is non-existant.  Where is the proof?  To say all those are caused by Vaccines is utter nonsense.  Thankfully you removed MS from that...since in your previous posts you mentioned it...and saying it is caused by vaccines when we don't even know the cause...is just ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can prove these are all linked...then please publish your work and claim your Nobel Prize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you listed can have and does have other causes which are much more strongly correlated then any Vaccine.  Even if they did have a chance of causing those...whatever your small correlation is...weigh it against the much higher risk of death by those which are being vaccinated against...it's worth the risk!
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no proof.  It has been studied again and again by people all around the world...the proof just isn't there.

       Why can you not take an opposing view as that (even though it's scientifically backed) without calling it propoganda. You realize that diseases could appear with or without vaccines? And it is a choice to get a vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a doctor says there is an 80% success rate that doesn't mean it will work 80% of the way, that means 1/5 will not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same way with vaccines (which haven't been proven to cause diseases you claim). If you believe that there is a 0.0237% chance of adverse effects, then you don't have to take that tiny risk.

       Without vaccines there would be less than 25% of the diseases we see today, and no people wouldn't have died from mild childhood illnesses like Chicken Pox and Mumps, they'd instead of stronger immune systems as they would be using them more.

       The ones who die from Chicken Pox have been wrongly given Ibuprofen or Aspirin, they could also be Leukemic.  Chicken Pox is perfectly fine in a healthy child and if it's left to run it's natural course.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're perfectly healthy and well-nourished you won't have any problems with Mumps either, also remember the Merck scientists have blown the whistle that they faked the Mumps vaccine efficacy tests, the vaccine didn't actually work well, so they added animal antibodies to fake the tests.  That vaccine would never have made it to market.  Instead of risking the fake vaccine just catch Mumps naturally when you're young and you'll be fine.

       Yeah and small pox wasn't that bad either. Just stop with your anti science bull shit. You have no idea what you are talking about and show that you don't have a grasp on basic science and immunology, like high school level stuff. You cite stupid websites whose evidence is "oh I'm a mom so I know this is what happened." What you say is obvious hot air to anyone who is in the field of biology. I've seen you post before and it always show extreme ignorance of science. Vaccines are a proven science that relies on well known mechanisms of the immune system that have evolved and we have carefully taken advantage of them. You are ruining lives, I hope you never convince anyone to not vaccinate their kids as that would be an incredible disservice to the world. It's truly awful to see people that want us to return to the stone ages.

       This is absolutely ridiculous. You deny one of the greatest medical achievements of humanity. I don't even know what to say. Your ignorance is astounding. The vaccine didn't even have small pox in it so there is no way it could increase your chance of developing small pox. This shows just how confused you are.

       You clearly haven't taken the time to read anything about how vaccines work. I was going to take this analogy apart bit-by-bit but, since you clearly don't read anything that doesn't agree with your opinion, why bother.

       That can be said about all diseases.  We see a decrease is all disease when santitaion and nutrition are improved.  Measles are almost unheard of in the general population today, the only people who get it are those that are unvaccinated.  A recent Measels out break in Canada was caused by an Unvaccinated child returning from the Netherlands in their "Bible Belt" where many protestants are anti-vaccine.  The child brought it back and infected other non-immunized children.  The disease spread quickly amoung pockets of population where there were large amount of unimmunized people.  Vaccines are the leading cause of why something like Measles is so rare now in Canada/US.

       Those who are against vaccines are generally well informed, that's why they are against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that Merck whistleblower Dr. Dalbergue has predicted that the HPV vaccine will be the biggest medical scandal of all time.

       Here's a quote from him
      </p>
      <p>
       "I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is far too much financial interest for these medicines to be withdrawn."

       It is currently linked to cervical cancer, why wouldn't people want to stop that. Hpv also causes warts that this vaccine inhibits, many people would prefer that.

       The immune system deals with HPV on it's own, it's also been shown that if you already have HPV when you receive the vaccine it increase your risk of Cancer.

        Human papilloma virus vaccine and primary ovarian failure: another facet of the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.

       "We documented here the evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry."

        Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?

       "We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        METHOD OF STUDY: The medical history of three young women who presented with secondary amenorrhea following HPV vaccination was collected. Data regarding type of vaccine, number of vaccination, personal, clinical and serological features, as well as response to treatments were analyzed.

       Then instead of putting a lot of your hopes on this one small case which can't even register as being statistically signifigant...how about go out and do a real research study on the subject?  Go to school get your degree and PHD and do a real study.

       You live in a City you risk cancer.  You go outside you risk Cancer.  You eat processed foods you risk Cancer.  You live on the west coast of North America you are at a higher risk of Cancer(Thanks Japan).  If you lived in the Northern Hemisphere during the late 80s and early 90's you are at a higher risk of Cancer...Chernobyl disaster.  There are strong correlations to increases in birth defects and cancer.  A nuclear power plant going into melt down almost 30 years ago is a higher risk for some one developing cancer then any Vaccine out there.

       remember the "crazy woman" jenny mcarthy saying vaccines causes autism and shit tone of other crap?. I think whats actually going on, at least with kids vaccines, is that vaccines as themselves are not the problem but what they put in additionally in vaccines. Vaccines are getting riddled with thimerosal (mercury), which is highly toxic, specially for a developing brain. They are using this as a vaccine preservative but it appears that the science is not right and they still dont have proper proof that thimerosal is safe. Maybe mcarthy  is not quite crazy after all. ( more info on the subject.

       ) Looking at how pharma companies operate i am not very surprised the hpv vaccine is getting a lot of heat now that a lot of people are getting bad secondary reactions or getting killed. Now when it comes to censoring on reddit, it looks quite worrying how easily they ban and delete posts that simply challenge the narrative or go against the grain but what can we do?  very worrying indeed.

       Actually a simple Google search will show that the Mercury in vaccines, ethylmercury, cannot pass the BBB. The mercury you get from fish, methylmercury, can pass through the BBB and actually is a neurotoxin. Also, one gets that methylmercury in a much higher dosage from a can of tuna than one gets ethylmercury from a vaccine. And that's the thing about toxins. They're dose - dependant.

       That may be the case with aluminum. I was however, refuting the original mercury claim. Methylmercury and ethylmercury are two very different things. The ethylmercury found in vaccines does not cross the brain blood barrier. But thanks for the video, interesting watch

       Mercury and Aluminum work move in the body in a similar fashion, as vinni says both do cross the BBB, so you definitely don't want either injected.

       Please do at least cursory wiki research before spouting off and citing some moronic Youtube. Thimerosal has been almost completely phased out of use. It is provably safe in the doses and organic form it is used in, but due to ignorant scaremongers they have phased out its use anyways.

       "almost completely phased out"?  a lot of the flu shots today have thimerosal still in them and internationaly it is still being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       i did do a "wiki" search before posting. toxicology part on the wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
       |Cases have been reported of severe poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.[16] Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury.[17] Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the blood–brain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.[18]|

       first off. fish may carry mercury but its Methylmercury. these vaccines carry ethylmercury which is bit different. second off, ingesting some of these types of mercury work differently than injecting them. third off, these so called "preservatives" are now useless since we just dont need them anymore. fourth off, there are hardly any studies out there other than the ones funded by pharma companies, that show these "preservatives" as safe. We dont need them, they are unnecessary in this day and age and thankfully they have been removed from some vaccines since 1999 but they are still out there, specially internationally.

       Yes and they are mostly similar. And a one time injection versus a lifetime of consumption makes the one time injection a joke. Sure they are removing them because they can just to shut up all the ignorant people, a lot of things are forced to adapt to the ignorance of society no big deal in this case though.

       Flu shots are recommended, and once again even if you are getting those, which is isn't really necessary especially if you aren't in a vulnerable group, the amount you get from the environment trumps the injection. You just create some boogie man and name it big pharma, how cute. There is nothing but real science involved and pretty basic science at that.

       Figured out as much. I was curious how they pass it through, what was the explanation, is there any? Is there even evidence the vaccine will last till puberty when you're supposed to have intercourse? It makes much more sense to vaccinate then, when the immune system is properly developed.

       Look into what an adjuvant does, in order for a vaccine to have a chance of working it also has to be dangerous i.e. to increase the chance of a desired immune response one must also increase the risk of an undesirable immune response which leaves the you with an autoimmune disease (the body fighting itself) e.g. Diabetes Type 1, MS etc.

       Different people have different immune systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a percentage of people who get a flu vaccine and
       <strong>
        get
       </strong>
       the flu while others don't.
Getting the flu is one thing but getting Autism is a life long struggle.  I don't know if vaccines cause Autism or not but I'm keeping an open mind about the cases and evidence that I see where it is linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i do feel that the vaccine schedule is pretty harsh.  They give children in this country 49 doses of 14 vaccines before age 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the ripe old age of 2 months, a baby is given vaccines for:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rotavirus
Hepatitis B,
PCV,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If this doesn't alarm an adult or parent, then please go get these vaccines injected into yourself in one sitting because it's safe, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       But as an adult, why stop there?  The same adults should go back and get vaccinated at 4 months with these vaccines:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rota,virus
PCV,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And again, why stop there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back at 6 months and get these vaccines in one sitting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
Rotavirus,
Hepatitis B
PCV,
Influenza,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And no need to worry because
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       vaccines are safe, correct?

       It is because they use a live oral vaccine (OPV) in India.  OPV has been banned in most first world Nations because it was found to have some pretty severe side effects, NPAFP being one of the major ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmaceutical corporations are notorious for pawning off their dangerous, dated "cures" on third world nations, including Bayer knowingly selling HIV infected hemophilia medicine, and older MMR vaccines (banned in Europe for causing very dangerous fevers often resulting in brain damage and.. surprise.. ASD diagnoses) sold cheap to poorer nations.

       Looking around at the very few people who have those conditions is in NO WAY proof vaccines caused anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those show much stronger correlations to genetics.  The Link to Autism is non-existant.  Where is the proof?  To say all those are caused by Vaccines is utter nonsense.  Thankfully you removed MS from that...since in your previous posts you mentioned it...and saying it is caused by vaccines when we don't even know the cause...is just ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can prove these are all linked...then please publish your work and claim your Nobel Prize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you listed can have and does have other causes which are much more strongly correlated then any Vaccine.  Even if they did have a chance of causing those...whatever your small correlation is...weigh it against the much higher risk of death by those which are being vaccinated against...it's worth the risk!
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no proof.  It has been studied again and again by people all around the world...the proof just isn't there.

        I then show you that the Hib vaccine's been linked to Diabetes Type 1 already, and show you the map which highlights that Russia isn't vaccinating much with Hib, Finland vaccinates at 5.5 times the rate with Hib and has 5.5 times the rate of Diabetes Type 1.

       One picture...it displays a snap shot of information.  While yes diabetes is higher in the country with high vaccination rates...it does not mean they are linked.  Correlation is not causation.  I can show a link bewteen caucasians and sunburns when they travel to a tropical location...that does not mean being caucasian causes sun burns.

        We've got all the information we need there, this would have to be a one huge coincidence for the Hib vaccine not to be causing Diabetes Type e.g. a 1 in 10,000 coincidence.

       What information?  A correlation with no proof as to what is causing it.  There are so many factors you ignore since they do not fit in with your theory.  Where is the proof that his vaccine causes Diabetes?  I can just as accurately say it is the higher income that causes diabetes if I were to use your methodology.

       Falsify me the existence of a walking plastic bottle? Don't you see what's wrong with your reasoning? To me you seem like indoctrinated religious sociopath. Don't act like you got all figured out because no one does, not science not religion. Good thing you are the dumb minority that has no voice in important matters because otherwise we would all be doomed.

       SCIENCE is a technique.  Its not a thing.  Science is a method of falsification, there is no "proof" required.  You have 5 senses that can determine what is there and what isn't, but that isn't SCIENCE, you fucking dolt.  I am not even religious, I just have common fucking sense.

       That I am trying to debate this...look in a mirror.

       You have a hodge podge of facts you are making fit your view, it's called Confirmation Bias.  You don't have the evidence to back up your claims.

       How about you produce some more evidence showing a link other then a weak correllation.
