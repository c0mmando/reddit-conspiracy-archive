       I was brought up to believe that the US was doing good. Yeah, sounds silly, but on retrospect the belief was supportable and falsifiable. I really became patriotic a few years ago when I discovered r/MURICA. It was and still is my favorite subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One Independence Day, I was introduced to alternative thinking. "The Road to WW3", "Syrian War: What You're not being told", videos like those. The producer of the videos, StormCloudsGathering, made his videos very clear, supported by evidence, and convincing. This brings me to my point
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the US. It's not out of loving the corrupt bloated government, or blindly following the media that has an agenda. It's a feeling of sheer patriotism. Sure, why should I be patriotic? George Carlin made a good case that patriotism is stupid. Well, I am because I am. I love my country and I only wish the best for her. I don't wish harm on anyone unless they deserve it. I'd fight for America's safety and sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But learning all this stuff about how the government keeps tampering with life's many faculties, like vaccines and medicine and water and spying and all that, it just makes me doubt myself. How can my country do this? Why are they doing this? I want to learn more but the more I learn the more I see that the US isn't doing what she was based on; just the will of a powerful few too stubborn to relinquish their power. Well, what else can I stand for, human rights? All of my friends are a bunch of liberal progressives who love the government and rely on it to fix America's woes. Hell, one of my friends WANTS a stronger government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess basically what I'm saying is: I want to stand for America's ideals, but how I can I have faith when I keep hearing about all these nasty things America causes? I want to have faith so I can stand for her people.

       our founding father literally wanted us to do this, but the 'new patriotism' seems to be about some weird national agenda rather than building community and a free press, since we have neither a free press or cohesive communities on the local level,  im pretty sure the country they started does not exist anymore

       I will only hint at it, but, as prescribed by the paradigms our forefathers have original set forth, our fisrt course of action is to address our government directly concerning our grievances. In this stage, we have many outlets to obtain a satisfactory response. This includes open letterz to our representatives, votes, and then formal rallies (aka protests).
      </p>
      <p>
       Should this stage fail (which it arguably has already), the next course of action is to call for the impeachment of offending representatives. Though, this can be seen as a subsidiary of the first stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all else fails, there is one final thing we may do, and that which is our duty as a sovereign people to accomplish.

       I encourage you to read, and fully analyze the Declaration of Independence. Let it digest within you. Extract their intentions and their meanings. Then, apply this newfound perspective in todays world.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Your answer is contained within the paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence.

       I am patriotic.  I stand behind the Constitution of the United States.  I stand by the Declaration of Independence that our fore fathers literally risked their lives to write and sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       This government is not the US.  The Constitution starts with "We the People" for a reason.  That is what I stand behind, not this over bearing police state loving government we have now.  The people , not the state, are who I am patriotic towards, and the ideal of making a better life for yourself.  Freedom, liberty, these are "American" ideals I believe in.

       I'm turned off from supporting human ideals, though, like the UDHR. Liberals that surround me will jerk off to it, saying "bomb Assad, he killed children" and "MUH CHILDREN MUH MORALITY MUH HUMAN RIGHTS MUH GUN CONTROL MUH LEGALIZATION OF HOMOSEX MARRIAGE" and all that.

       There was a reason "if you can keep it" was added to the one so famous quote. The second people allowed/demanded federal laws they opened pandoras box, from that point on "MUH CHILDREN MUH MORALITY MUH HUMAN RIGHTS MUH GUN CONTROL MUH LEGALIZATION OF HOMOSEX MARRIAGE" become legitimate concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       People couldn't be happy having states, had to start controlling all of them like a bunch of psychopaths. Federal marriage privilege for us elite hetero group and not the scum homo group. If you think the govt has no right to "force churches to marry homos" then get marriage the fuck out of government or recognize the bias and fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't care either way since for most people in the US it will take staring death in the face while he destroys their life just to think they might have made a mistake. Maybe we shouldn't have started federally regulating peoples lives, a grim foretelling of the future of a one world government. Don't teach your kids how your parents taught you, many people would like to have a future.

       The first thing is to realize that our country and our government are not the same thing, this is the first and biggest lie they would have us believe.

       Technically, countries are just lines on a map, but they are really an embodiment of ideas and people. There is nothing wrong with liking the ideas and people you associate yourself with, and this is what you are calling patriotism.

       Be proud of the American people and the spirit of innovation and self-sufficiency and self-determination that is the ideal of America.  Then fight like hell to save it from the plutocrats who have systemically destroyed our ideals in Orwellian fashion.

       You want the America that has not existed since the early 50's or so.  The mess began way before that, though.  Return us to a republic and we can have that again.

       You have to understand that the people's country has been hijacked by financial interests.  With the reins of power, they do what they want to further their own interests.  Think about whether or not your life is any better because of the war on terror.  It isn't. In fact, it's probably worse since the only real consequence of the war on terror is erosion of our own  freedoms and ability to pursue happiness in this country; also guilt over the murder of so many innocent civilians.  We must be "a people in exile" in our own land.  You love the same country that most people do.  It's just that it has been taken from all of us (hopefully only temporarily).

       Fuck faith, my brother/sister.  Stand for CRITICAL THINKING.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       should be your "faith".  Yes, it's tough, because you have to "kill your darlings" in order to learn more, but in the end you will
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       come out a stronger, wiser, more critically-thinking being - and THAT'S more important ultimately than mere blind patriotism toward a country that ultimately doesn't even have your best interest in mind and looks at you as chattel and an expendable pawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly not easy.  The shit is hard.  I remember when I finally figured out
       <em>
        for sure
       </em>
       that 911 was a 100% false flag, I cried pretty hard for a few minutes...just thinking/finding out that TPTB have absolutely no problem with just directly killing off that many us - "Of
       <em>
        its own citizens?
       </em>
       "

       Yeah.  It was tough for a moment.  However, I was not about to

       to information regardless of how difficult to deal with it might be.  That's what you have to do if you want to grow in life:  You have to be willing to accept the truth of things even if that truth be a truth that absolutely levels you and bowls you over and hurts and maybe even traumatizes you when you first come across it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that you're the type of person that wants freedom, right?  Well, TRUTH is the only way to true freedom...and the truth of what's going on in this country and in this world? is REALLY, really difficult to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just get ready.  Steady yourself, take a deep breath, and slowly move forward as you work on uncovering what's REALLY going on in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are not alone.  There are many that are on the same path.  It's certainly not easy.  You will be helped somehow, however.  Help comes along somehow from somewhere (sometimes from very unlikely and unexpected sources) to keep you from falling too hard or too permanently along the way.
      </p>

       Stay strong.

       I share your sentiments entirely. It helps me to think of those actively working towards the consolidation of checks and balances, the undermining of the constitution and the framers original intentions, and the undue usurpation of powers amd authorities as

       By viewing them in this perspective, i have a renewed faith in my country, and, more importantly, its People. Dont let the corrupted few and those who follow with blind faith squander your patriotism.

       I quote Sam Adams alot, but i find it important. This quote from him hits me hard, and if you would analyze and extract the message he was trying to portray, i believe you could find a certain solemn patriotism inherent in all of us, regardless of how forsaken that may have become:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Greed and power corrupts.Peace and love are nice ideas but the USA is in the war business now and without a war we will be out of business. We need to reduce the population and sell these products for war or the economy will tank. Human nature is susceptible to the lure of easy money and instant gratification. If you want to make a quick buck you just got to learn how to fuck someone over. Without the third world there would be no first world.
