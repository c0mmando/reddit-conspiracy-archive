       Actually, most of the world is calling for a true international reserve currency to replace the petrodollar (and by default, the Anglo-American hegemony); the obstacle to that is that NWO wants it to be fiat currency issued by a privately owned global central bank, and non-NWO countries do not.

       That's why they are gathering together in a true economic union (as opposed NWO's so-called free trade organizations) under the leadership of BRICS; which now has its own central bank, which it will eventually use to issue its own currency.

       They don't call it that, of course; and it isn't fully developed. Perhaps a proto-central bank, or central-bank-like entity, that they can continue developing if NWO does not relent in in its economic assault on them.

       They are in fact controlled by the same entity. This however does not change how this will affect Americans when the goal of a worthless dollar is reached, hopefully slowly and not rapidly.
      </p>

       The play goes like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Loan everyone money that you create out of nothing because you have more wealth than the entire population of the planet combined to begin with and that confuses and scares the leaders as well as commoners
      </p>
      <p>
       *make sure there is no single power that can overwhelm all others
      </p>
      <p>
       *make sure there are always wars and fighting so you can continue to loan money that you create
      </p>
      <p>
       *balance things according to the model when needed
      </p>
      <p>
       *become infinitely more wealthy than everyone and live as a modern king and blame all you do on economics, human nature and so on
      </p>
      <p>
       Tools in the arsenal
      </p>
      <p>
       *Money - you would be amazed at what it can buy
      </p>
      <p>
       *assassinations on occasion - to make sure those leaders keep in line
      </p>
      <p>
       *Obscurity - This is the glue that makes it all work - if no one knows you exists and other things are blamed for financial troubles then no one will ever find their way to the castle walls

       This is how it was, but I think it's changed now.  China and Russia have been cleaning house of the NWO crowd for a while now.  They are teaming up with BRICS and over 180 other nations to build another financial system.  I don't know if it will work, but the are now working towards a world that doesn't depend on the dollar.  This is why the west is so desperately trying to kick off World War 3 right now. The NWO is going for broke, literally.

       China and russia is also the NWO, it's all a part of the plan to destroy america so noone has the military might to oppose the one world goverment and depopulation and more debth to keep the bubble going. They funded both sides in WW1 and WW2 why would WW3 be any different? After WW3 the entire world will be bankrupt and they can move in with their one currency one goverment one military and so on, all justified by WW3.

       No, that's the narrative they want you to believe.  But things have changed.  The people now in charge China and Russia are set against the NWO, they've been purging their ranks for some time now.  The banking oligarchs responsible for funding the world wars are being run out and chased away.  The facts are that if the NWO doesn't find a way to refill their coffers again then they are toast, and everybody knows it.  That's why the BRICS and others are preparing a new system for a world without the dollar as the reserve currency.

       There are plenty of bloggers and others out there with opinions and ideas, but Neil is the guy actually in the ring.  He's the one doing the fighting on the front lines in Jakarta.  He's got the documents, the Black Books, the original Hilton Green Accord, access to the elders who are holders of the accounts and bunkers, he's got the connections, he's got dialysis calls coming to him from heads of state, intelligence, finance ministers, kings, generals, etc.  But most important, he's got the backing of the Dragon Family itself, the rightful owners of about 85% of the assets.

       Okay, thank you. I have just recently started digging into this and i found Neil yesterday from another comment in this thread, but i didn't know his sources/connections was that good. Although what he said sounded really informative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does it mean to be a level 50 conspiracy theorist? Is Jakarta important? Who are the elders and the dragon family?

       I just meant that I've been looking into this whole conspiracy thing for a very long time, lots of general knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jakarta, Indonesia is one a few primary locations for heavy activity involving the global collateral accounts.  This is where Neil and his team have setup shop.  Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and other South China Sea nations and islands is where most of the bunkers are that house the assets stolen during the world wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Elders are the people President Sukarno put in charge of holding the accounts/bunkers after he was removed from power and before he died.  The Elders, there are I think just over 100 of them, are the people who have access to the assets.  It's very important to note though, they DO NOT own the accounts and cannot legally take from or give permission to others to take from the accounts.  They are holders, nothing more, nothing less.  The only people who can legally access and use the assets from the global collateral accounts is the rightful depositors.  That's the Dragon Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dragon Family is the name given to those groups of people from which 85% of the assets come from.  They are mostly in China, ancient families.  Another important note here, it's NOT the Chinese government, it's the specific families who at this time remain anonymous.  Their intentions for the assets is to help humanity with HUGE projects all over the planet.  Clean up the environment, food, houses, jobs and health care for everyone, everywhere.  Also the responsible management and release of the various hidden super technologies that already exist but are purposely being hidden from the masses because they would provide enormous freedoms and independence.  Like free energy devices and replicators or constructors like on Star Trek.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helps.

       Also from 1984: "There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized."

       No.

      <p>
       Putin is not controlled by the same entities that currently control the world's financial system. Neither is China.  Truth is, at this very moment, for the first time in history, there is a monumental movement, over 180 un-aligned nations, that has decided enough is enough. For the first time, we have a chance to defeat the NWO crowd once and for all.  Impossible, you say?  China and Russia are the bad guys?  They're just working for the same Masters?  Read on my fellow conspirators.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell am I talking about?  At the very deepest levels of the conspiracy tree, and at the highest levels of the most powerful people on this planet - this is what's happening, this is what all the fighting is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called the
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fyibp/a_brief_history_of_the_global_collateral_accounts/">
        Global Collateral Accounts
       </a>
       , the bad guys stole it before, they're trying to steal it again, the good guys have stopped them so far, and whoever gains control of it in the end will determine the next world order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some history, apologies if you've heard this already...
      </p>
      <p>
       World Wars I and II.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides were secretly being run by the same people -- with the same goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 100 million people died -- for a completely different reason than they thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides fighting these wars -- Axis and Allies -- were owned and controlled by the same international bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       These world wars were used to plunder central banks and private holdings of their gold -- worldwide -- and turn them over to the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official number for all the gold ever dug out of the earth is 166,500 tons. This is a lie. The real amount is:
      </p>
      <p>
       2,420,937.4 metric tons of gold. Recently estimated at about $93,000 trillion in hard assets, with an untold amount of paper currencies used to lease the gold for printing.  Turns out they weren't printing out of thin air, they've been leasing the whole time, and the payments are due, hence the "financial crisis".
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was that in order to stop war, we needed to collect all the gold in one place, and then use it collectively to better humanity. Of course, it was all a ruse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bankers who sold this idea to the ancient families and governments of the world gained access to what is now referred to as the Global Collateral Accounts. This is the source and true assets for all of the western central bank printing presses. This is why the IMF, World Bank, etc. are all powerful and can do almost anything they please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of spreading the wealth throughout the world, the hoarded it for themselves and used it to continue the wars, disease, and poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This secretive group of nasty people are what most people refer to as the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, It's parts of all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common name now given to this collective is "the Cabal".
      </p>
      <p>
       They're aim is nothing short of complete world domination. The most current plan is to reduce the population of the planet to about 500 million people total. It will then be much easier to control things.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're a thousand more details but I'll cut to the fun part.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Most of you have heard this story in one form or another, but what you have not heard is this:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another group, even more secret than the others, and they are about to flip the world over
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, all along, the ancient secret societies, together with small bands of very well connected people, have been building a plan to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is simply called The Plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without revealing any details of the actions about to take place, here ore some of the results you can look forward to in the very near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, get back control of the Global Collateral Accounts and cut off the funding powers of the Cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Round up and arrest ALL the bad guys. The list is literally millions long. You know the FEMA camps they built for us? That's where they'll be stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally about 7 semi truck loads of evidence to convict these people. The "good guys" have been collecting it for a LONG time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Global Collateral Accounts will then be used to stop hunger and poverty, clean up the environment, provide homes for all, and create jobs for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, the hidden technologies will be released and developed. Free energy, replicators (or constructors), and incredible healing techs (think growing back of limbs).
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA will move away from admiralty law to a system of common law, with much of the world following in our footsteps soon after. It's simple, no harm to people or property, and treat other like you want them to treat you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The global financial system will be overhauled to be what is should have been all along. Real and transparent. All things will be based on actual assets. No more gambling with phoney FIAT crap. The good guys have already cut off access to the Accounts, this is the real reason for the global financial crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wars will no longer be tolerated by anyone, anywhere, for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world wants to create an honest, transparent, and stable financial system shared by all, ruled by none.  The complete opposite of what we have today.  And the bad guys are desperately trying to kick off WW3 to stop them.  It won't work, they're are too many set against them now and China and Russia have both agreed they won't play.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the grand plan, and the

       I've seen this idea before (I think you were the one posting the comment where I first saw it) and it does seem to have
       <em>

       legs.  I guess my question is: what are they waiting for?  From what I remember you've been saying this stuff for the last year or so at least and things have only gotten worse in that time.

       It all just seems very convenient.  Where was this "good group" during WWII?  How and why have they just decided to come out of the woodwork now as opposed to decades ago?

       It is exactly that tale.  While some of Benjamin's sources and reports have been dubious at best, his heart is in the right place, and the story he's talking about is real.  Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.  As for amounting to nothing, see my post somewhere in these replies about some of the results happening just behind the scenes.

       One very important thing that slowed things down was when they locked up Nelu 2 years ago.  Who is Nelu?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nelu is another important part of the Keenan team. He is the interface between Neil Keenan and the elders, or as Neil puts it, he needs Nelu to go up into hills and work with the elders, nobody else, Nelu is the guy that can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 years ago Nelu's uncle set him up with false certificates and them both thrown in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nelu was innocence, but keeping him behind bars caused much trouble for the Keenan team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nelu was released a week ago, August 26, 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       With Nelu free, an important piece of the work can now continue.

       I know it looks like nothing is happening, that's because most things are happening behind the scenes right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       some of the positive developments have been:
      </p>
      <p>
       the stopping of the false flag nuclear bombing of South Carolina.  there are certain generals to thank for this one, they lost their careers over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       an attempt to steal the global collateral accounts was stopped at the Vatican Bank.  there was a short blip on the news about these two guys getting stopped at the door with the fake  certificates in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       just recently US military drills in South Korea were to be used as a cover to steal 230,000 metric tons of gold.  this was also stopped by the good guys, but word just went out that they're at it again here.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the future, things are supposed to be getting more and more public. some things you can look for to be  coming soon:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wall Street is moving to Stamford Connecticut. much equipment and personnel is already there, up and running.
      </p>
      <p>
       something called the No fFly Accords  basically a giant list of cabal members and their supporters who will no longer be allowed to fly over participating countries. the BRICS and all 180 unaligned  nations are interested in implementing this in one way or another.  the idea is to box them in, for when it's time to go get 'em.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, Germany and France are looking to leave NATO and join BRICS.

       Hmm... all very interesting and I'll have to look more into the story.  My gut reaction though?  It sounds a little bit like, "Just sit back and relax, everything is being taken care of."  Which would of course play right into the cabal's hands.

       Yeah, I should explain better, 'cause it does sound just like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it as two separate efforts happening.  One effort to free the global collateral accounts, and a separate effort by separate people to hold the criminals accountable for what they've done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neil Keenan is is deeply involved in the efforts to secure the accounts back to the rightful owners.  Also, he is involved somewhat on the other side because of his lawsuit against the Cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the good guys in the Pentagon, military, alphabet agencies, etc. ever actually pull the switch and make the mass arrests may depend largely on whether or not the public can rise up and demand such actions first.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we sit back and do nothing, the mass arrests of the criminal elite may never happen.  Basically, it sounds like they can't do it without us.  they would support our actions and demands, but it has to come from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't, what we can expect to play out is the rest of the world will move on without us.  The dragon family, which owns 85% of the accounts, has said that we are welcome to the programs and help that will come, but not until we get rid of our corrupt leaders and broken system first.

       There is that very real possibility.  They tried to nuke South Carolina.  Thankfully, good guys on the inside stopped it.  Remember all the high-level nucular military people getting axed not too long ago?  That was some of the fallout.
      </p>

       Currently, word on the street is that New York is the next target again.  Wall Street is leaving New York, that should be a big sign to everyone.

       So I just googled "Wall Street moving to Stamford" and nothing came up about what you are claiming.  Can you provide a source for this?

       Edit: OK now I'm seeing something about this.  It's called near-shoring.

       I heard it a week ago from Neil Keenan.  I've learned to trust the guy, he's seems to have good info on things like this.

      <p>
       I didn't find anything either when I looked around.  one thing I did notice when I search Google News was many news releases coming from some Wall Street firms did list their location as Stamford, Connecticut.  Might be something there, I didn't look much though.

       Spread the word.  I've said this already but I'll say it again, we don't need believers. All we need is to spread the word that this possibility is out there. That way, when they do flip the switch, a lot less people will be freaking out because they will have heard about it already. We're the ones that will need to explain to our friends and families what's going on, cuz it's gonna be crazy and we'll be the ones they come to with questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, we really need to make some noise.  We need to let the good guys all throughout the military and agencies know that this is what we want.  We want them to back us, back our efforts to remove ALL the criminals from our ranks. We'll help each other, but neither side can do it alone.

       All very valid questions.   And extremely difficult to answer, also the answers may change depending who you ask.  Sorry, I know that's annoying, but its what I've found whule asking the same.

       Understand they're is no good guy group, and no leader of said non existing group.  Only people, with the same ideals, working in their own ways, towards a beneficial outcome for all.  A world free from the Cabal.

       The thing to remember always is that globalists have no allegiance to any country/ideology/group other than themselves.  They are the proverbial "chameleons" and "wolves in sheep's clothing" and they use subversion, manipulation, and infiltration as their weapons of choice.  "The agenda", their agenda, has been in place for hundreds (if not thousands) of years and they've had many generations to fine tune and work towards it.

       Another thing to remember is that they are parasites. They must have a currency/economy to feed off of. Is BRICs really "The plan" to undo the NWO or one that continues it? Given the animosity toward Putin, my guess is the former. Time will tell.

       Yes, there was a pivotal meeting off the coast of Morocco on a boat with many heads of state and important people, finance ministers and such.  It was said that Rockefeller tried to barge his way onto the ship but was refused entry at the gangplank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, at this meeting all the evidence was presented to every one of the cabal's plan to kill off 85% of the people on this planet.  It was decided that a new global financial system was needed and the key to it was mass resistance to the Cabal and the legal acquisition of the global collateral accounts back to the rightful depositors.  It will then be used as originally intended, to help everyone, everywhere. Instead of fighting the Cabal, they would starve it financially like cutting off its source of funds first from the collateral accounts and then any and every other which way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this meeting came BRICS and the over 180 in aligned nations.  Go listen to some of  what was said at the last g77 meeting.

       If he mentions Bitcoin, I'll eat a football helmet.  I'm pretty sure I'm safe, though, because it seems clear now that he is working on behalf of the City, just like all the Soviets before him.

       "In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet technology. Almost all — perhaps 90-95 percent — came directly or indirectly from the United States and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries have built the Soviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive construction job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been carried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance."

       But as for Putin- he has seemed to be trying to create his own NWO with the BRICS nations, and in doing so has pissed off the west and all of the Russian Oligarchs who wanted to share the power.

       Maybe. The thing is, oil is traded in petro-dollars which helps to keep the US in the #1 currency spot. Any change to that will spell death to US world dominance. I would preface that by saying, unless the BRIC nations and any other powerful nation were all tied to some sort of regional trade agreement, you're not going to see that sort of global currency. I think to get to that point we would need one more big world war, just to consolidate the rest of the power.

       "Globalist elites" and the world-controlling cabal at the top of it all is an idea that shills like Jones and Icke use because it reduces the complexity of the conspiracies that control the world into a caricature that's easy for the mind to seize upon. This is shilling for the grassroots, telling people what scares them the most.

       What does this have to do with OPs post? Regarding Russia and USA are just staging a show and are really controlled by some super secret society... illuminati?

       They don't call it that, of course; and it isn't fully developed. Perhaps a proto-central bank, or central-bank-like entity, that they can continue developing if NWO does not relent in in its economic assault on them.
