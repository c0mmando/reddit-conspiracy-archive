        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>yay for Mexico! more countries are fighting the big GMO corps.</p>

<p>&quot;...Despite their tireless lobbying efforts in Brussels, <em>the “Big Six” (Monsanto, Du Pont Pioneer, Syngenta, Vilmorin, Winfield and KWS)</em> continue to hit a brick wall of resistance in many of Europe’s biggest markets, including Germany and France. </p>

<p>...However, Monsanto’s bullying tactics failed to impress the Mexican judges. On August 15, the court convened to review Zaleta’s alleged bias ruled against the U.S. corporation’s legal suit. Also spurned by the Mexican courts was the <em>world’s third largest GMO seed manufacturer, Syngenta</em>, whose reapplication for a license to run test trials of its maize crops was rejected this week by the Federal Court.</p>

<p>...as award-winning professor of Cellular Neurobiology David R. Schubert warned in a 2013 letter to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto:</p>

<p>Introducing GM corn into Mexico would pose a huge environmental risk given that the plant is native to the country. The GM varieties would drastically diminish the crop diversity of both Mexico and the world at large.</p>

<p>GM corn would make the crop production process a lot more expensive. Buying the same crop seeds year after year – as already happens in the U.S. and across many agricultural sectors in the global south (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and India) – would increase the costs throughout the Mexican food chain, putting millions of smallholders out of business.</p>

<p>GMO corn will also increase Mexico’s social and political dependence on oligopolies. Once transnational corporations dominate the seed market of a particular crop (as has happened with Soy and is fast happening with Corn), they will continue introducing GM seeds for other crops and increasing their power over Mexico’s agricultural sector. </p>

<p>As Schubert warned, this has already happened in the United States, “where seed companies are one of the main sources of financial funding for the two main political parties and have put their own people in senior positions of power to dictate national and international agricultural policy”.</p>

<p>GM maize expressing Bt protein and herbicide resistance and the chemicals required for their cultivation pose a serious health hazard to those who consume it – especially on the scale at which it is consumed in Mexico.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <strong>once the GM seeds are planted, they’ll be no going back.</strong> The country’s native varieties, which are the result of thousands of years of careful selection and breeding, will be irreversibly contaminated – even if the GM seeds are introduced on a modest scale.&quot;</p>

<p>Those two statements do nothing to disprove my point. It does not matter if there is 1 gene changing or  a 1000. The fact is that by planting GMO&#39;s next to unaltered, natural plants you are going to alter them by just having GMO&#39;s present. </p>

<p>Some people want unaltered food and they have a right to ask that.</p>

<p>Maybe, but unfortunately with corporations running rampant the information we get is always skewed or just straight disinformation. Any information that could hurt their profits is subsequently squashed.</p>

<p>Maybe if it is harmful to the success of the plant then yes. It will weed it out through natural selection. </p>

<p>The question arises what if it is not good for living beings to CONSUME this genetically altered food. Frankly I just don&#39;t know but I also can&#39;t trust anything I read about subjects like this. If you can&#39;t trust what your Government and medical centers tell you because you know it is influenced by Corporations, your in a bad state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct if done correctly And ethically. The problem comes from greedy pockets. For instance: if you created a hover board and sold me one; would you also give me the blueprints along with it so I can make my own to sell? Of course not because that would take money from your pocket. Well the same is with big crop. They don&#39;t want you being able to reproduce a seed they are making money off of. So they alter the seed to make it sterile so you have to buy more of the same seeds from the same company to have the same plant. This creates two issues. The first problem being that you get locked into buying the seeds because any predators of your plant have adapted making it very difficult to go back to a natural growing version of the plant. The second issue is the price sticker on the plants. Ultimately GMOs right now avoid the supply and demand curve because of the patent they&#39;ve placed on the slightly altered version of corn or soy, and have successfully integrated their plants to place a monopoly on our food supply. The problem isn&#39;t that we are genetically altering plants, the problem arises from who is doing it, and their reasons behind it.</p>

<p>There is no crop commercially available that makes sterile seed.  That was/is called the terminator gene.  It&#39;s claimed that the technology is out there, but none has been released commercially.  Growers must buy new seeds each year because of contracts and the crops are hybridized.  Hybridized crop seed will generally produce an inferior product, so to retain hybrid vigor, you must purchase new seed each year.</p>

<p>EDIT: Growers must buy new seeds each year because of contracts.  This is for GMO seeds.  Not for general hybrids.  Most GMO seed is sold with the specification that you cannot replant from saved seed. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not quite true; unless the contract is for a specific end market use and the crop/seed/plant to be grown is specified by the end user. None of the seed company contracts make a farmer buy the seed in the subsequent years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This part is a/the good reason to keep buying hybrid seed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not shady.  It&#39;s business.  A grower can purchase Open Pollinated (OP) seed and can generally save seed from year to year.  But when you buy a hybrid, the subsequent crop won&#39;t be true to name.  That is why we generally replant don&#39;t save hybrid seed.  Though you can get some interesting products from those hybrids.  Hybridization is the reason that most fruit trees are grafted and not grown from seed.  They won&#39;t usually produce fruit like the parent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genetically modified dominant traits will suppress naturally grown genetic traits as that is what GMOs are designed to do. One of these dominant traits is to not produce seeds which would only occur in a mutated plant and would be deemed a recessive trait and would not get passed on to the next plant because the plant is sterile and otherwise not able to reproduce the traits that caused it to be sterile. If you have a GMO Apple tree that has a built in pesticide and the pest that bothers the tree adapts to the GMO, then the tree will eventually die. Where as in nature genetics of different organisms are in constant evolutionary battle that creates a balance and both organisms to survive. Gmos are defenceless and the sole purpose is for monetary gain. GMOs could be great for our species but not in the way It&#39;s being done today. </p>
