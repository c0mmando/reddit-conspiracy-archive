<p>I&#39;m not saying Greenwald is perfect. I think it was a bad decision to get into business with Omidyar, I don&#39;t trust that guy at all. I also disagree with some aspects of how he has handled the NSA leaks. But one thing I don&#39;t disagree with is the &#39;slow-drip&#39; method of handling the leaks, I think that&#39;s 100% the right way to go -- it keeps the story in the news.</p>

<p>The fact is, Greenwald has done a lot of good work on a variety of important issues. He brings significant attention to real conspiracies, I think that&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) No opinion</p>

<p>2) Not indicative of his current mindset, evidently.</p>

<p>3) Shady, I&#39;m no fan of the slow release format and I&#39;m one of many who is watching firstlook from a wary perspective. I think Wikileak&#39;s and Cryptome&#39;s responses and correspondence echo my sentiments. </p>

<p>That said, the firstlook journalists hired so far have excellent records so I&#39;ll wait and see how it pans out.</p>

<p>All in all, I find some of the motives and journalistic practices questionable, but I&#39;m certainly not of the mind that this is some sort of orchestrated ruse or anything, and I further think that there is a lot of objective factual data in the leaks which command the public&#39;s due attention, that is what people should be really paying attention to, not news theatre. just my 2p. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think Snowden chose Greewald for those reasons. I think both Snowden and Greenwald are credible, personally.</p>

<p>I think there have been fair criticisms that not enough documents have been released -- I 100% agree with that -- but I think more will continue to be released in the future. I also think it&#39;s good that NSA spying is now known in the mainstream. It&#39;s always better to have more information and more people aware of what&#39;s going on, in my opinion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I disagree with the limited hangout idea -- because ANY DOCUMENTED information about NSA spying is better than none. Ignorance is never better. You can argue it&#39;s only part of the picture, but the Snowden docs have illustrated a massive, aggressive, illegal surveillance state already. That&#39;s why I disagree with the &#39;panopticon&#39; idea too -- even if the government wants us to know about it&#39;s massive spying apparatus, to disenfranchise us or condition us to accept it, it&#39;s STILL better to be aware than ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between security and speed cameras. They do have speed enforcement cameras out by me. As well as portable ones in vans that sit by construction zones. </p>

<p>If they made an announcement that now speed would be monitored via Highway cameras I guarantee a majority of people would slow down. But since the purpose of the cameras is not to catch speeders(unless they are the marked areas for speed camreas) there is no threat. </p>

<p>Come to Chicago. The corners that have the police cameras on them are now safer. But they don&#39;t have them everywhere and the gangs know this. So they move to a corner with no camera. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Functionally, yes, there is a difference between security and speed cameras.  But for the Panopticon theory no, there isn&#39;t.  If cameras cause people to moderate their behavior what difference would it make which type of camera it was?</p>

<p>And as you&#39;re noted, the gangs just move down the street, they haven&#39;t given up crime because of cameras afraid of the mighty Panopticon.  Just walk down the street, like everyone else will and carry on their lives just as before the Snowden revelations.</p>

<p>If I do take up your invitation to go to Chicago, is it a wondrous utopia now thanks to the cameras where the citizens self-moderate?  Or is it still the murder capital of the US, cameras and all?</p>

<p>Panopticon theory is bullshit folks, it&#39;s just to scare you and it only will if you let it!  </p>

<p>And no because the cameras are only in so many places. </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s called conditioning, they won&#39;t just jump right into it. They start with the Internet and electronic communications and slowly creep into a security state. Right now it&#39;s the NSA spying on us. Not so much to police.  There is a difference between the two.  Give it some time you&#39;ll see the surveillance state evolve even more. </p>

<p>Come to Chicago you will be perfectly safe. The murders mainly happen in a few rough areas and aside from the kids caught in the cross fire it&#39;s mainly gang on gang violence. </p>

<p>That statement is patently false.  The NSA spies on us, and gives the information to the police to act!  The NSA doesn&#39;t arrest anyone, that&#39;s what the police are for.  Why have all this information about crime if nobody is going to be arrested?</p>

<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">parallel construction</a> because I suggest you look into it.</p>

<p>I see your points about gangs having preexisting criminality that won&#39;t be tampered by cameras, so what&#39;s the point of the cameras then?  The cameras are for all the law abiding citizens?  The law abiders don&#39;t trouble the government already, why scare them?  Might interfere with their shopping.</p>

<p>If by they you mean you then you are correct!  Yeah, the surveillance issue has repeatedly been in the news, <em>and it&#39;s waking people up!</em>  Your message is obey, but I&#39;m glad that my brethren Snowden, Manning, and Greenwald <strong>are not!</strong>  The fascist police state wants people to obey but there&#39;s more resistance now than ever.  If the whole purpose of this revelation was to put people to sleep it&#39;s had the exact opposite effect!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the difference between you and I: I believe that the government is evil, controlling and manipulative, but also logical.  Your theory is that all these stories are to put people to sleep, to make them scared, when the exact opposite is happening.  Either the illuminati fumbled the ball or they never had it in the first place!  The power is of the people, always will be, and that&#39;s what TPTB are afraid of and why they&#39;re trying to put people back to sleep <strong>because</strong> of the Snowden/Manning/Greenwald/Wikileaks revelations.  Those revelations are <strong>not</strong> how they&#39;re putting people to sleep.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great time to be a conspiracy theorist because more theories are being elevated to fact.  Open your eyes and rejoice, don&#39;t dismiss what is in front of you</p>

<p>I would argue that PRISM and the corporate collusion between the NSA and various tech companies have been the largest revelations thus far, and they&#39;re not so unsubstantial as to be brushed aside as nothing. It quite literally amounts to a conspiracy to dismantle civil rights taking place at both the highest levels of the government and corporate sector. </p>

<p>Well it&#39;s done a piss poor job of doing that. Most people really gave a rats ass about the Patriot Act or warantless wiretapping in the mid 2000s, but it is a topic that at least enters the common discourse now. The opinion of the NSA is less than stellar not only amongst the people, but even within the government establishment. Naturally it is going to be hard to break down Rome in a day, but in order to make any headway, the first thing we will need is awareness of the issue, which Greenwald and Snowden seem to be promoting. </p>

<p>true. step 1 is spreading information ......... but</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A &#39;limited hangout&#39; is spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. <strong>When their veil of secrecy is shredded</strong> and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, <strong>they resort to admitting</strong>—sometimes even volunteering—<strong>some</strong> of the truth while still managing to <strong>withhold the key</strong> and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.&quot;</p>

<p>I would love to hear Greenwald talk about 9/11. anything at all. would he label somebody who has questions as a conspiracy theorist or 9/11 truther?</p>

<p>I could go either way on Snowden.  He could just be an agent mimicking manning for a limited hangout operation.   But the info is reliable even if it&#39;s gear towards steering public focus.  Just don&#39;t put all your eggs in the Snowden basket.  That intel, just like wikileaks, can be manipulated.  It&#39;s still a good resource for information that isn&#39;t otherwise available and sparking a conversation that is otherwise impossible to have.</p>

<p>Hmmm, this is the theory, but in fact Greenwald has been concentrating on writing his book - very little of interest has been released in recent months. Greenwald talks a good game, but he seems to be putting the brakes on this information rather than &quot;keeping it in the news&quot;.</p>

<p>You seem to have a problem with me because I strongly disagree with your interpretation of the Snowden leaks. That&#39;s fine. But you have repeatedly accused me of rule breaking yet you&#39;re the one who called me a shill, I never insulted you, I just disagreed with your post and provided links illustrating why I disagreed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is a riot. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/YoureAllRobots">u/YoureAllRobots</a> just finished accusing me (yesterday) of violating rule #10.  He seems to enjoy flinging that accusation around.  Sounds like I had the exact same experience as you did.  Go figure that.</p>

<p>Also I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the NSA and the CIA cared more about getting people knowledgeable about hacking than people with an extensive education background. Doesn&#39;t seem illogical.</p>

<p>Since cameras have been installed on the highways and the streets have you stopped speeding?  How many tickets have you gotten driving about your daily basis?  Honestly now, have you really stopped speeding?  NOBODY HAS!  AND THERE&#39;S CAMERAS EVERYWHERE!</p>
