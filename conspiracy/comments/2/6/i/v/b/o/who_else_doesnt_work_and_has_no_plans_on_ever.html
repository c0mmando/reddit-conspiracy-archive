<p>Who else is not working and surviving just fine? </p>

<p>Are you happy not working? What&#39;s it like for you to wake up and know you don&#39;t have to do any work? Do you feel a sense of freedom? </p>

<p>What&#39;s it feel like to you not worrying about how to spend your money. </p>

<p>Do you feel like your life is &#39;good&#39;? </p>

<p>Why is this in conspiracy? Well a certain group of people believe and base their whole life on the notion that in order to &#39;live&#39; a &#39;good&#39; life you must work for it. And then lambast others like little children for thinking a different way. </p>

<p>Yet there are people living just fine with no work involved in their life. </p>

<p>I would just like to know some of their stories and feelings about things coming from a fellow non worker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite Buckminster Fuller quotes:</p>

<p>“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”</p>

<p>If this is your line of thinking you should definitely check out <a href="/r/BasicIncome">/r/BasicIncome</a> </p>

<p>We are fighting for a system that provides all citizens with a guaranteed monthly income that covers the basic necessities for life: food, water, clothing, and shelter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know who you are kidding but being a pop-artist isn&#39;t even remotely close to being a musician by trade. Do you know any actual musicians? I do - most of them don&#39;t make a lot of money. Most of them live transient-lifestyles floating between cities and couches looking for work they can do in-between playing their shows and going on tour. The rest of them seem to try and eek out a living teaching music and playing paid gigs (i.e. not playing their own music) and you have the nerve to suggest that it&#39;s some sort of easy choice to make because of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin? You should be laughed out of this place. Go post on some libertarian fantasy board where others are willing to entertain your false notions.</p>

<p>Lastly, do you think any of them were successful because they traded playing their music for more strings? Which was literally the example that you used.</p>

<p>The absurdity of your suggestion is outright fucking insulting to anyone who lives in the real world.</p>

<p>Yes as well as this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe he trades for a new strap and some strings </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So don&#39;t act like I&#39;m misquoting you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe the musicians you know are just not desirable enough to merit payment for their services. That isn&#39;t the case for every musician.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s a laughable point to make as it in no way detracts from what I&#39;ve been saying. I never said that musicians can&#39;t barter, only that it&#39;s only a realistic option for those who don&#39;t live in the real world, aka you and the hippy commune you live in on the pacific northwest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Absurdity is your proposition that only pop-artists receive compensation for their talents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must be fucking illiterate because what I suggested was that pop-artists are the only artists that receive enough compensation for their talents to actually eek out a living. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be fair, if all you want to do is sleep on the couches of your friend&#39;s, you don&#39;t even need to pretend to be a musician and barter. So I hope you can understand why I&#39;m drawing my examples from those of us that live in communities that make up a majority of this country (i.e. cities). </p>

<p>I own my own business, please. Like I said before, if you want to equate your situation to any of the people you were going to cite as guitarists that can trade their musicianship for goods then you are outright delusional. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve made the choice to be happy with what you have, but in your response to the OP you inherently assumed that others would be happy with the choices you&#39;ve made. I was simply pointing out that that making a living on musicianship has more to do with re-defining your cost of living versus your musicianship.</p>

<p>It also grants me the ability to travel to world, purchase art supplies and instruments, and most importantly, leaves me the means to give to charities both near and abroad.</p>

<p>What i never enjoyed was jobs. Mindless, soul-crushing, unappreciated, monotonous, time-filling jobs. They only exist to occupy our time and minds.</p>
