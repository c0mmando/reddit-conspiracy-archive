       Did someone save the info? Put that shit back up. This is the lesson. If it exists only on the internet, it will eventually go away. Make sure ALL important info is backed up on hard drives that are not connected to the internet.

       What tools do you suggest to pull down entire sites?  Because of the frequency of pulled articles online, I've started printing the important and interesting articles to PDF from the browser.  Even with descriptive file naming, later location and reference becomes a challenge.  It would be nice to have a means to quickly pull down an article, topic branch, or the entire site on command.

       The thugs that run the Gestapo are flexing their might.  We once believed that by and large the groups that ruled over our lives stood for justice, for doing "what's right."  A freak then, and even more so now.  False flags with frightening frequency, always coinciding with a black eye on a certain "ally" who has surreptitiously taken complete control over our government.  Where a certain citizen has the power over all candidates.  All bow down before him, and none are too large, too popular of their own doing to not need to kiss the pinky ring of this Don.  Infighting not for ultimate control, but control and recognition of those those truly in charge.  Hidden entirely from any consequence, subsequent accountability).  Ruling man from behind their puppet force.  We saw exactly this during the death throws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The actual rulers were not the in the public eye.  Rule fro the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parallels are remarkable.  An ever-shrinking precious medals content of currency.  Disillusion further and further.  Inflation to pay debts, screwing the state economy irreparably in the process.  Military propping the economy.  The circus becoming more and more Ogrish meets Jackass.  The depravity of the ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       This being foreced offline after uncovering much, and bringing us to where we are today.  With a solid list of questions the state is unable to answer without fully incriminating themselves as well as other foreign interests.
      </p>

       The three towers, two of which had just been condemned with their unacceptably high asbestos content.  Scheme is plotted, and for the first time ever, a private individual is able to "lease" the World Trade complex.  The corrupted members of government go against their formerly held natural self-interest in the complex ownership.  Though now with the staggering costs to repair, higher than being taken out by a controlled demolition and rebuilt from the ground up, they would pass this cost on to the people.  And justify the unjustifiable wars in the process.  While we think that the insurance companies were the ones that were burned by the costs, it was us, the taxpayer left to pick up the tab.  The criminal TARP ensured the insurance companies were paid back in full with interest, compliments the divided US citizens.  Then we are forced to pick up the larger tab for multiple concurrent wars, and our unconstitutional internal, government run "terrorist" organization.  I seem to have forgottebb when any of this was authorized by those will have to pay for it.

       Yup. This is most likely the case, realistically. When a site runs in auto pilot for so long you tend to become VERY disconnected from that site and it's potential usefulness to some users.

       The thugs that run the Gestapo are flexing their might.  We once believed that by and large the groups that ruled over our lives stood for justice, for doing "what's right."  A freak then, and even more so now.  False flags with frightening frequency, always coinciding with a black eye on a certain "ally" who has surreptitiously taken complete control over our government.  Where a certain citizen has the power over all candidates.  All bow down before him, and none are too large, too popular of their own doing to not need to kiss the pinky ring of this Don.  Infighting not for ultimate control, but control and recognition of those those truly in charge.  Hidden entirely from any consequence, subsequent accountability).  Ruling man from behind their puppet force.  We saw exactly this during the death throws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The actual rulers were not the in the public eye.  Rule fro the shadows.

       The parallels are remarkable.  An ever-shrinking precious medals content of currency.  Disillusion further and further.  Inflation to pay debts, screwing the state economy irreparably in the process.  Military propping the economy.  The circus becoming more and more Ogrish meets Jackass.  The depravity of the ruling class.

       This being foreced offline after uncovering much, and bringing us to where we are today.  With a solid list of questions the state is unable to answer without fully incriminating themselves as well as other foreign interests.

       The three towers, two of which had just been condemned with their unacceptably high asbestos content.  Scheme is plotted, and for the first time ever, a private individual is able to "lease" the World Trade complex.  The corrupted members of government go against their formerly held natural self-interest in the complex ownership.  Though now with the staggering costs to repair, higher than being taken out by a controlled demolition and rebuilt from the ground up, they would pass this cost on to the people.  And justify the unjustifiable wars in the process.  While we think that the insurance companies were the ones that were burned by the costs, it was us, the taxpayer left to pick up the tab.  The criminal TARP ensured the insurance companies were paid back in full with interest, compliments the divided US citizens.  Then we are forced to pick up the larger tab for multiple concurrent wars, and our unconstitutional internal, government run "terrorist" organization.  I seem to have forgottebb when any of this was authorized by those will have to pay for it.
