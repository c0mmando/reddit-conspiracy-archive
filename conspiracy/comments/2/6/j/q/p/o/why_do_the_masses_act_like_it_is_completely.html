Most people in the West already have peace, but it comes at the cost of their inaction and atrocities around the world and their slow slide into fascism. If people wanted change, they would fight for it. They don&#39;t, they want peace. So they stay still and stay quiet. That&#39;s peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think global stability and peace are all that unobtainable. People just need to come to realize how idiotic it is that we&#39;ve been forced to believe that conflict and aggression is the way we naturally solve our problems. Perhaps it has been a way, but not the only way for humans to co-exist.</p>

<p>The world just needs to chill out and think about the big picture for once. We&#39;re finally at a stage where our technology could easily provide adequate resources for everyone on this planet, but it requires people/society giving up on this idea of a lust for power and control at all costs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a social paradigm shift that needs to happen for long-term sustainability of our species on the planet. Somehow we better find a way to accept and come to terms with it. Or else, it&#39;s pretty bad for everyone involved...obviously.</p>

<p>some people still believe the official story, and they say that i am the one jumping to conclusions, yet they still believe the same things today as they did the week of 9/11. </p>

<p>jumping to conclusions: thinking you know what happened on 9/11, the week of 9/11, because you saw 9/11 on TV.</p>

<p>not jumping to conclusions: changing your views on 9/11 slowly over 10+ years of collective research on the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old people are much more stubborn with their opinions. They have had time to believe and reinforce those beliefs for a long time. It is impossible to change an old person&#39;s opinion about something he feels strongly about. There is not a lot of flexibility there. Old people also like to believe they are much more smarter because they understand a lot more, and so they lack the humbleness to change their own mindset. </p>

<p>Old people have more opportunities than a 15 year old, but that doesn&#39;t mean an old person took hold of all those opportunities and corrected themselves. Old people are generally smarter than 15 year olds, but that can&#39;t be used as an argument to make the case that an old person is more right than the 15 yr old (generalizations are not a good measure for truth). When a person grows older, they might have a lot of experiences, but that doesn&#39;t mean they understand everything because its impossible to do so. They might understand many specific things well because of their age, but can&#39;t use their age to make the case that they are all-knowing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that what happens is if I explain things I become either crazy or unsuccessful.  It seems to me that there is this psychology where if you are really winning at life then you won&#39;t be bitching about things at all and instead will have an arrogant and happy smug look all of the time or a stern stodgey superior look more if you are from the old world style.  So people perceive that someone who has something to say about something negative is someone who is losing the resource game.  So I&#39;ve found myself somewhere between crazy and loser in the monkey brain of many people.  I think that it is rather difficult for them to get a perspective on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loser, crazy or both.  I&#39;ve been all of that and in L&#39;viv, Ukraine I&#39;m currently doing pretty well in comparison to many.  I just can&#39;t seem to do amazingly well in California but I think that it is because I don&#39;t value it as much as the price.</p>

<p>Well I think that largely that I was cured of being afraid of what others think of me as a thing in itself when I was 18 and getting myself out of a ill concieved enlistment.  At one point I was put in front of a mirror and one hundred privates walked by me and slurred their insults at me if they chose to.  I was subjected to numerous nasty things as I was being singled out for trying to leave.  I&#39;m human so I do like people to accept me but I&#39;m not afraid of simply people not liking me.  I realize that people will do really nasty things to you to your face, to the back of your head or behind your back when you go against the common theme.  So there is a consequence there from the normalcy makers.  So I see many behaviours as veiled coercion because I have the experience and the intelligence to know that things will get nasty when I choose otherwise.  I&#39;m not a sycophant to want to suck up to someone who I perceive as being only abstractions away from aggressive behaviour.</p>

<p>Anyways I&#39;d suggest toning it down until you are making some money in a traditionally respectable and validating way.  Unless of course you are in a stage where you are testing the psychology and resolve of those around you.  There is a price to pay there and it could easily mean that people alienate you as well.  Also some people might agree with you and like you but they could perceive you to be too much of a liability to let into their fragile and trite social constructs.  Pussy and a paycheck are very compelling things to sell out for and once people get these they don&#39;t want to let any destabilizing actors into their life.  So you get to be the freak show to amuse them and to allow them to imagine a world in which they have the ability to think all thoughts all of the time.  There is no place for that in the majority of marriages and for shallow conversation by the water cooler.</p>

<p>You know what... they are right. However, the fact that we are unhappy with our lives, causes us to re-evaluate these things, rather than accept and adapt to them. Suffering in this manner is good because it helps you see clearly and gain much more insight into your lives.</p>

<p>The people who have power don&#39;t like those of us who don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; perfectly into their system because those are the areas from where threat arises against their system. Someone who benefits and succeeds under the system isn&#39;t going to be the one that starts a resistance against them, but a person who is unhappy and finds it difficult to struggle through. He who is unhappy and struggles to succeed under the system, questions whether he should be struggling in this manner or whether there are better alternatives to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, really this is the problem. You want to believe that the US government is better than other, obviously corrupt governments. But sadly, you and others ignore the dirty hands of US foreign policy that go against the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and statements about freedom by past presidents and dignified politicians.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fact the US government, via various aid programs, spent $5 billion to overthrow an elected government in the Ukraine, and yet, most people on Reddit, lapped up the anti-Russian propaganda that has been shown to be demonstrably false. </p>

<p>Or going back to the run-up to the Iraq war, some 70+ % of respondents polled believed Sadaam Hussein was behind 9/11. This is the same war that led to a 1,000,000 or more Iraqis being killed in the name of &quot;freedom.&quot; Yes the Hussein government was terrible, but Sadaam never killed as many Iraqis as we did. And it was the US government that helped Hussein consolidate and maintain power for decades, including selling him the WMDs that were the casus belli of the Iraq war.</p>

<p>The US government is the most inimical force to democracy and self-determination in the developing world. And it has been recently and historically inimical to democracy and democratic organization within the borders of this country as well (Palmer raids to the NSA). I mean, unless you believe total surveillance is harmless, which I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Yes there are other governments that have been as or more corrupt than the US federal government, but those governments generally had the support of the US government. </p>

<p>2) US is the most powerful nation in the world and so its the most dangerous country too </p>

<p>Very meta, but this thread, in which specific conspiracies are not being discussed, is a great example of that. No shills or <a href="/r/tards">/r/tards</a> pissing in the well, a nice civilized discussion. </p>

<p>BUT, mention Sandy Hook in a thread and holy crap, the deniers are out in force.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on talking points that have strong, documented evidence to support them. I want healthy dialogue so that people can make their own decisions about these conspiracies. </p>

<p>We have to choose our words and battles very carefully if we truly want to initiate change in the hearts and minds of those around us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because in movies, the &quot;corrupt&quot; people are never at the very top of the hierarchy. The top of the hierarchy is what comes in and saves the day, for example, when a corrupt police official is the villain, the movie ends with the FBI coming in and stopping him. </p>

<p>Most people do not imagine that those at the very top are corrupt even though all evidence proves this is the case.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Even when there is corruption in a government or powerful organization in movies, it is usually implied that only one, or a few in that organization were bad guys and the rest are totally without blame.  </p>

<p>A great example of this was Star Trek into darkness - watch the film from the point of view of Khan being the good guy and star-fleet being the bad-guys. </p>

<p>Khan becomes a lone hero fighting an evil corrupt organization intent on starting a war with a false flag, and Kirk becomes an idiot who ignores all evidence that the people he&#39;s working for are evil/corrupt and blindly sticks to his &quot;starfleet programming&quot; until the very end, where he happily receives an award from Star-fleet - and we&#39;re left never finding out how deep the conspiracy ran. (Assumingly thousands were involved because the corrupt general obviously didn&#39;t build his giant mega battleship by himself)</p>

<p>Movies like this, which paint the person who would be considered the &quot;good guy&quot; in real life by any sane individual as the bad guy are used to manipulate us into subconsciously supporting, and accepting the real bad guys in real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive actually been thinking about going about my day clad in a tin hat out of a sense of extreme helplessness, because talking about the bs that is going on hasn&#39;t helped and the rate of good things turning to shit seems to be exponentially getting worse.  An unreasonable response to an impossible environment starts to feel right and justified in the face of a terminally corrupt political system that is powered by war, human misery, and greed. In that context I could wear a tin hat as a visible symbol of the contempt I feel for the utterly crazy reality that life has become since the sept. 11 attacks.  Surveillance state, police state, free speech zones, NDAA, patriot act, Homeland Security, TSA, drone strikes on Americans, drone strikes on everybody else, CIA black sites, and extraordinary rendition. What a stunning legacy for the victims of the terrorist attack on Sept. 11...but don&#39;t worry about it, don&#39;t think about it, and above all don&#39;t ever, ever talk about it, because then you have to do something about it. na, just go to the museum in new York and marvel at the new freedom tower, built on top of the remains of those who died in the attack, and don&#39;t forget to buy a fucking shirt while you are there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It took me awhile to learn the answer to this question but alas I feel I have an answer for you. Read this <a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofseco00ingliala">https://archive.org/details/principlesofseco00ingliala</a> this is a summery of the 6 principals here: <a href="http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca/2013/02/6-principals-of-secondary-education.html">http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca/2013/02/6-principals-of-secondary-education.html</a></p>

<p>From the first principal:  1) The adjustive or adaptive function. 
Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can&#39;t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things.</p>

<p>So you see, the reason people trust their governments regardless of what they do is because they have been brainwashed into trusting their authorities regardless of how much they lie ect. Public schooling ensures this.</p>

This woman comes in who just happens to be running for congress here in my state, I used to work with her at some shitty job she was working through college like 10 years ago, its the primaries next week so she is stressed needing a drink.  I wait for a couple of drinks to get into her, and I go over and talk to her about Obamacare and how its basically fascistic in nature etc.  She started to agree with me even though she is hardcore democrat, started agreeing that insurance companies should not be in charge of health care and that if they were taken out of the equation prices would drop dramatically, etc.  So, it works at all levels.

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh no. The government is not an elite club of corrupt millionaires. The fact is the people who say that the conspiracy theories are stupid are the people who have gone to state funded schools and where treated in state funded hospitals (in UK, not US), and who will become lawyers, bankers, and hold positions in the uncorrupt government. It is simply ignorance to say that a western government is corrupt when if you paid any attention to government and politics if people think that corruption exists there are corruption inquiries. 
Do you not understand that the government is made up of people, not a  mysterious organisation that wants to steal from you. 
Furthermore, your accusations always lack cohesion and evidence which   further proves the false nature of conspiracy arguments. </p>

<p>maybe because so many think they have no power to make change, i&#39;m wondering - at this point now in the world, it requires more than yelling in the streets (unless it&#39;s a huge mass of ppl) and weapons would make things worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it&#39;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true. People&#39;s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think people deny the possibility of their government being corrupt.  I think people actually know its corrupt but that it goes so deep that they feel powerless to change it.  That is how I feel.  I have pretty much 100% given up on trying to tell people about it, I have stopped looking and reading about it.  It is depressing.  It sucks reading about how deep the NSA spying goes.  Or how fishy and demonstrably bad the 911 evidence is.  Or how laws are being written that may benefit us now but can have drastically bad effects if abused a certain way in the future.  I hate it.  I just fucking quit it because its depressing.  I hate to admit it but I pretty much just keep my head low, do my job, and just have fun on the weekend with my friends and family.  That is really all I can ask for.  Trying to change our corrupt government is like trying to get rid of Hydra.  You cut off one head and two more emerge.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a terribly screwed up system, and the corruption extends so far it truly can feel hopeless. Unfortunately, I think in the long run, if we continue to ignore it it&#39;s going to end very bad, probably worse than most people can or would like to imagine. That&#39;s why I think we have to work toward improving it, at least on some level, if only in just educating more people little by little. It&#39;s some kind of progress.</p>

<p>The world is bringing about a social/cultural revolution, whether we want it or not. I&#39;d rather at least be somewhat better prepared than entirely ignorant. But, perhaps that&#39;s my own idealism for a better eventual outcome. I&#39;d like to think we&#39;re not entirely doomed after all.</p>
