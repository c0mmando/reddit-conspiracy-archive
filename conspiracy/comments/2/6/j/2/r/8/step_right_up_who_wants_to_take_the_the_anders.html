<p>The Anders Björkman Challenge 1 has been open since March 2010 and there is still (February 2014 - 47 months and 28 000+ downloads of this page later) no successful Challenger/structure! </p>

<p><strong>The prize is €1,000,000!!!!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Come on debunkers, come claim your money!!!</strong></p>

<p><em>The FBI has failed the Anders Björkman Challenge 1.</em></p>

<p><em>Dave Thomas of NMSR, Albuquerque, NM, a dull desert town which looks bankrupt, thought he could win the Challenge after I made a presentation there but failed completely and miserably. Dave thinks that dropping a bag of rice on a kitchen scale (WTC) will crush the scale (WTC), while the bag, evidently, just bounced on the scale, because the scale applied exactly the same impact force on the bag of rice that the bag of rice applied on the scale when contact occurred. Try to crush a kitchen scale (WTC) with the top of another kitchen scale (WTC) to start with ... and note that the top just bounces off the scale, as expected, unless the scale crushes the little top of the scale at impact. John Geohegan also of NMSR thinks one mass impacting one, two, three masses attached to a rod is the solution but forgets that the rod and the masses remain intact. Only some tooth picks broke.</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>

<p>This funny. People are downvoting a chance to win €1,000,000. I wonder why Bazant hasn&#39;t claimed the prize yet? Everyone who is downvote brigading this post should ask themselves why the top comment here hasn&#39;t claimed the prize, shitty website or not. It&#39;s a million euros people! In fact, people should cut and past the top comment response below and send it to Anders Björkman, if the top comment is so correct. Seriously, what do you all have to lose? Go Google Björkman&#39;s offices and contact him.  <strong>You can win the million!!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2.5:</strong>  </p>

<p>Sorry, I linked a JREF challenge by mistake.</p>

<p><a href="http://heiwaco.tripod.com/cv.htm">http://heiwaco.tripod.com/cv.htm</a></p>

<p>Give him a call and take the money.</p>

<p>Anyone who downvotes this is basically saying they don&#39;t need a free million euros.  Who would say that?  I don&#39;t think even someone like Mark Cuban would turn down a free million.  Everyone should be pissed off <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>  is denying everyone a free million with their downvoting.   </p>

<p>This is like saying, &quot;Yeah, we can disprove this theory, and have the evidence, and will upvote it all day long, but don&#39;t really care for an extra million in my bank account.&quot;  Seems legit...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong></p>

<p>So it appears this account has been deleted or shadowbanned.  Whenever I click on my account, it shows nothing when I&#39;m logged out of the system.   I have appealed to the mods, but I&#39;m not allowed to send emails either.  It appears I can only update this post.  </p>

<p>Coincidentally, all my roommates accounts where also deleted/banned with no reason given.  I guess free speech does not exist on the internet anymore.  The conpritards will always have free reign to do whatever they want and brigade anything 9/11 related here.  If you go to downvote there, your account gets banned.  But <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>  gets to do that all day long here with impunity.  One day the truth with come out and there will be no brigading to stop it.</p>

<p>Been a good ride my friends.  Keep up the good fight!!</p>

<p><strong>Final and Last Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Well, 12 hours later and still shadowbanned or deleted.  Every new message I post is not seen by anyone.  I can see everything I post when logged in, but not outside the system.  I can only update this heading for some reason.  </p>

<p>I have come to realize that this sub is not what it appears to be.  I use to think it was one of the last great forums for open debate left on this planet, but sadly not anymore.  After years of seeing every 9/11 related post get downvote brigaded over and over for the official narrative ad nauseum, it has become apparent there is a large coordinated effort to censor the truth.  You can bring David Fucking Chandler on here to do an AMA to debate physics with the r/conspiratards and he will get brigaded.  You can bring 10,000 fully licensed and accredited architects and engineers from <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a> to debate 9/11 physics on here, and they will get downvoted.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me.  This sub is like the new fancy 9/11 museum.  Full of interesting facts and figures that are cool and scary to look at, but once you start asking questions you get booted out by the security guards.  The security guards at the museum are r/conspritard.  They run the museum.  When someone starts asking logical questions, a security guard quickly pops out to correct you.  They ban accounts when they get to close to the truth, like this one.  They will never let truth come out on this website.  They let a 9/11 a post ride high for a bit, then knock it down for the official narrative over and over and over.  This is just another system of control.  This sub is a farce.</p>

<p>-Peace out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His moneys safe: he&#39;s stated that certain measures/dimensions must be same/proportional to the towers. Unfortunately in making models there are various scaling laws to take in to account to get a fair comparison.  </p>

<p>e.g.1 he&#39;s stated that the hieght the upper part falls must be 3.7m...but scaling law:  </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>   In free fall, starting from rest, the time for an object to fall a certain distance scales like the square root of the distance.</li>
<li>   Conversely, in free fall, starting from rest, the distance traveled scales like the square of the time.<br/></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e.s hes already rules out any hope of building a genuine scale model that accurately represents the physics of the towers. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.av8n.com/physics/scaling.htm#main-fall-distance">http://www.av8n.com/physics/scaling.htm#main-fall-distance</a>   </p>

<p>(incidentally: his website does not look like he has €1,000,000 ).</p>

<p>but anyway</p>

<p>If a story is 4 meters high, it will take an object about 0.9 seconds to fall one story, by which time it will be going 9 m/sec.   </p>

<p>So once the collapse starts, the overlying structure will be falling at 9 m/sec by the time it has fallen one story.   </p>

<p>If we crush the collapsing story into rubble half a meter thick and expect the collapse to stop at that point, what kinds of forces are involved? We go from 9 m/sec to zero in half a meter, or 1/18 of a second. However, during that deceleration the velocity is decreasing, and the average velocity turns out to be half of the initial velocity, so the crunch time is 1/9 second. So the acceleration is -9 m/sec divided by 1/9 sec = -81 m/sec2, or about 8 g&#39;s.  </p>

<p>This is the difference between a static load and a dynamic load. In the north tower, <strong>with about ten stories above the impact, the dynamic load was about equivalent not to ten stories but to eighty, nearly the total height of the building.</strong></p>

<p>Gravity gives things a lot of energy very quickly. a 10kg medicine ball sitting on your stomach can be felt; but the same one dropped from 2m hurts...and without any mysterious extra source of energy.  </p>

<p>The only way a collapse of a structure with significant reserve strength can continue is for the static load to be amplified in what is called dynamic loading. Dynamic loading occurs when the impacting object decelerates. For instance, if during an impact the falling object decelerates at twice the rate of gravity, it will impart a load on the object it strikes that is three times its static load. This occurs due to an additional force with an acceleration value twice that of gravity being added to the static load. This amplified load is represented by the equation F = mg + m(deceleration), where mg is the static load and the m(deceleration) term is the additional load due to dynamic effects. <strong>Dynamic loading was postulated in a paper used in the NIST report on the WTC collapses, written by Dr. Zdenek Bazant of Northwestern University. However, Dr. Bazant had not performed any actual measurements to support his theory.</strong></p>

<p>Bazant never performed any measurements to prove his theory.  That&#39;s not science. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you submit your hypothesis to Anders Björkman?  He will gladly pay you €1,000,000.  Please submit a picture of the million euros when you have won the money.  Otherwise you are wrong.  Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you said seems to be right, but you are leaving part of the story out.</p>

<p>The impacts, while providing significant resistance, are very short lived. Essentially, you have an impact when the debris first hits the floor.  This puts significant stress on the columns making them buckle. This is followed by a long period of pushing through the now buckled columns which provide very little resistance. </p>

<p>You end up in a situation where you have a very high resistance about 1% of the time and very low resistance about 99% of the time. And the average resistance of the building ends of being a lot less than the force of gravity.</p>

<p>Then by your description of the Third Law whenever I hit a baseball with a bat, the baseball wouldn&#39;t move because of it applying an equal force back to the bat.</p>

<p>Then why does the baseball still fly away?</p>

<p>The building collapsed because of the increasing momentum of the collapsing floor crashing down onto the floor below it. There&#39;s a lot of potential energy sitting at the top of the building, and even though there was 88 floors underneath the 15 which were the beginning of the collapse, it was 15 floors v. the floor below it, then 16 floors, and so on and so on. All the while the debris is reaching terminal velocity and gaining mass.</p>

<p>Yes, as the floors are crashing down the floors underneath were applying an equal force to the floors above, but saying the building wouldn&#39;t collapse grossly oversimplifies the Third Law of Motion.</p>

<p>We are talking about your ignorance of Newton&#39;s 3rd law, which you demonstrate effortlessly on your own. Here&#39;s the answer. Please pay attention, as every debunker uses the same tired lie of an argument to &quot;dissuade&quot; Newton&#39;s laws of motion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Newton&#39;s third law, for every action force there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction force. Forces always come in pairs - known as &quot;action-reaction force pairs.&quot; Identifying and describing action-reaction force pairs is a simple matter of identifying the two interacting objects and making two statements describing who is pushing on whom and in what direction. For example, consider the interaction between a baseball bat and a baseball.</p>

<p>The baseball forces the bat to the left; the bat forces the ball to the right. Together, these two forces exerted upon two different objects form the action-reaction force pair. </p>

<p>Edit: That retort isn&#39;t a prize winner chap. Asking an internet stranger for basic high school physics answers isn&#39;t winning you the money.</p>

<p>Edit 2: You ask a simple high school physics question (which only exemplifies your lack of knowledge of Newton&#39;s laws of motion) and then go off on a tirade where you show your ignorance based on Newton&#39;s laws of motion. </p>

<p><em>&quot;In August 2004, Underwriters Laboratories evaluated the Pancake Theory by testing models of the floor assemblies used in the WTC buildings. Despite all the previous expert testimony, the floor models did not collapse. NIST reported this in its October 2004 update, in a table of results that clearly showed that the floors did not fail and that, therefore, pancaking was not possible.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;NIST more succinctly stated this again in its June 2005 draft report, saying: &quot;The results established that this type of assembly was capable of sustaining a large gravity load, without collapsing, for a substantial period of time relative to the duration of the fires in any given location on September 11th.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This describes the &#39;pancake&#39; theory and is a fallacy.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about it physically. The bottom floors at any given point are already supporting the weight of the taller floors. The mass of those floors is there and gravity has not changed.</p>

<p>In fact, the top floors will lose some mass as pieces fall to the street below or turn into dust and move elsewhere. The building will actually get lighter, even if only marginally, not heavier.</p>

<p>Now there is kinetic force as you describe, the force of gravity pulling the collapsed floors below. The kinetic force will be absorbed by the floor below which <em>may</em> cause its collapse as well. However, there is a diminishing return on this and while several floors may collapse, it is hardly enough to bring down the entire building.</p>

<p>Mass and gravity remain constant, so the building does not get heavier. Kinetic force can arise from a floor collapsing but there are diminishing returns, meaning only a couple floors <em>may</em> collapse, if at all.</p>

<p>Many people try to argue otherwise but it is simply untrue and physically impossible. In modern recorded history there has never been a steel building to collapse due to fire. There also has never been a severe floor collapse in a steel building due to a fire. Yes, planes this and that.. but it would not have collapsed the WTC... and then there&#39;s building 7...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have a common misunderstanding here so I&#39;ll try and clear it up. I find its easy to think of it this way.</p>

<p>You have two forces a play, the force of gravity and the resistance of the building. The force of gravity we could assume is approximately constant and the resistance of the building could vary quite a bit through a floor, but we could calculate an average resistance through the building. </p>

<p>The question is, is the force of gravity greater than the average resistance of the building?  If yes, than the collapse progresses all the way down, if not, the collapse slows down and stops.</p>

<p>This means that you can make a blanket statement saying that any building will resist a total collapse or that pancaking is impossible. It is completely dependent on a number of factors regarding the building in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thanks, I think I found the relevant part where he talks about the downward acceleration and how it implies that the applied force from the top of the building is less than its own weight and therefore should not be able to crush the bottom of the building. (Correct me if I&#39;m wrong)</p>

<p>It seems that he makes an incorrect assumption in his analysis. He assumes that the resistance provided by the building is constant which is not correct. Every time a new floor is impacted, there is an impact force or an &quot;impulse&quot;. Each impulse is very short lived but causes a very high force to be exerted onto the columns below (and also to the upper section of the building), and a corresponding deceleration of the upper section. This force causes the initiation of buckling of the columns below.</p>

<p>After the impulse, the building continues downward as the now buckled columns provide little resistance. </p>

<p>These impulses are so brief that the deceleration that accompanies them has a negligible effect on the downward velocity. What the speaker is looking at is the average resistance of the building, this is the average between the brief impulses and the crushing of buckled columns. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why he missed this, whether it&#39;s an innocent mistake or intentionally misleading, but it&#39;s a pretty big oversight, that in my opinion, negates the paper.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you can see how this building can collapse and not violate Newtons 3rd law now.</p>

<p>I circled all close to negative posts in red and negative posts in green (sorry, was done in a hurry). According to this, a sub with roughly 100k less subscribers has a higher downvote ratio and a much higher negative ratio. </p>

<p>So in that regard <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &#39;s new posts are definitely not being insta-downvoted unless you consider <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_how_is_a_submission.27s_score_determined.3F">Reddit&#39;s anti-spambot fuzzing</a> vote manipulation.</p>

It&#39;s really frustrating to post something, no matter what it is, then immediately gets vote brigade once cross posted to r/conspiratard.  I fear if this trend continues reddit will go the way of digg.  It&#39;s only a matter of time now.  :-(</p>

<p>This is what the admins refer to as a &#39;vote brigade&#39; or &#39;vote manipulation&#39; and will shadowban users for doing so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t though, a vote brigade requires a specific call to arms, the admins are pretty annoyed at both subs equally as they both link to things and go vote when they&#39;re linked. Conspiratard just links to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more than visa versa. It&#39;s a reddit-wide problem imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thanks, I think I found the relevant part where he talks about the downward acceleration and how it implies that the applied force from the top of the building is less than its own weight and therefore should not be able to crush the bottom of the building. (Correct me if I&#39;m wrong)</p>

<p>It seems that he makes an incorrect assumption in his analysis. He assumes that the resistance provided by the building is constant which is not correct. Every time a new floor is impacted, there is an impact force or an &quot;impulse&quot;. Each impulse is very short lived but causes a very high force to be exerted onto the columns below (and also to the upper section of the building), and a corresponding deceleration of the upper section. This force causes the initiation of buckling of the columns below.</p>

<p>After the impulse, the building continues downward as the now buckled columns provide little resistance. </p>

<p>These impulses are so brief that the deceleration that accompanies them has a negligible effect on the downward velocity. What the speaker is looking at is the average resistance of the building, this is the average between the brief impulses and the crushing of buckled columns. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why he missed this, whether it&#39;s an innocent mistake or intentionally misleading, but it&#39;s a pretty big oversight, that in my opinion, negates the paper.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you can see how this building can collapse and not violate Newtons 3rd law now.</p>
