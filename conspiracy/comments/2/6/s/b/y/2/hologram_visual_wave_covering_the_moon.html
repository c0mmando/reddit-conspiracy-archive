       Not sure if this is a repost, but I found these videos pretty interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaving aside any attempts to explain what is seen you gotta admit that the wave thing looks pretty weird, and that Crrow777 makes a very good point demonstrating that it is NOT a camera effect.

       I think this is an awesome idea. That the hologram is used to hide the true surface of the moon.

       The problem I see with this is that it wouldn't be any more difficult to simply build your base on the far side of the moon, where secrecy would be assured without the need for absurdly massive holograms.

       I would say, unlike other responses to this comment, it would be more an issue of communication rather than no sunlight. Even during the Apollo missions there was a period of communication blackout every time the astronauts went around the moon.

       Very cool. I think the first step would be for him to set up a second camera and compare what each one caught. Then have a friend record from another location at least a few KM away so that the two can be compared.

       This is actually an extremely easy one to explain.  He's using a motorized tracking telescope - It moves as celestial bodies move.  One of the servos in his telescope vibrates slightly, probably under specific loads (angle of the telescope and how much weight is being shifted).  This causes a distortion in the image.

       the ripples in your example are aligned with the frame of the picture, however, on the videos of the moon, the wave is not aligned with the frame of the camera, sometimes it comes from one angle, sometimes from another...

       That's also easy.  He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescope.

        Scroll down to Field Rotation

       Although he goes out of his way to show this isn't a camera effect, he does not argue that this isn't an atmospheric effect. As he's looking at the moon through the atmosphere, I'd be inclined to believe there's an atmospheric distortion before I jump to the fantastic conclusion that the moon is a hologram.

       I would think the same except for the waves coming in almost identical doubles every time.  That leads me to believe, like OP, that the effect is technological in nature in some way, except I am more inclined to believe it lies more on his end than the moon's end.

       The wave timings aren't exact or even precise or even close matches to each other. Each wave is "timed" differently according to the source. I agree, seems like some sort of technological issue on his end. Its probably a camera problem or an effect he achieved in editing (fake?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, we must ask why right? Why would the moon be covered in a hologram? What would 'they' want to hide? A super space weapon to zap enemy nations? Why not simply put that in LEO on a satellite, wouldn't that be easier to hide instead of covering the front of the moon in a hologram? Which, I feel like I don't need to point out here, is not possible by human standards. The projector or network of projectors you would need would be insane. There would be too many failures in such a system, it would also need an impossible amount of power.

       Yeah, I guess I should have focused more on how they swept from the same direction both times.  And I noticed the second one (I believe it was) was not as much of a crisp line as a gradual blurring, and I think the second wave was the same style.  But you're right, the speed was different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that I can't imagine what would such a large undertaking could possibly be worth it.  Besides a Truman Show theory, maybe.  Possibly OP lives in a huge dome, and the moon is projected on the surface of it.  And we're all actors in his show.  And I'm probably going to get fired for saying all this...whups...

       Probably not, the line is quite small compared to the size of the moon. The moon is also bright when looked at with a naked eye, so a faint line like that wouldn't show up. If the line made a shadow or something it could show, but a distortion like that, I doubt it'd be visible without some form of optics.

       That's interesting because i would come to the opposite conclusion. Consider the cone joining the lens to the circumference of the moon and then the subset of that cone available for the atmosphere to create the effect, it ain't much... as for the atmosphere, we're looking at seemingly randomly moving gases, a highly turbulent system where straight lines can only be averaged over long distances with lower resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This being said, holograms need projectors, and tides need moon. My occam's razor is that his camera shifts the glass of the lens back and forth (see formula 1 footage when it's raining) and there happens to be a build up of dust and crap on the glass where the translation stops, best part is he probably has no clue if that's what's going on.

       You're right, it really ain't much. Let me rephrase then, it very like is something at the atmosphere or in the camera ;) If it did curve around the moon, then it'd be weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because the cone is small, there's a larger probability of something straight happening, if it was a huge cone it'd be full of random stuff. I have absolutely no idea what could produce such a heat / pressure wave, or whatever that could refract like that, except large explosions, which then again is quite unlikely here too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you mean the incar footage when the camera rotates the outer cover of the camera to keep it clean? Or something else? If you mean that, I see your point, but can't figure what in a normal digital camera could produce similar results. Explain a bit more, maybe I'll get it.
      </p>

       Edit: could a passing plane produce a wave of hot air or something?

       that's exactly what i meant for the camera, maybe it's an automated thing with a rare trigger when looking at the moon without rain. I figured there could be a deposit of water/oil/dust on the very part of the glass that shuffles from side to side, and i assume there would be some kind of cleaning tissue where the glass slides in, if this can form a regular bulge of semi translucent stuff on the glass, perhaps it could displace light like we see in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the plane, it's not crazy but i would expect more lines, like a boat on a lake, and even then, i still think everything involving air is complicated for the turbulent reasons i mentioned earlier, this line is too damn regular for nature, small scale optic phenomenon or electronic disruptions could probably explain this infinitely earlier than gas turbulence models could. If you really want to go the gas route, you probably want to focus your attention on the room he might be in (or indeed, the inside of the camera).

       No, this was too linear to be a mirage. I'd consider this to be some kind of lag within
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_pixel_sensor">
        the pixel sensor
       </a>
       and it's controllig chip.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:Shit, who knows, maybe it's something to do with the atmosphere being altered - picture the lines we see in the video as a movement of a wave of compressed air. Considering how much we are being lied to these days, you just can't be sure of anything. I'd only be surprised if it turned out that the scientific community was united enough (globally) to perpetuate the lie/conspiracy.

       While I am thinking it may be some effect located on his end instead of on the moon's end, I'm not sure if it's a mirage.  I say that because of how it's always two distinct waves that are very very similar in nature.  If it was just a mirage, why would it always come in twos, and in almost identical patterns?  Shouldn't he just as likely (maybe more likely) capture an event with just one wave?
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes me more likely to think it's something to do with his electronics he used to capture the video.  Although the waves coming in different directions and width of waves seems to go against that idea.  I would think his waves would be much more uniform if it was just his electronics acting up.

       With image stabilization you see a stable window which is a part of a larger jerky window. If the lock-in target for the stable window moves and hits the limits of the larger jerky window then you have to move to a new lock-in target.

       That wouldn't actually accomplish anything. You would never notice that while looking at the moon with the naked eye. Of course on a hot night where the moon is big on the horizon, you might see other atmospheric effects with your naked eye.

       And what exactly is a high/low pressure atmospheric boundary line? What causes this? Why is it not visible to the naked eye? Why hasnt this been reported more widely?

       The video you watched here is a high resolution, zoomed video. Take a picture yourself of the moon to get an idea of the difference in what the naked eye can see and what a 12" telescope can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       A high/low  pressure atmospheric boundary line is just what I said it is: the boundary between a high and low pressure weather system (i.e., a cold and warm weather system.) Colder air contains more molecules per cubic meter than warmer air. If you have a cold front moving in, the effect the air has on light transmission changes. The boundary is where the high pressure front pushes the low pressure front away. If you happen to be zooming in a telescope at the right time, you may be lucky enough to actually witness the front  moving across the sky above you, causing the effect we witness in the video. This is why they're all different, approaching from different directions, with different velocities (time) and different intensities. Because weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever seen the heat from a camp fire, the sun on tarmac or the hood of a car in summer, you'll know what I'm saying: temperature in the atmosphere affects light transmission.

       It doesn't explain the apparent duality, but there is no "wrapping effect." Since there's nothing in the background to be effected, only the moon itself is. That's just an optical illusion.

       Since this thread is gaining some attention, I'd like to also draw everyone's attention to Richard C. Hoagland's work in cross-referencing Moon photos, critique of NASA and JPL, and geographic Moon analysis. His recent evaluation of China's Change-3 rover support his evidence and claim that there are geometric glass structures on the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also goes into geographic analysis of the Moon's surface (as well as many other solar system bodies), attempting to reveal what he believes is evidence of a whole solar-systemic empire, now decrepit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend his book Dark Mission, and suggest getting to know his detailed research thoroughly. The combined fabric of evidence he has discovered, found, and knit is warm in it's esoteric knowledge.

       I mean earth atmosphere. The line you see travelling in the video doesn't seem to curve around the moon so it's unlikely it's there. If it was a projection thing, it would've curved unless it was being projected just next door from the guy filming it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what phenomenon, but it looks very similar to a pressure wave. Just saying you can't say it can't be explained, not quite many have even tried. Atmospheric phenomena haven't been ruled out I think.

       I don't know - I've gotta say that the OP looks almost nothing like that to me.  The outline of the moon doesn't change at all - it isn't a distorted image, it's the same image with a "wave" flowing over it; always in groups of two.  Never more, never less.

       Again, I'm not saying it isn't

       possibly added post process, i'm going to wait untill more videos of the moon hologram emerge from other sources.  also, i did not get a sense that it is wrapping around the moon.

       Unless he can film this outside of the atmosphere I do not believe anything he says.   He doesn't mention anyone else being able to record these "Events"  Not sure a hologram would roll like he thinks they would, but that is my opinion.   If someone is going to fake a BIG ass moon for some STUPID asshole reason for MILLIONS of dollars they are not going to leave some ASSHAT with a camera to find them out.

       I would think the same except for the waves coming in almost identical doubles every time.  That leads me to believe, like OP, that the effect is technological in nature in some way, except I am more inclined to believe it lies more on his end than the moon's end.
