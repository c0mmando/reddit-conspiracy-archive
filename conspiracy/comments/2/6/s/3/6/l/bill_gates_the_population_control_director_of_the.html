       Gates made his remarks to the invitation-only Long Beach, California TED2010 Conference, in a speech titled, "
       <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates">
        Innovating to Zero!
       </a>
       " Along with the scientifically absurd proposition of reducing manmade CO2 emissions worldwide to zero by 2050, approximately four and a half minutes into the talk, Gates declares, "First we got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent."
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary focus of his multi-billion dollar Gates Foundation is vaccinations, especially in Africa and other underdeveloped countries. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a founding member of the GAVI Alliance (Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunization) in partnership with the World Bank, WHO and the vaccine industry. The goal of GAVI is to vaccinate every newborn child in the developing world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is total of
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;TransSchema=title&amp;term=contraceptive+vaccine">
        57 research papers listed on PubMed
       </a>
       relating to contraceptive vaccines, dating as far back as 1977. No doubt a researcher entering a range of different search terms could come up with many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       One paper in particular, published in 1989, written by G.P. Talwar and R. Raghupathy titled "Anti-Fertility Vaccines" appears to suggest that they are. The authors stated:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Vaccines are under development for the control of fertility in males and females. This review discusses developments in anti-fertility vaccines at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.
       </p>
       <p>
        A single injection procedure for the sterilization or castration of male animals depending on the site at which the injection is given, has passed through field testing and is expected to be on the market in the near future."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        Unless you have a sample of his vaccine with you and have empirical evidence showing the composition, there is no way anyone can confirm there are no infertility agents in his vaccines.
       </em>

        GMO, glyphosate and population reduction.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO crops have never been proven safe for human or animal consumption. Moreover, they are inherently genetically 'unstable' as they are an unnatural product of introducing a foreign bacteria such as Bacillus Thuringiensis (Bt) or other material into the DNA of a given seed to change its traits. Perhaps equally dangerous are the 'paired' chemical herbicides sold as a mandatory part of a GMO contract, such as Monsanto's Roundup, the most widely used such herbicide in the world. It contains highly toxic glyphosate compounds that have been independently tested and proven to exist in toxic concentrations in GMO applications far above that safe for humans or animals. Tests show that tiny amounts of glyphosate compounds would do damage to a human umbilical, embryonic and placental cells in a pregnant woman drinking the ground water near a GMO field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spermicides hidden in GMO corn provided to starving Third World populations through the generosity of the Gates' foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and Kofi Annan's AGRA or vaccines that contain undisclosed sterilization agents are just two documented cases of using vaccines or GMO seeds to "reduce population."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Isn't it a really, really ridiculous coincidence that a multibillionaire is activelly involved in 2 mega-industries that have questionable products heavily deployed in the third word linked, even if equivocally, to infertility when he preaches about reducing global population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines and GMOs are incredibly controversial topics with 0 consensus on it's legit purposes and uses. Bill is involved financially in both of them, and both are made use of in the third world, where the rest of the world cannot see the consequences unless you are there.

       You been fooled by someone quoting Bill Gates out of context.  Bill Gates gave a speech where he said if you decrease child mortality in poor countries, women respond by have less babies, because they don't have to worry about the children they have dying.  He claims the birth rate drops so much that saving babies actually decreases the population expansion. So things like health care and vaccines decrease the population by people
       <em>
        voluntarily
       </em>
       having less babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 4 minutes into the talk, Gates declares, "The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent."    If you take this quote
       <em>
        out of context
       </em>
       it sounds like Gates is saying that vaccines cause infertility.

       So reduction of the birth rate to sustainable levels is a bad thing?  Family planning is a hugely important step in the development of an economy and society.   Why exactly would one think without even a spread of evidence that the Gates foundation would be tampering with much needed vaccinations?  There is also no reason to conflate GMOs and vaccines.  There is consensus on the use of vaccines in preventive medicine.  GMO are indeed part of an active debate, but that is a separate  issue.
