       Today I'm going to look at
       <a href="/r/montageparodies">
        /r/montageparodies
       </a>
       . It started off as a subreddit for mocking cod and halo montages. Seems harmless right? Well recently there's been a trend for mocking conspiracy theories and there's been a gradual introduction of depreciating 'loomynarty' memes in the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       This clearly has nothing to do with cod montages so has this trend become so prevalent? I think someone clearly has an agenda.
       <a href="http://youtu.be/P9RkCTsnb8o">
        This
       </a>
       is currently the fifth most upvoted video there. It doesn't even attempt to be some sort of gaming parody. It's just a flat out mockery of 'conspiracy logic'. It's a shame that even innocuous subreddits aren't safe.

       Okay but do the viewers of montage parodies and conspiracy theories really overlap? I think you're seeing a community have a go at enjoying an inside joke and feeling offended cause you feel targetted, and while that's true you're jumping at shadows to grasp at straws when it's really not anything. Who cares if a bunch of gamer-mocking people feel like mocking conspiracy theorists as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       What can you do? Make good video game montages to go with rambling youtube speeches about secret alien invasions and takeovers of society? Cause I mean that could be pretty cool, if done correctly.

       Perhaps the reasons you list are exactly why it's being done on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fuck with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the tricks, it is a game after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to defeat us any way they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way then to do insane things like start to post conspiracy mocking videos on a cod/halo montage mocking forum?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just so crazy that it will more than likely attract at least one of the 233,234 "free thinkers" in here ( not everybody here is a free thinker, and I'm not just talking about shills/trolls ) and that they will post some self.conspiracy post about "the grand scheme to infiltrate every kind of subreddit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's reveal the grand scheme ( that is their actual plan, and they are using the method of revelation to make it known ) by doing something so crazy that none of them will believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're professionals and this is our fucking job, we can easily study the sites these teenage basement dwelling fucks go to ( 4chan , reddit , ifunny , youporn ) and imitate user behaviors from those sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can easily trick them into thinking "it's just trolling" or "it's just an inside joke in a kind little loving subreddit devoted to MOCKING PEOPLE".
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I really think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they've subverted the youth ( because they all joke about smoking weed now and yolo swag blaze it because my generation all smokes weed [I'm 24] and plays cs:go and shit with them online. ) and that this may be a genuine post, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe
       <a href="/u/nicepizza111">
        /u/nicepizza111
       </a>
       is a plant and this is actually a clever set up designed to make people look more paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're just trying to make us all over-think things and ramble on and on about any and every possible thing that it could be and drive us all fucking insane, I mean are you reading what I'm typing? lol

       What is the connection between 4chan, your apparent use of 14-18 year old slang "u wot m8 b gud" and such, and mocking of all "conspiracy theorists"?

       So you're basically mocking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       and "conspiracy theorists" and the NWO and the Illuminati yes?

       You don't actually give a fuck about sharing the truth of how a few extremely powerful individuals control a majority of the world through their global corporate and political positions do you?

       I mean seriously, less than 1% of the global population controls over 90% of global wealth, so how can anybody seriously dismiss that there is a small secretive cabal of people who are organized and regularly meet and engage in business with eachother to ensure their control over the world?

       The Bavarian Illuminati are a factually real group who you can look up, and they have been in America since it's founding, which is where they gained their position towards the top of the pyramid.

       Perhaps the reasons you list are exactly why it's being done on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fuck with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the tricks, it is a game after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to defeat us any way they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way then to do insane things like start to post conspiracy mocking videos on a cod/halo montage mocking forum?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just so crazy that it will more than likely attract at least one of the 233,234 "free thinkers" in here ( not everybody here is a free thinker, and I'm not just talking about shills/trolls ) and that they will post some self.conspiracy post about "the grand scheme to infiltrate every kind of subreddit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's reveal the grand scheme ( that is their actual plan, and they are using the method of revelation to make it known ) by doing something so crazy that none of them will believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're professionals and this is our fucking job, we can easily study the sites these teenage basement dwelling fucks go to ( 4chan , reddit , ifunny , youporn ) and imitate user behaviors from those sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can easily trick them into thinking "it's just trolling" or "it's just an inside joke in a kind little loving subreddit devoted to MOCKING PEOPLE".
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I really think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they've subverted the youth ( because they all joke about smoking weed now and yolo swag blaze it because my generation all smokes weed [I'm 24] and plays cs:go and shit with them online. ) and that this may be a genuine post, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe
       <a href="/u/nicepizza111">
        /u/nicepizza111
       </a>
       is a plant and this is actually a clever set up designed to make people look more paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're just trying to make us all over-think things and ramble on and on about any and every possible thing that it could be and drive us all fucking insane, I mean are you reading what I'm typing? lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I copy paste this to you again, or do you get it now?

       That is serious, I am 24, and I know how hard my generation was subverted from being good upstanding rational logically thinking people, and I feel it's even worse in the generations below me based on the attitudes I see presented from them.

       I really do kind of agree with some of that sentiment of this current young generation being kind of ridiculous in comparison to mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pop music has always been shit, with exceptions because there are always some good pop songs every year that aren't just bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This current pop music though this freaking EDM garbage, it's like UGH, please, stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same thing that happens every time. Something is underground for a while and then when it enters the mainstream it just BLOWS UP and a wave of shit ensures.

       They parody everything, and in this case, the "loominarty" gags is because of the tidal waves of conspiracy videos that spawned from Call of Duty: Black Ops.

       Could you elaborate on this at all?

      <p>
       I'm not denying your claim, but curious about why it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the gist of what people were saying is "illuminati" about COD:BO?

       In COD:BO you play as Alex Mason.
      </p>
      <p>
       A typical trope in call of duty is that when you begin a mission, you usually see the name of the mission (level), the name of the character you're controlling and some other unimportant information, like the current time. In COD:BO, that trope "advanced" into erasing verbose information on that "debrief" with black tape, often obscuring the name into "A. Mason". One mission in particular is named "Free Mason".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most videos showcased certain elements of the game's design, like one zone in particular had a "chess-tile" flooring, and people started saying things about "duality" and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some videos, however, were just grasping at straws. For example, at the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF-Hb1UUGXI#t=210">
        3:30 mark
       </a>
       , this video showcases a vehicle that when blown up, has a burned texture on the car's hood, which the uploader somehow processed it as the all seeing eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't remember any more examples right now, but i'll try searching for one video that i actually enjoyed watching about the subject. I'll post it if i can find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        edit
       </em>
       I couldn't find that video, but if you search for "Black Ops Conspiracy", "Black Ops Illuminati" or "Black Ops Submliminal Messages" you can see the thousands of videos i spoke about.

       Thank you for the overview, that's very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the game is made by free thinking adults, I wouldn't doubt that some of these things are done on purpose so as to drive up sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn't have "conspiracy theorists" talking about COD:BO if there was no reason for them to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you get them all to talk about it and further promote the game by giving it more publicity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw in shit that references those things like naming your character Alex Mason and having a mission where you must "Free Mason".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is the true "conspiracy", game devs purposely put this shit in their games to drive up sales, plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       They more than know they're making a futuristic war game involving global politics, so they'd really be stupid not to put some "conspiratorial" elements into the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the best game franchises dealing with global political conspiracies is the Metal Gear series.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for continuing this dialog with me, I really appreciate your kindness here.

        Jesus Christ the reason the car's hood looks like that is because of mirrored textures. Sometimes dev's get lazy or want to save space and only do half so the other side show the same thing but mirrored.

       The Bavarian Illuminati infiltrated Freemasonry as well, which is why that connection exists.
