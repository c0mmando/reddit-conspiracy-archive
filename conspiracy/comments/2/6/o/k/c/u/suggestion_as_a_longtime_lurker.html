        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, yes, this is an alt account that I very rarely use, but I have been lurking here for about 6 months now.</p>

<p>So, I have noticed that people on here tend to take any criticism or skepticism of their belief and regard it as a shill and disregard their opinion entirely. </p>

<p>What I would advise is for you to think of things in this way. I would think that the majority of people here agree that the Moon Landing Hoax (apologies to people who believe in the theory, but it&#39;s, in my opinion, one of the most well proven major events that people still think is a conspiracy) is ridiculous and the USA did in fact land on the moon in 1969. </p>

<p>Yet, there are people who insist that it didn&#39;t happen and most of you probably look at them and think &quot;Psh. Wow, comeon, really? There is so much evidence against that.&quot;</p>

<p>For the most part, a lot of people view your theories how you view Moon Landing Hoax theorists.</p>

<p>So, from now on assume that everyone looks at your theory as the Moon Landing Hoax. Give them a reason to believe you, and also don&#39;t  disregard anyone who questions you. </p>

<p>As a final thought, I don&#39;t believe the majority of the conspiracies posted here, but I enjoy reading and learning about them if nothing else to try to learn more and to make myself critically think about events.</p>

<p><strong>Tldr; I like reading/viewing your views/opinions even if I don&#39;t agree with them, but please reconsider how you attempt to persuade people.</strong></p>

<p>Sorry for the long message :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need to be defensive. I think the whole point here is to exchange ideas and contemplate their possibilities. What I meant (and where I thought you were going with your post) is when you choose to believe one thing it doesn&#39;t mean you have to disbelieve all others. A person can choose to believe a certain scenario is more likely, but attacking other theories doesn&#39;t make one&#39;s choice more right.</p>

<p>I see conspiracy theorizing (or critical thinking) as an unlimited imaginative process to seek possibility rather than a logical process to find answers with limited evidence. The problem is lack of evidence, not lack of consensus.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the story is how Buzz Aldrin used a felt tip pen to fix the circuit breaker that got him off of the moon... in the &quot;Eagle&quot; which looked like it was made of cellophane, gold wrapping paper and some duct tape.  Surely it would&#39;ve been able to blast off from the moon, travel the 230,000+ miles through space, and re-enter the atmosphere with nary a hiccup.  And all using a computer system that would&#39;ve made my 1998 nokia flip phone look like a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Ctrl+F &quot;Skin Dose&quot; to see the table showing the radiation rating for each Apollo mission. You&#39;ll see that they range from .16 to 1.14 - In comparison, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission has set the safety limit at 5 per year for workers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been doing this for a long time and most people who &quot;criticize&quot; us know nothing about our stance, they usually come in here with a set bias. </p>

<p>For example there are people who come in here and tell me that they believe wtc7 was brought down symmetrically in free fall speed through localized office fires... And they don&#39;t need to provide any evidence for this claim, somehow it just happened, the NIST report even omitted building 7 and only later included it. It has done simulations for which they didn&#39;t release any of the variables and numbers they used. They also didn&#39;t include an internal model of how this destruction could have happened and yet its us conspiracy theorist that have to spoon feed you every little detail about our theories while these supposed skeptics don&#39;t seem to need proof for their own goddamn bias.</p>

<p>The thing is that what you call &#39;skeptics&#39; aren&#39;t skeptical at all, they believe their own version with far less proof than the version we construct. There are plenty of scenarios where this happens. Sandy Hook for instance, what proof do you have that this event happened the way it did? You don&#39;t have any proof just a media show to which you point and say &quot;aha! see it happened!&quot;. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Robbie Parker is laughing his fucking ass off on camera before going into character and the skeptics start trying to convince me that laughing is simply a way of cooping with the death of your child. So why did he go into character then? Why did he laugh when he thought the camera&#39;s were off and only start &quot;crying&quot; when he read the script?</p>

<p>I have been talking about this stuff for so long I know exactly what kind of person I&#39;m talking to and when that person will never change his mind. Do the research yourself. People who don&#39;t do the research don&#39;t want to know its as simple as that. And you have no right to blame your ignorance on the fact that we aren&#39;t patient enough to explain the same thing over and over again. </p>

<p>And next time provide concrete fucking examples cause Iv heard many people claim this and I simply don&#39;t see it. So please provide a link to an example. </p>

<p>Can I get an example of &quot;so much evidence&quot;?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">Lunar Laser Ranging experiment</a> is evidence of mans capabilities of sending a shuttle to land on the moon. </p>

<p>If we couldn&#39;t land on the moon, that retroreflector wouldn&#39;t be there. We know the retroreflector is there because scientists the world over can and have &#39;pinged&#39; the retroreflector at their leisure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep asking people to prove a negative.  Assert your positive belief and see if it stands up to scrutiny.  There is plenty of knowledge outside of flashy youtube videos.</p>
