       First off, yes, this is an alt account that I very rarely use, but I have been lurking here for about 6 months now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I have noticed that people on here tend to take any criticism or skepticism of their belief and regard it as a shill and disregard their opinion entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would advise is for you to think of things in this way. I would think that the majority of people here agree that the Moon Landing Hoax (apologies to people who believe in the theory, but it's, in my opinion, one of the most well proven major events that people still think is a conspiracy) is ridiculous and the USA did in fact land on the moon in 1969.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, there are people who insist that it didn't happen and most of you probably look at them and think "Psh. Wow, comeon, really? There is so much evidence against that."
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, a lot of people view your theories how you view Moon Landing Hoax theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, from now on assume that everyone looks at your theory as the Moon Landing Hoax. Give them a reason to believe you, and also don't  disregard anyone who questions you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a final thought, I don't believe the majority of the conspiracies posted here, but I enjoy reading and learning about them if nothing else to try to learn more and to make myself critically think about events.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tldr; I like reading/viewing your views/opinions even if I don't agree with them, but please reconsider how you attempt to persuade people.
       </strong>

      <p>
       Sorry for the long message :)

       I agree with your direction but I don't see the need to be definitive. For instance: I don't agree or disagree with the moon landing conspiracy because I've seen evidence from both sides and I think both are plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Topics of conspiracies are often meant to be secrets. It doesn't surprise me at all that many things don't fit our understanding.

       No need to be defensive. I think the whole point here is to exchange ideas and contemplate their possibilities. What I meant (and where I thought you were going with your post) is when you choose to believe one thing it doesn't mean you have to disbelieve all others. A person can choose to believe a certain scenario is more likely, but attacking other theories doesn't make one's choice more right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see conspiracy theorizing (or critical thinking) as an unlimited imaginative process to seek possibility rather than a logical process to find answers with limited evidence. The problem is lack of evidence, not lack of consensus.

       Also, realize that we don't go into their threads trying to change their opinion. For some reason, a lot of people join this sub just to change our opinions. It's like telling someone homo-marriage should be illegal. It's like they're uncomfortable knowing we think a certain and they must "show us the light." Personally, i they should just unsubcribe if they don't like what we talk about here. Otherwise, it's the same as gay bashing IMO.

       I'd rather start with what compelling evidence you found that we did send a man to the moon.  As far as I know, it is merely NASA footage.  Not even the original footage, which has been erased, but remastered footage.

       It's simply unfair to expect someone to prove something didn't happen, like proving man hasn't walked on Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think something happened, but have no reason to believe that it did.  How am I to show you that it did not if you have no falsifiable claims about what you believe is true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence: if you have no reason to believe man walked on the moon, I have no means of dismantling that belief.  You hold it on faith alone.

       The moon landing is fun because there's no compelling evidence whatsoever that it happened, it's all video Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with the fact that it almost entirely inconsequential whether or not man has walked there and you get some interesting reactions.

      <p>
       It never fails to amaze me.

       I get this rabid, froth-mouthed reaction anytime I even attempt to suggest that we may not have gone.  It's completely absurd.

       One of my favorite parts of the story is how Buzz Aldrin used a felt tip pen to fix the circuit breaker that got him off of the moon... in the "Eagle" which looked like it was made of cellophane, gold wrapping paper and some duct tape.  Surely it would've been able to blast off from the moon, travel the 230,000+ miles through space, and re-enter the atmosphere with nary a hiccup.  And all using a computer system that would've made my 1998 nokia flip phone look like a quantum computer.

       Something like that.  Since launching a pound of payload out of earths gravity well is so cheap, we brought all sorts of fun things like go-karts and sporting equipment, and even spare cameras, specially made robotic tripods, and spare video transmission gear.

       If we couldn't land on the moon, that retroreflector wouldn't be there. We know the retroreflector is there because scientists the world over can and have 'pinged' the retroreflector at their leisure.

       Do you know how a retro reflector works?  Hardly the sort of device that requires careful human placement.

       In fact, the Russians had sent a rover with a retroreflector as well.

      <p>
       Not that it was entirely necessary, as the distance to the moon was measured by laser before any craft had landed there.

       Nobody disputes the presence of retro-reflectors on the lunar surface. The Russians also placed retro-reflectors on the moon during their

       Lunokhod 2 mission - it's still working to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of contention is whether human beings have landed on the moon, and the hackneyed "lunar ranging argument" is not sufficient to prove that. Unless you are trying to promote a brand new conspiracy theory that the Russians also sent men to the moon?

       I'm sure there are some that do. It helps to weed them out.

       It should be obvious to you now that retro-reflectors can, and have been, placed on the moon remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not the technological know-how. It is whether humans could pass unharmed through the extremely high radiation levels of the Van Allen belts. Clearly, the Russians didn't think so.

       The van Allen belts were of course a concern, but the exposure time as well as the shuttles shielding protected the astronauts from harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm on my phone, so I can't cite my sources right now but the level of radiation they were exposed to was less than the yearly allowed level for nuclear power plant workers.

       Ctrl+F "Skin Dose" to see the table showing the radiation rating for each Apollo mission. You'll see that they range from .16 to 1.14 - In comparison, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission has set the safety limit at 5 per year for workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it might be undesirable to get that much exposure in a short period of time, but it's not like it's anywhere near enough to harm you during or shortly after the mission was complete.

       I am aware of this, and it contains an inherent paradox. If someone does not believe that the Apollo missions took humans to the moon, then any "data" that Nasa published about radiation exposure during those contested missions is not going to hold much weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nasa faked the moon landings, then they would obviously have to provide some fake radiation data to counter the Van Allen belt skeptics.

       NASA had previously sent detectors through the belt to measure the levels, so it's not like the moon landing missions were the first times they measured it.

       We have been doing this for a long time and most people who "criticize" us know nothing about our stance, they usually come in here with a set bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example there are people who come in here and tell me that they believe wtc7 was brought down symmetrically in free fall speed through localized office fires... And they don't need to provide any evidence for this claim, somehow it just happened, the NIST report even omitted building 7 and only later included it. It has done simulations for which they didn't release any of the variables and numbers they used. They also didn't include an internal model of how this destruction could have happened and yet its us conspiracy theorist that have to spoon feed you every little detail about our theories while these supposed skeptics don't seem to need proof for their own goddamn bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that what you call 'skeptics' aren't skeptical at all, they believe their own version with far less proof than the version we construct. There are plenty of scenarios where this happens. Sandy Hook for instance, what proof do you have that this event happened the way it did? You don't have any proof just a media show to which you point and say "aha! see it happened!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile Robbie Parker is laughing his fucking ass off on camera before going into character and the skeptics start trying to convince me that laughing is simply a way of cooping with the death of your child. So why did he go into character then? Why did he laugh when he thought the camera's were off and only start "crying" when he read the script?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been talking about this stuff for so long I know exactly what kind of person I'm talking to and when that person will never change his mind. Do the research yourself. People who don't do the research don't want to know its as simple as that. And you have no right to blame your ignorance on the fact that we aren't patient enough to explain the same thing over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And next time provide concrete fucking examples cause Iv heard many people claim this and I simply don't see it. So please provide a link to an example.

       Actually, it was the condescending and thoughtless way in which I dismissed anyone that questioned the moon landings that really made me re-evaluate what I thought and why. Maybe you too could take a long hard look at "how you view Moon Landing Hoax theorists", and why that is.

       If you love learning about them then why aren't you looking for them yourself? There is a paradox in your speaking going on, on one hand you make yourself out to be some kind of curious enthusiast and yet you want us to give you the information. Isn't seeking for information kind of the natural result of curiosity?

       I never go on boards to ask people to explain shit to me, I google it myself and start skipping link from link until I get an image of what the running counter theory is.

       What possible missions could they perform that they would want kept secret from the public?

       It's not like they could put nukes on the moon and I somewhat doubt they had a tea party with aliens.

       All of us are human with human flaws and many are way into conspiracy theories after they had their first world shattering of perception to scrutinize carefully.

       The Moon Landing Hoax was produced by out friends from Fox News so its pure propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it's a red herring as there is many interesting theories about the Moon and Mars.

       Allow me to apologize on behalf of the other user. We happen to have a rule against making arbitrary "shill" accusations against other users here, as it is considered a personal attack and diminishes the quality the sub while contributing nothing to the debate.

       I must also ask that you try to avoid levying personal attacks here as well. Thank you for understanding.

       If we couldn't land on the moon, that retroreflector wouldn't be there. We know the retroreflector is there because scientists the world over can and have 'pinged' the retroreflector at their leisure.

       You keep asking people to prove a negative.  Assert your positive belief and see if it stands up to scrutiny.  There is plenty of knowledge outside of flashy youtube videos.
