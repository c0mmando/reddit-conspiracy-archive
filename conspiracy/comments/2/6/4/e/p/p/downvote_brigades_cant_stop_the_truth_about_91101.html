<blockquote>
<p>Having assumed the existence of an indestructible falling block, with or without accretion, we have demonstrated that, given the observed acceleration, such a block could not possibly have destroyed the 
lower section of the building. When we turn to the video evidence we see that even the hypothesized existence of a persistent upper block is a fiction. Videos show that the section of the building above the 
plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate. It was significantly reduced in size prior to the onset of destruction of the lower section of the building. Once the roof line descends into the debris cloud there is no further evidence even of its continued existence. Whether or not it was completely destroyed early in the collapse is a moot point. We have shown that even if it continued to exist intact, it could not have played a significant role in the destruction of the building. A small section of a structure, consisting of a few floors, cannot one-way crush-down a significantly larger lower section of same structure by gravity alone. </p>

<p>Resident debunkers will claim &#39;progressive&#39; collapse over and over, which has been proven false by David Chandler. The debunkers have nothing left to argue other than their tired &#39;progressive&#39; lie. This paper shows the progressive collapse is a lie. </p>

<p>Edit tl;dl The pancake theory (ie the progressive collapse theory) is a joke. </p>

<p>Edit 2: 10 hours in and no refutation of the original comment. 95 comments, and only 1 user addresses the OP&#39;s post. That user bolsters the case for Bazant&#39;s scientific fraud. </p>

<p>Edit 3: There was one other user who posted something pertaining to the physics of 9.11. (Thanks) Any debunker can win $1,000.00 by disproving Newtonian physics. Read below comments to find your prize.</p>

<p>Ironically, the most compelling content I&#39;ve posted here of a conspiratorial nature rarely gets more than a half dozen upvotes. </p>

<p>Two reasons: 1) the brigading &amp; burying of content, and 2) the apathy, indifference and/or ignorance of subscribers in failing to upvote quality or controversial content vs the tendency to upvote mediocre content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since most threads that get brigaded turn into accusation threads about brigading, let&#39;s address a glaring error with your breakdown.</p>

<p>If you consider reason 1 to be true, why not use reason 1 to explain reason 2? </p>

<p>The same <em>brigading</em> that puts shitty content on the front page is the same <em>brigading</em> that is happening when the good posts get buried. </p>

<p>The leap of logic in blaming <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members vs. blaming the same people who down vote quality posts is disingenuous.</p>

<p>Plus it lets us believe the game isn&#39;t rigged...cough cough.....</p>

<p><em>We&#39;ve never released a full list of reddit shareholders, but not due to any desire for secrecy. Rather, it&#39;s because shareholder lists are typically boring financial information no one cares about...</em></p>

<p>cough....cough....</p>

<p>Not to mention, why would reddit manipulators stop at content they want to bury? Why wouldn&#39;t they use just a little extra effort (since they are already here ;) to up vote bullshit?</p>

<p>All things to mull over after you realize blaming the fan base is wrong. I&#39;ve given a lot of shit on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for their turning into a sister sub of <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. Some people want to be told over and over that reddit.com is manipulating the message.</p>

<p>If you are willing to blame redditors vs. the countless manipulations we see every day, then you should readjust your redditview.</p>

<p>If anyone needs any proof of manipulation on a thread, look at the 93 comments that don&#39;t address a single aspect of the original post, and look at the 2 that do.</p>

<p>Beyond the aforementioned reasons, I suspect this may be an underling contributing factor:</p>

<p>According to the algorithm you just linked to, voter manipulation alone can bury quality content. That means the user base never has a chance in the first place to vote on quality content. </p>

<p>I suppose this is where our theories collide. I&#39;m of the opinion that the general user base isn&#39;t to blame, because of vote brigades/algorithm manipulation. </p>

<p>I take issue with blaming the user base. That&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>re. that jolt pdf.    </p>

<p>before the easy process of destroying this nonsensical paper...id just like to point out that it was co written by a retired professor of Religious Studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.
Graeme macqueen&#39;s specialties include Buddhist studies and has no professional background in the physics and engineering aspects related to the World Trade towers&#39; collapse.  </p>

<p>knowing that might explain why the &#39;paper&#39; is such a joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, if there was a powerful jolt to the lower structure there must 
also have been a powerful jolt to the upper falling structure, in accord with Newton’s Third Law. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is yet another attempt to frame the argument of the upper block competing against the strength of the lower structure as a whole, not floor-by-floor which is what was determined to have occurred. Global failure led to the initial drop onto the first floor beneath the failure zone. Subsequent drops were upper section plus newly failed floor, and mathematically this has been determined to be overall an accelerating one, with each individual floor not being able to negate the acceleration the upper segment.  </p>

<p>their figure2 (page6): The actual velocity calculation done for this is rather bizarre, and mathematically invalid. The authors are calculating the acceleration required to reach each point in the elapsed time, assuming constant acceleration, and from that deriving the velocity at that point relative to the velocity at the previous point. <strong>What they are therefore calculating is not the true velocity</strong>;   </p>

<p>in effect, they&#39;re applying a smoothing algorithm (based on averaging all the previous points).   </p>

<p>Looking at their results in more detail,it turns out that the reason they give for this is that they are measuring movements of small numbers of pixels, so a velocity graph obtained by numerical differentiation - which would give a correct velocity - would show pronounced steps in the velocity. This in itself invalidates the entire analysis.<br/>
The authors are taking a dataset which consists of discontinuous steps in velocity, applying a smoothing algorithm so as to produce a continuous function, then pointing out that the first derivative of this function contains no discontinuities.  </p>

<p>again: they don&#39;t plot the acceleration at a particular point in time, instead they plot the avrage acceleration until a particular point in time, smoothing out fluctuations in the acceleration. Not goodw hen you want to build a case for a sudden change in acceleration being absent: if it is present you obscure it.  </p>

<p><strong>note on the measuring of pixels:</strong> Given the 17ms sample frequency, it appears the video ( a DVD apparently) they used was in NTSC format, with 60 interlaced fields per second, giving 30fps. The interlacing halving their effective spatial resolution in the vertical direction (the direction that matters for their vertical measuring) to 2 pixels, or 1.76 feet. 
taking the DVD as a starting point doesn&#39;t do the accuracyany  good either. The format - mpeg-  used on DVD&#39;s uses a lossy compression algorithm: in the conversion to mpeg detail is lost. so you&#39;re pixel metric is very suspect.<br/>
But guess what? they had actually <em>converted</em> this <em>ripped video</em> to mpeg. this would have involved a decoding/recoding of the ripped file, resulting in even further loss of detail and thus accuracy.  </p>

<p>pretty much what you&#39;d expect from someone who doesnt actually understand physics.</p>

<p>I bet you spotte dthis all already though right? cos you only posted it after having thoroughly read it , comprehended it, and critically anlysed it? right? (lol).  </p>

<p>let me explain it simplif yo for your fragile little mind: there was no major jolt. theres no expectation of a major jolt. The upper 10/11 floors dropped with such force (due to gravity!) that the lower floors didntstand a chance.  </p>

<p>If a floor (storey) is ~4 meters high, it will take an object ~0.9 seconds to fall one floor, by which time it will be going 9m/s (s=seconds). So once the collapse starts, the overlying structure will be falling at 9 m/s by the time it has fallen one floor.   </p>

<p>Niw, <em>If</em> we crush the collapsing story into debris, say, half a meter thick and expect the collapse to stop at that point, what kinds of forces would have to be involved?<br/>
well, We would go from 9 m/s to 0m/s in half a meter, or 1/18th of a second. But during that deceleration the velocity is decreasing (obviously), and the average velocity turns out to be half of the initial velocity, so the crunch time is 1/9th of a second.   </p>

<p><strong>So the acceleration is -9 m/sec divided by 1/9 sec = -81 m/sec2, or about 8g.</strong>
This is the difference between a static load and a dynamic load. In the north tower, with about ten stories above the impact, <strong>the dynamic load was about equivalent not to ten stories but to eighty, nearly the total height of the building.</strong>  </p>

<p>again: the.floors.below.did.not.stand.a.chance.<br/>
<strong>and this is why theres no jolt</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Chandler is wrong or deliberately lying in every single one of his &#39;evidences&#39;<br/>
a great example is his video of the timing of &#39;collapse vs.nist&#39; where he just outright pretends that the collapse started after the east penthouse had already gone. a fact nist DID-correctly- take into account.  </p>

<p>if you dont understand chandlers &#39;stuff&#39; and you are jsut posting it because it uses terminology which fits you conspiracy conceptions - then you shouldnt be claiming it as good evidence. you couldnt evaluate it as good /bad or anything else.  </p>

<p>(its bad, though, seriously bad science).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>So basically, if you have a set of data that is a bit erratic, possibly because the way in which you collected the data wasn&#39;t very erratic, you can do something called curve smoothing, which basically smooths out the erratic points to give you a smooth curve.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what these guys did with the data measuring the descent of the building. The problem is, if you get some kind of a jolt every time the next floor gets crushed, smoothing the curve will eliminate any evidence of that. So if they did measure any jolts (and they may not have been able to since they were using a very crude method), then they just eliminated any evidence of it. </p>

<p>So they are either being misleading, or they don&#39;t know what they are doing.</p>

<p>You complain about details such as low resolution video yet omit the importance of significant figures in your own equations!  I am nowhere near convinced that you understand the fundamentals of physics, such as the proper application of acceleration functions; nor do you seem to comprehend application and mechanics of integrals and derivatives as they apply to acceleration.  Step smoothing? Abysmal.</p>

<p>I love your effort, but perhaps your summer free time would be best spent with a calc textbook.</p>

<p>Let me play the advocate for a moment. I personally have very little knowledge of engineering and am highly skeptical of quackery. So with that said, who do I trust? Is peer review moot? In most scientific articles a conflict of interest is noted and funding sources divulged. Why doesn&#39;t Chandler go through standard means of publication if his data is bullet-proof?</p>

<p>This issue trickles down to climate science, nutrition, medicine, and so many other fields. I realize doing your own research on issues is important, but not all of us can be expected to know or have the time to learn everything for ourselves, right? There comes a time when a lot of us appeal to authority and (I guess) hope that the peer-review process will catch the majority of frauds or mistakes.</p>

<p>Then if the person only relies on the legitimacy of the content to trust it then that person cannot defend anything other than their choice.</p>

<p>Most of the debunkers don&#39;t do this, they say that they believe in NIST because they are a legitimate entity and they refute everything else because it doesn&#39;t come from a legitimate entity. It&#39;s like saying that Galileo&#39;s points were completely meaningless because when compared to the Church, he had no legitimacy. If we apply this today, it&#39;s like saying that David Chandler&#39;s points are completely meaningless because when compared to NIST, he has no legitimacy.</p>

<p>And we all know how right Galileo was as we know that Chandler forced NIST to admit free-fall, even if partially. They both had/have no legitimacy yet the points they made were absolutely true.</p>

<p>This is why you shouldn&#39;t perpetuate your (whoever does this) ignorance if you only choose your theory based on legitimacy, especially when we have been explaining plenty of times how NIST&#39;s methodology in their report has been fraudulent.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the energy balance.  The upper section is evidently being destroyed as it falls.  Material is ejected out sideways, tons of it at high velocity.

<p>So even though the impact results in a deceleration of the decent, it happens so fast that it has negligible impact on the velocity of the collapse.</p>

<p>Every single gravity demolition presents a jolt: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHeCjZlkr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHeCjZlkr8</a></p>

<p>The WTC towers should too, unless they were demolitions.</p>

<p>Until you can present a clear and resonable example showing that the top sections wouldn&#39;t produce a jolt without the assistance of demolition then by default your arguments of Bazant&#39;s defense and Chandler&#39;s accusation are false and irrelevant. David Chandler shows with gravity demolitions that the jolt is clearly present without any use of explosives and explains why that jolt must exist. Bazant hasn&#39;t provided anything proving that the jolt wouldn&#39;t need to exist in the WTC collapses. </p>

<p>No matter how hard and how far you paint both sides, one has provided factual and direct logic to prove his points, the other has not and instead only used words and numbers. Which were already found to be incorrect plenty of times. <a href="http://www.911speakout.org/wp-content/uploads/Some-Misunderstandings-Related-to-WTC-Collapse-Analysis.pdf">http://www.911speakout.org/wp-content/uploads/Some-Misunderstandings-Related-to-WTC-Collapse-Analysis.pdf</a></p>

<p>If it looks like a demolition, behaves like a demolition, ends like a demolition... Only debunkers will have no problems defending the statement that for the first and only time in all of history a tall building turned into rubble and reached free-fall speeds due to fire. And they will do so by attacking the people and not the compelling evidence.</p>

<p>Funny enough, your OP is actually a comparison between their backgrounds and the way their papers were presented, not what they were saying, to which you were called attention for.</p>

<p>Quick question: If you&#39;d seen a core column cut in 45º right when one of the WTC towers started collapsing, would your belief in the official version remain unchanged?</p>

<p>EDIT: I ask that quick question just out of curiosity, nothing else.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I asked. And your theory doesn&#39;t hold true once you observe the columns in the piles of debris. <a href="http://www.nuclear-demolition.com/images/WTC_perimeter_core_columns_on_ground_zero.jpg">None of them present the behaviour that you assume to be normal</a>, the behaviour that you had no problem inventing without ever providing evidence of it being true, that columns tend to shear at 45º. The only columns in the debris with 45º angle are columns that were cut.</p>

<p>And again, just a reminder, that wasn&#39;t even what I asked, but you are completely free to act like a politic and answer my question by not answering.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No main question, it was a correction of your yet another incorrect assumption. The top of the buildings that started to collapse should have presented a jolt once it hit the first floor below. All 3 towers should have presented that jolt, none of them did. I provided a video explaining it clearly and easily with a real life example of a gravity-only demolition (<em>which is suppose to be what happened with the WTC towers</em>) and an in-depth journal doing the same in an even bigger detail.</p>

<p>This is the last time I repeat myself. If you contiue to choose to ignore what is easily explained and clearly incorrect then that is your choice, but whatever you choose you will always be left with Bazant&#39;s uncorroborated and incorrect word,s and numbers vs David Chandlers factual, direct logic and examples proving both his words and numbers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Ken Ham vs Bill Nye.</p>

<p>This is correct, but the most accurate way to measure this is by counting pixels on a grainy video from 2001.

<p>Despite that accusation you <del>have</del> still haven&#39;t shown any column in the towers debris that prove your argument to be true and you also avoided answering my question by changing the subject to your uncorroborated claim. Even if I didn&#39;t have education in this field I haven&#39;t yet made a claim without proving it true, something that you have been doing continuously. For the second time I was still waiting for you to show a column in the debris with a 45º shear that wasn&#39;t cut by men, you haven&#39;t done such thing. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can detect the jolt in any gravity-only demolition and that method of measuring the pixels has been very accurate to the point of even NIST using that same thecnique for their measurements. You are now attempting to downplay the relevancy of this by falsely implying that the technique is rudimentary. It is not seeing that the same technique can be applied to any other actual gravity-only demolitions and clearly detect the jolt in any of them, no matter how different the buildings are the jolt still exists regardless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The demolition video in your previous comment is a completely different building. It&#39;s significantly smaller, concrete and a very different design. It&#39;s clearly not an accurate comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dismissing evidence to prove your point, now that&#39;s a good tactic, the same that NIST did for their report. Even if we had identical towers for comparison you would dismiss it as well, what a nice strawman argument.</p>

<p>It falls in the same category when you (debunkers) dismiss the lack of any tall building global collapse due to fire in the entire history of manking and instead replace the evidence of history with &quot;<em>there&#39;s always a first time</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Convenient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you choose to believe that&#39;s true, than so be it. I clearly won&#39;t change your mind. It only shows that you will accept any piece of evidence that supports your preconceived notions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have presented examples proving my points, I have presented the flaws with the Bazant&#39;s papers and I have provided counter-examples refuting yours.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, avoided answering my questions, did not present any evidence proving your claim -<em>twice</em>-, dismiss real life examples when it was convenient and failed to defend Bazant&#39;s paper after I have showed how flawed it is.</p>

<p>Like I said before, it&#39;s like Ken Ham vs Bill Nye, and like Bill Nye I will continue waiting for any Ken Ham to prove me wrong with clear examples and facts like I have been doing from the beginning.</p>

<p>So, no, you won&#39;t change my mind the way you have been doing. I, unlike you, value more factual and direct corroborated logic than your personal beliefs in the legitimacy of whoever speaks unfounded claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any photos of columns sheared at 45 degrees, I assumed you did, which you would show my and then assert that thermite must have cut them. If not, I have no idea what you are trying to get at here.  All you have shown me was that photo in your last comment, with columns that I think you were trying to imply were cut by thermite, which they clearly weren&#39;t. This is exactly what I mean when I talk about misleading evidence from truthers. The evidence doesn&#39;t go your way, so you always have to present it in a misleading fashion. </p>

<p>With your example of a gravity collapse, you&#39;re comparing apples and oranges,  another example of misleading evidence. These two building are very different sizes, made if different materials and have a very different design. Yes, they both experience a jolt, but the magnitude and duration of it will certainly be different. You are submitting this as evidence,  so it&#39;s your job to prove that the magnitude and duration of the jolt in these two buildings are comparable. I&#39;m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on this and look at your calculations to prove this is true.</p>

<p>And yes NIST used the video to measure the descent rate of the buildings,  but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t rudimentary.  It&#39;s literally the only resource they had to do this measurement, so they had no choice. It may have been fine to get an estimate of how fast the building falls, but it isn&#39;t necessarily accurate enough to measure these jolts.</p>

<p>And ironically, Bill Nye sides with me on this argument, I think he would consider you the Ken Ham.</p>

<p>Shall we make a list of well-known people who turned out to be horrible?</p>

<p>Instead of constantly asking for convincing like every other dimwit, why don&#39;t you ask some questions and do so in an objective view.

<p>Just looking at the situation under which 9/11 happened and the cave monkeys who executed it in ace fashion that has already been disputed by commercial airline pilots and math, and the fact that the entire war was fought in the wrong place under false pretenses, and the fact that the amount of money that was made and went missing is unimaginable, there&#39;s a strong basis to start asking questions for yourself if you were a responsible, caring person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote a comment showing why chandler is completely wrong, but the mods deleted it, apparently they were threatened by it.</p>

<p>To sum it up, Chandler assumes that the building is completely uniform and calculates the crushing force applied by the top of the building based on its acceleration. He calculates that this force is less than the force of gravity, which he says proves explosives must have been used.</p>

<p>Well, his assumption is wrong. Every time the falling building hits the next floor, there would be an impulse that happens nearly instantaneously that causes a very large impact load that is more than enough to cause the columns to start buckling. Once the buckling starts, the force required to continue the collapse is much less than the gravitational weight of the top part of the building because a buckled column provides very little resistance.</p>

<p>So what you actually have are long periods of acceleration followed by these impulses of deceleration. The impulses by their nature are so short though, that it causes a negligible impact on the velocity of the collapse.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a genius to see where chandler went wrong, so it&#39;s my opinion that he was intentionally deceiving.  And that&#39;s why you should be skeptical of any article like this that hasn&#39;t ever gone through any official checking.</p>

<p>This works both ways. Watching random YouTube videos about 9/11 conspiracy theories is not forming your own thoughts either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supporters of the official story like to imagine that the skeptics are people who <em>were already</em> conspiracy theorists, that we were all convinced it was a false flag on 9/12. The truth is that for the majority of us it took years to come around to questioning the event.</p>

<p>A YouTube video I stumbled across, and months of subsequent research, <em>did</em> change my mind. I formed a new opinion. I&#39;m proud of my ability to reconsider my strongly held beliefs, a lot of people just pick a side and stop thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with you on this for the most part. Just using my 3 uncles as an example. All 3 work in fields were they should know and understand all the physics involved. However only one of them applies it. The other two to this day tell me it was the jet fuel and that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. At the time I just finished a class that made me able to see what was wrong on day one. Even now years later with all the other evidence and schooling and examples presented they still say the same thing. I don&#39;t even bother to try with the two of them anymore. They have it made up in there mind it could of only been that one way. I should add they are unfortunately avid watchers of fox news. Ive wished that my 3rd uncle would chime in on these debates but I think he has been down the road with them and given up as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are describing is the logical fallacy of authority.  Being an expert alone does not mean you are right.  Experts should be challenged,  they should always be required to justify their stance through argument.</p>

<p>Fortunately experts tend to be very good at documenting and publishing their work, as a post grad I have experienced the public presentation of such work and the scrutiny that is undertaken by the wider community.  Credible experts don&#39;t get away with arbitrary assertion.</p>

<p>I read both sides of the debate,  had a think by myself, and decided that the official story seems by far the most credible.  </p>

<p>I will gladly change my mind if / when Wikileaks or similar release the smoking gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you see it all as just a debate. I&#39;d be hard pressed to imagine how someone could just &quot;read both sides&quot; of it; it&#39;s clear to me that there far are more than two sides, and this can&#39;t be boiled down to a simple dichotomy.</p>

<p>If you honestly watched the video of WTC 7 collapsing, and believe that falling debris and office fires alone could have caused that, then my opinion is that you are unable to think for yourself.</p>

<p>The last line of your message seems to be a confirmation of that: you might change your mind, if someone else tells you that you should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It needs to be said and held up high like a billboard for all to see.  There are maybe 1 out of 10 &quot;duhbunkers&quot; actually make any headway in bullshitting people anymore and that&#39;s only because there is no blinking lights everywhere saying the case has been closed.  Nothing to finally shut those people up and get people thinking beyond the bullshit.</p>

<p>This kind of thing needs to be stickied so people can always see it at the top and can&#39;t forget its there or pretend it didn&#39;t happen, etc. etc.</p>

<p>One step up and no steps back.  Eventually the &quot;basic debunker&quot; who just parrots what he was told will go away because they&#39;ll have no real ammo.  They&#39;ll get laughed at because they can&#39;t even read a simple article.  That&#39;s the idea that should be out there.  You don&#39;t already know this?  It&#39;s right at the top, etc. etc.  Set it in stone, no one will want to be in that place and we will move beyond it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually think it&#39;s wrong to rely on others for information on topics that you are not educated in. Most people don&#39;t know much about engineering, so of course they look to engineering experts for an explanation of what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to chime in and provide a supporting comment. </p>

<p>Humanity has made it this far by relying the the knowledge of those that come before. If every person on earth had to become an expert on every aspect of their life we would still be slinging rocks at deer.</p>

<p>It is ok for a person unfamiliar with a certain subject to default to the knowledge of an expert in the subject. Especially when that expert has the support of fellow experts. </p>

<p>Defaulting to the opinions of a group of experts that are <em>recognized as experts</em> is a perfectly acceptible stance to take. Most conspiracy theorists do exactly the same thing with their experts. The only difference is that most of the time the conspiracy experts <em>aren&#39;t actually experts, or at least not in the relevant field</em>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say any of that? </p>

<p>Double checking...</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Let me be explicit so that you can&#39;t infer odd things from what I said. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A person cannot know all there is to know on every subject ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, a person can rely on the knowledge of an expert on a given subject. Bonus points if that expert is backed by fellow experts. </p></li>
<li><p>With adequate intelligence, a person can use the knowledge of experts to come to a conclusion, around which opinions can be formed. </p></li>
<li><p>In instances where experts are at odds, a person should weigh the value of each side&#39;s position. When a large number of accredited experts arrive at a conclusion that is backed by more accredited experts, that conclusion carries more wieght than the conclusion made by a smaller number of non-experts without peer backing. Odds are in favor of the first group. </p></li>
<li><p>It <em>is</em> possible for an expert to be wrong. But this is less likely than a non-expert being right while also being at odds with the expert. </p></li>
<li><p>People <em>do</em> have motives to lie about things. Thats why so many people lie about so many things. Having a motive to lie about something doesn&#39;t necessarily indicate that a lie is being told.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The truth doesn&#39;t boil down to current consensus and expertise alone. But they certainly help in ferreting it out. </p>

<p>Also, and you may find this interesting, my <em>point</em> was that both groups (those that tend to believe the mainstream explaination, and those that don&#39;t) utilize the same methods to come to their conclusion. The only difference is that one group is basing thier conclusion on a statistically (and signigicantly) higher probability that the source knowledge that conclusion is based on is correct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t oppose that. I advocate intelligent thought. I have said that at least once. </p>

<p>In order to think intelligently, one must have informed knowledge. Either we have this knowledge from first hand experience, or more likely we rely on the experience of others. One of the great things about being human is that we can easily take the experiences of others and learn from them despite never having actually experienced it ourselves. </p>

<p>For example, I don&#39;t need to have an intimate knowledge of the mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic systems of an earth-mover before I move earth with it. I also don&#39;t need to shoot myself in the foot to know that it will hurt like a mother fucker. Similarly, you needn&#39;t have designed and built the computer you&#39;re using in order to argue with me.</p>

<p>A more relevant example perhaps is that I don&#39;t need to be an expert in biochemistry to understand that I must have water to survive and that dirty water can be harmful.</p>

<p>I think we can agree that smoking can be detrimental to our health or start fires despite a lack of scientific study on our part. Why? Because of the people that have researched and studied such things before. With that knowledge I can determine that it is unwise to chainsmoke my way through life at the gasoline warehouse. </p>

<p>I just realized I&#39;ve gone on and on. I&#39;ll leave you with a thought; Where do you think your concept of independent thought came from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. Ok. I think you may be foolin yourself on that one buddy. You&#39;re saying that the concept of unadulterated thought, pure and original without any influence from the world around you or the experiences of those that raised you is a thought entirely devoid of all the qualities I just mentioned? You truely have the mind of a prodigy. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the interesting part. I couldn&#39;t possibly know exactly what happened that day. And I&#39;m not stupid enough to even suggest such a thing. Though a number of people that are more acquainted with such matters tend to agree on certain things. The odds are that they are correct. I also don&#39;t reel off a bunch of (and this is hilarious, considering the topic at hand) regurgitated talking points that I&#39;ve picked up and memorized for just such an occasion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be confusing the point of my comments. </p>

<p>I foster my own thoughts just as much as you do. I also <em>have not</em> said that a person can never find the truth. </p>

<p>What I have said is; A person must utilize the knowledge of others to formulate and bolster thoughts and opinions, because sometimes the knowledge required to develop an intelligent opinion is too diverse or specific for a person to have an intimate awareness of it all by himself. <strong>Everybody does this. It is expected. It is how man has made it this far. It is one of our most valuable intellectual skills. The persistent collecive knowledge of mankind is shared and improved upon everyday.</strong> You do this as much as I do. The only difference between you and me is that I come to a conclusion using knowledge sources much more reliable, reputable, and abundant than you.</p>

<p>That is what I have said. I don&#39;t advocate empty-headedness. I promote an intelligent approach to collecting information beyond a person&#39;s scope of expertise so that an accurate and intelligent conclusion can be made. </p>

<p>Let me show you an example of your own use of data collection;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure that you have in your head some excellent explanation for how the entire 47 story steel skyscraper of WTC 7 fell symmetrically into its own mass in less than 7 seconds, experiencing free fall speeds, leaving none of its 25 central and 58 peripheral steel support columns intact, almost 8 hours after it had only been hit by falling debris from the other towers, having only experienced office fires on some of its floors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, unless you are a combination physicist/structural engineer/video analyst/material scientist you couldn&#39;t possibly have the first hand knowledge that would lead you to the conclusion that what happened is impossible without a malicious conspiracy. Even more telling is that your entire paragraph is a regurgitation of the talking points that thave been floating around for years. Are you claiming that you gathered the necessary data and come to these conclusions without ever seeing somebody else&#39;s thoughts on the matter? Because that is a heavy claim. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure whether your ego is born of ignorance or naivete. </p>

<p>Very well. Let me be more direct. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t let &quot;experts&quot; think for me. I trust that people considered by the world at large to be experts have a better understanding of certain aspects of the world than I do. I can assimilate that knowledge and use it to compliment my thought process. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So did you get your opinion on 9/11 from one of these modern day renaissance men?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There are a large number of experts that agree on key aspects of that day. None of them are the kind of savants that would be able to have intimate knowledge of all that happened, but they are recognized as experts in their respective fields. This combined knowledge in addition to my own knowledge and logic leads me to my opinion. </p>

<p>Let me ask you something. How is that you came to the conclusion that guides your opinion on the matter?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But then you&#39;re just blindly trusting a perceived consensus without doing any critical thinking of your own.  Is someone &quot;considered an expert by the world at large&quot; just because they got an article published in a scientific journal?  Where is the line?  Why should we just take an &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; word for it without bothering to look and see if any of his claims make any sense?</p>

<p>By your logic, Bazant is an &quot;expert&quot; and we should thus just take his word for it.  But anyone can read his work on 9/11 and see how flawed and dishonest it is.  Do you see the disconnect here?</p>

<p>Are perceived &quot;experts&quot; infallible?  Do they <em>always</em> tell the truth?  How would you even know what the truth is if you just take someone&#39;s word for it based on nothing but the fact that you consider them an &quot;expert&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. There are a large number of experts that agree on key aspects of that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there are a large number who don&#39;t.  What&#39;s your point?  Consensus in and of itself proves absolutely nothing, especially in the field of science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me ask you something. How is that you came to the conclusion that guides your opinion on the matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure my full answer to that question would fit in the space allotted.  But when you realize that most &quot;debunkers&quot; base their arguments on the NIST report, and then you read the NIST report and see how fraudulent it is, and then you see the aftermath of 9/11 and how it lead to the furtherance of the security state and the wars in the middle east, and then you listen to the official story and notice all of the glaring holes in it, and then you watch WTC 7 fall &quot;from office fires&quot; and have people try (with a straight face) to convince you that what you&#39;re seeing is fires weakening all support beams simultaneously, and then you watch <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;amp;artid=167">this movie</a>, and then you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Rubicon-Decline-American-Empire/dp/0865715408">this book</a>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>We can also throw Bazant&#39;s work in there as well.  I realize his intention is to support the official story, but he only succeeds in weakening it further.  How was it that he had his full scientific analysis of 9/11 <em>completed</em> 48 hours after the towers fell?  Is that not a little absurd to you?</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the critical thought comes in. </p>

<p>Of course not. On both counts. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> just take someone&#39;s word for it. I think about what they say and determine if it makes sense based on what I know. This is what I&#39;ve been saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And there are a large number who don&#39;t. What&#39;s your point? Consensus in and of itself proves absolutely nothing, especially in the field of science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point is that the number of those that do is larger and comprised of more reputable people that those that don&#39;t. Consensus isn&#39;t proof. But it tends to point in the general direction of the truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you read the NIST report and see how fraudulent it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you recreated the model to double-check their work?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you see the aftermath of 9/11 and how it lead to the furtherance of the security state and the wars in the middle east.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably the one the requires the least amount of external knowledge to come about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you listen to the official story and notice all of the glaring holes in it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you are aware of what <em>should</em> be in those holes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you watch WTC 7 fall &quot;from office fires&quot; and have people try (with a straight face) to convince you that what you&#39;re seeing is fires weakening all support beams simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you have intimate knowledge that such an event is impossible. And you chose to use the least supported and most simplified explaination for that building&#39;s collapse because it fits what you&#39;ve been told. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you watch this movie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And assimilate that knowledge as your own because it fits what you&#39;ve already decided is true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then you read this book</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing, different medium. </p>

<p>Again. I&#39;m not here to debate the events of 9/11. I came here to point out that conspiracy theorists absorb and utilize collective knowledge just like the people they claim can&#39;t think for themselves. Interestingly, it is conspiracy theorists that frequently state &quot;I&#39;m just asking questions.&quot; because they don&#39;t have the mental capacity to think about the answers themselves. </p>

<p>An excellent waltz. I never said people think for me. I said I use the knowledge of others to inform my own thought processes so that I don&#39;t need to spend years gaining an intimate understanding of a subject.

<p>This would be where I can safely assume that you don&#39;t have the requisite knowledge base to understand that the various factors that are involved when capturing life in a video result in a product that is not accurate enough to make claims about the physics involved. Video analyitics. Compression, interlacing, framerate, recording medium, encoding and decoding all are variables that need to be known. Were you aware of the values of these variables when you watched your videos that told you the ideas you regurgitate?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say it does a pretty damn good job at explaining the events. Is it so unreasonable for the destruction of a few buildings involved in plane crashes in the span of a few hours to be a complex affair?</p>

<p>Eh. No. I&#39;m telling you that you should fortify your thinking with the knowledge and wisdom of those more knowledgeable about certain subjects than you. If you are a structural engineer familiar with the structures that fell that day then you are well equipped to consider that aspect without the knowledge of another. In that case, I wouldn&#39;t rely on you to be more knowledgeable about the planes or the logistics of such a scenario, because that isn&#39;t your area of expertise. Follow? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I <em>do</em> trust my own thinking. Partially because I am confident in the material I use to inform my thoughts. </p>

<p>No. It doesn&#39;t.

<p>Go ahead and explain to me how little faith you have in your own ability to think, reason, and understand. You sure do have a lot of confidence in your conclusions, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never even implied first point and fully embrace the second. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One day you&#39;ll learn that consensus is a poor method of searching for the truth, but it&#39;s great if you&#39;re too lazy or cowardly to think for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not that consensus leads to the truth. The truth tends to lead to consensus, though. That&#39;s why consensus changes when new truths are revealed. Which is pretty interesting when you think about it. The consensus used to be that the earth was the center of the universe. That was proved to be incorrect, and now the consensus has changed. Obviously, no proof has been provided for what you are claiming is truth, otherwise it would be the consensus.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re wrong in your assumptions about me. I&#39;m not ignorant. I&#39;m also not arrogant enough to claim that I know everything. That I admit I don&#39;t know everything seems to bother you. You interpret this admission as an admission of my ability to think for myself, which is not true. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I claim that I and everybody else here come to conclusions by way of the same method. For some reason, the fact that this method includes the assimilation of information not native to our own minds also bothers you. You even linked to a web page that I posit is not a collection of your original thoughts, while simultaneously accusing me of being incapable of independent thought despite using identical methods.</p>

<p>You continue to put words in my mouth. I never stated that I come to a conclusion based &quot;solely&quot; on the work of experts. But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re hearing, because that&#39;s not what you want to hear. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been gentle so far, but you&#39;ve ignored my comments and demanded discussion on an unrelated topic while insulting my intelligence time and again. So in no uncertain terms; We use the same method to develop ideas. The difference between you and me is that I am smarter than you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re the only one repeating it, I would hardly say its memetic.</p>

<p>I never said a person shouldn&#39;t use logic and science. In fact I have said a number of times that these avenues should be actively pursued. </p>

<p>I do think for myself. Your mistake is thinking that the topic at hand is anything but a discussion of the methods in which a person forms an opinion and the irony involved in your perception that your method is different from anybody else. I have been perfectly clear in that. Were it not for that specific subject I would have simply continued on my way, chuckling softly to myself at some of the comments here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After a decade, we&#39;re still discussing if this was an inside job? I say so what if it was? We already know that our government killed/wounded over 100,000 people, &quot;lost&quot; billions of our tax dollars and generally is ruining a lot of the middle east trying to &quot;fix&quot; things. And this will continue. There are plenty of clear-cut examples of our government doing 9/11-type stuff, right? </p>

<p>So it was a setup from the start. US government arranges fake wars, it&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t seen this before. So 9-11 was organized partially by the US. What next? Throw a few people in jail? Make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again? If we really find out what happens... all that will do is cause more mistrust and maybe we&#39;ll storm Washington, physically or digitally. Probably, we&#39;ll do nothing. Because we&#39;re loud online, quiet as mice offline.</p>

<p>And the engineers, if they are so smart, why can&#39;t they figure this out for real? Why are we arguing over this after a decade? Either engineers know what they are talking about and it&#39;s an inside job, or it&#39;s not and this ongoing &quot;research&quot; is a waste of time.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant attack, masterfully executed. I don&#39;t really think they needed our government&#39;s help with this, a couple of planes and some training. Amazing outcome. We&#39;re focused on blaming our government, the terrorists must love that.</p>

There&#39;s a pluthera of information which pops up here in the forums, some poorly documented, but lots of it well documented, do not waste other peoples time with something that you could easily research yourself. </p>

<p>If you wish to suckle on the governments propaganda teat which is present in all mainstream infotainment and cognitively blind your self to the obvious hyper corruption of the U.S. government then I suggest you congregate with others who also wish to ignore what is so painfully obvious, 9/11 is not even a conspiracy, it is at this point an information war between citizens and a fascistic government. </p>

<p>F.Y.I., this is how the government views opposition to its own terrorism, a terrorism we all have to deal with, a terrorism used to spend trillions of citizen debt on foreign wars to empower the oil barons of the Rockefeller family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand you are completely invested in believing what you believe and nothing I can say will change your mind so I will keep it short and simple.  </p>

<p>A) The &quot;Official Story&quot; accounts for the destruction of the WTC.  There are gaps, there are inconsistencies, and there are inaccuracies all of which are very minor.  Two hijacked airliners crashed into the WTC and caused their collapse.  </p>

<p>B)  The math, the engineering, and the computer models can replicate the physical events with high levels of consistency.  The ELI5 version is widely available.</p>

<p>C)  The ancillary data available from 9/11:  seismographs, bystander video, and radio transcripts support the &quot;official story&quot; and debunk most conspiracy claims.  </p>

<p>If you want to find the real conspiracy of 9/11, find out who profited from those put-options on airline stocks and find out who in the SEC covered it up.  Thats where the conspiracy is.  Pretending 9/11 was a controlled demolition is the product of ignorance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the brief, you are right, I do have quite of bit of time invested, as such from my own analysis of available information I do not agree with your points, there are videos/clips from the government&#39;s own subsidized media describing events completely contrary to the it&#39;s own account. </p>

<p>(a) Isreali&#39;s caught with a van full of explosives</p>

<p>(b)government reported missing titanium black boxes supposedly destroyed in the crashes, yet they found the passport of a terrorist on the ground intact, along with many articles of clothes, body parts including finger nails, clothes and and plenty of plane debris... unofficially one of the reporters said the FEMA, or the other party who contained the 9/11 site, NIC or NISC? Reporter said unofficially they found all four black boxes. </p>

<p>(c) There are media clips describing secondary explosions from on site fire fighters who were forced out of the WTC towers from those very explosions. </p>

<p>(d)9/11 Architects and Engineers, 1000+ strong, including one from the initial company whom the government hired to investigate the collapse, that engineer claimed the report was made to fit the governments version of events. These people show that the &quot;pancake&quot; theory of vertical collapse of the WTC to be impossible, given the planes initial impact and limited burn fires. </p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/disinfo/collapse/">http://911research.wtc7.net/disinfo/collapse/</a></p>

<p>(e)There are tons of online &quot;debunker&quot; videos using excess amounts of thermite to destroy steel, yet the few people who actually construct the same vertical columns with bolts have used less then 5 to 10 pounds of regular thermite to destroy and compromise the integrity of the beams, this only with regular thermite in a compress device to control the flow of heat to make cuts in the steal. Nano thermite can only be manufactured in Los Alamos or the naval warfare command center(name might slightly vary), considering this believed to be an inside job, they&#39;d have access to this material. </p>

<p>(f)Corbett Report linked clipe about a certain plane, I&#39;ll have to dig for the link again, the U.S. had developed Home Run, and a newer remote control airplane controller almost three decades prior to 9/11. The conctracter/developer for the technology had an airplane in the sky near the WTC towers the day off and its believed this plane hijacked the planes and had them fly into the towers, where as the hijackers had insufficient pilot training and capability to fly a passenger jet, as opposed to a turbine propelled plane, something similar to a crop duster. </p>

<p>It is far from ignorance to acknowledge 9/11 as a total slaughter of American citizens by the U.S. government, the implications of this are enough to crush the the current political establishment and bring an end to the one party establishment controlling/robbing/raping the the populous through private centralized banking. </p>

<p>Short, well produced video about one private, centralized bank. There are far better ones, the classics being Bill Stills, Money Masters and Secrets of Oz, both lengthy, but informative in both the historical and present context.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&amp;amp;list=PLE88E9ICdipidHkTehs1VbFzgwrq1jkUJ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&amp;amp;list=PLE88E9ICdipidHkTehs1VbFzgwrq1jkUJ</a></p>

<p>Unlike the government white wash of never forget 9/11, never forget the fact that the military and the CIA attempted the Bay of Pigs, another slaughter of American citizens to create a false flag event to supposedly invade Cuba. The establishment has thought of this methodology before and it is ignorance to ignore this very real fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>as the AE911 people say, there would have been stumps of towers remaining standing with 1/2 or 2/3 of their original height.</p>

<p>the base of the free moving top and the top of the standing tower destroy each other as they meet, the debris is mostly ejected sideways, eventually theres not enough top mass moving downwards to destroy the lower, the collapse slows then stops. </p>

<p>the towers were built lighter as they got higher, conversely they were stronger in strength and mass as you get lower.</p>

<p>its quiet a simple model and simulation if anybody could be bothered.</p>
