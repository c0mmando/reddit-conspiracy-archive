       First off, when discussing limited hangout theory and how it applies to Snowden and Greenwald.. keep in mind that in order for this operation to work, it has to seem credible. The controlled opposition figure (Greenwald) has to say the right things. He has to be convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, of course, in theory, what Snowden did was just.
       <strong>
        BUT

       ... remember that the point of limited hangouts are to release
       <strong>

       pieces of information. So, you love the stuff that he released... but look deeper. Bear in mind that IF this is all limited hangout...  Snowden is supposed to play the role of a "manufactured hero". Do you base your analysis on Snowden solely from what CNN/MSNBC/Foxnews/Guardian [And all other corporate media outlets] have told you

        In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirke Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting "millions and millions of dollars" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that "
        <strong>
         it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had
        </strong>
        "[9] as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.[10]
        <strong>
         He was furious that the NSA hadn't uncovered the 9/11 plot
        </strong>
        and stated that intercepts it had collected but not analyzed likely would have garnered timely attention with his leaner more focused system
       </p>
       <p>
        Binney repeated estimates that the NSA (particularly its Stellar Wind project[16])
        <strong>
         had intercepted 20 trillion communications
        </strong>
        "transactions" of Americans such as

       While others leaked some of this info, they were quickly marginalized and forgotten.  They were never given an effective opportunity to get their word out to the masses, and, absent documentation, it all could have been relegated to the dustbin of disgruntled ex employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the documents came out, people who would never have entertained the notion that the US government was spying on all of us, were suddenly unable to dismiss it.  It was in everyone's face, on all the networks.  Each time a new leak comes out, it is again in everyone's faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Snowden/Greenwald/Assange are limited hangouts remains to be seen, but I have yet to hear a good reason for the government taking this story out of tin foil hat land, and placing it squarely into the consciousness of the average john q citizen.

       Let's play a game....you are the government....you control the media, you are constricting the web, you've got indefinte detention on the books, endless war, extra judicial assasinations pretty much accepted, and you've had a successful dress rehearsal for martial law (Boston)....why would you give up plausible deniability when you didn't actually have to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what about the cost to the

       I consider that if every person alive today is having some form of control exerted upon them, then by definition, any opposition is controlled opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would leakers or do-gooders who were acting from within the system at high levels look like?  I imagine they would have been initiated and would have a past that would indeed look suspect or like that of a manufactured whistleblower (I think much of what people are asked to do on the path to power has to do with creating workers within a power structure who have nowhere else to turn, as they themselves bear the same responsibility as those with the power who exploit it.).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also very skeptical and untrusting of anyone who gets television airtime, or just everyone, as I think one ought to consider all possibilities, and a very real possibility is that people often do not portray themselves as they truly are.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've looked at the actual information being "released" and it's effect.  I think that this is historical, that the demarcation from a time when this stuff was not even spoken about, to it being mainstream is almost too significant for us to grasp in our own time.  My real fear is the extent to which these inordinate and overwhelming powers may be used- historically, authority structures acting with impunity on the people doesn't go nicely.

       By "leakers or do-gooders", I meant actual leakers and do-gooders, who had a position within the system to have something to leak.  I wasn't referring to a limited hangout or whatever it's called.  Like, a person who had risen withing the system a bit, yet decided to actually break their silence for the benefit of the rest of the people.  Such a person might look like an establishment figure because up until that point they had been.

       It could be that they knew something this big would be leaked eventually, so by having "their guy" do it they can control the narrative, and also break it to the country softly.  Ever notice how Snowden is very calm about the whole thing?  No emotion really.  Its kind of like when you look at him his demeanor says "this whole thing is no big deal."  I was always curious why Geraldo Rivera aired a segment about WTC7 on FOX News.  Why the hell would FOX air this?  Again, the only thing I can figure is it is some kind of information control strategy where you have one of your own leak the bad news so that you have at least some control over the narrative.

        Why would the government want that kind of information out?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       1) It's not the government.  You're looking in the wrong direction.  They're not the ones in charge.  They're not the most powerful entity on the block.  They're not the ones that call the shots.  They're only there to make the peon citizens
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       that this is who's in charge.  The government
       <em>
        is not
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Getting the information about NSA spying, etc "officially" out once and for all and for good serves the
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       important purpose of letting EVERYONE - not only the
       <del>
        conspiracy theorists
       </del>
       critical thinkers, but the coach potato sheeple as well - know that there most definitely IS this level of ubiquitous surveillance going on in this country.  This, in turn, lets everyone know just how powerful Big Brother really is.  Before it was just speculation...Now it's official and everyone
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       knows that the Boogie Man most definitely
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       real.
      </p>
      <p>
       This puts an extra level of "fear of Big Brother" into the minds and hearts of the citizenry that most definitely was not there before.  This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what TPTB want out of the people - out of the citizenry.  See, the citizenry has been getting a bit unruly lately w/OWS, March Against Monsanto, etc.  TPTB have to inject some fear back into the public.  Letting them know they can't get together in secret and devise secret meetings against the state for fear that the powerful surveillance state will find out about it and shut them down and arrest them.  That is a VERY powerful tool of manipulation, bullying, and curving dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Letting the public know about the power of the surveillance state is VERY important because it lets the people know that they are being watched 24/7 by an apparatus that is so powerful that the people didn't even KNOW they were being watched until somebody came out and
       <em>
        let
       </em>
       them know.  That's why TPTB needed their little limited hangout patsy Eddie Snowboy to be the "hero of liberty!".  They needed him to come out and tell the people just how big and bad Big Brother was so that the people could then go O_o "Oh shit." and be afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has served a very important purpose for the security state.

What the fuck are you doing?  Fuck you. You probably think Daniel Ellsberg is some limited hangout bullshit.

       You're forgetting a key concept. "They" are scared of "They" too. Are the nerds running the show? Are the generals running the show? Are the wealthy running the show? David Patraeus was a big bad scary powerful motherfucker right up until the moment he wasn't. Same with Keith Alexander.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They" don't need limited hangouts to strike fear into the populace, there are much easier and more effective ways of doing so. You're right about Snowden being controlled opposition though... He is the end result of "They" being scared of themselves.

        Every point pointing to limited hangout can also be perceived as a legitimate building up of company like Wikileaks to bring forth leaks from governments that people need to hear about. If he was just running a blog, no one would take him seriously. He is setting up a professional medium through which to pass this information he has onto others.
I think that if he is genuine, then he is doing the best he can with what he has. Am I frustrated he hasn't dumped all the info to the web and let us sort through it? Yes. Though, I am aware that such a tactic is needed to remain in the medias spotlight as well substantiate his legitimacy.
If they just threw a ton of documents at us, can we prove they were doctored or not? No, but if they write a well written article to go along with the documents the information can be displayed in an effective manner.

       Well, that's not really what it is though.  "We" don't need to know this exists.  "We" - as in the individuals who are generally more awake than others and ARE paying attention to all the b.s. that's happening on this planet - already DO know it exists and AREN'T surprised by the supposed "leaks" that have come out.  Those individuals who are awake and
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       paying attention don't need any of that in order to already know that conspiracies and great, great levels of manipulation DO indeed exist on this planet on the part of TPTB against the 99%.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, I'll say this.  I don't think TPTB are really all THAT afraid or scared of the 99%.  As continues to be shown to be the case, TPTB continue to be quite a few steps ahead of the general population in terms of manipulation and control.  It's like this:  So long as humanity doesn't put aside all the petty, contrived, indoctrinated differences that have been brainwashed into them/us by TPTB's (via school, MSM, etc) - so long as we don't come together as the ONE PEOPLE that we absolutely are, so long as we don't see each other as
       <em>
        one race
       </em>
       together and united, so long as we don't look at as inconsequential these stupid, moronic differences of class, race, color, money, education, gender, orientation, etc, etc, so long as we continue to alienate each other over these stupid, petty differences - we will continue to be easy pickings for TPTB and they will have almost nothing to really fear from us where it regards us/the 99% "finally coming together!" and fighting their manipulation against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, more recently, the coming together was tried in OWS here in the United States, and it got disbanded and ridiculed so quick and fast and the people here did really not nearly enough to fight back and keep it alive.  Heck, just as many (stupid) people actually JOINED in on the ridiculing and actually acted to ensure that this attempt at fighting back by OWS, by March Against Monstanto, etc led nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer.  On this planet, TPTB keep the 99%
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       much divided.  This is their m.o., and it goes DEEEEEP - deeper than most can even begin to imagine.  As a result of this, we remained entirely conquered as a people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no.  I don't think TPTB really have all that much to worry about, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we DID come together as one people, then they'd be screwed.  So long as we don't do that, however, we will remained ruled over...and we are FAR from being united as one Earth human family.  Far from it.

       The claim of a limited hangout serves to generate a division between those aware of previous suppositions or leaks and those being introduced to the topic by a damaging set of very public leaks. If you look through the rhetoric put forward in these arguments, where one might expect a call to action in a bid to interrupt the supposed operation one instead finds a vilification of anyone responding to the content of the leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be far more efficient for the CIA to leak a document spelling out the theoretical limited hangout operation and astro-turf accusations of such against any leakers with a strong presentation of evidence than it would be to actually carry out limited hangout operations. After all, leakers exist and leakers are capable of learning from the mistakes of other leakers. The CIA requires a plan for when everything else fails to contain a legitimate leak from public discourse, and this rhetoric fits the bill quite well.

       Thank you for actually sticking up for the journalists, not just Greenwald but also Jeremy Scahil, Laura Poitrus and a myriad of others who've banded together since Michael Hastings died.  Just because The Intercept has a disagreement with Julian Assange does not mean all of a sudden JA is the only legitimate person out there.  Before Greenwald everyone was saying JA was limited hangout, a disinfo agent, etc.
       <strong>
        Do not buy into this limited hangout nonsense.  Limited hangout is far, far, far more obvious and far, far more limited.  It's the tiny stuff you see on CNN and the like daily, that's limited hangout.

       <a href="http://youtu.be/O69SCJAhUdI">
        made the claim that Wikileaks isn't to be trusted.
       </a>
       It would follow, that wikileaks may be trying to attack GG's credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may be for ego-driven reasons or something worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this issue is clearly divisive (even in this subreddit). I personally don't think it's that important. Most of us here will make up our own minds who to trust and go for information.

       The influential ties are necessarily subtle and somewhat subdued. There is only so much that they can manage to have ignored without the facade completely vanishing. As of yet the populace hold sufficient power that such brazen control would have disastrous consequences for those exercising it. If this were not the case, then there would be no need for the kind of games that a limited hangout represents in the first place.

       Though I would have rather had a straight answer, that is a nice long confusing response. If I deciphered correctly; you think the msm is influenced by the "government" but is also independent. I don't like people putting words into others mouths, so if thats not correct please clarify.

       I have no idea whether your "government" directly controls the organizations responsible for main stream media. However, I can fairly easily observe that economic factors require that these organizations provide coverage of certain events in order to prevent loss of viewership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loss of viewership to independent organizations is loss of a degree of control over the populace for anyone in control of or influencing main stream media. Therefore, it can be reasonably established that the influence over what is published is subdued, which, in turn, means that individuals working for these organizations must be managed with some degree of subtlety lest they decide to exploit that limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "government": please define this term more clearly, there are multiple possible definitions that generate ambiguity in this context.

       I think I hear what you're saying: That if it becomes too obvious that what is being presented in the msm is censored/propaganda/controlled that the influence said msm has is diminished. Is that about right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe you're right...if people are thinking critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if said influence was just well hidden? Or not at all well hidden?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much could that be exploited with live broadcast delays being commonplace?
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens if people are forced to attend school for 13 years, all learning the same "truths"?
I feel like it might make responses of people rather uniform thus predictable with sampling.

       The CIA generally has final say on what usually gets reported and what usually does not get reported in most MSM, especially US MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relevant: The CIA's "Operation Mockingbird".
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia would tell you that Operation Mockingbird "was" a CIA program (/DrEvil.JPG), however it would be quite naive to think that they have haulted the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they did hault the program, it was probably revamped under a new name and pushed further underground (such as the CIA's "MK-ULTRA" which did indeed exist, and many speculate that it was replaced by a program known as "Project Monarch").

       You guys are missing the underlying point from these leaks, which is pretty massive, Google was contracted to provide hardware and logistics to make this possible in all countries which this operation took place in.  Which is hypocritical of their statements when this whole debacle started in which they stated they had no prior knowledge or voluntary involvement in these operations.

       Then why imply you have some sort of information which would "risk" some sort of retaliation?  If you truly had some insight you would know that deleting your comments really does nothing to further your argument or credibility, you would be privy to the fact that although your comment is deleted, it is still archived somewhere.

       MSM, they downwashed every real whistleblower so far and now we have a weekly newscycle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ed Snowden is an insider. His career is all wrong. Too far, too fast, too young. Forgetaboutit.

       I'm 90% sure this is a psyop/limited hangout straight out of 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell the population what's happening to them so they're less inclined to bat an eye at these types of things later. I feel like if this was the America of 100 years ago and the population had an idea that they were being spied on we'd see riots/protests but because we've been slowly conditioned to lose these freedoms and accept the loss of privacy everything just goes on. The corporations are clearly aware of everything that's going on and any CEO that tells you differently is lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This operation works perfectly because it targets two demographics the sheeple and the conspiracy types. The sheeple it targets accepts the loss of their privacy, they feel powerless, and they don’t get upset.  Or the other group of sheeple well they love America and see Snowden as a traitor thus dividing the country even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the conspiracy minded people it works one of two ways. Either you love him and think he’s gods gift to us OR you see it as a psyop thus dividing the conspiracy demographic. Most people that see this as a psyop know that things like this have been going on for a long time and also has already been leaked by other NSA employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the BIGGEST, RICHEST, MOST POWERFUL, spy machine in the world and you’re telling me that we can’t track where Snowden is? So on top of that this “traitor” sits down via “satellite” with MSM and your telling me the NSA isn’t pulling up his coordinates? Really? I’m not that gullible and I hope you’re not either. If that doesn’t make you think then think about this. Not only does he sit down with tons of MSM figures he walks through the Chinese airport, boards a plane, and again you’re telling me the BIGGEST, RICHEST, MOST POWERFUL,  spy machine can’t find their very own employee?  On top of that we have Greenwald who dropped a new book and is going around promoting it on TV. Who controls tv you’re only being showed what they want us to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay so let's play devils advocate and say that snowden since he worked at the NSA is a super elite computer hacker/user so he covers his tracks good. I am going to tell you right now that if the NSA can't get into his info because of his knowledge I am guessing they could get into Wikileaks, The Guardian, Greenwalds computers, the MSM computers that are housing the emails setting up the meetings/interviews.

       You can learn everything by paying close attention to Reddit voting manipulation.  Look at the disinformation of "Programmer", where he paints skeptics of Snowden as part of an elaborate CIA scheme to muddy the waters.  This is a sensitive topic, so they need his content to be the top post and vote him up swiftly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, notice how the people who proclaim Snowden is a limited hangout are voted down to half as much as the lead plant (Programmer) or to nothing in almost every case.  This is to cast the illusion that the majority agrees with Programmers' initial "conspiracy theory" that Snowden is legit and the people speaking against him are CIA.

       Bryan Williams of NBC traveled and met with Edward Snowden the most wanted man in the world. Yes the most rich/powerful spy machine can't follow Bryan Williams to Moscow?

      <p>
       Snowden's not worried Bryan Williams will be taken under the NDAA for aiding a terrorist or working with him? C'mon people use your brain.

       Is it possible from a government employee or contractor to leak information without leaving themselves open to the criticism of being part of a limited hangout operation? Like others in this thread, I am open to the possibility but remain unconvinced.

       Even though I'd like to believe that Snowden and Greenwald aren't as well, this "revelation" doesn't bolster that belief.  Of course Afghanistan is under surveillance.  It's a war zone.

       This is simply untrue. Major news and press like CNN were talking about the NSA as far back as 1998. It is a gimmick that we all, including yourself, have fallen for.

       The fact is people just don't care about the news unless a building has just had a plane crashed through it.

       So can you show me what proof was available back in 1998? I see this mentioned all the time but all I get are the names of some whistleblowers who were claiming all of this happened, they never had proof in their hands. I'd like to see the proof you're referring to.

       Erm, among the tech community this was well known, and a fix was implemented in the sense that proprietary encryption became useless compared to other open source algorithms.

       The fact that they've actually been able to directly tap these large servers, and new social media sites is something entirely new for this generation.

        Why would the government want that kind of information out?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       1) It's not the government.  You're looking in the wrong direction.  They're not the ones in charge.  They're not the most powerful entity on the block.  They're not the ones that call the shots.  They're only there to make the peon citizens
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       that this is who's in charge.  The government
       <em>
        is not
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Getting the information about NSA spying, etc "officially" out once and for all and for good serves the
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       important purpose of letting EVERYONE - not only the
       <del>
        conspiracy theorists
       </del>
       critical thinkers, but the coach potato sheeple as well - know that there most definitely IS this level of ubiquitous surveillance going on in this country.  This, in turn, lets everyone know just how powerful Big Brother really is.  Before it was just speculation...Now it's official and everyone
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       knows that the Boogie Man most definitely
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       real.
      </p>
      <p>
       This puts an extra level of "fear of Big Brother" into the minds and hearts of the citizenry that most definitely was not there before.  This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what TPTB want out of the people - out of the citizenry.  See, the citizenry has been getting a bit unruly lately w/OWS, March Against Monsanto, etc.  TPTB have to inject some fear back into the public.  Letting them know they can't get together in secret and devise secret meetings against the state for fear that the powerful surveillance state will find out about it and shut them down and arrest them.  That is a VERY powerful tool of manipulation, bullying, and curving dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Letting the public know about the power of the surveillance state is VERY important because it lets the people know that they are being watched 24/7 by an apparatus that is so powerful that the people didn't even KNOW they were being watched until somebody came out and
       <em>
        let
       </em>
       them know.  That's why TPTB needed their little limited hangout patsy Eddie Snowboy to be the "hero of liberty!".  They needed him to come out and tell the people just how big and bad Big Brother was so that the people could then go O_o "Oh shit." and be afraid.
