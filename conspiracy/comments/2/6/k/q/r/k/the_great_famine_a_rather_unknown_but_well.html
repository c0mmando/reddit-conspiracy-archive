        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The Great Famine&quot; was <strong>not</strong> the main reason and cause for mass starvation and emigration in Ireland from 1845 onwards. Back when the famine began all land in Ireland was owned by the British and every piece of land had a British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)#Landlords_and_tenants">landlord</a> to rule over it. Who ultimately held rule on the logistics of resources/food in his land. Like all oppressors, most of them absolutely hated the underclasses and seen them as subhuman and even like <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/famine/coffin.htm">animals</a>. </p>

<p>Ireland has always had at least <a href="http://www.wolfetonesofficialsite.com/famine.htm">twice</a> the amount of food needed to feed itself and today it stands at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jun/30/ireland-economic-recovery">6</a> times. During the famine this was no exception. Yes the potato did fail but many other crops thrived and the livestock did not suffer. All food during the famine was harvested and exported at a very efficient and rapid rate. This <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RBAU6tI.jpg">map</a> will make it easier to grasp the British military strongholds and shipping routes to export the food. Effectively starving the population with the food the Irish created. During the &quot;blight&quot; many <a href="http://irishamerica.com/2009/08/international-relief-efforts-during-the-famine/">countries</a> tried to help Ireland including the USA, India and even the <a href="http://hotterthanapileofcurry.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/ireland-thanks-ottoman-caliphate-for-humanitarian-aid-provided-160-years-ago/">Ottomans</a> tried to help Ireland, but most aid was rejected and the British used the guise of the already crushing legal ruling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">corns law</a> to try to vindicate their actions. The money and food that was allowed to Ireland was mostly giving to the ruling British to use as they seen fit. The British seen an opportunity to decimate a country they had been fighting against for 800 years and ruthlessly pushed their plan into action with results and consequences in population that are still felt <a href="http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/the-irish-potato-famine-in-one-terrifying-chart/">today</a>. In short this was an act of genocide by the British. </p>

<p>I tried my best to shorten this as much as possible. Irish history is a very old, intricate and frankly bloody one. It is also a well documented one. Worth reading into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive always been suspect that so many starved only because of one item on a menu: potato. Also- what people didn&#39;t know is why there was a blight on them, they used the spud sprouts instead of planting the seed, which was impervious to the blight as opposed to using sprouts. </p>
