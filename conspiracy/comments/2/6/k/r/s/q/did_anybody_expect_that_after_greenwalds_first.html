    <div class="md"><p>It is if you dont want to know the depth of it all. You see, most people now know these spy programs exist, but they still believe it boils down to an &quot;over reaction&quot; of the US. They refuse to watch a movie length documentary that would tell them OBL is a patsy and the official 9/11 narrative is a big big lie.</p>

<p>Easy to learn if you seek the info, hard if youre afraid of what you will find or if you have a hard time bending your perception of what is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh fuck off.  Every week it&#39;s a new attempt with you limited hangout idiots.  THE SAME &quot;limited hangout&quot; bullshit.  Why doesn&#39;t a different person with a different agenda say &quot;controlled opposition&quot; or &quot;psy operative&quot;?  Nope, it&#39;s the <em>exact same talking point but from different usernames,</em> on a schedule with the <em>exact</em> same wording.  </p>

<p>Because you&#39;re doing the same slow roll out of sowing doubt.  Go hangout at that limited hangout sub.  </p>

<p>The only Journalists in the world with any name recognition who challenge the status quo just banded together in the Intercept after Hastings died, with the exception of Matt Taibi at Rolling Stone and Seymour Hersh, but I guess they&#39;re also limited hangout so we&#39;re all fucked and must rely completely on...what exactly?  Reddit?  You?</p>

<p>Do you have <em>anything</em>, like psychological theorems or CIA psy-op manuals describing this?  Anything?  Those could be psy-ops too!</p>

<p>Have you forgotten how long Greenwald wrote at Salon and the Guardian?  Did you read his weekly, fantastic and adversarial articles for years?  Did you do <strong>ANY</strong> fucking research before you post this fear mongering, doubt-sowing shit?  You&#39;re so irresponsible, at best. </p>

<p>Daniel Ellsberg loves Snowden and Greenwald, and I read+loved Greenwald for <em>years</em>, that&#39;s all I need to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty exasperating isnt it? No one wth any molecule of intelligence is buying  the &#39;limited hangout&#39; fantasy....literally no one. Whether it&#39;s WokersInterest, or this new guy, or all the new accounts yet to be created, it&#39;s the same old story, &#39;come on guys, we <em>really</em> need to plant seeds of doubt!!&#39;. Yet everytime these silly threads appear, they get destroyed! I mean, complete dismantling of the bullshit! And yet in a few days a new account will appear : &#39; Gee whizz fellas, do you ever get the  feeling that these guys could be a limited hangout?&#39;  NO, WE DON&#39;T!!!. Is that clear enough to you? Frankly, this continued effort, despite it&#39;s utter failure makes me realize how important they are. Thank you for that!</p>

<p>But I have to say, I always love the part when they say &#39;but surely you don&#39;t trust Omar the billionaire right? You know he&#39;s a billionaire right?&#39; LOL </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they&#39;re all &quot;limited&quot; hangout, a perfect little catch phrase and sub that appeared with Conspiratard around the time Snowden&#39;s docs came out!  Wonderful! You&#39;re a waste of time and intentional distraction.  Instead of focusing on solving the issues, the actual issues, you make it about Snowden and Greenwald. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what Snowden and Greenwald are, because those programs existed with or without Snowden&#39;s leaks, and now hundreds of millions of people who were clueless, didn&#39;t believe, were on the fence or unacknowledged due to lack of tangible evidence now know the truth, and can actually do something about it.  Before, they could do nothing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how cute</p>

<p>nixon and his team coined the phrase limited hangout/modified limited hangout</p>

<p>perhaps you can idk.. wiki it?</p>

<p>youre saying <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> begun in june of 2013?</p>

<p>had you done some research you would see that r/limitedhangouts is only 3 months old</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>what are the actual issues? did they tell you anything binney/drake and common sense about cointelpro didnt already tell you? we know, or atleast i know how to solve these issues. </p>

<p>and we are only spreading info about the term limited hangouts, to get people to question things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what Snowden and Greenwald are,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uhm, it actually does? you&#39;re only information about snowden has come through poitras and greenwald, formerly at british corporate media group the guardian, and now financed by a billionaire .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>now hundreds of millions of people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the point of limited hangouts; you enlighten the population with <em>some</em> info, but not all. again, nothing important, nothing on 9/11</p>

<p>their latest leak was that Afghanistan is totally spied upon... was this news to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can actually do something about it. Before, they could do nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nothing has changed since snowden came out. sure obama had a lil sutpid task force or something, but the corporate/fascist imperialist state continues in its 13th war in afghanistan, ndaa again is continued, patriot act remains intact, etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. I feel like the &quot;limited hangout&quot; crew is a segment of the group of people who were ahead of the curve on how deeply the government has been spying on innocent civilians with the help of telecoms, and because of how far ahead they were they&#39;ve forgotten that a lot of people were not that clairvoyant or paying enough attention.</p>

<p>No one knew the depths the NSA was going (with evidence to back it up) for years, and now that there is a lot of facts on the table, and documents being released and declassified, the &quot;limited hangout&quot; crew wants to ignore it, minimize it and jump back into the unknown: </p>

<p>Snowden is government, he works for government, we knew everything he released (without actually knowing the detail), so ignore it, and just know he&#39;s a spy, and nothing he said is new, it&#39;s all known fact, move on.</p>

<p>The only theory for &quot;limited hangout&quot; that interests me is that there might be some group of lower upper management within the CIA that set this into motion, but even that, I highly doubt.</p>

<p>Also, I hope this &quot;finale&quot; isn&#39;t the finale and that more is to come.</p>
