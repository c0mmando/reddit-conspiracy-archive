        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Both <a href="http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=alate1990stenetchannel#alate1990stenetchannel">CIA director Tenet</a> &amp; FBI director <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0993freehfbi#a0993freehfbi">Louis Freeh developed private channels to communicate with the Saudis, including Bandar &quot;Bush&quot; --- <em>without Clinton&#39;s knowledge</em></a>.</p>

<p>Although both men were appointed by Clinton, both were reported to hate Clinton.</p>

<p>Freeh in particular developed <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0993freehfbi#a0993freehfbi">a secret back-channel relationship with former president George H. W. Bush.  He used this relationship to liaison with the Saudi royal family without Clinton’s knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Freeh#Post-FBI_career">Freeh was hired by Bandar Bush as a legal defense attorney in the Al-Yamamah arms deal scandal</a></p>

<p>In 2005, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2005/12/19/daily12.html?page=all">Tenet was joined the Board of Directors of <strong>Viisage</strong></a></p>

<p>In 2006, <a href="http://findbiometrics.com/former-federal-bureau-of-investigations-director-louis-freeh-joins-the-viisage-board-of-directors/">Freeh joined the Board of DIrectors of <strong>Viisage</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/NC21Dj07.html"><strong>Viisage</strong> was flagged by the SEC as one of a small handful of suspects of <strong>9/11 Insider Trading</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Viisage no longer exists after a merger that created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-1_Identity_Solutions">L-1 Identity Solutions</a> which is part of the privatized &quot;Homeland Security&quot; corporate welfare gold rush.  They specialize in biometrics &amp; face recognition tech.</p>

<p>Both Freeh &amp; Tenet helped block investigations that would&#39;ve disrupted 9/11.</p>

<p>FBI investigator <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=robert_wright">Robert Wright</a> and FBI investigator <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=john_o_neill">John P. O&#39;Neill</a> were each blocked multiple times by FBI superiors on many occasions when their investigations threatened to uncover 9/11.</p>

<p>Ex-CIA counterterror chief Michael Scheuer says that George Tenet <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/30/tenet/index.html?iref=newssearch">had 8 opportunities to kill Bin Laden and declined with all of them</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thomas Drake’s 1st day at NSA was 9/11...</p>

<p>Full Letter: <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/">http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>...“<strong>My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11</strong>. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....</p>

<p>...“That’s where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...</p>

<p>...“In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSA’s senior leaders took me off the task because they realized – belatedly, for some reason – that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.</p>

<p>“When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find any evidence that Viisage was investigated by the SEC for insider trading in connection with 9/11.  Everyone seems to link back to assertions to that effect by Kevin Ryan, but I can&#39;t find anywhere Kevin Ryan actually substantiated those assertions.  I see no mention of such an investigation in any of Viisage&#39;s annual reports from 2001-2004, which strongly suggests that there was no such investigation as it would have had to been disclosed.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018332/0000927016-99-001643.txt">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018332/0000927016-99-001643.txt</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does being flagged by the SEC mean and how do we know it actually happened in this case?  The SEC does informal investigations all the time but they are private.  Is that what he means by &quot;flagged&quot;?  If it was an informal investigation, how does Ryan know about it?  Ryan&#39;s claim seems dubious given that he provides no source.  Why do you think it is credible?</p>

<p>EDIT: Just looked over the complaints and decisions in the THOMAS E. BURNETT, SR., ET AL. V. AL BARAKA INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION case and I also cannot find any support there for the notion that the SEC was investigating insider trading of Viisage stock.  Viisage isn&#39;t mentioned anywhere in the complaints or decisions in that case.  Not sure where Ryan is getting his allegations but they seem unfounded.  Moreover, I should also note that the type of trading you and Ryan seem to be alleging, even though unfounded, implies there was no wrong-doing on Viisage&#39;s part in any case, making its use in the arc of your criticism here rather strange.  The type of trading alleged by Ryan would inculpate only the Saudi bank official who traded the stock, not anyone at viisage.  The allegation is that the bank official knew the attacks were coming and thus traded defense- and security-related stocks shrewdly.  That allegation has nothing to do with Viisage or any of its officers knowing about or benefiting from the attacks.  It&#39;d be like someone buying Toyota stock right before he burned down a Honda factory.  Toyota may have benefited, but Toyota also did nothing wrong.  The only one who did anything wrong was the arsonist.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Why would someone downvote this?  I researched the claims in question and cannot find any actual evidence for them.  If someone has some evidence for them, please post it.  If not, I don&#39;t see any good reason to believe the claims.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: If you don&#39;t believe me re these claims looking entirely made up, read Ryan&#39;s original article where they came from <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2010-11-18/evidence-informed-trading-attacks-september-11">here</a>.  Then follow the link in the footnote to the only source cited for the viisage claims (footnote 30) to the wiki page <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=saudi_american_bank">here</a>.  There is no mention of viisage there at all.  All that link contains is small snippets from the Burnett case or news articles that refer to filings in the Burnett case.  So Viisage must be mentioned in the Burnett case, right?  Otherwise it looks like Kevin Ryan is just completely fabricating evidence for his claims.  Well, surprise surprise, Viisage is not mentioned at all in the Burnett case.  You can see the decision in that case <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/2003360274FSupp2d86_1353">here</a> and original complaint filed in that case <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/terrorism/burnettba81502cmp.pdf">here</a>.  No mention of Viisage.  I cannot find the third amended complaint anywhere online for free, but I also checked it via my westlaw access and it, like the original complaint, did not mention Viisage.</p>

<p>If some people still believe this claim, I&#39;d love to know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah, that document clarifies things quite a bit. It seems Ryan was just sloppy in how he spoke in the Asia Times interview: It was the FBI, not the SEC that flagged Viisage stock trades.  And the FBI didn&#39;t actually flag Viisage or the actions of anyone at Viisage, but they flagged trades of Viisage made by a single individual who was not at all associated with Viisage.  That individual was then investigated and it was determined he had no connection to 9-11.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Ryan deliberately misspoke to make the Viisage connection sound more sinister to the general audience at Asia Times or what, but, in any case, the reality seems entirely germane and neither supportive nor contrary to a theory that Tenet was involved in the 9-11 attacks.</p>

<p>I do appreciate you taking the time to ask Ryan and get back to me, though.  I never really dug through the commission files, so I never would have found this document.</p>
