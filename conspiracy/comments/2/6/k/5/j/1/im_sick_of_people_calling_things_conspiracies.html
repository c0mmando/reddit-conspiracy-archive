    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I see is all of the things you just mentioned are in fact conspiracies:</p>

<p>con·spir·a·cy
[kuhn-spir-uh-see]
noun, plural con·spir·a·cies.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the act of conspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>an evil, unlawful, treacherous, or surreptitious plan formulated in secret by two or more persons; plot.</p></li>
<li><p>a combination of persons for a secret, unlawful, or evil purpose: He joined the conspiracy to overthrow the government.</p></li>
<li><p>(Law) an agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime, fraud, or other wrongful act. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: At least these are acts of conspirators. NDAA may not in itself be a conspiracy but it is part of a conspiracy and therefore still relevant to discuss here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;NDAA is a public fact&quot; - so is much of the NSA&#39;s spying programs. Should we also stop reporting on them? Almost every politician and judge is bought and paid. Just because they do something outwardly doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s less corrupt, it just demonstrates the weakness/apathy of the masses and the strength of the rich and powerful - and means broadcasting is even more important.</p>

<p>&quot;Fluoride being harmful is a verifiable fact.&quot; To you maybe, but most people wouldn&#39;t agree because government/corporate/media propaganda.</p>

<p>You specifically mentioned media corruption and you&#39;ve posted twice at least in this sub regarding specifically that. </p>

<p>It seems like you&#39;ve seen a few posts recently that you wouldn&#39;t consider worthy of this sub. I see those everyday, but I just look elsewhere. All posts won&#39;t meet your criteria, and if they do, you should really worry.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is a huge, concerted, and thus far successful effort to <em>suppress</em> the information regarding many already discovered conspiracies to such an extent that even though the information might be publicly available, there&#39;s still a huge machine keeping much of anything from being done about it.  This state apparatus keeps the majority of the people STILL carrying on as if the truth of the information was never actually ever disclosed.  Therein lies the conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like 911.  That was 100% a false flag conspiracy through and through.  A <em>lot</em> of people know that now.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still over in the middle east fighting day in day out, however, and thousands upon thousands of people have still died and continue to die daily because of it and TPTB <em>continue</em> pumping dollars into this huge lie that shouts:  &quot;Remember the middle east terrorists that hate our freedoms and attacked us on 911!!&quot; when that&#39;s actually NOT what happened or how it happened.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making here is that the effectiveness, the depth, and the breadth of a conspiracy doesn&#39;t always just die out and stop the moment that it&#39;s discovered that a conspiracy&#39;s going on in the first place.</p>

<p>TPTB are extremely strong and influential, and they can simply contrive things in such a manner that even if a conspiracy is discovered, there is a huge, HUGE apparatus in place to pretty much effectively hide it or ridicule anyone that attempts to really expose it, etc.</p>

<p>As such, a lot of lies and conspiracies simply continue on undisturbed in this country and on this planet because of this m.o.</p>

<p>This means that it needs to be realized that 1) there are a lot of conspiracies in existence, and 2) discovering their existence alone doesn&#39;t do away with them or their continued effectiveness in the least.</p>

<p>Oh most certainly.  Agreed there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, you see that&#39;s the problem with the world we live in right there.  The very reason why it&#39;s NOT brought up in the front page or in the MSM or places like that is because of the very CONTINUED conspiracy that I talked about above.  Even after a conspiracy has been outed and revealed, there is an absolutely huge industry on this planet that is designed to <em>still hide it</em> and keep everyone still ignorant and in the dark about it.  This is the reason why even after conspiracies are uncovered...nothing happens and you hear almost nothing about it.</p>

<p>Crazy fucking world we live in, bro.  Crazy fucking world.</p>
