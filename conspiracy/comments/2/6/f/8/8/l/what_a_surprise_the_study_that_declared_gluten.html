       Why do people look at who funded research as if somehow it discredits the study?  Read the study...discredit the methodology or conclusions of the study, but trying to raise anger and discredit something due to the people who funded it is a lazy person's way to (bad) debunking.

       Funding conflicts are a huge red flag, and if anyone actually bothered to look at the study and methodology and results, they wouldn't be eating up the second and third-hand blog posts that are trying to draw way more solid conclusions than the original research merits.
      </p>
      <p>
       113 of 150 subjects were excluded before the study started - many because they had the HLA-DQA2/8 haplotypes, and since they were already gluten-free, there was no way to tell if they actually had Celiac Disease or not.  The previous study had shown that those who suspected and self-identified gluten-sensitivity disproportionately represented these genes, but this time, they were completely locked out of the research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the remaining 37 subjects all got much sicker after two weeks.  Why?  No idea, there were no 'healthy' controls.   They say it might be nocebo, it might be due to the stressful and invasive nature of the test's protocol, or personally, I think it might have something to do with eating nothing but pre-made and frozen foods that are high in fermentable sugars.
      </p>
      <p>
       How they could have improved the study:  Include actual Celiacs as a control to prove the gluten-free food is actually gluten-free (it was prepared in a commercial kitchen).  Include healthy controls who definitely don't have Celiac, to prove that the stress of the test isn't causing symptoms.  Use a much larger sample size.

       30 is the
       <em>
        smallest
       </em>
       sample size that you can expect statistically valid results from.
       <em>
        400
       </em>
       is the
       <em>
        optimal
       </em>
       sample size for the greatest statistical accuracy in terms of reduction of statistical error. 37 is damn near laughably small and has a huge margin of error. Given the methodological issues in sample selection (they only included self-diagnosed gluten intolerant people who failed the genetic tests for predisposition; in other words, the hypochondriac me-toos) and the lack of control using diagnosed celiacs. this study is complete garbage. We also don't know that the test foods were not cross contaminated.

       It's never that simple. You can use any sample size you want, but by increasing the sample size you increase the statistical power of the test (i.e. decrease the likelihood of false negative).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dozens of ways to calculate an appropriate sample size but in general sample size will vary greatly depending on the variance of the data and the shape of the distribution (normally distributed or something else).

       Ok...it is still a lazy man's way of "debunking." You can't just dismiss any study without reading its contents based on who funded it. Sure, there might be instances of industry getting in bed with scientists, but that doesn't mean every such study is tainted.

         there's still no way to genetically test for gluten intolerance, so did someone stand around in a mall asking people if they were gluten intolerant?  And then once they found 37 people the study started?

       Most initial studies have small sample sizes, obviously the goal was to discover or validate a hypothesis for which people can further study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody is different and therefore everybody responds to disease differently as well. I still don't know whether to classify myself as lactose intolerance because the symptoms come and go (I did not notice a pattern till college). Lots of treatments have been discovered because some people lack certain enzyme activity due to their DNA as well as some people have hyper enzyme activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a solution to your gluten intolerance wouldn't you appreciate the discovery because you can enjoy certain food again? They proverb necessity is the mother of invention applies here; if George Weston foods can discover a cause and prevent it they can have more people buy there product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people looking to fund a project would go to someone who has incentive to support them. If that was not the case than a cancer institute would not support studies involving chemo therapies but instead  support diabetes research. Overall I do not think this is big news and most people have probably already forgotten reading the article, the only real news would be if they had found a way to cure gluten intolerance

       Yep. And that's why the results of most of those studies fail to be replicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       See this paper
       <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040028#pmed-0040028-g002">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two papers demonstrate that hypothesis generating studies with small sample sizes are usually wrong. They're even more likely to be false when there is a financial conflict of interest, as there is in this study.

       Are you 7 years old? Because you don't just suddenly get a food intolerance. You either had it always or you've never had it. That would be like me getting out of bed tomorrow and finding out I'm lactose intolerant. It's not going to happen.

       You are incorrect. Allergies and food intolerance does appear randomly. Also our food has changed drastically in the last decade, with additives and sweeteners that didn't exist before.

       You can definitely worsens intolerances through not knowing of them and subsequently spending years exacerbating the issue until it becomes an outright medical emergency.

       I had a friend who used to drink a lot of whiskey. It turns out he had Celiac's disease. It was worsened by his years of drinking. He didn't find out until he went to the doctor to try and find out why his stomach was so fucked up.

       I strongly disagree. You should analyze study without knowing who funded it and if it's biased. You should be able to find any bias yourself AND your analysis won't be biased too.

       Gluten is only one protein out of several in wheat.
People with sensitivity or allergy to wheat find their condition goes away by avoiding wheat. No change with isolated gluten. However, the condition returns with exposure to wheat.
Therefore gluten intolerance doesn't exist! We solved the problem! Yay!

       Pretty much this. "Who funded this pro-gluten-agenda research?" "A small eastern European car company, actually." "Wtf, why would they do that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing is happening with the E-cigarette industry right now as well. The only people that are remotely interested in funding research into the safety of E-cigarettes are pro-ecig groups (and big tobacco lobbies, but that's a different story), but it makes them seem biased when the research skews in favor of the groups (as was expected, but I won't get into details here). So all of the research funded by these groups are largely discredited as being biased because they're the only people that have a stake in it. As long as they don't try to cover up any research that paints their product in a negative light, I don't have any problem with companies putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to research. As long as the study itself isn't biased, there's nothing wrong with that.

       That's not entirely true (but you're definitely partly right). Has big tobacco ever funded research that went against their interests? Probably not. I would imagine that if you looked at the statistical sway of cash, research funded by money tends to side with the money. A lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public health organizations, such as the NIH are also funding research. For the most part, the NIH (and most independent researchers) have a much more positive view of e-cigs than lets say studies funded by big pharma (who make anti-smoking aids) and big tobacco. I would guess the same is true for gluten. Independent research is much more likely to be accurate than studies funded by special interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think e-cig companies are coming out with too many studies, by the way. They're small time operators for the most part.

       They did fund research that went against their claims about smoking. Then they suppressed it and spent lots of money undermining independent research that showed the harms of smoking.

       These actions were part of the basis for the tobacco settlement.

       Can you link to some studies that support the existence of non-allergic / non-celiac gluten sensitivity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're all funded by the meat industry ;)

       Right, so you'd know that IgA and IgG antigliadin isn't technically an allergic response, since allergies are specifically mediated by IgE.  So, this is an example of a specific non-Celiac, non-allergy immune response.

       tbh it is confusing as fuck, especially as each new study tends to raise more questions than it answers.  One trend among researchers has been to call it gluten or wheat "sensitivity" because it isn't like lactose "intolerance" at all.  So this new term "sensitivity" becomes a specific term for immune responses that aren't really allergies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every day, non-medical usage though, sensitivity implies a very non-serious reaction.  But medically, people can have pretty serious sensitivities that significantly effect their quantity and quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, about 2-7% of the population reacts pretty badly to wheat, rye and barley, so we're trying to figure out all of the allergies, sensitivities, and types of intolerance that cause that, because even though this group is reacting to the same foods, they seem to have completely different reactions to completely different chemicals inside of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular study seems to have identified a small subgroup of the wheat-tards as having a FODMAP intolerance.  It doesn't debunk the other subgroups that have been identified, nor does it identify all of the subgroups.

       "No Effects of Gluten in Patients With
       <strong>
        Self-Reported Non-Celiac
       </strong>
       Gluten Sensitivity... "
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the commotion it caused was mainly due to people not reading the title properly.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First giveaway of the faultiness of the study. Anyone can self-report any disease. It basically means that no doctor has even acknowledge the possibility of gluten intolerance on these people. For all we know all 37 of them could be hypochondriacs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...Non-Celiac...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Celiac disease it the one that really messes you up when you eat foods containing gluten. Gluten sensitivity is a very wide spectrum of diseases which include coeliac disease. But even a slight discomfort after eating can be considered gluten sensitivity, even if it could be caused by something else that in turn is triggered by high-gluten foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think there's tons of misinformation around the issue, and the fact that the study itself is
       <em>
        flawed
       </em>
       . I'm not sure if blaming a company for tipping off a medical journal is a bit of an overreaction though.

       Dude. There's 3 types of these people. The health freak band wagoners. The people with an intolerance, and then there's the people with full blown celiacs.

       Don't hate on people with a medical condition just because there's so many fuckin idiots out there.

       I've got the intolerance. Was sick as fuck for about 4 years before realizing what was causing the damage. This shit is real. I gained 60 pounds in 3 years because of it. Stopped eating gluten, lost all that weight in a few months and was back to feeling normal.

       The funny thing is, if you're not intolerant/celiac, you may as well give up all grains if you're serious because the replacements for gluten are all almost higher calorie.

       Yeah, the study doesn't say that at all. In fact, the study points out that there's more than gluten in the wheat which some people are sensitive too. So some people may not be gluten sensitive but they're still wheat sensitive because wheat is more than gluten.

       Yeah, actually, they got 150 people who said they had gluten sensitivity, disqualified the vast majority of them because previous doctors hadn't sufficiently ruled out Celiac Disease (especially the ones with the at-risk genetic haplotypes associated with CS and GS), then they managed to get all of the remaining 37 subjects sick.

       Exactly.  Science has been bought and paid for by the multinational corporations.  It has been hijacked.  Science is the new religion and the truth goes to the highest bidder.

       This is exactly what's wrong with the conspiracy community. You see evidence against a conspiracy, and instead of modifying your ideas to fit the evidence, you expand the conspiracy to discredit the evidence.

       The evidence that exists is evidence for the very thing I stated, however - not evidence "against a conspiracy".  If you think that such isn't the case, then, unfortunately for you, it is you and your world view that has something "exactly wrong" with it.  I'm

       Not quite. Science has these weird dogmatic laws that have never been tested or have been tested and reproduced with drastic changes. Those results are then pushed under the table, making "science" more of a religion than actual science. Is it any surprise that instead of testing the hypothesis with experiments he proposes, he instead is criticised and ridiculed? Classic religious behaviour. The book explains better than I can. However, two examples of scientific dogma that has been disproven but is still widely accepted by "science":
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed, is a dogma that has been disproven yet still fully accepted. The universe is accelerating in expansion fuelled by increases in dark energy which science cannot explain.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The constants are constant is another dogma. The gravitational constant is continuously changing. The speed of light has been shown to change quite dramatically over the last century, which again has been completely ignored / dismissed despite the reproducibility of these changes.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The other 8 dogmas are just as fascinating.

       It's like we as a civilization haven't actually moved forward anywhere near as much as we think we have.  We're stuck with the same level of general ignorance that we had in the dark ages - except then, we unquestioningly genuflected before the church and burned anyone who disagreed.  Now?  We generally unquestioningly genuflect before corporate science, and pretty much don't pay much of any attention to anyone who shows just how limited and flawed it really is.

       I'm going to suggest that there are actual people who have a gluten intolerance. It's entirely possible, nature evolves, and it could be that humans are starting to evolve as a result of GMO Wheat.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do think the amount of people that actually have a gluten intolerance are relatively low right now. The problem now, is that gluten free is becoming a fad. Gluten-free has benefits, but it requires you to eat healthier -- which might make it just a correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I briefly tried to go gluten-free last year and I found that a good majority of food that was label gluten-free and was processed food was basically junk masked as "healthy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Gluten isn't the cause of obesity, but it could be a cause for some disorders. I think the bigger culprit overall for obesity is sugar and it's derivatives. Look at any nuitrition label (not the marketing words, but the actual listing of ingredients. Sugar and it's "-ose" alternatives (HCFS, Dextrose, etc) are in EVERYTHING, including bread.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's actually a movie that is coming out, Fed Up (
       <a href="http://fedupmovie.com">
        http://fedupmovie.com
       </a>
       ), which a discussion about this movie is what turned me on to looking into sugar even more. The real conspiracy isn't gluten, carbs, or GMO. It's sugar and it's freaking huge lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       I changed my eating habits last summer (as a part of trying the gluten-free thing) and went from Hot Pockets and fast food every day to cooking my own food. Basic stuff like burgers (without the rolls), potatoes, chicken, oatmeal, among other things. I have yet to see any difference from cooking my own food vs eating junk and when I heard about the Fed Up movie I started looking at stuff I was adding to my food and found sugar to be in a ton of stuff that I didn't even realize. I'm going to start cutting down to 15-20 grams of sugar a day while still trying to keep food simple (because I'm lazy) and see if it makes a difference. I think it will.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I guess the moral of the story is gluten-free is just a distraction, sugar is the real problem.

       I had a friend who used to drink a lot of whiskey. It turns out he had Celiac's disease. It was worsened by his years of drinking. He didn't find out until he went to the doctor to try and find out why his stomach was so fucked up.

       The evidence that exists is evidence for the very thing I stated, however - not evidence "against a conspiracy".  If you think that such isn't the case, then, unfortunately for you, it is you and your world view that has something "exactly wrong" with it.  I'm

       Study tracks people with anti-gliadin antibodies, meaning that they're actually allergic to gluten and therefore aren't suffering

       gluten sensitivity

      <p>
       (the study also has no control with people who aren't gluten-sensitive and no placebo group but that's besides the point)
