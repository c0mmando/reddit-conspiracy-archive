       Yes there was a lot of turmoil in the last few months and now things have
       <em>
        apparently
       </em>
       stabilized with the mainstream media newsfeed retaking the front page. I predicted the censorship debacle would be the beginning of the end for this site, I may have been wrong, but it hasn't all played out yet.

       Holy shit you are so right!!! As a personal example, I just today read a r/worldnews post about people marching on Monsanto. I was thinking to myself before I clicked on the comments that it would be a great discussion cheering on the spirit of protest and fighting back against a criminal corporation...yet, to my disbelief, the top comment in the thread was someone saying how dumb people are for spouting "myths" about Monsanto and (paraphrase) how "oh these are probably those same misinformed people who say GMOs are bad" and being really aversive towards the animal studies regarding GMOs. The insanity ensued as I read almost all the replies to the top comments agreeing with this sentiment and really trying to label people who question Monsanto's unethical and downright evil practices as people who are just ignorant sheep (which is ironic in and of itself)!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever was responsible for those comments took what was an activist event and turned it into a complete "make everyone who questions status quo look like idiots" thread. That is clear disinformation and is the exact protocol we saw from the NSA slides to use online forums to actively turn public opinion against any sort of incendiary ideas. And, of course, it's front page.

       Are you any less of a sheep, given that you will accept any anti-Monsanto news without examining the many, many counterarguments and rebuttals against it?
      </p>

       It's easy to think you are the winning side in an argument when anyone who disagrees with your assertions is using NSA disinformation techniques, I suppose.

       These incidents keep media and politicians calling for survelliance and gun control but keep ignoring the same damn red flag in all these cases....that they all have mental health issues. It gets confirmed that they have some illness, but the discussion about his health is 5 mins while the rest is about "guns guns guns!"

       "Mental health issues" but they'll never mention the fact that every one of them had a new prescription medication or had just stopped taking it. Or that their "mental health issues" pretty much started with the advent of the prescription. This is happening all over the country - why doesn't anyone speak up about it?

       Are you attempting to say that all mental health problems started with medication?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure mental health issues have been around well before prescriptions have been around.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't to say that every prescription is safe, nor have they ever had a bad side-effect.  That of course has happened.  This doesn't mean that prescriptions have caused all mental health issues.

       Enjoy kicking dirt over the path - sleep well, there's a death every day and it's people like you, refusing to do any research whatsoever, to see what's right there in front of you, that keep the deaths coming. Hopefully you can take a few minutes to do some PubMed searches, read the newspaper, and you'll see the pattern, too. Working so hard to hide the truth while people keep killing themselves and others, [wo]man, I just don't understand it.

       Can you define the "far more good?" Because the harm is dead children. Me being a little less sad after a death is good, but is it worth the mass murder of little kids? (And I'm not just talking Sandy Hook - every single day, check the local news - there's a murder suicide every single day in my state.) Which just sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am actually not against full-scale banning of medications with deadly side effects, but there are a slew of things that could be done to make them safer and reduce the number of spree stabbings/shootings/murder-suicides caused by withdrawal/toxicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, for one thing, there's some research identifying a specific gene which predisposes some people to not properly metabolizing their medication, resulting in a much higher level of homicidal behavior than others who do not have the gene:
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/">
        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not test for that gene before prescribing, then fast-track that person into good therapy and a medication that DOESN'T have homicidal ideation as a side effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not, after putting a patient on a medication, pull 'em back in a week later and do a blood test to verify that they're metabolizing their meds correctly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not educate patients up and down and around the bend that if they're on a type of medication that has suicidal or homicidal ideation as a side effect (not just SSRIS, btw, you have Lyrica and a number of anti-seizure meds and what the heck - even Tamiflu with psychiatric side effects!), do NOT drink if it's liver-metabolized, do NOT drink grapefruit juice if it's kidney metabolized?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not provide people with tools to taper off their medication when they are ready (no one wants to take Chantix forever), instead of being put into situations where people go cold turkey (very dangerous for many) or are forced to break up their pills (which can be really dangerous, too, especially if they're using slow-release capsules)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we pushing for public programs that pay for people to get their medications when they run out so that they don't go into full blown withdrawal? (How many people, when experiencing an adverse reaction to a medication, just get pushed out by their doctors and are left to fend alone? I would hope not many, but it happened to me once--not a psych medication, but the side effect was one that lawsuits are still going on about, so it's not inconceivable that others are in the same boat.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we rethinking putting patients on cocktails of 10-12 medications that have never really been tested together? You hear people say, "Show me the study, show me the research!" yet no one ever says, "Show me the study that these 6 drugs together will help a PTS patient" - patients just get the medications dispensed and pushed out of the office. And when they have a side effect, they're told it's psychosomatic, here, you just need to up your dosage and all will be well. And then, when they get seratonin syndrome and kill themselves, the response is, "Well, what do you expect, they were mentally ill!" That's not science, that's quackery.
      </p>
      <p>
       These medications could be made safer. The suicides and murders could be lessened, if not fully eradicated. But instead, we sit on our hands and hush up any warnings and any education about how to make these medications safer, and I just watch suicide after suicide after suicide. And lawyers broker settlement after settlement on the down-low. And the cycle continues. It sucks.

       Agreed! Diet, exercise and talk therapy all work quicker, better and long term. Yes, even for schizophrenia. People need to stop thinking that "science" is the answer. People used to empathize with the mentally ill, not shun, fear or commit them!

       I think it's because blaming guns makes it easier for victims or even bystanders to believe these events can be avoided through "simple means",that is to ban guns or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You tell people, "this was because he had X disorder,took Y drug and had Z personal issues and guns aren't the cause but the vehicle through which these things were made manifest",it doesn't give people a lot to work with as to find a fix to these instances of violence and death. After all, you can't ban mental disorders.

       So if you implement gun control there by stopping the people with mental illness from getting them and taking people away from guns(people kill people or whatever helps you sleep at night) that's a problem? Guns are designed to inflict harm, the real conspiracy is how gun companies have had so much influence over your Senate that no gun control reforms have ever gotten through.

       wait wait wait. what does feminism have to do with a conspiratorial agenda? to me, the aspects of his misogyny and narcissism are footnotes of the issue. they are gonna try to use this to support gun control absolutely, and they might use it to support internet surveillance. but what on earth could they possibly have to gain by attacking and vilifying white males, and sympathizing with feminism? maybe there's some really deep cultural brainwashing going on, and somehow it will tie into a conspiracy, but you're gonna have to explain that for me... cause your post made sense until you dropped those two sentences.

       that's a good point, i will acknowledge that it seems the elite want to divide us in any way possible. i'm just not sure whether this event in particular would really have the effect of polarizing the topic of feminism. the media coverage i've seen so far has not even mentioned anything about his misogyny.

       Individualism spans all the -isms &amp; separates people from forming those powerful fight-back groups. Plus, people love to show what a special little blossom they are! 
I was at a wedding where the bride wanted the minister to list all of the achievements her groom &amp; her had made in their careers. It screams "Look! How special we are!!!!" I think I vomited a little.

       Feminists on tumblr and other websites are already jumping on it and using it to justify their ideologies and agendas.

      <p>
       Even if you're not aware of the deeper conspiracy theories surrounding the topic (e.g feminism being used to weaken/divide the west, or the conspiracies surrounding the modern Feminist movement and how it was funded and orchestrated by big business and the elite to "empower" (Mobilize) women into the workforce), it makes sense from a political point of view.

       They did the same for Obama - Made it out that anyone who didn't like him was a racist. Race related attacks were over reported on by mainstream media just before both of Obama's campaign victories. It was subconsciously implied that by voting for Obama you were somehow combating racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're doing the same for Hillary in the 2016 election, except by making anyone who doesn't like her seem like a women hater/Misogynist.

       It's literally the most tried-and-true, most effective tactic the elite have. Make an opinion or ideology they want to destroy unpopular by associating it with a lunatic, idiot, or actor pretending to be one.

       believe me, i have watched the whole thing. i've actually been talking about it with my ex girlfriend for the last 4 hours. she grew up in calabassas, and somehow has 2 mutual friends with the guy on facebook. i've seen a lot of the coverage on the internet, but i don't watch much tv. anyway, my point was that i don't see how the government could use this to push any agendas aside from gun control and mass surveillance. even if someone tried to assert that the incident means all men should be taught about feminism, (or whatever you want to call it) i don't see how this benefits the rich, the government, etc. i don't see where the motive is. the only motive i can think of is the idea that it creates a polarized environment with respect to gender. perhaps they could use this to help hillary in her election, as you suggested? it's entirely possible. i just don't see it as nearly as significant as the issues of gun control or surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       and keep in mind that this is one of sooo many mass shootings over the last 5 years. this is the first time (to my knowledge) that the media has even mentioned the gender issue. what they all have in common is that the media has used them to push gun control and, to a lesser extent, surveillance and other violations of our rights. do you see what i mean? there seems to be, at the very least, a media conspiracy to USE these shootings as, ironically, ammunition in the war against guns. the sheer amount of media coverage on all of these shootings suggests that
       <em>
        gun control
       </em>
       is the subject of this media conspiracy. which is why it seems like the gender issue is just a
       <em>
        detail
       </em>
       in
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of the incidents, rather than a subject of a conspiracy. if all of the shooters in the mass murders of the last 5 years were misogynists, then i would absolutely not call it a footnote. but it seems like this is just a small detail in one incident. that doesn't stop the neoliberal feminists from using it for their political agenda, but i think the bigwigs are primarily using this to push the gun control thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       hope i made myself more clear this time.

       By being divided into camps fighting amongst ourselves over who's issue is the most important, we lose track of the fact that nothing is getting done about any of those equally important issues as attention to each group remains minimal. We saw this with occupy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greater conspiracy theory at play is an old one with ties and roots in every facet of our lives. It's impossible to link everything involved into one simple entity, for it is the foundation of our society and history which is the conspiracy theory, the conspiracy being the promotion of revised and biased notion of warfare and the economics behind them throughout the late 18th until even today. It alone is the sole reason truth and transparency are not capable of surviving in our political climate, and for why honesty and cooperation are not considered for industry. Because the tendrils that have infected our leadership on a global stage has done so in both private and public sectors. It has the upper hand, and if unchecked the endgame will be disastrous.

       yeah i know exactly what you mean, and i have definitely written and talked about this subject many times in the past. i owe it to george carlin for enlightening me on the matter, i guess you would say. he has a few really great bits regarding the left right paradigm, the scheme of divide and conquer. before i heard his comedy, i had never seen anything about it before in my life. everyone i knew was polarized, especially politically. i grew up staunchly liberal, extremely anti republican. i saw only red vs. blue everywhere i went. when i heard his comedy my entire world paradigm fell apart, and i realized the leaders of the neoliberals and conservatives are equally at fault. it's just a game, a puppet show they put on to a) divide us and b) make us think we have a choice. i always see political arguments on message boards, especially youtube and facebook for some reason... and i often try to bring this up so i can bring people together, but it always fails. there's always a few who agree with me, people who already understand what i'm talking about. but i have completely failed at getting anyone to change their opinion... at least, to my knowledge. it feels like a lost cause, but i suppose when people stumble on this information themselves, instead of being lectured on it by someone else, it can have a profound impact on them. that's how i changed. it turned me into a mega conspiracy buff, as george carlin would say. so maybe if we release this information in an objective way, without confronting people, we stand a chance at breaking through the massive wall of propaganda. who knows?

       You are completely correct.  People can only see it when they are ready.  Dont be discouraged though.  Just be selective.  If someone is arguing with you or not receptive just recognize they aren't ready yet.  If someone is asking questions then make sure they know what you know.

       yeah that's so true... i think the turning point for me was the humorous context in which george carlin expressed his ideas. making people laugh before spilling the beans can really eliminate the natural resistance people have to accepting these dark, cynical things.
