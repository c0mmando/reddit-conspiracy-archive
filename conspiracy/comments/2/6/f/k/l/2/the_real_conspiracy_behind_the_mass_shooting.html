       Check the figures. Over the past ten years, there has been an astronomical increase in mass-shootings in the U.S. We are presented with two (2) default perspectives on who these shooters are, and why they do what they do:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         MSM says, "Crazy lone gun-man is crazy! There is no reason for his actions, we can legislate the problem away!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Alternamedia says, "False flag, they gonna take our gunz!"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       They're both wrong, and
       <a href="http://hyperboholic.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/the-next-civil-war-part-3/">
        here's
       </a>
       why (the long version). The TL;DR version goes like this: there's a metastasising demographic out there exhibiting a distinct and consistent pattern; 18-34, wounded entitlement, male, narcissist, sometimes FPS freak, having suffered a recent disappointment in love or career. Guns aren't the problem, when this happens in China (again, more and more frequently), the killers use a knife.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why is the binary split around this issue focused on factors that are either irrelevant or illusory?
      </p>
      <p>
       To address the symptoms of this disease would require an overhaul of the way we sell manhood to young men-- i.e. would require overhauling the oligarchy. As a media op, it's easier to just throw up your hands and say "crazy!", rather than to bite the system that feeds you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our failure to address the real sociological roots of this problem, and the economic factors that drive it, results in the large-scale manufacture of people built to snap.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, apparently, when they aren't shooting strangers in a public place, this demo is a massive engine of profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large scale manufacture of people likely to snap creates a pretext for an open police state. Another huge profit angle there. Cui bono? Fucking no one, but try telling that to the dicks holding shares in gaming tech, porn and weaponry (guns for private ownership as well as the military grade tech being whored out to your local PD).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, the perpetuation of the "lone crazy vs. false flag" binary debate reduces the possibility that someone will spot the potential for a successful grassroots effort to give these guys a tribal identity.The danger there being that the isolated little man with a gun suddenly becomes a major militia movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The boys up top are desperate to hamstring the possibility that some enterprising group might pick up all those paper tigers and arm them with a binding ideology as well as with guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But also doesn't do much to address the escalation of this problem, nor to staunch the flood of innocent blood that will continue to be spilt while the public haggles over a (relative) non-issue.

       Speaking of conspiratorial angles that are being entirely missed. If the NSA surveillance apparatus is everything it's cracked up to be, riddle me this: how the flying fuck can someone post youtube rants for months with titles like, "I'M GOING TO KILL THEM ALL," purchase a gun safe's worth of guns (on the record) in the month before the spree, be tagged multiple times by local law enforcement, and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be in a position to slaughter a slew of innocents?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two answers that fit the bill, take your pick, they're both awful:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The intelligence collected is not being collated, let alone acted upon. See: institutional incompetence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The intelligence is
         <em>
          deliberately
         </em>
         not acted upon.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Either way, that's you and me fucked.

       Definitely an exacerbating factor, I didn't intend to graze over it. But meds aren't the prime cause, just another way to perpetuate/profit off the problem. I say this because improperly prescribed SSRIs are a co-morbidity in many cases, but by no means all cases. Always look to the common denominators in order to isolate the root.

       And I didn't mean to gloss over yours - but the action, the stabbing, the shooting - humans do this shit and have always done it when told to by their superiors; at essence, we're savages - but these kids who haven't lived, these elderly who have lived, these mothers who love their husbands and children and husbands who love their wives and their children - if they're lucky enough to wake up, they wake up perplexed. I think the culture issue is a very, very big reason no one dare mention what the common denominator is.

       The normative folks you describe above are easily herded into this binary debate because of a very natural reluctance to understand the mind of a mass-shooter. It's uncomfortable and painful, and when one really grasps the scale of the problem and how complex the solutions would have to be, one might be excused for retreating into simpler explanations.

       I like how you are thinking about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We like simple answers. The human condition is not as simple as black, white, and grey. I think that it is much closer to the quantum physics model, the observer's position skews the results depending upon the particular polarization involved in the interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote a very long and detailed essay on this subject a few minutes ago, into another virtual box. Then I found the magical keystroke right as I was finishing it that shut down my browser instantly with one finger. I don't even know how that happened, and it was my own hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow. The gist of it was this, to avoid this particular demographic of violence and probably many others, we should lower the "age of self responsibility" to 16 and legalize regulated prostitution. Make sexual education into something that teaches more than the dangers, have it teach about being a decent human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won't do that. It's too polarizing. We will probably just increase the prohibition of civil liberties, increasing violence, and we will try to tame the more base human desires with ever higher levels of immersive reality entertainment. Think Facebook with oculus rift, teaming up with boston dynamics, google, Genentech, fleshlight, and bethesda or rockstar games. Remember how everyone in the Star Trek universe deals with their more base desires over at Quarks?

       But, goddamn, I fucking love this. And you're right. If you look into it, the majority of sex workers have regulars who regard them as substitute GFs. You know, "the GF experience". What this tells us is that for most, regardless of how we've been conditioned by beer commercials, sex is still primarily about connection.
      </p>

       Now, if you can stand to, go to Roger's youtube page. The master theme is loneliness, but pay attention to where it is focused. Roger is an aspiring "alpha male", he feels that he is entitled to "alpha females". Could he have found a perfectly nice girl to hang out and have satisfactory intercourse with? Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he have hired a prostitute? Absolutely. Probably did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he wasn't seeking
       <em>
        connection
       </em>
       . Hell, he wasn't even trawling for sex. He was seeking an object to accessorize and validate his image of himself. He had a very particular idea of the
       <em>
        type
       </em>
       of woman who he
       <em>
        deserved
       </em>
       to be with, and when he failed to attain the object (along with other accessories that would secure his status), he reacted with rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what we're dealing with. At bottom, it is absolutely about our universal desire for connection (to the extent that being a "winner" is tied to feeling worthy of connection), but it's buried under a lot of bullshit for some.

       If I ask nicely, do you think the robots will plug me back in? I miss filet mignon wrapped in bacon and basted with thyme infused cognac. It's cold out here, broken and in exile.... That's a similar sentiment to the idea of always deserving more than you have. Which is not to say that complaining about being legitimately screwed over should be punished, and growing groups of conspiracy theorists are not the root of a problem, they are a symptom.

       An obsession with self image is normal during massive hormonal balance shifts. And it is relatively well documented that between the ages of 16 and 25 people are prone to doing extremely stupid things. I don't suppose that I have a more fair solution that doesn't involve virtual reality or natural selection. The right knowledge in the wrong hands can be very dangerous, so we think it is prudent to keep kids just a bit stupid. It wouldn't be great if everyone knew how to use and make high explosives well before they know how to handle an adult relationship.

       I understand the need to drive technology out of this self harm phase as quickly as possible. But for fucks sake, if we don't look out we will turn ourselves into a cosmic dust cloud or a race of electronically actuated mammalian vegetables. (Like the Borg. Fucking star trek, shaping my mind when I was young. Even the positive programming stings a bit when you recognize it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       See, I don't really believe that it is a few assholes who can effectively control everything... I believe that we have a naturally coalescing form of our own sort of hive-mind reflection and correction system, it's loosely called the arts. As our ability to communicate faster increases, so does the refresh rate of our arts, allowing for sharper clarity and truer balance on the apex when everything focuses... but there are so many of us, that our sentiment swings in extreme over corrections as we are trying to thread the proverbial needle of self imposed extinction level events.

       Each cultural revolution puts tremendous strain upon humanity, like passing an event horizon probably would, we don't know what's on the other side, just that getting there MIGHT suck and kill us all. And everyone is elbowing each other to get a better view of the impending transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that there are people out there who BELIEVE that they are some sort of illuminati, and that they have ultimate control. I know, I have met the type, they say things like "You can solve any problem with $100,000.". These people are nuts and take ridiculous risks, but they don't do much beyond "getting away with murder" only to get pinned for securities fraud. In short, they are ultimately delusional until someone breaks their preening cycle.

       I grew up in a quietly influential household. There ARE some major schemes, but there are also alcoholics with tall tales interspersed with the truth. It's more glamorous for the suits to think they are in on something sneaky. Looking around, that's a dangerous feeling to allow to grow unabated...

       I'm not sure that I'm not crazy, which I think is a sine of true sanity. I just know what I think I will and will not do to survive. Giving up my right to bitch is apparently not one of those things yet. If someone would give me a better seat though, it might just change everything!

       In our day to day lives, we opportunistically "go with the flow" more often than we "follow the program", which is why we have traffic jams. That's the human psyche, just disconnected from each other enough to blame our own mistakes upon others, and stupid enough to not see that helping a hundred people is worth it even if only 95 of them really needed it. If there is fraud in a system, err on the side of treating everyone as genuine in every way and do not start punishing everyone for the sins of a few.

       When you find someone who is obviously wealthy going in for another disgusting scam, stepping over the charred bodies of car wreck victims, stop them. Retire them, If they insist upon a heavy metal credit default swap and one more chance to do good... It's their choice to raise the stakes, and any further bail-out is inhumane. It's like keeping someone alive against their will. These insurance tycoons keep choosing to double and triple dip on the same scam, taking on more banks as they go, and it's catching up to them. It will crumble. The Crypto currency movement is proof of that. Digital coins with high accepted value because they CAN be popped into existence out of thin air by design, but still not as fast as fiat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow. The world is really complex. And I am merely tangential. We are only as powerful as those willing to follow us for reasons that money cannot buy. We passed a tipping point in 08, everyone has been frantically trying to catch it on the way down. I learned that when a top heavy load tips, get the fuck out of it's way.

       Yeah, so here's how that one goes on Reddit: "Correlation does not prove causation! Correlation does not prove causation!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So you pull up and cite the multiple studies that prove the causation (
       <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015337#s1">

       </a>
       or just pubmed search suicidal ideation, lots of data out there, it's been studied ad infinitum, but we don't appear any closer to fixing the problem as we can't even talk about it outside of research settings--I think this is liability-based).
      </p>
      <p>
       You remind the "correlation does not prove causation" people that even the drug manufacturers admit that yeah, there's causation. The FDA requires that the prescribing info has this data, read the labels, guys, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So they just downvote you and move to the next person that brings it up, screeching again "Correlation does not prove causation! Science!" I'm hopeful that people see through the tactic...unfortunately, I think most people are forced to because everyone knows someone affected by it at this point, even if it's just that naked guy that ran down their street that used to be such a nice young boy...:(

       From his manifesto and elsewhere, he apparently stopped taking his Risperdal. Seeing multiple therapists and living in a halfway house, it's hard to know what he was taking (or more likely, what he had been taking and stopped taking). Withdrawal can be hella worse than toxicity in some people. Met a guy like this not too long ago, he was walking to Disney World to meet his wife-to-be. Talking about angels. Didn't seem explicitly dangerous, but how do you know? Now I wonder if I should have called the police, but then look at this situation - the cops weren't able to do much even with the parents' and therapists' advance warnings.

       I would agree with you is the gun grabbing wasn't so obvious, to me it seems like most of these are government assets being used to strip the peoples right to arm themselves, another factor is that many of these shootings seem VERY staged, ie sandy hoax.

       Not trying to be a cockknocker here, but point them out to me, this untapped reserve of the humble and meek. As far as I can tell, the more disenfranchised you are in America, the more likely you are to be loud and arrogant, and the less likely you are to actually take pro-active measures to alleviate your disenfranchisement. Which is no accident, and also serves the interests of the oligarchy.

       Another thing: there's a parallel rise in incidents of family shootings, and for precisely the same reasons. We don't hear about it as often because a. mass shootings = higher body count = more $$$ to be made off of the coverage and b. it's become so commonplace as to drop almost entirely off the radar.
