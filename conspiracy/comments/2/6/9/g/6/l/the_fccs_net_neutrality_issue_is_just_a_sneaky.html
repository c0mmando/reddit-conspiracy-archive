       This has long been my concern and for a while I thought it explained nicely both why government was so eager to do this and why the FCC initially offered up the promise of overturning municipal internet bans as a "compromise."   Because it didn't matter:  either Comcast would censor your internet or your municipal provider would.  The fast and slow lanes are a form of obfuscated censorship, plausible deniability.  Your favorite conspiracy site not working?  Oh, we have no idea why!  I guess they "didn't pay."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why would Comcast censor information that government told it to?  Well, why would Google or Microsoft or AT&amp;T fork over heaps of data to the NSA?  Because "national security."  Why wouldn't internet censorship work the same way?  Comcast gets a National Security Letter telling it to slow down or stop traffic to subversiveinfo.com.  They have to abide, and they can't talk about it, can't question it. Your calls to Comcast about problems with the site will never be answered honestly because they simply aren't legally allowed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history, until the advent of the internet, information was always centralized.  It could easily be controlled.  Books could be burned.  Publishers could be harassed.  The internet has changed all of that.  This is a big problem for governments and their never-ending ratcheting of power.  People are onto it because the information is almost all out there now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put yourself in the government's shoes.  In terms of controlling a populace, there is perhaps no greater issue today than a way to control information flow over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This struggle has already begun.  Notice the recent increase in propaganda demonizing "conspiracies" and "conspiracy theorists."  Eventually it will start to become an overt national security issue.  It will be said outright that such information and such people are dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the FCC's version of net neutrality will be defeated.  But there are other ways to censor.  Stay vigilant.  Explain to people why conspiracies and skepticism are healthy forms of thought.  And why they are vital to a free and open society.   This battle is not over.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr
       </strong>
       Net neutrality allows, in principle, for censorship to occur by confining certain info to the slowest lanes.  Given the surveillance state NSA revelations, journalist/whistleblower harassment, and the seeming indifference to blatant corruption, I think
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       are the fool if you think that instituting a
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       to internet censorship won't result in
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       censorship.  Please.  The US government has lost all credibility, we pretty much have to assume the worst from them.

       "As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master."
