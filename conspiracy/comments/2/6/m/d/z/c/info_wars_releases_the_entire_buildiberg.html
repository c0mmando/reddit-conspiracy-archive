       The list of names has got fuck all to do with Alex Jones. Maybe you could address the content and not shoot the messenger. No wonder people are so sensitive when the same incredibly stupid arguments get put forward so often.
      </p>
      <p>
       "AJ's a retard" doesn't detract from any of the information or what potential discussions these people have. And to everyone who sees nothing wrong and points out that there is no proof of any type of conspiratorial discussions happening at these meetings, consider this. Pick nearly any of these people from the list (especially someone like Kissinger/Perle/Alexander etc) and tell me why you think they will be talking about nice fluffy things? It makes perfectly logical sense that when two or more pieces of shit get together with track records of being so and discuss things, it's likely they aren't talking about democracy.

       it just gets back to the root of how you do research and provide info. some want an original source (me). Others want an editorial that tells them not what, but what to think (people who watch fox news, cnn, and read infowars).

       And then there are people who see that reality is so much more complicated than that. The lack of an original source does not prove anything. Editorials that sell narratives aren't completely useless either - it's worth noting who it is that wants to sell you a story, and what that story is.

       Check his sources. I used to be a huge fan, loved his documentaries, listened to the radio show, etc, but I noticed over time, he's lost it. I think 'they' got to him. Quite a few of the articles on his page are outright fake, his sources are usually shoddy at best, and his methods are loony. He just comes off as insane and he lacks credence. Like most disinformation agents, it's lies with sprinkles of truth.

       I also think he's right about Assange and Snowden too, in terms of limited hangout theory as they're CIA frontrunners to prime the public for the massive surveillance state, the first helped to destabilize sovereign middle eastern nations.

       I think he turned around 2006. Just too much of what he says isn't based in fact. Certainly, he was spot on several times, but I listened to his radio show too many times hearing him trying to predict the next 9/11 with no results at all. He's a sensationalist. I'm thankful that he opened the veil for me, but I think today, he's pulling a whole new veil in front of the people that trust him. Who's to say that he himself isn't an agent to soften us up either? And reporting geopolitical corruption isn't exactly difficult; in the world today, it's harder to find a story about a sincere politician that isn't shoveling money in his pockets under the table.

       I only started listening to him recently and he certainly does a lot of prophetizing, sometimes his over reaction is laughable but the base of his arguments is unfortunately true.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is he priming us for the new world order? Coming out of the fake right vs left paradox only two to three months ago and finding Alex only this May of 2014, he's still very insulated from the mainstream public as a racist Libertarian gun loving nutjob, not a lot of mainstreamers are into the "conspiracies" of the truth movement, however there's a lot of potential as people are becoming increasing resentful and intrusting of the governing establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm personally finding a lot of new stuff from Alex's perspective, however after seeing this aptly named "Snowjob", I too would prefer to keep a multitude of sources then to stick to a messiah of sorts, as the sheep are doing with sold out Greenwald and Chomsky.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly not a bad thing to be skeptical, I can understand your criticisms of Alex Jones.

       I think you're right ton Alex Jones, I starting digging and found some good blogs discussing the issue of Jones. Mostly what I found was that he's Zionist shill using fear mongering to control and bottle conspirators and free thinkers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes me also wonder about the stuff he's peddling, nascent iodine, etc, if its all garbage as well.

       Part of the reason the downvotes are coming is because Alex Jones is in the title. More and more ppl are questioning his motives and who is behind infowars.

       Hmm if i was part of the government and i know most people in the usa believes in one or more conspiracy's i would feed them so much they couldn't see what was real and what wasn't . And i then lead them to where i want them. I think they are trying to prepare us for the coming age. Plus go and talk to some old people about the way people used to be and you will find out that most people didn't care about human life at all and seen the world end a very different way. Trust me things are getting better even with all the crazy in the world today.

       The nature of the people that visit this sub is to be suspicious. If there is someone out there that makes a name for themself, speaking of conspiracies and things of that nature, the audience they would have is the exact same people that would believe that they have ulterior motives. It's basically the people that ask questions of the government eating their own .

       I've seen a lot of evidence that points toward ties between Infowars and Ted Turner. Yes, Jones puts out some good information I will not deny that, but any legitimate controlled opposition outlet HAS to deliver some goods to the viewers; otherwise they will lose the audience. I was a big Alex Jones fan for years, but his work on the Turner owned (and total BS show IMO) truTv's "Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory" along with his appearance in 2 motion pictures make me apprehensive.

       Turner's business partner the now deceased Boris Berezovsky was involved in starting up anti-government media outlets in Russia in the 90's, some of these actually inspired armed insurrections resulting in deaths. Sometimes Jones likes to encourage people here in the US to maybe do something similar.

       that's clearly a wierd thing he's done, with the y2k russian nuke thing. truly disappointing. 
But it was about 15 years ago and listening to the man everyday for the past three years, I can see for myself he's clearly not a false prophet.

       He never ever mentions knights of Malta, which is a huge red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knights of Malta are extremely influential and almost always destructive. Silvio Berlusconi, George H.W Bush, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, Precott Bush, Tony Blair, Michael Chertoff, Rudy Giuliani, J. Edgar Hoover, Rupert Murdock, Amschel Mayer von Rothschild, David Rockefeller and Ted Turner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes you wonder why he(a christian) won't report on conspiracies regarding knights of malta(a christian corp). He's also very soft on Jesuits and their reach.

       I've heard callers question him about the Jesuits and the KoM several times on-air and he quickly diverts the conversation, or ends the call.  However, I wouldn't discount all information he puts out just because he's reluctant to discuss either group.  The Ted Turner information above is of more concern to me, particularly Turner's deceased partner's activities in starting anti-government media agencies.

       One thing I hate about conspiracy theories in general is that so many of the loudest community members can't be bothered to take spelling seriously.  If you can't even write the name of what you're talking about, no one is going to take you seriously.

       I noticed a fairly strange name in that list - Kasim Reed is the mayor of Atlanta, GA. Why in the world is he in attendance for this? If you live in/around Atlanta you are probably aware that there is quite a buzz in the air with new things being built basically everywhere constantly (two new sports stadiums coming up by 2017). Seeing his name here makes me really contemplate what the future plans for Atlanta could be. Thoughts?

       I recognize few of the names, offices or companies. Why do these unelected assholes have power over us? Also, I suspect many of them are just the representatives of wealthy monsters. We're not supposed to recognize their names but we would recognize their owners.

       Is there any demonstrable evidence that these Bilderberg meetings amount to anything?  It's not illegal to get together and discuss politics, governments, companies, policy etc.  I get that it is frightening that all of these powerhouses all meet in one place, but what is the problem?  What are we fearing these meetings for?

       When a detailed list is released that tells us who is going and where its going to be then I wouldn't really consider these meetings secret.  Private as fuck?  Yes. But I wouldn't call them a secret. But yeah, I do kinda wish I knew what they talked about and that is why I asked if there was evidence demonstrating that we should actually care about these meetings.

       I'll ask you again to look at the list of names and do some research on who these people are and the things they've done over the last 50+ years.  These are globalists and powerful people in all industries and from all around the world.  If you don't see why we should care about these meetings and what goes on in them then I really don't know what else to tell you.

       Alright I swear to Moloch im not shilling here, but I had a professor in college who went to bilderberg a couple years back.  We asked her about it during lecture one day and she said its basically a time for leaders to talk shop without the media getting all up in their faces.  She said the reason for the secrecy is to encourage frank discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was a researcher on neuroethics and went with the goal of getting other leaders to think more realistically about so called "study drugs"

       These conferences and think tanks work the same way as secret societies and religions. There is a hierarchy and as you advance, you gain additional knowledge.  Bilderberg and bohemian grove (which you are referencing with your moloch joke) are both organized in this fashion.  There are many discussion groups and speakers are invited to take part in the outer circle discussions to provide insights on their specialties.  In this years conference, there are two chinese banking ministers invited.  They clearly aren't going to be privy to the real occidentalist discussions that the meeting is based around.

However, it is the side bars with powerful leaders and corporate business men, this is where info and directions are passed, this is where real decisions are made....main group is a cover, oh and I'm sure many things are done prior to this meeting, i.e. ok lets meet and discuss or convince at the meeting....

       I hate to be THAT guy, but will you please share the name of your professor who claims to have attended?  I'd be very curious how she received an invite while nut-peddling away as a college professor...

       Sounds like his prof went in more of an 'advisory' capacity. I would imagine they invite all sorts of experts in their field, but that they see only the outer circle of meetings that go on. Publicly reported meetings &amp; seminars would lend the whole thing legitimacy, but the real Bilderberg stuff would go on behind closed doors that the researchers &amp; other experts never even know exists.

       The nature of the people that visit this sub is to be suspicious. If there is someone out there that makes a name for themself, speaking of conspiracies and things of that nature, the audience they would have is the exact same people that would believe that they have ulterior motives. It's basically the people that ask questions of the government eating their own .

       I've heard callers question him about the Jesuits and the KoM several times on-air and he quickly diverts the conversation, or ends the call.  However, I wouldn't discount all information he puts out just because he's reluctant to discuss either group.  The Ted Turner information above is of more concern to me, particularly Turner's deceased partner's activities in starting anti-government media agencies.
