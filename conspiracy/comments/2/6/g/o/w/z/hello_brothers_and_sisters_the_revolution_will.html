       Did you know that no matter what you write, it cannot reach the front page of reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know no matter how persuasive you are, how RIGHT you are, you cannot reach the general population on this "social media" website?  It's not for profit.  It's intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       was killed for that reason.  Then, when we got too popular,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was banned from
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when we moved to other subs to get our message out,
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       was taken off the default.  That closed the last avenue for pure rhetoric on reddit.  The last avenue for actual pure communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullshit subs, frivolous subs were put in instead.  No politics or police brutality in
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       .  No videos in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .  Because the best medium for persuasion is the most dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we rallied against surveillance,
       <a href="/r/RestoretheFourth">
        /r/RestoretheFourth
       </a>
       was hamstrung before it got to the street.  It was nerfed, 100%.  We HAD momentum.  We HAD intrest.  People SAW, for a day, or two, that we were right.  That was all we needed. We got fucking
       <em>
        nerfed
       </em>
       .   On purpose.  People who were watching know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we stuck to the news, our posts were deleted, our comments were shadowbanned.  The government paid people to spread false information.  The corporations paid people to cover our legitimate discussions with advertisements.  This is still happening.  It is getting worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been ghettoized.  We're a growing ghetto.  We're sometimes on point.  But we're a ghetto.  We're becoming irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this different from CNN?  How is this Web 2.0?  How is this 2.0
       <em>
        anything?
       </em>
       This is the same shit.  The same shit, my friends.  The same shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       When things change, when things really begin to change, when people are in the street, when water cannons are on, when people are not coming home, when you need to know what is happening, what is true, what is right, ask yourself:
      </p>

       It won't be on reddit per say, but once the true tail of the monied interests entangled within the administrative web of influence on this website become clear it will start here.

       When I say "it" I mean the progression towards a new aggregate medium. Digg v4 was so easy to pindown because of the redesign. Reddit inc is not that stupid and their fall from grace is only going to come about via

       We need this now.  We need this before the new Greenwald reports come out and are censored.  We need it before TPP is passed.  We need it before the next Occupy.  We need it before the economy breaks.

       Like all the recent posts allowing Will Farrell to plug his products and himself. With massive upvotes. I don't believe he has that kind of popularity on Reddit so I believe he purchased his front page placement.

       Worse have been the submissions showing the war criminal George Bush in a positive light. The last being in

       The more overt the manipulation gets, the more momentum we'll have to move to a new, decentralized platform when it's ready.  With all the innovation happening in blockchain-based protocols, I don't think it's far off.

       I was just thinking that. A mesh net with a block-chain protocol for a distributed communications platform. With 3d layered NAND flash, we will have some impressive storage capabilities that could make data redundancy nearly a non-issue. A system where what you write publicly can be ignored, but it cannot be hidden, and what you write privately cannot be intercepted.

       we should setup some diaspora servers ... i've always wanted to see how well it works after all the creator 'committed suicide' the day before it was released ... so it must be good hehe ... from what i can gather its like a distributed social media site where you only share what you want whilst you're online ... if you leave the group so does your data.

       The surveillance state does have a chilling effect. I could be worried about voltage drop reduction across multiple integrated position sensor systems causing packet corruption under certain operating conditions... but noooooo, we have to fuck with uncle sam because he's getting all uppity, fucking with the internet that our tax dollars developed, thinking that he's better than the common citizen.

       I watched it happen but even still, the same people came out the woodwork, chastised those with the warnings and continued unfettered and then escalated it to a point where a few people chose to delete their accounts because of threats. All the angles are covered and the subs where you could bring information to attention have been subjugated and even new ones made ahead of time to mitigate any problems they might have.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happened on Digg and the exact same behaviour is on display. Offsite planning of down voting, burying, stalking and threats by the same people. It's got less to do with this sub and conspiracy theories and more to do with the bigger picture of censorship
       <strong>
        sitewide
       </strong>
       with the acquisition of major subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, it hardly ever leaves this sub-reddit and it's instantly scoffed at even though it's true.

       You know that the only reason they haven't banned
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       yet is because the sub is useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is useful for them to see what the most persuasive leaks and beliefs are, all in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also useful for throwing off the trail of readers by muddling the water with sock puppet accounts posting counter-propaganda and votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only true danger of this sub they already have taken care of, and that's to make sure that what happens in this sub stays in this sub. It's why this sub is blocked in so many ways and can't be advertised. It is harmless as long as it doesn't gain the attention of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as that remains true,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is merely a free wiretap for them into the demographic of would - be revolutionists and skeptics, as well as an opportunity to confuse information and  make the demographic look as stupid as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are really serious about conspiracies you will have to go somewhere other than reddit.

       The most popular website for corrupting online mediums has had closed markets for reddit influence since at least 2012. A lot of you probably know what I'm talking about, the color scheme is black and gold, and that is just the most popular one. I expect there have been groups going back far longer. I moderate a few subreddits that are small scale but relatively successful, and I see corruption seeping into them daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       On
       <a href="/r/happygirls">
        /r/happygirls
       </a>
       , just yesterday, I think I saw one of our most active contributors since forever doing for profit linking of crappy and inappropriate content, and that is
       <a href="/r/happygirls">
        /r/happygirls
       </a>
       , which was a VERY positive place originally, and isn't even a good place to make money via corruption. Fucking TwoX has let the SRS types run so rampant that they're sending themselves hate mail to influence public opinion and being called out by admins. The bullshit I've dealt with where it's actually possible to make money, and these are small scale subreddits, is beyond belief. I really don't believe the simplest explanation on some of it, and I'm not even one of the most active mods there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, suspecting everything on here is definitely a good idea now. There are still truly altruistic efforts, but it's not anything like it once was.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still enough active intelligent users that you can call out bullshit sometimes, but for God's sake, or the spaghetti monster's, or whatever you value, be fucking cynical of most of the bullshit on here.

       The problem is, now practically all of the larger subreddits have been compromised, infiltrated by moderators who are either hardline Zionists and/or statists. The only exception I know of, as far as I'm aware, is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the most seemingly innocuous subs, given enough subscribers or content they deem worth censoring, have become a victim of this. For example, I tried to post an article to
       <a href="/r/nottheonion">
        /r/nottheonion
       </a>
       today only to discover it had been removed by their automoderator:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your submission has been removed, rt.com is not an allowed source at
        <a href="/r/nottheonion">
         /r/nottheonion
        </a>
        . rt.com frequently quotes other sources for their news. Please review the article that was not accepted, and resubmit using the original source of the story.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Only, RT
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       the primary source for this article, and it was not political in nature nor regarding foreign policy matters such as Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks prior, I had posted a link containing a compilation of photographs showing victims of a recent drone strike, sourced primarily from non-Western news outlets, to
       <a href="/r/MorbidReality">
        /r/MorbidReality
       </a>
       . Shortly after it was removed and I was banned. When I asked why, one of their mods (
       <a href="/u/KingMswati">
        /u/KingMswati
       </a>
       ) responded with a multi-paragraph rant about me being a "conspiratard" and that I was not welcome there because their readers are "relatively intelligent", a response laden with profanity, insults and ridicule, and of course false accusations of "racism" out of nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further instigate matters,
       <a href="/u/KingMswati">
        /u/KingMswati
       </a>
       and one of the other mods from
       <a href="/r/MorbidReality">
        /r/MorbidReality
       </a>
       then repeatedly reported me to the site's administrators for "spamming" in an attempt to have my account banned, basically because they didn't agree with what I had posted. Basically, a flawed back-handed attempt at censorship. I later learned this individual (
       <a href="/u/KingMswati">
        /u/KingMswati
       </a>
       ) is an
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       regular, and yet another hardline Zionist turned reddit gatekeeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months prior to that that, I was banned from
       <a href="/r/humanrights">
        /r/humanrights
       </a>
       immediately after posting an article regarding the plight of Palestinians, after posting a few others regarding Palestinians only recently. I was one of the top contributors of that sub at the time, posting stories and news regarding the human rights of all people, from all walks of life and all ethnicities, but of course when it came to Palestinians I was banned. And when I asked why I couldn't even get a straight answer. Eventually they claimed my submission was "spammy" which was utterly ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I've experienced first hand not only the rampant censorship on reddit, in subs one wouldn't even expect to be politically censored, but some of the most vile, hostile interactions I've had yet on reddit with these individuals, who just happened to be hardline Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears these Zionists pieces of shit somehow weaseled (or coerced_ their way into moderating nearly every sub of significance, from those moderated by
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       , to
       <a href="/r/restorethefouth">
        /r/restorethefouth
       </a>
       to
       <a href="/r/humanrights">
        /r/humanrights
       </a>
       , and even
       <a href="/r/nottheonion">
        /r/nottheonion

       I understand your frustration. Reddit is not the shining beacon of organized free speech on the internet we need, but it's the reddit we got. Besides, I still get good info here.

       It certainly will not be on reddit.  We'll all be tearing apart the revolution because it is illegal and its participants are out-of-control nutcases, and thank goodness the police and FBI are tracking all of them down.

       It won't be televised due to media and message control, it would not be televised because there is something else on, like friends reruns.

       There will be no revolution, Web 3.0 will be a trust less consensus based platform and it will slowly phase out all form of government like a virus. The first application is Bitcoin. The second will be replacing centralized authority with a consensus based voting on everything we do and the best part is no one can stop it. The Technology is invented and its already taking over. in 10 years the world will be completely different and national boundaries will start to dissolve. Get into bitcoin now look up block chain technology and read how its going to change everything.
