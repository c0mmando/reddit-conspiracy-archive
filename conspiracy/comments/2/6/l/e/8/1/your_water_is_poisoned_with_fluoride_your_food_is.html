    <div class="md"><p>You have to differentiate between cancers. In the US lung and bronchus cancer is overall dropping significantly for men and slowing for women, because people are smoking less. Those rates are dropping and were always the more significant cancers next to breast (female) and prostata (male) cancers. Prostata cancer skyrocked 1992 and is going down since.</p>

<p>Cancer rates go up for other cancers. Fluoride is associated with thyroid cancer and the rates are going up. Aspartame is destroying your kidney and affects genes associated with cancer. Most probably aspartame is causing liver cancer. Kidney and renal pelvis cancer rates are going up in the US. Melanoma of skin and liver cancer rates are both going up. Sodium lauryl sulfate and also Aluminum are thought to cause skin cancer. You get both from cosmetics.</p>

<p>You are quite right, different cancers most be studied individually.  Some communities fluoridate their water, others don&#39;t.  If you know of any studies that shown communities with fluoridated water have higher rates of thyroid cancer I would be interested in reading it.  If you have articles on the other chemicals and their association with cancer I would like to see that to.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>acknowledge the last observation I made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I avoided discussing worldwide cancer rates in detail, because the mathematics  are hard to understand if you are not a researcher like me.</p>

<p>Your links say the <em>total number of cancers</em> worldwide are increasing. However I never asked you if the <em>total number of cancers</em> worldwide was increasing.  I asked you if the <strong>age-adjusted</strong>  cancer <strong>rate</strong>
was increasing.</p>

<p>The total number of cancers is going up in the world.  The main reason is because the population is increasing, and more people means more cancers. That why people always ask for the <strong>cancer rate,</strong> which is the number of cancers divided by the population.  You never provided this information.  Also cancer mostly occurs in old people, and the old people are increasing at a faster percentage than young people, and this also causes the total number of cancers to increase.  You therefore have to do an <strong>age-adjusted</strong> cancer rate calculation.</p>

<p>After doing an age-adjusted cancer <em>rate</em> analysis, cancer rates worldwide are decreasing somewhat in the developed world, and increasing somewhat in the less developed world.  Reasons are unclear.  We doctors tend to blame smoking which has increased in the less developed world as these people get richer.  This is not absolutely proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you deflect and shift the goal posts, acknowledge the last observation I made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I may point out my first post discussed the US cancer rate.  I am not shifting the goal posts, I am returning to my first discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;This increase is driven by cancer diagnosed in older adults and minorities&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We know that the US population will grow, and grow older, by 2030. We also know that cancer becomes more common as we age, but it&#39;s not inevitable,&quot; said AICR Registered Dietitian Alice Bender.</p>

<p>Rate of cancer in Males (only in US) declining since 1990.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RsxgMj2.png">http://i.imgur.com/RsxgMj2.png</a></p>

<p>Women shows a similar trend.  </p>

<p>At the same time the population is growing by millions (the previous 14 years has been 36 million) <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7HR6ZM.png">http://i.imgur.com/W7HR6ZM.png</a></p>

<p>So age and minority growth coupled with pure population growth increase the number of incidences without increasing the actual rate (or number per 1 x 10<sup>x)</sup></p>

<p>I hope you understand people know that Cancer is a mainly environmental cause, and the statistics you bring up are important even if the rate is going down.  The problem is science is trying to define a cause and improve living and you&#39;re blabbering about some nonsense that isn&#39;t going to help anyone.  </p>

<p>The incidence of cancer worldwide is growing at an alarming pace, and there is an urgent need to implement strategies to prevent and curb the disease, according to a report from the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>New cancer cases will skyrocket globally from an estimated 14 million in 2012 to 22 million new cases a year within the next two decades, the report says. During that same period, cancer deaths are predicted to rise from an estimated 8.2 million annually to 13 million a year.</p>

<p>Nonsense.  As I pointed out US cancer rates are <em>also down</em> not just mortality.  Stop trying to make an argument I already corrected.</p>

<p><strong>If all these chemicals are causing cancer rates to rise world wide  why aren&#39;t they causing cancer rates (not mortality) to rise in the United States? We have lots of fluoride, GMO&#39;s and aspartame.</strong>  This is a legitimate argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you use a base number rise? Wouldn&#39;t a percentage of incidence rise be more accurate?</p>

<p>Just so I don&#39;t confuse you...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 1990, there were 600,000 men in Nevada. But by 2005 that number rose by 200% to 1.25 million men in Nevada.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t say anything about anything. It could mean that the men killed all the women and cloned themselves. It could mean that all the women transfigured into men. It could mean that all the women moved out, and men moved in. It could mean that the entire population grew and the rate of men grew in proportion. The only way numbers like this matter is to compare rates with rates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Nevada in 1990 men made up 50.92% of the population. In 2005, they made up 50.70% of the population.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RATES matter in population dynamics. Numbers seriously don&#39;t mean a damn thing. <strong>The moment I see somebody quoting numbers and ignoring rates (as you do above), I know they are being disingenuous.</strong></p>

<p>In cancer or any other disease-rate studies, you would link to incidence. So (pulling numbers out of my ass to show you what data you should be quoting) 120 out of 100,000 people get cancer after the age of 15 in 2010, and 240 out of 100,000 people get cancer after the age of 15 in 2030. THAT would be significant data.</p>

<p>Though, to be fair, it would be better data to do age &amp; rate breakdown. So, for example, you can see &quot;Oh, people who were between 5 and 15 during 1973 got this type of cancer in their 50&#39;s at a rate 2x higher than other groups&quot;. This way you can look at what happened in 1973.</p>

<p>If any of what you say is true, you&#39;d see cancer rates lower for people with less fluoride in their water. You&#39;d see cancer rates lower for people who don&#39;t eat MSG. You&#39;d see cancer rates lower with people who don&#39;t eat GMOs. And these are things that you can test for in population statistics. This is how you find the actual causes of things rather than the heuristic paranoid bullshit you&#39;re spewing.</p>

<p>Cancer incidence is the total number of cancers, and that increases because the population increases.</p>

<p>Cancer rate is the number of cancers divided by the population.  Cancer rate is the term <strong>you used</strong> in your original post.  You can&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t exist.  You have never provided data on cancers <strong>rates</strong>.</p>

<p>Talking to the rest of you out there, everybody knows that when you study cancer, you talk about the cancer rate, not the cancer incidence.  From the very first, I have talked about the cancer <strong>rate</strong>.  Everybody knows that the number of cancers should double if the population doubles.  That why you calculate the rate.  You divide the number of cancers by the population to see if the <strong>rate</strong> per 100,000 people changes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is not an artifical flavoring.  It is a naturally occurring amino acid that can be isolated from seaweed.  It has been used for more than 100 years as a taste additive.  There is no risk of toxicity, and no study has ever been able to prove any sort of health issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I checked out a book from the library one time called &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Color-Additives-George-Burdock/dp/0849394120">The Encyclopedia of Food Additives</a>&quot; I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, apparently food manufacturers are allowed to call a product &quot;natural&quot; if it only contains ingredients that can commonly be found in a residential kitchen. This is according to what this book states as the FDA definition.</p>

<p>So... I guess, according to this strange definition, a residential kitchen may contain aspartame and MSG, so a product that uses these ingredients may be allowed to fall under the &quot;natural&quot; category?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not totally sure as it is the strangest definition for &quot;natural&quot; I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Although, I just went to double check by doing a quick search, and apparently <a href="http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm214868.htm">the FDA has no idea what the fuck they are doing.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a food science perspective, it is difficult to define a food product that is &#39;natural&#39; because the food has probably been processed and is no longer the product of the earth. That said, FDA has not developed a definition for use of the term natural or its derivatives. However, the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances.</p>

Obesity and growth hormone deficiency due to slightly above average glutamate intake
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16132059">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16132059</a></p>

<p>From the previous study: &quot;<strong>The present study for the first time demonstrates, that a widely used nutritional monosubstance--the flavouring agent MSG--at concentrations that only slightly surpass those found in everyday human food, exhibits significant potential for damaging the hypothalamic regulation of appetite, and thereby determines the propensity of world-wide obesity</strong>. We suggest to reconsider the recommended daily allowances of amino acids and nutritional protein, and to abstain from the popular protein-rich diets, and particularly from adding the flavouring agents MSG.&quot;</p>

<p>More on too much glutamate and obesity <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14513871">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14513871</a></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>Most of the studies on rats used a dose of 4mg per gram of body weight, which is quite large, about 10 times more than the average person will consume in a day. It is also important to note that most of the studies on rats used injections or oral administration of MSG, so it wasn&#39;t consumed as it normally is: in food. Some studies in humans seem to indicate that consuming MSG in food illicits less health problems than being administered the same dosage on its own. See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10736382">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10736382</a></p>

<p>Overall, I think a little bit of MSG with food seems to be mostly safe, unless you are particularly sensitive to it. Most people can probably eat a little bit of MSG in food and be fine, as long as they&#39;re not eating large amounts. However, <strong>even slightly larger than normal amounts of MSG seem to have the potential to cause health problems</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true. It was proven to be a &quot;real thing&quot;. What they did find is that there is absolutely no benefit for those whom avoid gluten in their diets if they do not have gluten sensitivity. For a select few, its a thing that they need to worry about. For everyone else, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>At least, that&#39;s what I took from reading the recent findings.</p>

<p>Edit: Feel like I didn&#39;t explain it well. The findings indicated that avoiding gluten is useless unless you are one of the few, rare people whom are actually sensitive to it. This makes sense to most of us. A lot of people who are the &quot;all natural organic&quot; type eaters (you know the people) have been going gluten free for a long time now and its only been a detriment to their health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which nerve cells are damaged and killed by excessive stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances.</strong> This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated by Glutamatergic Storm. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions[2] (Ca2+) to enter the cell. Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.</p>

<p>Excitotoxicity may be involved in spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing loss (through noise overexposure or ototoxicity) and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson&#39;s disease, alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal and especially over-rapid benzodiazepine withdrawal, and also Huntington&#39;s disease.[3][4] Other common conditions that cause excessive glutamate concentrations around neurons are hypoglycemia[5] and status epilepticus.[6]</p>

<p>History</p>

<p>The harmful effect of glutamate upon the CNS were first observed in 1954 by T. Hayashi, a Japanese scientist who noted that direct application of glutamate to the CNS caused seizure activity, though this report went unnoticed for several years. The toxicity of glutamate was then observed by D. R. Lucas and J. P. Newhouse in 1957, when the subcutaneous injection of <strong>monosodium glutamate</strong> to newborn mice destroyed the neurons in the inner layers of the retina.[7] Later, in 1969, John Olney discovered the phenomenon was not restricted to the retina, but occurred throughout the brain, and coined the term excitotoxicity. He also assessed that cell death was restricted to postsynaptic neurons, that glutamate agonists were as neurotoxic as their efficiency to activate glutamate receptors, and that glutamate antagonists could stop the neurotoxicity.[8] Subsequent research by Mark Mattson provided evidence for the involvement of excitotoxicity in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and other age-related neurodegenerative conditions that involve oxidative stress and cellular energy deficits.</p>

<p>Unami is the 5th taste bud, and my personal favorite.  The brown bits on bread, ripe tomatoes, parmesan cheese, cooked meats.  All of those  taste as good as they do because of glutmates.  MSG (it looks like white cane sugar granules) is just delicious.</p>

Reddit is being gamed by corporate influence in obvious ways, but to assert that some clandestine group is controlling a highly specific sub using thousands of dummy (yet totally active) accounts is ridiculous.  A bunch of conspiracy people talking about conspiracies amongst themselves is a threat to nobody.   People like OP (and possibly you, apparently) making ridiculous claims based on sketchy or no sources is what&#39;s driving that sub, not any shadow group.</p>

<p>Do you have any proof what-so-ever that JTRIG is targetting online forums?</p>

<p>Haha, dude.  JTRIG <em>exists</em> to target online forums.  You&#39;re sitting here arguing with me and you don&#39;t even know the most basic facts about it?  That&#39;s embarrassing.</p>

<p>Here you go, I&#39;ll enlighten you:</p>

<p>&quot;Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material <strong>onto the internet</strong> in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate <strong>online discourse</strong> and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (<strong>posting material to the internet</strong> and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” <strong>on various forums</strong>.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s reasonable to believe is that JTRIG exists (obviously), what&#39;s unreasonable to believe is that it&#39;s actively targetting this specific subreddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t it?  We know it exists to discredit anti-government discussion, so why wouldn&#39;t it exist here, one of the largest online discussion forums that exists on the internet?  Can you think of a valid reason why they would target <em>other</em> forums but not this one?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s actively targetting this specific subreddit on reddit.com using thousands of dummy accounts and an entire subreddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a childlike position to take.</p>

<p>I can only surmise that you have never actually read that sub, because otherwise you would realize that the entire purpose of the sub is to ridicule Reddit, other Redditors, Reddit trends, Reddit cliches, Reddit subs, and so on. The sub is <em>right now</em> devoting itself to an extensive ridiculing of r/adviceanimals, and in the past has offered a wealth of ridicule to r/atheism, r/iama, r/til, and many others.</p>

<p>The <em>whole purpose</em> of the sub is mockery, and specifically the mockery of the common tropes, people and topics you see on Reddit, usually those found on the default subs.</p>

<p>That sub has been tolerated for many years and in no way violates Reddit&#39;s rules because mockery and ridicule has always been allowed.</p>

<p>TL:DR - &quot; The results suggest that large doses of MSG given without
food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG.
However, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent and were not
reproducible. The responses were not observed when MSG was given with food.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a pretty generic two paragraphs. Swishing tap water in your mouth would help in a very small manner, but it has very little contact with your teeth. The whole point is that it helps when it comes in contact with your mouth, not swallowing it.

<p>This would be true if you didn&#39;t cook with or drink the water you brushed your teeth with. But.. cooking, drinking and brushing with fluoridated water would be extremely common in municipalities with fluoridated water right?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want cavities you need to brush and floss. That is the number one contributor to increased dental health in the last 100 years. By far. Fluoride water treatment does not even register on the scale next to dental care awareness and practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your a scepticism, I would like to note, that several trace amounts of fluoride over the course of a day accumulate to an amount that might not be safe an longer. Having it in the water supply makes the effective daily dose of what is essentially a dental drug dependent on the drinking habits of the subject. Why not just put it in toothpaste and nothing else. Toothpaste makes for a relatively predictable amount, water does not.</p>

<p>Think about this. Insulin has been used as a replacement for electro-shock therapy for years. You drink Big Gulp after Big Gulp, along with eating Twinkies and Coco Puffs, flooding your system with sugar that it is evolutionarily not designed to handle. Over time, your insulin response gets fucked (type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome). And insulin doesn&#39;t just regulate the breakdown of sugar, but is also an important hormone.</p>

<p>If your body is flooded with insulin, day after day, it fucks with your brain as well as your body. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to have to ask for a reputable source that fluoride is a neurotoxin at the levels in US water supplies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the wrong question. What you want to know is what is the average level of fluoride exposure for a person in a given municipality that has fluoridated water. And the answer for that question does not exist because no one would pay for that kind of study to be done.</p>

<p>You might have a lab study that says x amount of fluoride per x time period for x weight/age/health conditions is &quot;dangerous&quot;. But that won&#39;t tell you whether you or your neighbor is ingesting dangerous levels of fluoride. </p>

<p>Ask the correct questions and don&#39;t look for answers here. Go and ask the people you are trusting your water treatment with. They should know right? They don&#39;t. They will tell you they follow guidelines. Well.. those guidelines do not take into account a specific communities level of fluoride exposure through food, environment etc. For the most part, if you live in North America and eat the average North American diet the fluoride added in your water is not helping you. You may even have fluorosis along with cavities. </p>

<p>Splicing insect DNA into plants isn&#39;t even remotely similar to breeding plants...</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m going to use this analogy that I just thought up from now on:</p>

<p>Saying that GMOs = cross-breeding is like saying genetically splicing a human with a dog is the same as a British person and a French person having a kid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe so, but there is no reason to expect/think that splicing in parts of insect DNA into plants would have any negative side effects to the consumer unless that specific DNA was responsible for a process that results in the production of something in the plant that is then harmful to consume.  </p>

<p>DNA is simply code that results in certain biological functions. It is not enough to say that changing the DNA is bad.  You need to point to specific new biological function as a result of the tampering with DNA that has some kind of detrimental impact on the consumer, maybe I am ignorant and out of the loop but thus far everything I have seen that is anti-gmo is pretty much just fear-mongering about the big bad science.</p>

<p>Wrong. Negative health effects can take time to present themselves. Cancer can take months or years to appear, at which point it can be impossible to determine what caused it.</p>

<p>The whole reason the question of the danger of genetic modification even exists is because we don&#39;t fully understand it or its consequences. If we did, we&#39;d already have the perfect vegetable, because it would be as you say &quot;simply code&quot; - which it is not.</p>

<p>For all the times people use the phrase &quot;playing God&quot;, GMO science is just about as close as you can get before you&#39;re literally creating a Frankenstein&#39;s Monster. We haven&#39;t even classified all the species on the planet. We have only a limited idea of how our own genome even works. We don&#39;t understand ourselves, and a company that globally tries to lock farmers into their proprietary non-reproductive seedbase is playing demi-god with everyone&#39;s food while their employees get themselves installed in the FDA.</p>

<p>Ok, give me a specific example of some kind of biological or chemical material found in a GMO food crop that has been spliced with dna from another species that is not found in its non-spliced contemporary and would make any amount of sense as something that may contribute to an increased cancer risk due to consumption/exposure.</p>

<p>You can just say we don&#39;t fully understand it and it could cause cancer of some kind some day somehow so it shouldn&#39;t be released into the public without some kind of specific concern and &quot;but cancer&#39; is not a specific concern.  </p>

<p>The efficiency clause in that sentence was in reference to the idea (though admittedly not well-laid out in my comment) that one gene does not do one thing. One hormone does not do one thing. We evolve to utilize things in many ways and have our genes interact with each other in an efficient manner.</p>

How does this contribute to cancer? small traces of any pesticide or herbicide in your gut can contribute to the destruction of healthy bacteria colonies. Bacteria needed to digest and assimilate food and the nutrients in it. Over time a lack of these healthy bacteria can lead to all kinds of unwanted medical conditions... including cancer.

<p>Toothpaste: How Safe?</p>

<p>By Don Oldenburg
Washington Post Staff Writer</p>

<p>Last month, as 8-year-old Molly Statt stood in the bathroom brushing her teeth, something on the back of the large-size tube of Crest caught her attention. She stopped brushing.</p>

<p>Looking up at her father standing beside her, she motioned to the toothpaste and asked, “Is this poison?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Paul Statt reassured his daughter.</p>

<p>“Then why does it say ‘poison’ on it?” she asked.</p>

<p>Statt looked closer at the label on the back of tube. In small print were warnings he hadn’t noticed before, including one that read: “If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional help or contact a poison control center immediately.” &quot;</p>

<p>full WaPo article: <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/articles/fda-toothpaste/">http://fluoridealert.org/articles/fda-toothpaste/</a></p>

<p>Some research suggests consumption of Flouride may lower chldhood IQ - &quot; children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas&quot;:

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t eat it ? Yes, I&#39;m aware of that - I brush with high-concentration prescription Flouride toothpaste, which has its uses. And, I didn&#39;t posit any &quot;conspiracy&quot; - I just linked to some research on the toxicity of Flouride, which as it happens is chemically somewhat similar to another well-known toxin, Chlorine. </p>

<p>As an example of another, perhaps less than well considered, accidental mass epidemiological experiment, one could look to the historical use of leaded gasoline, which by well-substantiated research has mildly poisoned untold millions in industrial nations.</p>

<p>There was no &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Nobody wanted to poison people, and  Tetraethyl Lead did a great job at preventing damaging engine knock (detonation). But it also wound up blowing out auto tailpipes as a fine dust that was ingested by humans in small but significant concentrations.</p>

<p>The people who were responsible for leaded gasoline thought at the time, based on good medical authority, that the expected dosage of lead people would get from the use of leaded gas wouldn&#39;t cause significant problems. But later research has showed that the brains of young children are dramatically more sensitive to lead than believed possible when leaded gasoline was developed. Whoops. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take your bodyweight at 127 lbs (57.6 kg), that is 2880 mg of aspartame daily without any health risks.</p>

<p>The amount of aspartame in Diet Coke and Coke Zero is about 520 mg and 240 mg per liter respectively.</p>

<p>That means that you can ingest about 5.5 liters of Diet Coke and 12 liters of Coke Zero a day without ANY health risk.</p>

<p>I was researching it for my friend, hence the weight.
Also if you don&#39;t trust the FDA, then the European Commision&#39;s Scientific Committee on Food has the ADI of aspartame as 40mg/kg of body weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar to how antibiotics create superbugs like MRSA.  Eventually a weed normally killed by herbicide will have a mutation that allows it to live.  Because all the weeds without resistance are killed off, there is little competition in the gene pool to stamp out the mutation.  The resistant weed passes down its DNA, the unresistant weeds do not.  Environmental pressure is the driver of evolution.  This is exacerbated by the fact that giant stretches of land are turned into monocultures and sprayed solely with round-up.</p>

<p>There are now 24 species of round-up resistant weeds, and the herbicide has been in use less than 20 years.  It is estimated that an extra 500 million pounds of herbicide has been sprayed in an attempt to combat the issue.  It&#39;s not working.  This is why GMO crops INCREASE herbicide use, not decrease it.  Guess what Monsanto&#39;s solution to this problem is?  They are proposing to use far more toxic herbicides to combat the weeds including 2.4-D THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF AGENT ORANGE! <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/superweeds-overrun-farmlands-0384.html">here&#39;s an article on the subject</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not used to that (immediate) change of things we eat. It is unnatural and foreign to those that eat it.
Some of Monsanto&#39;s GMO products have been made to make its own pesticide that dissolves or explodes insects stomachs (but its entirely safe for humans /sarcasm (there has been no long term studies on GMO&#39;s that have proven any GMO&#39;s to be safe, since it is an extremely new advent (DNA was only discovered in the late 80&#39;s or early 90&#39;s, and GMOs have only been on the shelf since the early 90&#39;s))), or have DNA from viruses in them (which is then implemented into the consumers genetics), or the crops can withstand more and more Roundup (which is another Monsanto product) (and therefore more and more roundup is absorbed into the food).</p>

<p>There was a study done in the EU that had found the main ingredient from Roundup in peoples urine.</p>

<p>Monsanto&#39;s versions of GMOs are also less nutritious than organics.</p>

<p>It is a false notion to say that &quot;we need GMOs to feed the worlds population&quot;; The world can produce, and if I recall correctly, does produce enough food to feed more than the current population, with organics alone.</p>

<p>Half of the food produced in the world does not get eaten by people, it gets wasted.</p>

<p>The problem of hunger famine is not that there isn&#39;t enough food, its because of lack of funds because opportunities are manufactured to be limited through 1st world exploitation and negligence of the 2nd and 3rd world countries (raping of resources, etc.), human greed, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1990, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) published the results of studies on the potential carcinogenicity of fluoride in rats and mice.38 The studies found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats or mice at very high concentrations (100-175 mg/L) but found “equivocal evidence” of carcinogenicity in male rats. Osteosarcomas (bone cancers) were observed in 1 of 50 male rats receiving 100 mg/L sodium fluoride and 3 of 50 rats receiving 175 mg/L.39 From this study, NTP researchers concluded that levels of sodium fluoride below 175 mg/L in drinking water over a two-year period would not be expected to cause any bone cancers in rats or mice. The result of the NTP study (i.e., equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity) was not confirmed in a 1992 study of rats using higher fluoride doses; however, rare, nonmalignant tumors were found in this study.40 According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, both studies had problems that limited their usefulness in showing whether fluoride can cause cancer in humans.41</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to the concerns raised by the NTP 1990 study, EPA requested that NRC review the available toxicological and exposure data on fluoride to determine whether the current drinking water standard of 4 mg/L was sufficient to protect public health. In 1993, NRC completed an extensive literature review concerning the association between fluoridated drinking water and increased cancer risk. Although NRC concluded that the data did not demonstrate an association between fluoridated drinking water and cancer, it did suggest that more research should be undertaken (especially research that examined individual, rather than population, exposures).</p>

<p>Source - your link (Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Review of Fluoridation and Regulation Issues)</p>

<hr/>

<p>In September 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services convened a panel of scientists from the across the U.S. government to review new information related to fluoride intake and to develop new recommendations for community water fluoridation.</p>

<p>The scientists reviewed the best available information on: the prevalence and trends in dental caries, water intake in children in relation to outdoor air temperature, changes in the percentage of U.S. children and adults with dental fluorosis, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) new assessments of cumulative sources of fluoride exposure and risks of children developing severe dental fluorosis.</p>

<p>This new information led HHS to propose changing the recommended level for community water systems to 0.7 milligrams per liter. The current recommended level is a range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/">Source</a></p>

<p>So from 1993 to 2014 even the FDA lowered approved intake from 4mg/L to 1.2mg/L because they understand there is a risk of ingesting to much flouride and over time they are not sure what that does... unequivocally.</p>

<p>Edit: Source and to say &quot;dental fluorosis is a real thing&quot;</p>

You also ignore that the critique of a paper is published, so any phoney criticism would be easily spotted. This stretches as far as the public who are not scientists by profession but understand the subject well.</p>

<p>Plus, since you&#39;ve not specified a particular area of science, I can only conclude you&#39;re talking about <em>any</em> peer review.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is the statistic for the rest of the world? </p>

<p>In the report titled &quot;AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY — More Interested In Accumulating Wealth Than Saving Lives&quot;, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein, chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, plainly lays to bare the many conflicts of interest that hamper the effectiveness of this organization.</p>

<p>For example, the ACS has close financial ties to both makers of mammography equipment and cancer drugs. But that&#39;s just for starters. Other conflicts of interest include ties to, and financial support from, the pesticide, petrochemical, biotech, cosmetics, and junk food industries, the very industries whose products are the primary contributors to cancer.</p>

<p>Once you realize that these conflicts of interest are there, it becomes quite easy to understand why the <strong>ACS never addresses the environmental components of cancer</strong>, and why <strong>information about avoidable toxic exposures are so conspicuously absent from their National Breast Cancer Awareness campaigns</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is no accident,&quot; Dr. Epstein writes. &quot;Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, spin-off of Imperial Chemical Industries is one of the world&#39;s largest manufacturers of chlorinated and other industrial chemicals, including those incriminated as causes of breast cancer.</p>

<p>Zeneca has also been the sole multimillion-dollar funder of the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month since its inception in 1984, besides the sole manufacturer of Tamoxifen, the world&#39;s top-selling anticancer and breast cancer &quot;prevention&quot; drug, with $400 million in annual sales.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Zeneca recently assumed direct management of 11 cancer centers in U.S. hospitals. Zeneca owns a 50 percent stake in these centers known collectively as Salick Health Care.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s no small irony that Tamoxifen has been found to cause cancer and increase risk of death, while several top-notch preventive strategies and many safe and effective cancer treatments are ignored.</p>

<p>The ACS, along with the National Cancer Institute, virtually exclusively focus on cancer research and the diagnosis and the chemical treatment of cancer. Preventive strategies, such as avoiding chemical exposures, receive virtually no consideration at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Giant corporations, which profited handsomely while they polluted air, water, the workplace, and food with a wide range of carcinogens, remain greatly comforted by the silence of the ACS. This silence reflected a complex of mindsets fixated on diagnosis, treatment, and basic genetic research, together with ignorance, indifference, and even hostility to prevention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not surprisingly, the incidence of cancer over past decades has escalated, approximately parallel to its increased funding,&quot; Dr. Epstein writes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many also do not realize that when they donate money to the American Cancer Society, the majority of it may never go further than the bank accounts of its numerous well-paid executives.</p>

<p>Cancer recommendations are based on profit, not superior science and results. The two major cancer &quot;prevention&quot; strategies that the ACS continuously pushes, regardless of what the science says, are Mammography and Sun avoidance.</p>

<p>The Two Myths of Cancer: </p>

<p>Dr. Epstein also points out two glaring myths perpetuated by the American Cancer Society:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dramatic progress has been made in the war against cancer;</p></li>
<li><p>Rising cancer mortality statistics are primarily due to smoking and an aging population</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>global cancer rates have doubled in the last three decades</strong>, and their &quot;war on cancer&quot; strategy completely ignores, and oftentimes denies the obvious links between cancer and toxic exposures through pesticide-laden foods, toxic personal care products, cancer-causing medical treatments and drugs, and industrial pollution.</p>

<p>Mercola.com claims that &quot;Meanwhile, global cancer rates have doubled in the last three decades.&quot;  However it fails to explain where it got its information.</p>

<p>Mercola is a <strong>drug company</strong> that sells all sorts of &quot;alternative&quot; medicines.  It makes all sorts of claims that it does not back up with evidence.  I do not consider it a reliable source.</p>

<p>However in properly done studies,  the cancer rate refers to the cancer rate per 100,000 people.  So in the examples you give, the cancer rate is 50,000 per 100,000 people in each example.</p>

We carpet bomb every insect and weed in a field, destroying the ecosystem that farms used to depend on, so that we can grow a single crop with synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. We are creating a food system that requires massive amounts of petroleum byproducts to function and leaves our food security in the hands of a few huge agribusiness companies.

Yes GMOs are bad!&gt;Is there any peer reviewed documentation or experimental evidence that GMOs are harmful to health, aside from the rat study that was retracted by the authors due to methodological flaws?

    <div class="md"><p>How about this. I choose to not use or put those substances (I get that GMOs wouldn&#39;t necessarily qualify as a substance per the definition, but go with me here) in my body, and you choose to do so. </p>

<p>Nor do I accept that fluoride is necessary to prevent tooth decay. Considering the history of fluoride used in water systems, and the slow level of research that has shown fluoride to be slightly more effective in preventing caries, I don&#39;t think the trade-off of ingesting a substance used in rat poisons (a statement you will dismiss as hyperbole) is worth it.</p>

<p>Or GMOs are going to save humanity (look at India&#39;s experience, for example, or just something like the emergence of Bt resistant corn rootworm, or Roundup ready coca plants caused by the DEA&#39;s single minded use of glyphosate as an herbicide). </p>

<p>As for MSG, it&#39;s has naturally occurring analogues in mushrooms, and might be partially responsible for the umami category of flavor. But anecdotally, at least, certain people tend to be sensitive, even highly sensitive to its presence in food.</p>

<p>I have personally given up all processed food (though occasionally I have a Coke or a root beer). And I feel better, look better, have less inflammation, and better mental health. So I would challenge you to try the same thing. You know, use the scientific method on yourself (I get that one data point does not science make, but that data point is you), and see if there are positive results. Basically, as Chuck D said, &quot;don&#39;t believe the hype.&quot; Be skeptical of us nutters and of the received wisdom that so easily allows you to dismiss people as crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean literally purely the compound H2O, obviously there will unavoidably be additional minerals etc. But for the government to add medicine to our water is deeply wrong. </p>

<p>They should try their hardest for it to be AS CLOSE to H2O as possible, I don&#39;t think that is so hard to understand. To me it is just common sense that they should ONLY provide us with clean drinking water and nothing else. If people want fluoridated water surely they can make the personal choice by buying bottled fluoridated water, if there is such a thing? Don&#39;t force medicate the entire population. </p>

<p>We need water to LIVE, even if fluoride is completely harmless it is highly questionable to taint the main life-giving source on this planet with it. What will they do next? Spray the air with some kind of happy gas to prevent depression and force us all to breath it?!</p>

<p>However, to me, this doesn&#39;t seem as big as a problem as you seem to perceive it. I fail to see the jump from fluoride for dental concerns to actual gas in the air.

    <div class="md"><p>There are no comprehensive studies done to conclude a communities total fluoride intake before fluoride is added. To do so would be extremely expensive.

<p>No study exists that would counter or support that supposition. I think you missed the point or are intentionally avoiding it.</p>

<p>It should go without saying though, that those that have developed fluorosis in a fluoridated municipality should reduce obvious sources of fluoride right? I can&#39;t imagine you would argue that. So re-read what i wrote.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only if your defensiveness misinterprets a metaphorical demonstration of flawed logic as some kind of assumption on your beliefs. I don&#39;t know what you think about global warming and it doesn&#39;t matter. It was a metaphor demonstrating your flawed logic that fluoride added to water isn&#39;t ever dangerous. It absolutely can be dangerous for anyone already getting too much fluoride. Some generalized recommendation on fluoride consumption will not reduce your risk of fluorosis if no one is measuring how much fluoride you are actually exposed to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any fluoride that can be proactively avoided or eliminated in the case of fluorosis is the obvious one to eliminate for those that suffer fluorosis.  Your second point is a belief. Each community does not have comprehensive analysis with regards to health/financial benefit of fluoridating water.

<p>Here&#39;s a volume from a reputable neurology journal written by a Harvard Doctor and another Harvard/Boston College educated Doctor who studies lead poisoning, pesticide exposure, etc. Their studies show fluoride (and number of other neurotoxicants) are harmful to brain development in children.</p>

<p>Here are the Doctor&#39;s profiles... they seem pretty credible:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s about it poisoning people, I think its about the fact that the flouride is coming from waste in some process ( iirc gas production), so why add it. I really think it&#39;s more a case of choice. People get pissed/scared when they come upon something they don&#39;t have a choice with. It does seem forced upon us with the banner of health flying above it. I&#39;m skeptical of it myself. In too high a dose it is not healthy for anyone. I really think they should stop forcing things upon people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The rising incidence of cancer, brought about chiefly by growing, aging populations worldwide, will require a heavier focus on preventive public health policies...&quot;</p>

<p>From your own source. I read your articles, and the concern for the increase in cancer is as a result of developing countries. As more &quot;third world&quot; countries continue to develop and grow, and as their life expectancy and poor habits continue to grow, so too will their cancer rates. If you read your own sources, it says nothing about your reasons for the cancer increase.
 The rates are actually dropping for western civilizations, the ones that typically do things like fluoridate water, drink beverages flavored with aspartame, ect... The only reason the number of cancer deaths is increasing is due to population increases. More people = more death. 
Try not to complain that no one does research and read your own sources before making such bold claims.</p>

<p>do they though? There hasn&#39;t been any studies since then that have said &quot;we were wrong&quot; so it hasn&#39;t changed. The theory of relativity hasn&#39;t changed in a long time, it&#39;s not old useless science. It only becomes obsolete if something replaces it, and I haven&#39;t seen any recent research that shows the levels we have in our water are toxic. They say it can be toxic in high amounts but so can a lot of things, that doesn&#39;t really justify being terrified of something for no reason.</p>

<p>if 8 glasses a day does zero harm, then over 10 years it would do zero harm. If it did harm, don&#39;t you think we would&#39;ve noticed or people would&#39;ve come forwarD? people came forward for autism and vaccines and those two things aren&#39;t even related. people would come forward with &quot;fluoride damage&quot; if it were possible.</p>

<p>as I said before lots of people agree on the helpfulness of fluoride and it&#39;s success, the fact that it was 13 years ago doesn&#39;t mean they were wrong. So you c&#39;t say &quot;no real benefit&quot;.</p>

<p>And you&#39;ve been unable to demonstrate this science that says its bad. Certainly, scientists themselves don&#39;t have any of these same ideas, you only hear about it from non-scientist. I&#39;m guessing they banned them for the same reason Germany banned GMO&#39;s - fear and a lack of influence by their scientific minds. Certainly not based on actual science and there&#39;s no scienctist that would recommend banning GMOs, just like it would be pretty hard to find a dentist who hated fluoride.</p>

That&#39;s how science works when it gets new findings. Whereas I suspect if you read a study that for instance showed Fluoride to be overwhelmingly beneficial and not cause any harms, you would find some way to discredit it without having to acknowledge it - perhaps by saying &quot;it&#39;s 13 years old&quot; as if that somehow discredits it (only a newer paper directly contradicting it would make it irrelevant).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t sound like you understand science, there honestly is none that supports your side and if there was I feel like you&#39;d post it. But you just mention the Harvard study which we both know was done in far higher amounts than was in our water supply.</p>

<p>In high doses. I guess semantics is all you&#39;ve got left. Fluoride has not been shown in any study to be dangerous in low amounts, which we take in our water supply. That harvard study would be as rlelevant about one that says drinking too much water will kill you, therefore water is bad. And then you using that in an argument that drinking any amount of water is bad for you.</p>

<p>Right, so you don&#39;t actually understand science. If science is wrong, it actually will correct itself when it gets new data. That&#39;s what makes it different. The process of peer-review means we CAN rely on the findings of scientists from all over the worlld, because they have an incentive to prove each other wrong, and regularly try.</p>

<p>To associate science with religion is very faith-based in itself, you&#39;re trying to disqualify both as equal so that you can just believe what you believe without needing to reconcile the fact that the entire process of what we know to be facts (science) disagrees with you</p>

<p>this is, rather ironically, just your belief. There is constant outcry about fluoride and subsequently quite a lot of testing. The study I linked to you before should really be all I need to provide since you can&#39;t provide a source to the contrary though.</p>

<p>You criticize me for not providing evidence, but just because SOME science has said it isn&#39;t known to cause harm through our water supply, doesn&#39;t mean that accounts for all science that exists. Science is a huge umbrella, and yes when you say &#39;Science says this&#39;, that is purely faith because you&#39;re putting all your eggs in one basket where there are lots of eggs and lots of baskets to choose from.</p>

<p>YOU don&#39;t understand science, do not point the finger this way. Again, the way you&#39;re presenting it, is entirely faith based. I have not done any such thing as I&#39;m not saying for certain I know either way. All I&#39;ve ever said is that we dont KNOW for certain, EITHER WAY. This is fact! It&#39;s just plausibility. Unless you&#39;re taking part in the scientific method, it is purely faith.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also highly plausible again based on the HARVARD STUDY CONDUCTED RECENTLY, AND NOT 13 YEARS AGO, that it CAN be harmful!</p>

<p>The only science you understand is the science that supports the governments doings, but even if I did present you with another 5 articles, you&#39;d still have the same feelings, because you have faith that because one study has supported your feelings, all else is irrelevant.</p>

<p>This is again, contradictory to your nonsensical babbling about science replacing itself. Because your 13 year old science is wrong, yet you will not allow it to be corrected. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t semantics, you don&#39;t understand logic. </p>

<p>Again, the government does not have the right to medicate our water supply. If people want fluoride in their water to help their dental problems.. (Ugh this is so laughable..) then they can do it on their own. In a true democracy we would have the choice.</p>

<p>I guess you also have blind faith in this oligarchical world.</p>

<p>When trying to find the culprit of a crime you look for motivation. Many in the scientific and aristocratic community have openly spoken of their concern in overpopulation and there is only one answer to that problem, and that&#39;s the people who aren&#39;t just looking to profit. </p>

<p>One of the most important researchers and authorities on SV40 is a molecular pathologist at Chicago&#39;s Loyola University Medical Center named Michael Carbone. From the Wikipedia page of American physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner">Herbert Ratner</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. </p>

<p>Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet &amp; Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. </p>

<p>The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. </p>

<p>In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. </p>

<p>Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is SV40 showing up in brain tumors and leukemia, but according to research conducted by Carbone and others, SV40 is being detected in 38% of patients with bone cancer and in 58% of those with mesothelioma, a deadly type of lung cancer. Carbone&#39;s pioneering work indicates that SV40 blocks an important protein that normally protects cells from becoming malignant.</p>

<p>Carbone, M., et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8760294">“SV40-like sequences in human bone tumors.”</a> <em>Oncogene</em> 1996;13(3):527-35.</p>

<p>Pass, HI., Carbone, M., et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9776223">“Evidence for and implications of SV40-like sequences in human mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas.”</a> <em>Important Advances in Oncology</em> 1996:89-108.</p>

<p>Rock, A. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1996/12/01/218857/">“The lethal dangers of the billion dollar vaccine business.”</a> <em>Money</em> (December 1996):161.</p>

<p>n 2001, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> published a story called <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">“Rogue virus in the vaccine: Early polio vaccine harbored virus now feared to cause cancer in humans,”</a> stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The discovery of SV40 in human tumors has generated intense debate within the scientific community, pitting a handful of government health officials, who believe that the virus is harmless, against researchers from Boston to China who now suspect SV40 may be a human carcinogen. At stake are millions of research dollars and potential medical treatments for those afflicted with the cancers SV40 may be causing. </p>

<p>“I believe that SV40 is carcinogenic (in humans),” said Dr. Michele Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. “We need to be creating therapies for people who have these cancers, and now we may be able to because we have a target—SV40.”</p>

<p>Critics charge that the few studies done by the government are scientifically flawed and that health officials have downplayed the potential risks posed by SV40 ever since they learned in 1961 that the virus contaminated the polio vaccine and caused tumors in rodents. </p>

<p>“How long can the government ignore this?” asked Dr. Adi Gazdar, a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center cancer researcher. “The government has not sponsored any real research. Here&#39;s something possibly affecting millions of Americans, and they&#39;re indifferent. Maybe they don&#39;t want to find out.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1998, after a national cancer database was analyzed, it was determined that among those exposed to SV40 from the polio vaccine, there were 17% more bone cancers, 20% more brain cancers, and <em>178%</em> more mesotheliomas. <a href="http://www.nccn.net/%7Ewwithin/polio.htm">Researchers also found</a> 10 times more osteosarcoma rates.</p>

<p>Even more alarming, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2835679">some research suggests</a> that SV40 can be passed from human to human and form mother to child. <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/curtis.htm">A study of nearly 60,000 women</a> found that children of mothers who received the Salk vaccine in the early 1960s had brain tumors at a rate 13 times greater than mothers who didn&#39;t receive the shot.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8841004">a 1996 study</a> published in the journal <em>Cancer Research</em> found SV40 in 23% of blood samples and 45% of semen taken from healthy subjects. Mauro Tognon, one of the authors of this study, believes this might explain why brain, bone, and lung cancers are on the rise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite official denials of any correlation between SV40-contaminated polio vaccines and increased cancer rates, by April 2001, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Rogue-virus-in-the-vaccine-Early-polio-vaccine-2899957.php">62 papers from 30 laboratories</a> around the world had reported SV40 in human tissues and tumors. Even the National Cancer Institute issued a statement that SV40 “may be associated with human cancer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the uncertainty? Why the obfuscation? Why the silence? In his book <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html">The Health Century,</a> Edward Shorter asks these questions and quotes an extraordinary statement made by Albert Sabin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was this silence merely the incompetence of the press in the face of a complex scientific question, or was there a deliberate effort to keep a lid on the story? Albert Sabin was asked thirty years later why the silence? “I think to release certain information prematurely,” he said, “is not a public service. There&#39;s too much scaring the public unnecessarily. Oh, your children were injected with a cancer virus and all that. That&#39;s not very good.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40_Cancer_Foundation">the SV40 Cancer Foundation</a> is devoted to raising awareness about a potential link between the simian virus and human cancer.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons this subject needs to be <em>thoroughly</em> studied is that traditional methods of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy <a href="http://www.sv40foundation.org/Treating.html">may make SV40-related cancers worse:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is well documented that SV40 binds with tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB. These genes and their proteins are needed to drive a damaged cell towards apoptosis—programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a critical cellular function that stops the growth of tumors in man.</p>

<p>Cell-killing or cytotoxic therapies like chemotherapy and radiation utilize apoptosis. These therapies cause cellular DNA damage such as point mutations, strand breaks, and other disturbances to a cell’s DNA. This DNA damage, in turn, triggers the apoptosis which leads to cell death. In this way, chemo and radiation kill cells (cancer cells and healthy cells). </p>

<p>However, when the large T antigen (Tag) of SV40 is present in a cancer cell it binds p53 and RB and stops these genes from working. There is no apoptosis. The result is that chemo and radiation kill healthy cells, <em>but the cancerous cells infected with SV40’s Tag live on with even more mutations.</em> </p>

<p><em>This means that standard cancer therapies may only make a SV40 cancer more abnormal and aggressive and less responsive to standard cytotoxic therapies.</em></p>

<p>Knowing this, you would think that a patient who is diagnosed with a cancer associated with SV40 (i.e. brain cancers, mesothelioma, bone cancers, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and thyroid cancers) would have their cancer tested for the presence of this virus. And, if the virus is present, the patient would be offered rational therapies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are no prospective tests or trials in which SV40 status is used in clinical decision-making. Instead, tumors are tested often after a patient has died to determine whether it contained SV40. At this point, there is no benefit to the patient.</p>

<p>SV40 is a problem that federal government authorities have not addressed responsibly because the government’s own vaccine programs are responsible for the spread of the virus throughout the western world. Federal authorities are so concerned about being blamed for unleashing a cancer-causing monkey virus that they would rather ignore its role in cancer than take the appropriate steps to develop rational therapies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Fluoride applied in concentrations seen in our water, is more beneficial than harmful.</p>

<p>2) GMO foods are not known to be toxic. I can argue many points against their use, but they are more beneficial than detrimental at the moment. My post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1twjqz/how_gmo_foods_alter_human_dna/cec8cqe">here</a>.</p>

<p>3) As a researcher, I need to do a better job at conveying just how we determine the appropriate use of such products...</p>

<p>4) MSG is natural, but having too much of it, like most things we eat, can throw off metabolism... Obesity has a far too many factors to discuss in one comment, msg is not a direct factor, it is the diet of the individual along with predisposition at the genetic/epigenetic levels.</p>

<p>5) Aspertame is not something to fear, it is not directly associated with serious side effects. An analogy to aspertame can be peanuts. Some people have allergies to certain nuts, the allergic reactions they experience are on a spectrum (mid to severe). The severity depends on how much effort they make to avoid nut products. Most people do not have adverse effects coming into contact with aspartame.</p>

<p>6) Heavy metal toxicity in north america is not a major issue, you would have to spend a considerable time near the source of the metal for it to accumulate in sufficient quantities to cause serious side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the opinions that sound reasonable at first thought, but are scientifically not. There should be a correlation between life expectancy over the years cleared by age structure demographics compared to cancer rates. But there is no such correlation. Look at the figures, please.</p>

<p>There is a correlation between the peak of prostate cancer in 1992 and the baby boomers for instance. But the life expectancy does not rise as fast as the cancer rates. And certain cancers rise continuously independently, whereas the demographic is varying significantly. And you have another problem you have to explain. More and more younger people are getting cancer. How did that happen. Suddenly bad DNA? You see there are only environmental issues left (food, cosmetics, clothes and environmental poisons). Please, do not spread the myth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes half-truths are more dangerous than critical thinking. Every person I know with a PhD in chemistry, biology, pharmacology or toxicology in my age is absolutely paranoid about the ingredients in their food, the cosmetics or in their medicine. They would never let their children take all the normal stuff everybody is sabotaging their system with. The more you know.</p>

<p>OP might sound a bit over the top, but people should really look in what they are ingesting, because they simply can not account for the risk they are taking. And the health problems will eventually start to manifest in seven years from now or later. Ignorance is not bliss in this case and every motivation for others to start a healthy life is associated positively in my book. Nobody will have the opportunity to enter a time machine and change their lifestyle later after they have been diagnosed with cancer. Most cancer patients would wish they could then. But also most dismiss the opportunity to change their lifestyle right now, because of wilful ignorance and playing around with their odds to get cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe you are the problem for not paying attention to your science classes in high school to understand simple principles that could explain why some of the substances listed in OP&#39;s post aren&#39;t in fact dangerous.</p>

<p>Fluoride is ineffective and can cause health problems, aspartame is transformed into methanol in our bodies, which is cancerous and can cause other health issues, but when people insert things like monosodium glutamate in that list, which is something that naturally occurs in our bodies, they are just making themselves look like a fool.</p>

</ul>

<p>I can go further and say that GMOs aren&#39;t in fact as bad as people say. They can cause economical, political and environmental problems, and because of that I&#39;m against their use in our food sources, but saying they are harmful to our health is incorrect unless you believe there are scientists out there intentionally creating plants that can produce harmful substances inside.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about one thing that, that GMOs aren&#39;t bad as people say or really..bad at all. Besides the fact they cause us to use harmful chemicals that pollute the environment and that they use more water than organic farming. </p>

<p>But again not as bad for US as people say. There&#39;s one reason for that though. </p>

<p>There are no agencies monitoring whether or not they&#39;re bad for US!!</p>

<p>This was my question. Instead, you have answered why plants genetically modified to be more resistant to pesticides are dangerous. That is a <em>dangerous use</em> of GMO, not a danger inherent to GMO. </p>

<p>The same could have been (and has been, and will be) achieved through selective breeding. Is that less dangerous because it is &quot;GMO-free&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re proving a point I made earlier in response to someone else that Science is religion for a lot of people, yourself included.  Of course it&#39;s a danger inherent to GMO! Like I said, this is a design function of GMO! If you&#39;re not using the more toxic pesticide there&#39;s even less reason to go the GMO route. But I guess your degree taught you all about deflecting reality. </p>

<p>Again.. the self post you quoted does directly correlate to my response. </p>

<p>Here are some more. They poison the environment. GMO farming uses stronger chemicals that we put out into the air. Does that make sense to you or will you claim this is still irrelevant to save face?</p>

<p>How about this, in a world where we will soon be fighting wars for water, GMO farming uses much more water than conventional organic farming. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t have to be as simple as why is genetic engineering bad, there are many more variables that your science seems to be simplifying to the point you stop caring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will explain it to you. Glyphosate is the main ingredient of Monsantos Roundup. And that is used as herbicide mainly on Roundup ready GMO. Every year they have to use more of the stuff on the crops. The problem is that food gets in the food chain soaked in glyphosate and that is really bad news. So GMO often means also glyphosate intake.</p>

<p>That is not theory of mine. You do not need to look any further than the fact that they find not only glyphosate in our system, but also in the milk of breast feeding mothers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t entirely understand what you&#39;re saying. These chemicals are a byproduct of our lives, increased rates of cancer are the price we pay for a modern lifestyle. If you think some malevolent intelligence is poisoning us to keep down the population you have severe paranoia issues.</p>

<p>You try to engineer any one of the thousands of industrial processes that produce air pollution so that they&#39;re 100% clean. You&#39;ll be massively wealthy in no time.</p>

<p>Oh, also, flouride in our drinking water is not dangerous. It&#39;s dangerous in massive doses but the amount in our drinking water helps to prevent cavities. This can be proved by looking at cavity rates in countries/areas without fluoridated water. </p>

<p>Finally, GMO food isn&#39;t poisonous. There hasn&#39;t been a study or any evidence linking GM foods to cancer and many scientists have tried to find that link. GM food may actually be the only way we can support our current population. In fact, OP, you might be one of the people poisoning our society with misinformed and ill researched ideas and theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, having a little every now and then won&#39;t do much harm, neither would arsenic though. The thing is aspartame is banned in most EU countries and Japan (both seen as some of the most civilized places), and the only reason why it&#39;s even allowed to be used in the U.S is because the FDA initially ruled it as unsafe but then Rumsfeld got them to overturn that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more about profit than anything, before they put fluoride in the water it was a useless byproduct from something else (maybe a fertilizer but I don&#39;t remember), once they started putting it in the water (which is decided by each municipality) they were able to now sell a useless product and make money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off course money is in the game too, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad as long as you don&#39;t exaggerate it. What most people here assume is that if big money is spend the result is automatically bad for the consumer, but that&#39;s not always the case. Aspartame is a good example of this because it&#39;s a good substitution for the average consumer, with some extra special attention the the average consumer part. I&#39;d rather see someone drink 2 cups of soda with aspartame a day than 2 cups of side with regular sugar. Fluoride yet again is an example of something that&#39;s really not that harmfull as long as it&#39;s in small quantities. </p>

<p>btw, aspartame is only banned in certain European countries, it&#39;s perfectly legal here in the Netherlands </p>

<p>WHICH YOU ARE ADVISED NOT TO DRINK IN SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the lack of water they have poor water quality during summertime and some countries use filtered and chlorinated water from the Mediterranean as tap water. You would not drink it twice because it is salty. Anyway most people use it only to wash and not to drink. That advice has nothing to do with fluoride levels of tap water. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>likely already be dead, either by cholera or some other nasty disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest countries in Europe have no fluorides in their tap water and the water is clean with best drinking quality. Since 1854 cholera is no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe. Tap water without fluorides is healthy.</p>

<p>There have been well over 7,000 aspartame toxicity reactions officially
received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 1982 (after
aspartame was first approved) until 1995 (DHHS 1993, DHHS 1995).
From this figure, we can estimate the number of actual toxicity
reactions observed.</p>

<p>FDA officials believe that as little as 1% of the serious
adverse drug reactions are reported to the FDA (Kessler
1993).  Using a reported rate of 1%, we would estimate that there
have been 700,000 recognized aspartame toxicity reactions in the U.S.
since 1982.  However, there are a number of significant adjustments
that must be made before we can accept this estimate.</p>

<p>7000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7000 reports on a population of 300 million. You do the math because that&#39;s nothing. Even if they use this as a 1% then the 700000 still is nothing on a population of 300000000. And how many people actually get this reaction from aspartame? Did they just stop eating huge amounts of candy? Or did they expose them to quantities of pure aspartame? And moreover, it could be the result of an allergy, some people are more sensitive to certain sugars than others. Calling it a &quot;poison&quot; is ignorant. Poison is a substance that can kill every single person, not just someone with a light allergy. Your source isn&#39;t very convincing.</p>

<p>you call aspartame a poison. Do you even know what a poison is? A poison is something that makes you sick and kills you. Aspartame doesn&#39;t kill you, nor does it cause autism/asthma or any other shit. It may not be 100% healthy, but so is fat, so are all sugars, even protiens aren&#39;t 100% healthy. Stop scaring people over nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. And please, don&#39;t get me wrong. I know full well the negative effects of msg, which I&#39;m in no way refuting. I&#39;m just saying that it is tasteless, which makes it even more dangerous in my opinion because, even as your link proves, it can be in things you wouldn&#39;t know it was in. About 8 years ago I had gotten a couple bags of Andy Capps fries. After eating them on break at work I started getting dizzy and I got a real bad headache. The same thing happened the next day after I&#39;d eastern the other bag on my break. Then I looked at what I was eating and it was labelled as containing msg. I contacted the company to let them know what happened to me and they never got back with me. So, I do my best to stay away from that poison. Because poison is exactly what msg is.</p>

<p>Yeah it&#39;s called I got them and became immune, which provided me with even more immunities and strengthed my immune system.</p>

<p>you mean the shit fox news broadcasts, entirely out of context or even worse, entirely funded by religious groups. Let me give you some real data on vaccines: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Msh0RWq.png">measles outbreak 2013 in the Netherlands compared to the Dutch bible belt</a></p>

<p>and guess in which part of the Netherlands vaccines are not common. You guessed it, the religious nutjobs who decided not to vaccine themself as it goes against the will of god.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t get the truth about vaccines from the controlled media, Measles is nothing to be scared of if you live in the First World, perfectly natural.  However the vaccine is incredibly dangerous as are all vaccines.  The pharmaceuticals profit when you are sick, they want you diseased for life, vaccines are an attempt to start up lifelong highly-profitable autoimmune diseases and allergies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You started by saying &quot;Aspartame isn&#39;t dangerous&quot; but in fact it&#39;s highly toxic so hence is dangerous.</p>

<p>It was malnourished people and those living with poor sanitation who would die from infectious disease, this is no longer relevant to the First World.  </p>

<p>Look closer at the pharmaceuticals, these corporations are known to be criminal and regularly get fined Billions of $&#39;s for putting dangerous products out there.  Why would they suddenly turn into nice guys when it comes to vaccines given that they have a huge conflict of interest in that if they manage to induce autoimmunity in your body e.g. Diabetes Type 1, MS etc, they get to make a lot more money.  These guys care about money, that is what drives them.</p>

<p>Pro-vaccine propaganda gets everywhere; in your Neighborhood, TV, News, Social Media, Pharmacy etc.  It is best to trust no-one, not even me, do the research for yourself, read the studies, always look for conflicts of interest then once you&#39;ve allowed yourself to form a balanced opinion you can draw your conclusions on this important topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, well that answer is simple: vaccines have been around for a long time, longer than big pharmaceutical companies: <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine</a>. </p>

<p>the reason I&#39;m here is because i was taught to always be skeptical, no matter what. I&#39;ve read lots of articals on vaccines. Your argument on &quot;pharmaceuticals are bad&quot; don&#39;t apply on vaccines, and that because, as i said, vaccines are around long before big pharmaceutical companies, it&#39;s effect has been proven long before they could have interest. As for other medicines, i share your opinion. I don&#39;t trust the Medicines the pharmacist gives me, i only take them when i absolutely have no other choice. But vaccines, vaccines are oke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The early vaccines caused a lot more harm than good, but the people behind those vaccines had good intentions.</p>

<p>So because vaccines started out as an honorable cause doesn&#39;t mean that if you put them in the hands of known criminals that they won&#39;t abuse them, as is going on today.  Studies show that vaccines are inducing autoimmune diseases, that is the purpose of them, Pharma profit when we are on drugs for life, that&#39;s why they push vaccines hard.</p>

<p>Guns can be used for good and bad too.  In theory if vaccines were taken away from Big Pharma and developed properly by decent people, there would be scenarios where they would have a positive benefit/risk ratio, but as long as they&#39;re with Big Pharma keep well clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find vaccines terribly damaging to the world as a whole. Mostly due to the fact that a virus tends to mutate more rapidly when the population is vaccinated. Also, countries that don&#39;t vaccinate are at a greater risk of exposure when part of a population vaccinates and others do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basics of your immune system won&#39;t allow that. You create memory cells to recognize foreign antigens after your body killed the pathogen. If you vaccinate yourself you inject yourself with dead or severely weakened versions of the virus/bacteria (a virus isn&#39;t alive), so your body can make those memory cells so it knows which protein structures it needs to kill the foreign pathogen. If you get infected by the real deal you won&#39;t get sick because your body immediately knows how to react. That is immunity. It isn&#39;t something you just suddenly have, your body has to go trough the same process as it would normally. The nutjobs who are not vaccined are immune after the first infection, but first they have to survive it. And that last part is why vaccines are such a beautiful discovery, because they make sure you survive that first infection. Vaccinating is natural, believe it or not, you just give your body a head start. And when a mutation comes that won&#39;t matter, you create a new population of dead/weakened bacteria and you won&#39;t get sick again.  This only doesn&#39;t apply to rapid mutating viruses like the flu or HIV, you can apply this however to all bacteria as they don&#39;t mutate fast enough, nor will they ever do so.</p>

There should be a correlation between life expectancy over the years cleared by age structure demographics compared to cancer rates. But there is no such correlation. Look at the figures, please.</p>

<p>There is a correlation between the peak of prostate cancer in 1992 and the baby boomers for instance. But the life expectancy does not rise as fast as the cancer rates. And certain cancers rise continuously independently, whereas the demographic is varying significantly. And you have another problem you have to explain. More and more younger people are getting cancer. How did that happen. Suddenly bad DNA? You see there are only environmental issues left (food, cosmetics, clothes and environmental poisons).

<p>That&#39;s what makes EVERYTHING you&#39;re saying so misleading</p>

<p>I never mislead anyone into thinking I was talking about world rates.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cancer rates are up? You change it to &quot;mortality.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense.  As I pointed out US cancer rates are <em>also down</em> not just mortality.  Stop trying to make an argument I already corrected.</p>

<p><strong>If all these chemicals are causing cancer rates to rise world wide  why aren&#39;t they causing cancer rates (not mortality) to rise in the United States? We have lots of fluoride, GMO&#39;s and aspartame.</strong>  This is a legitimate argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the assertion that was originally being made to start this conversation, ergo why I&#39;m ranting against it.   Where are you getting that information from?  I&#39;ve looked a few reputable sources concerning JTRIG, but have yet to see anything about them posting things on forums, etc. </p>

<p>Even if it&#39;s thoroughly documented that the intent of JTRIG is basically COINTELPRO with forums, I still dont think for a second they&#39;re doing it in the way that the original response was insinuating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any fluoride that can be proactively avoided or eliminated in the case of fluorosis is the obvious one to eliminate for those that suffer fluorosis.  Your second point is a belief. Each community does not have comprehensive analysis with regards to health/financial benefit of fluoridating water. Many of them simply refer to guidelines or anecdotes from some other study from a different area. Check your own municipality. Send me some links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to the concerns raised by the NTP 1990 study, EPA requested that NRC review the available toxicological and exposure data on fluoride to determine whether the current drinking water standard of 4 mg/L was sufficient to protect public health. In 1993, NRC completed an extensive literature review concerning the association between fluoridated drinking water and increased cancer risk. Although NRC concluded that the data did not demonstrate an association between fluoridated drinking water and cancer, it did suggest that more research should be undertaken (especially research that examined individual, rather than population, exposures).</p>

<p>Source - your link (Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Review of Fluoridation and Regulation Issues)</p>

<hr/>

<p>In September 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services convened a panel of scientists from the across the U.S. government to review new information related to fluoride intake and to develop new recommendations for community water fluoridation.</p>

<p>The scientists reviewed the best available information on: the prevalence and trends in dental caries, water intake in children in relation to outdoor air temperature, changes in the percentage of U.S. children and adults with dental fluorosis, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) new assessments of cumulative sources of fluoride exposure and risks of children developing severe dental fluorosis.</p>

<p>This new information led HHS to propose changing the recommended level for community water systems to 0.7 milligrams per liter. The current recommended level is a range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/">Source</a></p>

<p>So from 1993 to 2014 even the FDA lowered approved intake from 4mg/L to 1.2mg/L because they understand there is a risk of ingesting to much flouride and over time they are not sure what that does... unequivocally.</p>

<p>Edit: Source and to say &quot;dental fluorosis is a real thing&quot;</p>
