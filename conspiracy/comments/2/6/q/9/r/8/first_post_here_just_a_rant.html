        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Isn&#39;t it funny how we&#39;re expected to go to college for a degree that tons of other, more qualified people have and then pay a fortune for it for years while we work at a job that is completely unrelated to that degree? And then were supposed to devote 70% of our waking hours working at that job we hate to pay off the student loans that we acquired while getting a degree we don&#39;t use? And we drive to that job in a car we don&#39;t even own, because we&#39;re still paying it off? And when we leave work we go home we&#39;re too tired to do anything but sit down and watch TV and have more trivial things pumped into our minds to distract us from major things happening in the world? And we&#39;re told that we will finally be happy if we buy that new flatscreen TV, or drink that can of coca cola. And most of the work we do at our jobs benefits our boss, and most of their work benefits theirs, ad on and on? And we are told from a very young age that this is the best possible way the world can work, and that we are free even though our government decides who we are allowed to marry, and what kind of substances we are allowed to put in or body? And they&#39;ve taken some of our most basic needs, such as water and food and tried to sell them back to us? And we are supposed to be thankful that we are given this oppertunity, because the people in charge of us have shafted other groups of people even harder? We are an advanced form of slavery. We are owned by our debt and kept dumbed down by reality TV and food that damages our brains. And the vast majority of our population is fine with this, and another part of our population believes that this is the absolute GREATEST way we can possibly live, and that no other country or culture can compare to us. Our generation is bigger than the baby boomers after WWII, and we can change this. But everybody is so distracted by things like social media, TV, and consumerism that they don&#39;t even care. We are owned by the corporations and the government. They see us as nothing but another building block that keeps the structure from coming down. 
Excuse the poor grammar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 27, and I approve, and agree with every word you said. I&#39;m part of that generation, and I would love to do something about it, keep talking, keep spreading the idea. Do so on a local level too though. On social networks your really just helping the NSA build a portfolio on you I imagine. We need to decentralize and get people in our immediate vicinity on board and talk to face to face about our ideals so they are so...trackable. Things will change. The baby boomers won&#39;t live forever and then we&#39;ll still be left with the shit we inherited. What will happen I wonder, will the children continue the evil or will this generation stand up to that evil should those children of evil wish to continue the process which only eliminates futures. It doesn&#39;t build them up. Even the richest of the rich will run out of people to farm if they bring the system down on themselves. Don&#39;t they understand that the best investment they can make isn&#39;t the quick buck but the long term investment of the people around them that help build their fortunes?</p>

<p>Fools. Dam fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, TPTB have foreseen their impending doom and have taken all of this in to account. The very nature of reality is fluctuation, weather it be of light, electricity, etc. We have never been allowed to become aware of this state of being (you refer to) on a massive scale until the past few years, although the evidence of what has been going on dates back THOUSANDS of years. So what makes more sense? That we are suddenly vibrating at a higher level, we&#39;re all becoming more conscious of what is being perped upon us, and at some point (before complete and utter control of all human populations on this planet) we are going to rise up and do something about this? Do you really not see how blatant and obvious their complete disregard for law and ethics has become? Do you really think they&#39;re not able to hide these things? Do you really think the sources that are feeding you this information on how evil these bastards are are somehow operating against the system? </p>

<p>I would beg you to imagine something with me for a moment. Imagine that there is a field called Social Psychology developed by Freud&#39;s nephew, refined by the Nazi&#39;s, and perfected by Uncle Sam. Imagine that it allows you to influence the behavior of societies in much the same way that normal psychology allows us to influence the behavior of the individual. Imagine that said field also demonstrates that regardless of your method, a small percentage of the population is resistant to your programming. Imagine what a group of individuals hell-bent on complete control - forever - of the entire species would do to counter this percentage. There are only two options: exterminate the dissenting group, or incorporate the aberration in to your plans. Considering that at this point, the majority, as brainwashed as they may be, would probably not tolerate the outright ovening/showering of millions of us - it&#39;s probably safe to say that incorporation into the program is where we are. And don&#39;t you dare think for one minute that they aren&#39;t miles ahead of anything you can imagine, having innumerable think-tanks with limitless funds, made up of the greatest minds in all their fields (thinking, no doubt, that they are serving good) coming up with the best ways to counter any resistance and ultimately allow this (reluctant, I&#39;m sure) group of individuals to save us from ourselves by micro-managing our entire species down to the smallest detail - in every setting. </p>

<p>Yet, we are still alive, hence in the incorporative stage, where our own rage will be used against us. Have you ever trained in jiu-jitsu? It&#39;s similar to a constrictor snake that uses it&#39;s victim&#39;s own struggles to tighten it&#39;s suffocating grip. And that is what we have here: A HUGE group that is kept fat and happy grazing on poison (physical &amp; spiritual) while a small minority is becoming ever more aware that none of our normal avenues of righting wrongs are working and it may be too late to even do anything at this point. </p>

<p>&quot;What would be the point of this?&quot; - One might ask. Quite simply to push a small, targeted, profiled, and alienated portion of the population so far in to the corner that self-defense demands aggression. The bully in the hall pushes you in to the locker over and over and you understand that you have to swing or you&#39;re done for. Except this bully has the nerds profiling you and determining probability on every action you&#39;ll ever take for the next 500 years, the popular kids spouting everything that he puts in their mouths and parroting it endlessly in the highest voices possible, and another couple hundreds of thousands of bullies with big sticks just waiting... And the moment you take the swing he&#39;ll have 30 reports from last week warning him it was coming, the actors all trained in their lines, and all of his boys ready to have some fun with you. Thus will be culled any real resistance. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry though, because they will martyr us all. And the masses will see through the facade, just like they&#39;re being trained to do right now. And they will want blood. The new regime will be more than happy to point those evil old regime who did us all so wrong and they&#39;ll be hung in the streets, brained in their homes, and burnt alive. There will be parties for weeks as humanity celebrates it&#39;s freedom from the politicians who betrayed us all, the bankers who impoverished us, and those media whores who sold us the whole racket. </p>

<p>Then these masses will be reminded that we have to come back to reality and realize that we must never be deceived again. As such, we must impose a system of total control that will ensure complete and utter fairness for all  - forever. And the only way we can do that is if we give up all of our freedoms forever, but tis a noble sacrifice and not without its rewards: Free housing, free frozen mcdonald&#39;s delivered to your door, free flatscreen, free highspeed internet, free xbox2000, and netflix. All you have to do is get a nifty little tattoo that let&#39;s us make sure you&#39;re safe and healthy at all times - oh, and inform immediately of anyone expressing ungrateful attitudes. </p>

<p>Now, as much as we hate to do this, SOME of us are going to HAVE to take on the arduous task of managing all of this. We totally promise that we won&#39;t live like gods, farm/buy/sell you like cattle, rape this earth dry and then leave you and your descendants here on a desolate rock while our genetically biomechanically enhanced eternal race reaches for the stars to continue the perpetration of the parasitic - forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post and spot on. I don&#39;t have much to add to it other than to say that this logic needs to be spread to more eyes. If you got this to every pair of eyes just in a city/county/state/half a country/full country/ hemisphere/the world then it would break those barriers of worrying about our future. We want the change now, real change not from the silver tongue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preaching to the choir man... America is being looted and dumbed down by psychopaths. It&#39;s weird talking about it because it seems so strange but that&#39;s just because you&#39;re transitioning yourself away from the slave-mind and it still seems weird, if only subconsciously in a way you can&#39;t verbalize. Just accept it and move yourself forward into knowledge and understanding. There is no need for reality to &quot;seem funny&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst aspect of the whole scenario is that you would think people are brainwashed into living this way, like cattle, going day to day doing the same things against their will, but I think that a  lot of people recognise the absolute absurdity of this culture,   spending a lifetime grafting for no real reason, but can&#39;t decipher any real meaning in their own lives, so just think, fuck it, I&#39;ll crack on, at least I&#39;m doing something. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just corporate culture, it&#39;s everywhere. It&#39;s why I can&#39;t get on board when people bash religion. I&#39;m not a religious man, but I can see that believing in something at least gives people some meaning in life. If someone came out tomorrow and proved conclusively that there was no God, that there was no life after this one, imagine the chaos. Mass depression, suicides etc. Or most likely people would dismiss it out of hand, don&#39;t wanna leave their cosy little delusional bubble. </p>

<p>Point is, having something to occupy your life and give it meaning without having to dig too deep and think about it for yourself is a convenient solution to a lot of problems. A bad solution, but it is what it is. Sometimes facing the reality of something is a lot more painful than just taking the easy way out and ignoring it til it goes away and you get with the program, hop on the cattle cart, strap on your feedbag and graze away at life til you die. </p>
