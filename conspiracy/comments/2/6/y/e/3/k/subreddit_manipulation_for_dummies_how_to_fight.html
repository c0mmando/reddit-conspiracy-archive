        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I&#39;m about to present to you is a completely plausible way a single person or small group of people can effectively manipulate discussion on this sub.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a private sub.</strong></p>

<p>This is where the bot will post its findings from crawling the /new queue on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Remember: It is not possible see posts or comments of people who participate in this private sub. This sub would also provide links to debunking sites, copy &amp; paste texts, debunking arguments or just any tool useful for an Agent to work his topic on a given post.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Create your bot.</strong></p>

<p>A perfect example of a mirror bot is found in <a href="/r/conspiro">/r/conspiro</a>. However, this spy-bot will only cross-post specific topics based on keywords it finds on the post title or self-post text. This bot makes it easier to find posts without having to hang out at <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> all day. The Agent can check his private sub any time he likes so it fits with his work schedule without missing any posts they have to suppress. Work smarter, not harder. So far it doesn&#39;t seem the bot in use right now scans self-posts texts but we cannot rule out future implementation.</p>

<p>A typical cross-post on this private sub would look something like this: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26xbft/are_there_any_gmos_in_pepsi_next/">[GMO] Are there any GMO&#39;s in pepsi next?</a></p>

<p>The [GMO] tag serves to classify topics so the specialized agent can work this post, likewise with [Sandy Hook], [9/11] so on and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Create your sockpuppets.</strong></p>

<p>The hierarchy would look something like this:</p>

<p>Agent 1 (specialties: GMO):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/u/Agent1_sock1">/u/Agent1_sock1</a> - This account comments in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a naïve new guy.</li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent1_sock2">/u/Agent1_sock2</a> - This account does general JTRIG &amp; manipulation tactics.</li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent1_sock3">/u/Agent1_sock3</a> - This account cross-posts in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a></li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent1_sock4">/u/Agent1_sock4</a> - This account cross-posts in <a href="/r/SubRedditDrama">/r/SubRedditDrama</a></li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent1_sock5">/u/Agent1_sock5</a> - This account does general discussions, usually agreeing with a debunking partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agent 2 (specialties: Fluoride):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/u/Agent2_sock1">/u/Agent2_sock1</a> - This account comments in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a naïve new guy.</li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent2_sock2">/u/Agent2_sock2</a> - This account does general JTRIG &amp; manipulation tactics.</li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent2_sock3">/u/Agent2_sock3</a> - This account cross-posts in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a></li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent2_sock4">/u/Agent2_sock4</a> - This account cross-posts in <a href="/r/SubRedditDrama">/r/SubRedditDrama</a></li>
<li><a href="/u/Agent2_sock5">/u/Agent2_sock5</a> - This account does general discussions, usually agreeing with a debunking partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>... and so on and so on for any topic worthy of suppression. One agent per topic but this is not written in stone, they can engage other topics but have to focus on their main narrative.</p>

<p>So far here we have 10 highly organized sockpuppets. 10 users (or just 2 agents) can do serious damage to a post.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;But Reddit&#39;s algorithm prevents vote brigading via IP.&quot;</p>

<p>No problem. Each sockpuppet can be created using a different IP using free proxy services like <a href="https://www.hidemyass.com/proxy-list/">https://www.hidemyass.com/proxy-list/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Ok, but 2 users with the same IP will be noticed by the algorithm.&quot;</p>

<p>No problem. After the account is created with a proxy IP, a simple browser extension takes care of the rest. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anonymox/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anonymox/</a>. This addon let&#39;s you change browser IP&#39;s on the fly. The paid version let&#39;s you use up to 40 different IP&#39;s. I&#39;m not suggesting this is the addon they use, but it serves to illustrate how a common user can pull this off with widely available software.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is how the &quot;inner circle&quot; would operate. The ignorant users of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are just brigade fodder. The Agent cross-posts in  there to get the useful idiots to do their thing: ridicule and brigade. Now the sockpuppet army has just expanded and I didn&#39;t have to create any new accounts, they did the job just fine without even knowing they were being manipulated themselves.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Ok, now what? </p>

<p>Since they depend on these methods to work, we can&#39;t necessarily stop them completely but we can slow them down. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>REMOVE keywords from post title. For example, insinuate the topic without having to use Sandy Hook on the title.</p></li>
<li><p>Like mentioned above, it&#39;s not clear if the spy-bot scans self-post texts. If it does, you can create a self-post using method in the step above as to prevent the post from being flagged, and the text can be an image with the text written on it. The spy-bot would not be able to read the text on the image.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using just these 2 steps, it would severely damage the progress the shills have made, forcing them to have to lurk <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and making them waste time looking for their topics themselves.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but see some comedy in the solution though. </p>

<p>&quot;Interesting observation made about the air travel machines roughly contacting man made objects 4,654 days ago!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Individuals who handle spreadsheets and implied value vehicles lie to increase their holdings of said value vehicles with such vigorous efficiency as to rend the trust from the entire system which implies authority to said vehicles.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, targeting keywords is super effective. Because we look for keywords. It&#39;s a brain thing. Now, I can scan a ton of information, looking for a single combination of characters for hours. Because for some reason I give myself tasks that require me to know FOR CERTAIN that I am ordering the correct 50 cent bolt, and I like to see the schema to make sure, and then measure the application to make sure that I started with the correct terms. At least that&#39;s what I did when I started working on cars as a kid. Because I HATE crossed threads and bolt extraction with a PASSION.</p>

<p>And that was just because I didn&#39;t want to waste the gas going to the fastener store unprepared for the 20th time and ordering another 25 bolts that I didn&#39;t need.  M5x110 for EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Sorry. </p>

<p>I like the idea of using images with text written on them. It could slightly increase the difficulty of censorship. But, if this is real: <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/05/google-acquires-word-lens-the-iphone-translation-app-from-apples-latest-commercial">http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/05/google-acquires-word-lens-the-iphone-translation-app-from-apples-latest-commercial</a> , and there is a concerted government effort to modify opinion (duh) then the only effective method is going out into the rest of the web and directly communicating with forums. Or, you know, friends, neighbors, family...</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t talk about your theories with people in person, you may not understand the material evidence enough to defend your position. </p>

<p>Then again, I grew up perfecting the art of making people hit me first... Like a true American. :-D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had a solution. Aside from an encryption system that obscures titles except for people who can prove that they are human. Unfortunately that is a form of censorship and a hassle that most will not go through. </p>

<p>The only way to really make sure that you do not have bots or individuals with multiple accounts manipulating opinion is by removing anonymity. Which is dangerous too. You can see how we have tried to achieve this with Facebook. We need to be able to communicate privately, which means we need to be able to trust electronics manufacturers or build our own electronics. </p>

<p>I suppose that it really boils down to making fewer things punishable by the law. Which requires a concerted effort to win the hearts and minds of the people.... </p>

<p>Maybe we never did get away from the hearts and minds doctrine... We just implemented a little shock and awe as a sloppy catalyst.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with clandestine agencies that report to nobody... You just can&#39;t know what the doctrine is. I want every dollar in government tracked. If they can throw us in jail for obscure tax codes... Fair is fair. </p>

<p>If your post is hit.  Make another post, and another.  Cover more angles.  Become even more controversial.  Keep them busy.   Nobody can confound JTRIG shills like those here, and that&#39;s because we have the most practice.  </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t like crisis actors, and you see brigading?  Give them a wall of crisis actor posts to work on.  At the very least we&#39;re creating jobs.</p>

<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.</p>
