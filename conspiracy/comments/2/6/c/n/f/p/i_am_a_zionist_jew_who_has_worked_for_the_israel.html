       As the title says, I am a Jew and a Zionist. I have worked for a pro-Israel lobby and personally lobbied for pro-Israel legislation several times. I grew up going to Israel every year and consider it a huge part of my identity. Just for fun, I'll throw in that my parents are wealthy financiers who frequently donate to political campaigns. I'm basically everything the 'Elders of Zion' crowd dreams about.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/Conspiracy is frequently the site of reasoned, rational discussion on everything from 9/11 to the NDAA, but I'm fascinated by how quickly threads relating to Jews/Zionism become heated &amp; bombastic. So, I just thought I'd put myself out there to clear up anything you guys might wonder about "us". AMA!
      </p>
      <p>
       (And no, I'm not a 'JIDF shill'. Believe it or not, some people like Israel without being paid for it.)

       Personally, I'm sure you're aware that this post will attract a few people that are anti-Jew and a lot of trolls pretending to be anti-Jew using foul language... all in order to make this sub appear to be anti-Jew. (

       I definitely wasn't trying to attract Jew-hatred.. I'm not really vested enough in reddit politics to care how this sub is perceived. I just felt as someone who frequently peruses the sub that so many commenters talked about Jews and/or Zionists like Martians and thought a little exposure wouldn't hurt. Happy to say that thus far nothing overtly racist has cropped up.

       how can you justify the extermination of a group of people, while at the same time calling people who criticize your policies "racist"?

       Not that you do these things, I don't know you or what you believe, but in my experience this seems to be the zionist agenda.

       I don't justify the extermination of Palestinians, nor would I. Extermination is not what I believe is going on. Palestinians within Israel are flourishing, attending universities, starting families and businesses, and attaining public office. Palestinians in the West Bank/Gaza are another story. The Occupation creates some horrific human rights abuses, and plenty of people who identify as Zionist Jews are staunch critics of those policies. It's tragic, but it's not extermination. Call a spade a spade. (and no, I don't think criticism of Israel is inherently racist or antisemitic). Thanks for being the first person to ask an actual question.

       Well that just makes you human, it certainly doesn't make you a humanitarian.  As for the Palestinians that are 'flourishing' what about the ones that can't get to certain hospitals or jobs because of check points?  What about the recent up tick in internment camps being built all over Israel, certainly not all of them are for the Ethiopian jews!?  You should be ashamed by how many Palestinians have been killed and have had their homes bulldozed not applauding the Israeli government for any kind of restraint.

       I specifically said that Palestinians within Israel are flourishing. The sorts of things you're referring to (check points, home demolitions, etc) occur within the Occupied Territories and I referred to them as "horrific human rights abuses" in the comment you're replying to... we're on the same page. As for internment camps, I'm not sure what you're referring to. There are refugee camps for all of the African undocumented immigrants, but those people are not Ethiopian Jews. It's certainly not an ideal situation, but Israel excepts way more refugees by percentage from places like Sudan and Eritrea than most other first world countries. Those people risked their lives to end up in these "internment camps".

       It's a huge demographic problem. But, as the video says, these people are in Israel because America and Europe shut their doors to them. They aren't given citizenship or full rights (is there any country in the world where you can just show up and demand that?) but at least Israel gives them a haven from the places they're fleeing. In the U.S. they'd never make it in, and if they did, they'd be rounded up and deported at the first opportunity.

       Huge demographic problem for an artificially created settler state "democracy" based on ethnic superiority and preference, and segregation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the occupation, which will ensure a 1 state solution eventually. The only demographic problem is that Israel only exists as a fairy tale, and in reality has to forcefully segregate, dispossess, occupy, etc... all the things its done for decades.

       Its not a normal country, and a western "Democracy" based on Ethnic segregation and separation of people either from their place of origin, or from each other is not the course for western countries, as history has shown (Civil War and Abolition, Civil Rights Movement, etc..) The fact that liberal westerners don't recognize the cognitive dissonance of living in a real democracy while advocating for segregation overseas is mind boggling.  But that just goes to show you how strong the brainwashing is.

       OP, if you had to make a guess, why do you think that Jews are the nucleus of so many conspiracies? It seems like evey little thing is blamed on the community/sinister organization. Is it just centuries of momentum in that direction that's impossible to stop?

       It's a really pervasive historical trend. During the Black Plague it was always Jews poisoning the wells, etc. Jews have been around longer than almost any other ethnic group and for the vast majority of our existence have never had a place where we were the majority. Humans have a tendency to blame things on the "other", and we've been the "other" (especially in the West) basically forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for all the conspiracies, it's actually fairly simple. In Europe, Christians were forbidden from lending money (by religion) and Jews were forbidden from owning land (by law) so all of the Jews gravitated towards financial trades. They tended to accrue lots of money this way. Christians looked around and saw that this tiny minority of Jews had huge amounts of cash. Before European kings had central banks/other countries to borrow from, they'd borrow from Jews. When they were too deep in debt, they'd say the Jews were conspiring to rob the good Christian folk and kick them out. This pattern continued till modern day. In modern times, you have a lot of really successful Jews largely for cultural reasons. Our culture places a huge emphasis on education, and we've been doing white-collar jobs since before they were even lucrative. Those factors happen to result in us being a wealthier-than-average ethnic group in a lot of places. When people see a small group doing oddly well, they tend to assume we're all in cahoots. Add to that classical anti-Semitism like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and it's a formula for this kind of conspiracy theory.

       Wow, that's really a shit deal your people have had. Is it even getting better? Most Middle-Eastern countries are staunchly anti-Zionist, but in America most of it is concentrated into small comunities like this. Do you ever see any indication that it's a dying trend that will someday disappear? Or at least weaken indefinitely anyway, let's be realistic here...

       Obviously I'm pro-Israel, but I suspect that an independent Palestinian state might solve some of the tension in and around Israel. Is that something you see happening?

       It's actually getting worse in a lot of places. America has never really had a problem with anti-Semitism (thank God), but places you'd never expect are getting really anti-Semitic. For example, 75% of Jews in France report that they've strongly considered moving to Israel because they don't feel safe. Jews in Sweden are being granted political asylum because their rights are being infringed. This isn't the Saudi Arabia or Somalia, this is liberal, educated Europe. It's crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a Palestinian state could help to lessen tensions enormously. Most Jews and most Israelis support a two-state solution with two independent states for both peoples. The trouble is getting there... Kerry had some serious talks that have failed in the last few months. I believe that the creation of a state is inevitable and the only way peace will happen. The question is, do we do everything we can to make that a reality now or do we wait 50 years until things are so bad we have no other choice? I pray the world chooses the former.

       Holy crap, that's the opposite of what I expected from Europe. Well, not from France, but whatever. I didn't know it was still so strong there. It seems old habits die hard, for better and for worse.
      </p>

       It almost seems like the leaders of Israel are holding out against the Palestinians in terms of independence, which is not surprising (see Canada, Spain, the UK, Ukraine, China...), but there almost seems to be an active resistance to the formation of a Palestinian state, especially in America, which I believe is the only country on the UN security council opposed to recognition of Palestine. Is this just a consequence of imperialistic desires or is there a deeper motive going on?

       A lot of it has to do with anti-Semitic acts being carried out by recent immigrants from places like North Africa and the Middle East and the local Europeans being too indifferent to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of active resistance to Palestinian independence. When the Israelis pulled out of Gaza, they had total self-determination and used that to elect Hamas, a terrorist group, which proceeded to launch one of the bloodiest terror campaigns in modern history that continues to this day. Until they feel comfortable that relinquishing control in the West Bank won't result in something similar, they won't do it. Now, in America, it's just reached ridiculous heights, to the extent that Chris Christie recently was forced to apologize for even saying the word "Occupied Territories" in public. In Israel, it's not so ideological, it's just a very practical fear of the consequences. Again, most Israelis support Palestinian independence, they are just terrified of the steps it will take to get there. I don't agree with them, but I also find it hard to blame them.

       Kind of. The American Right gets very upset when you acknowledge that any kind of occupation exists. They call the West Bank "Judea and Samaria" instead of the Occupied Territories. Even though almost every single Israeli, including the prime minister and the courts, regularly uses the word "occupation". Communities in the Diaspora can be way more extreme than the people they're trying to defend.

       So most of Israel is in favor of Palestinian liberation, but the people in charge are reluctant to do it because they're worried about terrorists taking control and retaliating violently? That sort of makes sense. Is it possible that a lot of the foot-dragging is caused by the leadership's desire to please the USA?

       No actually. Even though the conservatives/Jews in the U.S. tend to be pretty radical, U.S. leadership desperately wants to see some progress on this issue. Obama and Kerry were incredibly frustrated with the Israeli administration's refusal to act during this last round of talks. Obama has publicly (and not so publicly) made some pretty scathing remarks about Netanyahu's inaction during these 6 years. Our only hope is that when a more liberal PM gets elected (don't even ask who, maybe Tzipi Livni or Yair Lapid) there will be some progress.

       as a Frenchman I can say that my country has sadly become more and more racist throughout the years, not only anti Jew but extremely anti Arab too. The extreme right is gaining every year more and more votes. I'd say that the economic crisis has a lot to do with this. people see the jobs disappearing and actually believe it when politicians blame immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a sad state of affairs that I believe only economic reconstruction would put an end to, but that will be a long process, and I don't see any signs of it starting yet. In the EU and US at least.

       That's a complex question, but I'll do my best. The vast majority of the aid is military assistance. However, 74% of that money is required to be spent in the U.S. Effectively, we give the Israelis money that they then pump back into the American economy. Our aid to Israel keeps dozens of huge American companies in business.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for 'why', there are a number of reasons. For one, we need to have a place from which to deploy troops/planes/ships in the Middle East. Israel has been called "America's Middle East Aircraft Carrier". For better or worse, without a stable, strong ally in the region we would have a greatly diminished ability to exert our foreign policy in the Middle East, and would be much worse at protecting our troops there. It's also standard policy for the U.S. to support ideological allies in otherwise unfriendly regions. We've dealt with the consequences of extremism &amp; dictatorship coming out of the Arab world. A secular, liberal democracy in the middle of all that helps to even things out (at least in theory).

       I would argue that the more sane among us would seek out a position of power over one's peers. Although, for a lot of people, morality gets in the way of reaching that ultimate end.

      <p>
       I don't think you're a troll. There's always a possibility you are of course. My question is this. Has morality ever gotten in the way for you? On the scale of 0 to 10, how Zionist would you say you are? Do you think the more Zionist someone is, the less likely they are to feel empathy for their peers?

       If you define Zionism as the belief that the Jewish people have a right to safety and self-determination, then I'm a solid 10. If your view of Zionism is that Jews have a right to do whatever they want in the name of national security, expand settlements endlessly, and generally conduct themselves like warmongers, I'm not a Zionist. I think when you say "more Zionist" you really mean "more right-wing". There are left-wing pro-Israel lobbies (like the one I worked for) that believe that criticism of Israeli administrations when they fuck up (like Netanyahu does, all the time) is absolutely necessary. I would argue that keeping the Jewish state moral/ethical is the duty of every Zionist. But to be totally honest, I've had plenty of moral dilemmas. I never really interacted with Palestinians in the West Bank until I was 17. It was eye-opening, and made me uncomfortable. I questioned a lot. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that Zionism and a love of human rights are exclusive. Palestinians will only achieve statehood/freedom when Israel gives it to them. A weak Israel is not one that's going to make those concessions. You cannot support either people without supporting both.

       I believe every group of people deserves self-determination. I stated elsewhere in the thread that the majority of Israelis and American Jews believe in the creation of an independent Palestinian state. It is as much their home as it is ours. You may be interested to know that before the creation of Israel Zionists were pushing very hard for a state in Argentina or Alaska. It's only located where it is today to placate the religious minority. It also just made the most sense to the largely Christian international community; they decided where Israel should be as much as we did.

       What you're referring to is the Khazar Conspiracy, which isn't accepted by mainstream academics. Jews from Eastern Europe have more in common genetically-speaking with Jews from India, Africa, and the Levant than they do with their Eastern European neighbors. Besides, the majority of Israelis are Sephardi or Mizrachi, not Ashkenazi. Even if all of the Ashkenazim are converts, if every single nation on Earth would deprive you of your rights for being a Jew, I'd say you still deserve some peace and safety.

       for some reason, I'd guess the good old "divide &amp; conquer", a lot of people seem to think that Israel and not the USA-UK-NATO clique are behind 9/11. I'd wager that a lot of the hate comes from these misguided people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the extreme right propaganda so common in the US of A also helps keep the good old "jewish conspiracy" alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking for myself, I have nothing against Israel, even though I tend to feel more favorable to Palestine simply because they are the underdog, I believe Jews should be allowed to have their own country, not a Jewish only country, but a country they can call their own while still allowing people who want to live there, to live there.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question would then be, what is your stance on the multiple crimes of the extreme right government currently in power in Israel? things like the white phosphorous bombings in civilian areas, or the ever expanding Israeli territory? Do you feel those are justified by the years of fighting? or do you believe these are excesses that cannot be justified?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you can be bothered, what is your position on the 9/11 events?

       The extreme right in the U.S. actually tends to be staunchly pro-Israel. Michele Bachmann (arguably the closest we have to Marine Le Pen) actually worked on a kibbutz for a while. And all of the Christian fundamentalists love us, albeit for rather strange reasons. I've experienced far more anti-semitism coming from the Left.

       That's exactly what Israel is.

      <p>
       As for your question, I oppose the use of white phosphorous as anything other than a smokescreen. White phosphorous was specifically brought up in a U.N. investigation into Operation Cast Lead called the Goldstone Report which alleged it was being used as a chemical weapon. As it produces large amounts of smoke, it's commonly used as a smoke screen to cover troop movements in many militaries. The IDF response was that they were using it only as a smokescreen and nothing else. There were 10 civilians with white phosphorous burns according to Human Rights Watch, but there's never been a conclusion as to whether or not that was inflicted intentionally. I think its use was very dangerous in so densely populated a place and a few civillian structures experienced small fires. That being said, if it burned 10 people out of 500,000 in Gaza City, it's not a very effective weapon. The smoke itself is far less harmful than tear gas. Obviously, I don't support its use as a chemical weapon, I just think it's hard to make the case that that's what was going on. It's not even included in the U.N's
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention">
        Chemical Weapons Convention
       </a>
       Also, white phosphorous is launched from canisters, sort of like tear gas. To my knowledge there have never been allegations of white phosphorous "bombings".
      </p>
      <p>
       As for settlement expansion, I actively oppose it and have personally lobbied for legislative measures which would aim to curtail it. The majority of Israelis support the evacuation of settlers over the Green Line as part of an eventual final status agreement.

       Because I don't really like the use of the term 'Israel Lobby'. There are many lobbies focused on Israel, with diverse and sometimes opposing viewpoints. For example, my organization lobbied directly against AIPAC on the Iran Sanctions Bill this year (and won, btw). So I don't think we should all be lumped into the same group. I just knew it was a term people in this sub would recognize and respond to.

       The organization to which you belonged, JStreet, is a component of the Israel Lobby.  As is AIPAC. Like AIPAC JStreet seeks to ensure the continuance of US political, military, economic and diplomatic support for Israel, no matter what.

      <p>
       The very day when Israel initiated the atrocities of Cast Lead, there was JStreet:

       <a href="http://jstreet.org/blog/post/j-street-supports-israels-right-to-selfdefense">
        "We believed that Israel’s military action in Gaza was both understandable and justifiable. No country can be expected to absorb thousands of rockets without the right to respond militarily."

       That quote essentially says we believe Israel has a right to defend itself. I don't think you can construe something we wrote two hours into Cast Lead as sanctioning everything that went on. The actual statement we released that day is found at the link you posted and warns against escalation. The second half of the statement you quoted condemns the blockade. If you can't perceive how that's different than AIPAC you don't know AIPAC very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       "While this morning’s air strikes by Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza can be understood and even justified in the wake of recent rocket attacks, we believe that real friends of Israel recognize that escalating the conflict will prove counterproductive, igniting further anger in the region and damaging long-term prospects for peace and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respecting Israel’s right to defend itself, we urge leaders there to recognize that there is no military solution to what is fundamentally a political conflict between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       We stand by that statement and believe that the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the consequent human suffering being experienced by the people of Gaza is not advancing Israel’s interests and is in fact sowing the seeds of further violence and devastation if there is no political resolution to the conflict in the near future."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your distaste for liberal Zionists relative to other groups is interesting. Given that Kahanists sanction acts of terror and literally pray at a shrine to Baruch Goldstein, you may want to reevaluate a bit. If you consider all Zionists baby-eating monsters then, yes, I suppose liberal Zionist sounds like an oxymoron. If you don't view the most complex conflict in modern history as an easy black-and-white narrative with Good Guys and Bad Guys, you can appreciate the nuances more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iran Sanctions Bill, not Iran sanctions in general. A specific piece of legislation that we lobbied in opposition to AIPAC on. It stalled completely in the Senate and after it started to gain House support, we lobbied for a letter that gained traction and prevented more Dems from signing on. Obama hasn't actually had a chance to take direct action on it yet.

       This is actually something that comes up a lot within the trendy Israeli left. Ultimately, I disagree. The goal of Zionism is a Jewish democracy by and for Jews. Today, you have a Jewish state not-so-democratically governing millions of non-Jews (Palestinians). The state spends way more resources governing people beyond its borders than the people within them. That was never the purpose. Until Palestinian statehood is achieved, the Zionist dream is not yet accomplished.

       Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians lived in "Israel" when Zionists immigrated. In order to have a "Jewish democracy" you would have to remove all of them, and have a 100% Jewish only citizenry. How is that not fascism/apartheid, etc..? I don't understand that. Especially since you don't live there and still feel the need for this "Jewish democracy" (an oxymoron) to happen and be maintained. Well, why don't you move there? Or are you content with all of this being a mental exercise you can fantasize about?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a game man. You can't have a Jewish democracy without creating it artificially, and you cannot call it a democracy unless there are 100% Jews only there - forever. Also, if the majority of the populace wanted it to become a real democracy or all of its citizens, and become a secular state with a sensible immigration policy, not determined by Jewish or non-Jewish character. In a democracy, this could be voted in. In a JEWISH democracy, this makes no sense - therefore, not a democracy.

       Israel today is Jewish. Israel today is a democracy. And yet, contrary to your statement, Israel does not have 100% Jewish citizenry. Non-Jews are and have always been an integral part of Israeli society and culture. They vote and run for office like everyone else. Sure, there's a magen david on the flag and the national anthem says "nefesh yehudi" but I don't see how you can act like non-Jews aren't actually participating in the democratic process simply because it's a Jewish state. The dominant party in Germany are the Christian Democrats, no one's accusing Angela Merkel of trying to turn Germany into a non-democracy.

       This proves nothing other than the fact that Israel is unique. It exists to serve the only group of people in the world that have no central geographic area. It was designed to be the exception to the rule, you'll have to do more than that to demonstrate whether or not it is a democracy.

       trendy, that's dismissive.   the goal of zionism has been achieved.  the only reason I can see for zionism now is for christian evangelists who need a landing pad for their messiah.

       Again, you still don't have a state by and for Jews. It's by Jews and for Jews plus millions of other people. But I think this is largely a semantic question, the state of Israel will always need support and will always need a continued debate on what its principles are. If you want to stop calling that Zionism for one reason or another, fine by me. I'm attached to the concept, not the term.

       If I may, I think you're onto something when you say that the goals of Zionism have already been accomplished, so why is it an issue?  The problem is that Zionism has become a dirty word.  It is simply a name for Jewish nationalism.  In a very real way, it's no different from Czech, German, Hungarian, Serbian, Italian, or Polish nationalism that came to define the 19th century.  Now before you say "Judaism is a religion, not an ethnicity, it's not the same!" - Judaism is both.  This is a problem unique to Judaism and it has no parallel anywhere else.  Technically, there are three major "ethnicities" of Judaism - Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Mizrahi (Iberian, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern). Honestly I would prefer "Hebrew state" over "Jewish state" but the distinction is semantic.  The idea behind Zionism is that these three ethnic groups, collectively called Jews or Hebrews, have the right to unified self-determination.  Now as for why it's still important - it wouldn't be, really, if it weren't used as a criticism.  When many people today use the word "Zionist" it is synonymous with murderer, bigot, racist, thief, etc. - strangely enough, exactly the same age-old slurs against Judaism.  Many Jews today consider themselves zionists, not because they think that there is more work to be done (or more land to "conquer"), but because they claim it as a neutral descriptor and think it should stay that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, in much the same way, I am a fan of Palestinian nationalism, too.  It just doesn't have such a catchy single word like "Zionism" to describe it.

       All very salient points. I think the reason the word to describe support for Jewish statehood is still around is that the existence of the Jewish state is still not accepted by some people. I'm sure there were catchy words specifically for Czech, German, Hungarian nationalists when those conversations were still being had, but eventually the world accepted that those states existed. There are such words in Spanish for Basque statists and Hindi for Sikh statists. When we assert that we are Zionists, we assert that we believe the Jewish state should and does exist, because somehow that's something some people haven't yet accepted. I yearn for a day when we don't need a word for Zionism.

       They want Jews only. Forever. Next question.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is Zionism. Don't be fooled. Jews are not aliens that need to be segregated from anyone else. Most humans by now (generally in the Western World) are a mix of many different ethnicity, ancestries, traditional heritage or descent, etc... To create this absolutist ideology and expect anyone and everyone to accept it without criticism is just... psychotic. I don't know any other word to say it. And I have so much experience with Israeli and Jewish communities... like 5 generations of them from Israel, as well as American-Israelis, Jews, etc... They are almost all brainwashed and bigoted. There is no way to be Israeli/Zionist without resenting or hating an opposing group. It is also not possible to be Israeli without feeling the victim. Victim hood is the basis of Zionism. Therefore one must always feel at odds with the world around them in order to truly be a Zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to be fair, I think most Israeli/Jews/Zionist etc are not consciously bigoted or segregationists, but they attach themselves to these ideologies because they don't feel comfortable questioning what they were brought up with and what their community or family believes. It can also be an empowering feeling, to be taught you are "chosen" and "entitled" in perpetuity to a superior position. It can be very exciting for many Jews/Israelis and therefore they don't feel the negative effects of segregation and endless, perpetual, indoctrinated, normalized war state.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can make a person feel very isolated, to question and disconnect from that.  However, it is simply inevitable if you are person of conscience, in my opinion.

       This is difficult to respond to because it's a bit vague and also not a question. For starters, saying you're a Zionist means you believe in the existence of a Jewish state, not that you sanction each and every policy of such a state. Israel is not a monolith, and neither is Palestine. One may call themselves a patriotic American without supporting the Iraq war or the Affordable Care Act. If you have a more specific question, I'd be happy to answer it.

       Sorry, couldn't find anything on Ben Zigiev when I googled. Could you explain it to me? As for Mossad, they are actually pretty open about their activities compared to other intelligence agencies. They tend to take credit for their operations, in a twisted kind of honor system. I find them pretty fascinating. I'm not sure about specific resources though. I'm sure there are some pretty comprehensive books given how new the agency is.

       Israel's defense budget is $15billion. US Aid is about $3billion. Suddenly stopping aid would hurt Israel's military of course, but is not an existential threat at all.

       I answered a question above about U.S. aid pretty extensively. To answer you directly, the U.S. won't be cutting off aid anytime soon because they benefit greatly from it. If there's one thing America does well, it's looking out for its own self-interest. See the post above.

       The US does not benefit from giving Israel some 2.5$ billion a year. Also, soon enough that aid will begin to end. So answer the question: How long will Israel last once the US cuts Israel off?

       I outlined how the U.S. benefits from giving aid to Israel in the post I referred you to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of the aid is military assistance. However, 74% of that money is required to be spent in the U.S. Effectively, we give the Israelis money that they then pump back into the American economy. Our aid to Israel keeps dozens of huge American companies in business.
As for 'why', there are a number of reasons. For one, we need to have a place from which to deploy troops/planes/ships in the Middle East. Israel has been called "America's Middle East Aircraft Carrier". For better or worse, without a stable, strong ally in the region we would have a greatly diminished ability to exert our foreign policy in the Middle East, and would be much worse at protecting our troops there. It's also standard policy for the U.S. to support ideological allies in otherwise unfriendly regions. We've dealt with the consequences of extremism &amp; dictatorship coming out of the Arab world. A secular, liberal democracy in the middle of all that helps to even things out (at least in theory).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to hear why you think aid will end soon given that the budget for it has been approved so far into the future. Fortunately, vast though it is, U.S. Aid comprises only around 20% of Israel's military budget, so the country wouldn't exactly collapse without it.

       The US won't be cutting this off any time soon, not because they benefit in any way by making the Middle East less secure, but because you can't seek any high office in the US without fully supporting AIPAC.

       The problem I have with you is that you are not even Israeli, yet you think having rich parents that send you to summer camp in Israel every year warrants you some kind of credibility to dictate where people can live, the legitimacy of certain ideologies, and some kind of moral superiority about a place you do not live in and a community (Israeli/Palestinian) that you don't belong to. I find it hilarious and telling thay you call yourself a zionist, and dont live in Israel or raise a family there, even though you admitted to having the means to do so. While you and your family later return to the US and continue to lead lives under a fair and equal system of government, you casually support the erasing of the history,  culture,  identity and property of another people who dont have the casual ability to return to cushy lives in the US after summer camp in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is and has absolutely been  systematically facilitating an infrastructure and culture based on segregation and occupation/colonization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love how you 'put yourself out there to clear up misconceptions' when not only are you not Israeli, but you are a prime example of a privileged american jew dictating terms to a place he has no connection to except through money and privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in an actual setlement in east jerusalem and I can tell you first hand it is systematic removal of Palestinian residence and history while implementing a Zionist/Jewish one in its place. Then israels government and lobbies invest all they can in rationalizing and white washing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try 4 generations in Israel before you "clear things up for everyone" from your ultra privileged US suburb.

       You've managed to produce the most condescending response in a thread in which I've been called a "fascist cunt thief". Kol hakavod.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears you haven't read anything in the thread beyond my initial post, so I'll catch you up. I have never once purported to offer an Israeli perspective. I am a Jew and a Zionist and I speak from those perspectives only. I'm clearing up misconceptions about those groups. That being said, most of my family lives in Israel. My cousins are buried on Har Herzl. My brother nearly died serving in Sayeret Matkal, which isn't exactly a cushy summer program. My summers were spent working on kibbutzim &amp; studying in yeshivot, not at some camp. I'm not a Sabra but I know Israel and its people. Israelis who think you aren't a Zionist unless you make aliyah are being dismissive of the very people that support them. I also lived in Madaba, Jordan for a year, going to a school attended mostly by Palestinian exiles. After that I lived and worked in Ramallah for 6 months. Again, I'm not a Palestinian, but I know Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are absolutely right that the settlement movement is an attempt at Judaizing Palestinian space. I've said in this thread that I oppose settlement expansion. I've also mentioned the name of the organization I worked for, which actively campaigns against support for settlement movement in the U.S. legislature and considers an end to the occupation one of its primary goals. I've also said in this thread that I consider some of the consequences of the occupation to be horrific abuses of human rights. Supporting Israel is not the same as supporting those things. There are groups within Israel that identify proudly as Zionist and work every day to prevent them. You've literally read nothing I said and somehow assumed that I was simultaneously ignorant/disconnected from the issue and also the suburban American Naftali Bennet?

       You just don't see how your belief system does not give you the right to conquer another people. That is the fundamental idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists think that by stating what Zionism is, it makes it legitimate. Well it does not. Zionism is not necessary to be Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       It simply takes Jewish mythology and traditions and turns them into a nationalistic/military campaign for conquering. If you had entrenched family ties in Israel and went to a Zionist school, but were NOT religious, then you would see how Zionism is simply a nationalistic/militaristic conquering ideology. It is very difficult for me to empathize with someone who is not really tied to Israel in a significant way (you live an identify as American) trying to dictate to native peoples (all Palestinians in Israel, West Bank, whatever..) what they can and can't do or what's an appropriate form of resistance, national identity, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think that saying Zionism means "self determination for Jews" which is really just a convenient phrase for white washing what Zionism actually is: the turning of religious tradition into a nationalistic, Sparta-like tribal mantel, and conquering all available lands to expand this state and insulate it. I mean, if you weren't religious (and I'm speaking frankly, not as a personal attack on your religious belief) and didn't subscribe to supernatural beliefs as a way to rationalize your life experience, then perhaps you would be able to see what is happening there as a military exercise almost entirely devoid of religion or spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Zionism means that if someone converts to Judaism, they are now entitled to live in a settlement built on a demolished Palestinian's home. How exactly is that something that needs to be accepted simply because you define Zionism as 'self-determination for Jews'. Not all movements based on 'self determination for such and such group' are righteous and just. In fact, generally those are white-washing words to mask brutality and absolute ideological conquest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The genocide of the Native Americans was "Manifest Destiny" in other words, Self-determination for American colonists. The various fascist movements in Europe were 'self-determination' campaigns by those governments and cultures. The North Korean government proclaims itself as a movement for the self determination of Koreans, etc... There is nothing automatically 'right' about a 'self-determination' movement. That is just language to white wash invasion and occupation and segregation. Again, if you didn't attach yourself to ancient tribal mythology such as Judaism (hate to sound harsh) then perhaps you would live in the present and see that Zionism and Israel is just a way to segregate those who define themselves as Jews or are defined as such by the arbitrary "rabbinate" from all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion has NOTHING to do with it, and your family members being buried on Har Herzl justifies absolutely nothing about the Zionist ideology or occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had extended family members on both sides die as Partisan resisters against the Nazis, I had family members die in death camps, I have family members from Arab and African countries who suffered persecution, and none of those things justify what is happening in Israel/Palestine or the segregationist ideology of Zionism. You already know and can vouch from personal experience about where the safest and most natural place for Jews to live in this world: The United States of America. Don't ever forget it: You are American and that is why you have the privilege of this discussion while others who don't have this privilege suffer at the hands of an ideology you support.

       I view Zionism as a purely secular nationalist ideology. In fact, in purely theological terms, I oppose it. There are two schools of thought in the religious community about Zionism. We aren't all Dati Leumi. Before Rav Kook's radical reinterpretations, the vast majority of religious Jews were anti-Zionists. I approach the issue as a result of my secular principles, not my religious ones. It's also a bit silly to say I wouldn't think as I do if I weren't religious when there are millions of non-religious Zionists with viewpoints far to the right of mine.

       I have a very real issue with people saying non-Israelis are unqualified to speak on the issue. Firstly, since you continue to address my personal background, how long have you lived in the States? Most of my friends of Israeli decent from the Bay Area are children of parents who moved there in the 80's/early 90's, so I wouldn't guess you're fresh off the boat. Secondly, I have a degree in Mid-East politics. I worked for an organization dedicated to nothing but this issue. I have lived and worked in both Israel and Palestine. I've probably had more direct contact with Palestinians on the other side of the Green Line/in Jordan than 99% of Israelis so why are they more qualified than me to have an opinion? When I talked about my family members in Tzahal who are buried on Har Herzl, I wasn't saying that alone "justifies Zionism", I was simply saying my experience with the issue is personal as well as professional. I'm not sure you can judge the extent of a connection based on the color of a passport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you equate Zionism with nothing but the Nakba? I don't hold your parents responsible for it and neither should you. This is not a historical/philosophical discussion. However unjust you feel it might be, however angry it might make you, Israel exists. There is no evidence to suggest that will change in the foreseeable future. You've advocated elsewhere for a one-state solution. Again, however morally right that may seem to you, whatever kind of poetic justice there would be in that, it isn't going to happen unless the Israeli public demands it, and the Israeli public is not going to willingly cede a Jewish majority in Israel anytime soon. For a moment, set aside how you feel about those facts and remember that for the time being they are the facts. In a world where a Jewish Israel exists, what can you personally do to alleviate the injustices and abuses you've described? Like it or not, Israel is in the position of privilege here. Change will come because they allow it, not because of some U.N. resolution, not because some college kids put on keffiyehs and tweet about boycotts, and certainly not because Palestinians demand it. Irrespective of morality and philosophy, history has shown this to be the case time and time again. The only way the Occupation will end, Palestinians will achieve statehood, the refugees will attain a permanent home, and the violence will cease is through Israeli action. Israel will never be in a position to make any of those concessions unless it is strong and secure. Even if you hate the surrounding philosophy till the day you die, that alone is reason enough for people like you to support Israel. Anger without action helps no one. Before "Jew" or "Zionist" or any of those other labels, I approach this issue as a pragmatist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just out of curiosity (I mean that sincerely, I really hope you're up for more than just confrontation) how does your family feel about these views of yours? You may not see it since we differ so drastically, but as someone whose views are radically outside the norm of my Israeli family/religious community, we may have very similar experiences, ironically enough. Also, again just wondering, are you involved with the issue on a day to day level with groups like Jewish Voice for Peace or Students for Justice in Palestine?

       I sort of wanted to do this in the format of an AMA... But I might ask why? Obviously, a lot of atrocities occurred with the creation of Israel. The same could be said for America, France, Russia, almost any other modern state, and usually on a much larger scale. If events surrounding creation are your criteria, does any state have a right to exist?

       Not really.  But let me say this, I'm not a huge fan of the American government either.   The colonists basically raped and plundered their way into existence.  One of the reasons we fought England was to keep our slaves. Nobody seems to mention that one.  But what really pisses me off about Israel is the thing we're you tell Palestine to go fuck itself and all of it's people that even though they live there for generations they need to leave and turn all of their land over to you fucking Jews because it's ordained in your fucking magic book.

       States either exist or they don't. Israel does. Was it a smart move to place a liberal, secular democracy in the middle of a region that is anti-liberalism, fanatically religious, and undemocratic? Probably not. Were there atrocities committed in the name of Zionism during the creation of the state? Absolutely. But what's done is done. What we're left with today  is definitely imperfect, and I work to right those imperfections. But Israel is the only state in the Middle East where Arabs can vote, where women have the same rights as men, where one isn't stoned to death for being gay. And that's not insignificant.

       You're asking the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I've answered twice now in the thread the strategic benefit the U.S. gains by supporting Israel. As for your moral concerns, Israel isn't an apartheid state. If it were, Palestinians within Israel would not be elected to the Parliament, appointed to the Supreme Court, voting in elections (unlike every other country in the Middle East), attending universities, and using the same public services as everyone else. Plenty of Arabs serve in the IDF. Arabs and Jews interact and collaborate in every sphere of Israeli society. However, this does only apply within Israel proper. In the West Bank, there are conditions which separate Israelis and Palestinians. These are the things commonly used to allege it's an Apartheid state. The Occupation creates some horrific human rights abuses, and plenty of people who identify as Zionist Jews are staunch critics of those policies. The majority of American Jews and Israelis are in favor of the creation of an independent Palestinian state, complete with evacuation of the settlers and landswaps. The Occupation is awful, but it isn't apartheid. In every instance where self-governance is possible, the PA governs itself. In many cases, the PA was too disorganized to implement policy and actually asked the IDF to help out. To exaggerate and say that Israel is an apartheid state is not only inaccurate, it trivializes the struggles of those who went through actual apartheid.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Britain was in charge of the mandate. Britain signed the Balfour declaration. Britain spearheaded the U.N. Partition plan and later granted independence. You're not arguing against Israel here, you're kind of arguing against modern international relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Yet again, Israel is unique in the Middle East in that it is the only country where people may practice whatever religion they wish, or none. It's probably one of the most religiously diverse places in the entire world. In Israel, Shia and Sunni Muslims live on on the same streets without so much as batting an eye at each other. There is a Rabbinate that handles Jewish religious matters. It's strictly Orthodox and the largely secular Israeli populace is generally in favor of abolishing it. I don't really think it's accurate to say Jews receive preferential religious treatment, though I'd be happy to hear your examples. I think it's more accurate to say as an ethnic group Jews receive preferential treatment, but even then, this only really comes to the fore with immigration policy. I don't think it's racist for the Jewish nation-state to prioritize Jewish immigration. We all know that if an Arab majority in Israel was achieved, things wouldn't go well for the Jews. I believe the Israelis have a right to preserve their freedoms and self-determination. There are other cases with things like land rights where Jews are prioritized, and Jewish Israelis protest such things all the time (you may recall the shitstorm that went down when the Bedouins were being squeezed out).
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I support every people's right to self-determination. Jews, Palestinians, Basques, Irish, Sikhs. Everyone. As I've already said, I don't condone the violence that occurred when Israel was being established. But we haven't expelled the natives. Those that chose to stay in Israel have full rights. Those that chose to leave Israel chose to retaliate with violence, and subsequently live under occupation. They've been offered statehood numerous times and have chosen to decline. They have that right. Even under occupation, they have more legal rights and a higher standard of living than Palestinians living as refugees (or the general populace) in the surrounding countries. As a non-zionist, do you believe Jews have a right to self-determination? Obviously not at any cost, but would you support a Jewish state in Alaska or somewhere where there wouldn't have been a native population?

       just like many slaughterhouse owners are vegetarians. easy to be a humanitarian when you're not the one living in an open air prison. but it's not israel proper, so it's not apartheid!1! (nevermind that israel controls all imports and is constantly annexing land).

       I counter your analogy with one of my own:  the creation of Israel wasn't "stirring a hornet's nest" - it was simply adding another hornet to an already kicked nest.

       I specifically said that Palestinians within Israel are flourishing. The sorts of things you're referring to (check points, home demolitions, etc) occur within the Occupied Territories and I referred to them as "horrific human rights abuses" in the comment you're replying to... we're on the same page. As for internment camps, I'm not sure what you're referring to. There are refugee camps for all of the African undocumented immigrants, but those people are not Ethiopian Jews. It's certainly not an ideal situation, but Israel excepts way more refugees by percentage from places like Sudan and Eritrea than most other first world countries. Those people risked their lives to end up in these "internment camps".

       No actually. Even though the conservatives/Jews in the U.S. tend to be pretty radical, U.S. leadership desperately wants to see some progress on this issue. Obama and Kerry were incredibly frustrated with the Israeli administration's refusal to act during this last round of talks. Obama has publicly (and not so publicly) made some pretty scathing remarks about Netanyahu's inaction during these 6 years. Our only hope is that when a more liberal PM gets elected (don't even ask who, maybe Tzipi Livni or Yair Lapid) there will be some progress.
