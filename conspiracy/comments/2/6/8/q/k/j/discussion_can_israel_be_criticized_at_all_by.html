      <p>
       This was my response to the nth accusation of anti-semitism for criticizing israel.  In all honesty, please point out to me where I am going wrong here:
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I say 'every jewish person I've met in the usa the last year has been a fanatical yet ignorant supporter of israel's fascist policies, so I would like to see jewish people do something about how most jewish people are fucking up and also I would like to know that if i criticize israel i'm not going to be spied on by israel and have my career ruined' is that anti-semitic?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same way about christians, but not as much about muslims, as muslims aren't infiltrating my country and creating a mccarthy-ism type environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The newsweek article that just came out quotes a us official referring to the network of jewish/israeli spying operations in the united states as being part of the 'mothership', the recent snowden leaks show that all american communications are basically cc'd to israeli intelligence, including this conversation no doubt, so my question is,
      </p>
      <p>
       at what point can we say in my country we have a problem with jewish people? It seems all you, and about a dozen other responders to my points on these issues, want to talk about is to what extent I am generalizing about jewish people due to my racism and never, not once, about actual israeli policies that spy on me, interfere in my country, break treaties, shoot children, roll over peaceful demonstrators with bulldozers...(the list here really goes on and on and on, like really man, read Goliath)
      </p>
      <p>
       When it seems to me the big elephant in the room is israeli racism against muslims and especially palestinians. I'm kindof just saying 'stop spying on me' 'stop making a concentration camp and then begging us for money' 'stop using spy-ops to infliltrate my country' where as in actual israel it is commonplace to treat palestinians and even christians as genetic inferiors (see graffiti about the pope's visit), demonstrating to me that the actual lessons of The Holocaust(tm) are completely lost on the political majority in the nation of israel, despite their religious obsession with the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically if someone comes to me about my complaining and says the big problem here is that I am 'generalizing about jewish people' when the original fucking article is saying that there is now getting to be a larger tiny minority of jewish people critical of israel, implying of course that the vast majority of jewish people remain fanatical supporters of the policies I'm talking about, and you are this person in this case, i'm going to tell you to fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a jewish person, you have to show me that you are not with these policies first, otherwise I am going to assume that you are one of the ones that is a cause of the problem and say mean things to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do exactly the same when I encounter christians, if I see an 'i voted for romney' 'let's roll' and one of those fish stickers, then I am going to assume that person has their head up their ass and is cheering on all the problems in our country, that this person doesn't believe even the first tenets of their religion, as they are hell bent on war and starving out the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for that I am willing to risk being called anti-christian, and thus in the same sense, I am using my highly evolved set of balls to risk being called anti-semitic because that is how we got where we are, too many people benefiting from the mccarthy-ish fear of being branded an anti-semite and all the difficulty existing that will bring on you, due to giant networks of jewish people working together to get their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an alien came to this planet to examine the anti-semitism problem, he would read about how in olden times jewish people were accused of infiltrating countries, setting up secret networks, creating incidents to their advantage, refusing to be loyal to the country in which they were actually in...and then look at the united states over the last 60 years and see exactly that happening, with the added new addition that you are equated with a tyrannical monster (hitler) if you even say anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that alien want a bunch of jewish people on his planet? You tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: so far good discussion, I'd like to add that I only see the israeli/zionist spy operations on the usa as being one of many similar types of things going on especially by russians, chinese and americans.  But I think the united states would not get involved in the middle-east nearly so much without israel pressuring us to.  If I went to pakistan, I as an american would be
       <em>
        rightfully
       </em>
       suspected of being a spy, and people would act racist against me, something I dislike very much but which can only be solved if the "special" relationship with israel is dissolved and the forces within my own country are dissolved.  Silent jewish americans who oppose this only aids the zionists, so I would just like to see a greater argument inside the jewish people's communities about this, in the same way I'd like to see more christian and islamic people get their communities to stop fucking up and being evil in other ways.  It just so happens that the israeli meddling is influencing my country in particularly horrible way that affects me, so I am, I believe, justifiably ticked off about it.

       Jewish does not always equal Israeli, on a per individual basis at least, but in generalized terms zionist is a fine term since it clearly defines Jewish people who support Israel's genocidal campaign against the Palestinians, even the retarded ones who can't be bothered to educate themselves on this fascist state.
      </p>

       I would like to vent that the apartheid state is the largest welfare recipient of U.S. funds on the planet, Israel is a fake, propped up failed nation state. The only reason I can think it actually exists is to provide the U.S. a satellite state to rape the Middle East and African nations. That or the Rockefeller/Rothschilds actually still have roots in their primitive subset Jewish cult and wish to appropriate the area.

       My personal belief. It's a remote base of operations. Costly, but the profits from exploiting the ME and Africa would dwarf that. Also, it acts as an area of denial for other groups trying the same plan, eg. Russia, China and so on.

       An very well said argument and one that is frustrating many people right now.  It seems that there is a current trend, mostly due to the way mainstream media and politicians deal with difficult questions, to attack the messenger or questioner, rather than deal with the questions or issues themselves.  Whether it be the Israeli/Palestinian issue, 9/11, Edward Snowden revelations (name your issue de jour) if the questions cut too close to the bone of truth, the messenger is quickly labelled 'traitor, anti-emetic, anti-Islamic, conspiracy nut'...(name your insult!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it time we matured our ability to debate and discuss important issues without the name calling; its tiresome and childish and only proves to me that if you can't answer the questions asked of you without resorting to name calling, then you haven't really bothered to really investigate or research the stance you are so fiercely defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I don't know enough about the Israeli/Palestinian debate to tackle your issue in this post directly; so taking my own advice, I will say that you've asked some very important questions and perhaps someone out there will have enough clear headedness, intelligence and clarity of thought to avoid the heavy emotional response and discuss your Israeli issues without calling you anti-Semitic first.

       Someone above said the term 'zionist' is a more accurate term, and I agree. I have been in love with a young Jewish woman for years, and she is not supportive of their apartheid regime....although she was when i met her, less than a year after she returned from a school trip from Israel.

       Conflating Israeli policy with the beliefs of any given Jew is just silly. Compare US policy on any number of issues with the stated preferences of its people - marijuana legalization, NSA spying, torture - and you will see that it doesn't represent the majority. Why would you expect it to be any different in other countries?

       1 israel pressures and manipulates the usa to go to more wars than it otherwise would
      </p>

       3 the number of jewish people i encounter vocally opposing all this bullshit is pitiful, and i encounter many who are on board with it
      </p>
      <p>
       4 it's the rise of jewish fascism and fascism is a threat to everyone anywhere, any time it arises, so it's not an issue you can sit on the fence about and claim there is a huge number of silent opponents, silence feeds the beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 a large group of jewish people who are just kindof upset in an abstract way about what is going on is never going to be able to oppose the vast organization that comprises the infiltration of the american government and society.

       Zionism make me sick--probably for the same reasons that it sickens you. I will NEVER shill for Israel--to do so would be akin to supporting South Africa at the apex of apartheid.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before, MOST of us Jews are just like you--being screwed by the US Government and lied to. If I moved to Israel they would do the same to me...even WORSE...and I'd get to see the rightful owners of the Palestinian country be mistreated to boot.
      </p>

       No thanks. Israel can fuck herself--and LOTS of Jews in my age/demographic group feel the same way.

       I know there are jewish people speaking up, just seems I encounter so few of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how do you say there is a largish-jewish group of people and a fascist jewish-mostly nation infiltrating my country without flaming some fire of anti-judaism?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's israel's fault, they played themselves right into this situation, you can't fan flames like they are fanning without losing trust and casting doubts on your entire ethnic group for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same way about the usa's reaction to 911, now i can't go to pakistan(or a lot of countries) without someone thinking i might be in the cia.  And since I find our entanglements in the middle-east(sic) to have a lot to do with israel's influence, from within our own government, it is a real priority, not some fanciful cause, for me to try to get that influence out, because my personal reputation and my amount of influence in my own government are both adversely affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is working hard to make the usa act like more of a bunch of assholes than we are and it's been going on for a while.  The bankers and oil company people here have had plenty to do with it too, but the link there is a weak spot I think has to be confronted if there is any chance to improve actual conditions in my country.

       Israel is a lot like the US, surprise surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall it's a net positive, but some of the stuff "they" (as in, as a singular geopolitical entity -- obviously a massive oversimplification -- but
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "they" the way an anti-Semite would use the word) do is bad.
      </p>

       Israel is a functioning sovereign democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has a tech-based industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has a free economy which allows investment from outside individuals or companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the fundamentalist hatred towards Israel, or Jewish people living in Israel, it remains a relatively safe place. This has also led to a tourism industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is arguably the Middle East's / North Africa's singular free country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has a justice system based on common law rather than religious law (though arguably it could be more secular and more apolitical, from what I've heard).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an international state that genuinely seems to care about the world, and their place in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has a strong educational system which leads to a disproportional number of academics versus their population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's sad that so many anti-Semites, and so many people who are fundamentally opposed to the state of Israel, look at all the really great stuff they've done in the face of
       <em>
        extreme
       </em>
       adversity. I mean, just look at what Israel was a century ago.

       I'm not so interested in rehashing the bad as I feel there's an anti-Israel stance on this subreddit, but I would argue that
       <em>
        when you hear bad things about Israel, they should be taken into context
       </em>
       . Radical movements in the region are fundamentally opposed to their existence for religious or racial reasons. Israel's reaction to those problems can paint a demonic picture of the country, its government, and its people. Just as it is possible to focus focusing on an extraordinarily narrow picture of Muslims when there's a rocket attack or a suicide bombing. When Israel gets slapped in the face, their response is to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I think I misinterpreted the point of this post, I just saw this paragraph
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        he would read about how in olden times jewish people were accused of infiltrating countries, setting up secret networks, creating incidents to their advantage, refusing to be loyal to the country in which they were actually in...and then look at the united states over the last 60 years and see exactly that happening, with the added new addition that you are equated with a tyrannical monster (hitler) if you even say anything about it
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I feel like you believe in an international Jewish conspiracy, so perhaps this post will fall on deaf ears. I think I'll stop wasting my time with the rest of what I was going to say.

       you miss the point, your only defense of the newsweek mothersip accusation and the fact that american communications are all recorded in israel, is that me pointing out that a vast majority of american jewish people are ok with it, and use their money and power to influence society, to the extent that i may lose work for saying what im saying, is that i am prjudiced racially against jewish people, and im saying this is so obviously disengenuous and consistent in my interactions with jewish people that i am actually liking jewish people less and less and even less because you are manipulative, annoying, and have your head in the sand anout the actual issues you are at the center of.
      </p>
      <p>
       and really proving the point i was hoping not to peove that all criticism of israel is immediate proof of anti semitism.  when accused of this you point to the chamber of commerce and a guy named larry and say if larry isnt involved and hes jewish, you cant say its jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       so your response is dumb and off topic at best, and propoganda ops at worst.

       Sadly I think all communications from all countries are recorded to the best of all other countries abilities. Everyone spies on everyone. For some of this, we've got proof. Our allies have been
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       to spy on us. Do you hate them? Do you hate the Australians and the Brits and the French and the Germans? Do you hate Japan or Korea? Do you hate India? Do you hate Mexico?

       In a religious sense? Can the same not be said of Christianity? The Catholic church alone is
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       larger than Judaism. A lot of rich Christians out there. Some of whom own news networks. Where are the conspiracies questioning why the Pope has so much coverage in the news?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that "the Jews" get so much more coverage in the alternative news media is the reason people point fingers towards anti-Semitism.

       Okay champ. You're making me nervous. First of all, I'm not Jewish. Secondly, I think it's high time you go out and meet some Jews. I've met quite a number over the years. They're fucking people. Some of them are as dumb as a post. Some of them are pretty hardcore in their faith. Some of them don't really care and just like getting an extra holiday or two each year, truth be told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them are pretty normal people. A fair number of them are fucking smart, and funny, and clued in.

      <p>
       <strong>
        They are people
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like you're one bent media story away from going on a shooting spree, because you've concocted this image of a stereotypically evil Jewish person in your head. Even if those people exist, they do not represent the average person.

       Get out of the fucking house and meet some real people. For your own good. My response was that you should treat Jewish people as people, and not members of some large conspiracy. The fact that you 1) assume I am Jewish because I'm not frothing in the mouth with hate, and 2) think I'm "propaganda ops" just tells me you are perhaps out of touch with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not anti-prejudice. This is not "head in the sand". I hold plenty of prejudices, some of which are I'm sure are bullshit but I hold them anyway because I haven't been exposed to anything to convince me otherwise (yet).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm prejudiced against you because of the opinions you've presented so far, and your spelling/grammar. Or the way your arguments warp within the same sentence fragment. You could be a totally stand-up dude in person. You could be a scientist. I have no idea at the moment.
       <em>
        If I were to meet you
       </em>
       -- and if I were to meet a bunch of people like you, I would realize you're all different, and you're all unique individuals. And that saying "this person on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       who types like a crazy person may not be all that bad a guy, they're just misinformed on a few things".
      </p>
      <p>
       However I think you've been misled about whether or not this conspiracy exists, and that's
       <em>
        severely
       </em>
       misleading you on whether or not this group of millions of people are evil. It truly is making me nervous, man. Seems like you're chomping at the bit to go off on some racially motivated hate crimes. It's honestly scaring me.

       “Israel does spy on the U.S., but in a wide variety of ways that can't just be reduced to handling a clandestine agent like Jonathan Pollard,” said the former official on condition of anonymity because virtually everything about Israeli operations remains highly classified. “There are many players [at work], military and civilian, [in the] defense industrial base and [among] industrial competitors, technologies and commercial systems.” They are not necessarily direct employees of Israeli intelligence agencies, he said, "but all work for the mothership."

       And this is newsweek.  It's been going on for a long time.  It is well documented.  Jewish people, some of them working together, can work very strongly in the entertainment industry especially to prevent anyone from having a career if they are vocally not on board with the settlements, treatment of palestinians etc. etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have met a lot of jewish people, and i have sought encounters to try and understand better and in the last 2 years I have had only bad experiences.  At a peace gathering I visited the jewish camp and was told i need to read everything herbet weitzel(sp) ever wrote before I could even talk with them and they said things that are the opposite of what newsweek is saying, 'the mossad doesn't have time for this or that'.  They said I had to go, half of them wouldn't even talk to me.  They said I was picking a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lost a facebook friend, another entertainer, who said that palestenians launched 3 rockets into israel uh oh, and she unfriended me after I asked how many the israelis had launched into palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to be diplomatic here, but something has to change here if there is going to be peace, at all, ever.  It's not just israel, the russia, china and the usa are doing these things in lots of countries, and we are losing our trust among most of the world's population.  Like I couldn't go to any islamic country without being accused of being a spy, I can't go to south america without risking getting kidnapped, for the same kinds of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I want to change my country, I am going to have to change my country's relationship with israel just as much, which is difficult because if I lift my finger to, there is this brain-slug program going on around here that my only motivation must be historical, nazi jew-hating, when it is clearly not.

       They are a tribe and their loyalty lies with their tribe, how they act among other nations has been the main reason why they were kicked out of so many countries in history, or do you actually believe that all those incidences didn't have a valid reason for occurring?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it in Germany, tried it in Russia and they did it in America, the neoconservatives control American foreign policy and who knows how much more. The Fed, the music and movie industry, the information media the list is endless. All those facts prove that they have an incredible ability to rise social ladders in society to positions of power, whether this is done consciously or not is not the question. It DOES happen and if you choose to ignore this you are a liar.

       As mentioned previously, history is filled with baseless accusations against the Jews - typically by those envious of their wealth, or for religious reasons. Blood libel. The Protocols. Accusations of spreading the plague. All lies by anti-Semites, made up to justify pogroms and seize their assets. And, of course, that little unpleasantness in Germany during the forties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you really claiming these were "valid"? Your statement "they did it in Germany" seems to imply you think the Nazis were right. Which certainly would prove my point.

       I'm not saying Germany was "right" I'm saying events in history don't happen from nothing. Jews controlled a lot of key positions in Germany they were severely over represented and this caused them to come into the public spotlight where their every move was more closely scrutinized. They began to make life really hard for the German's themselves. When massive inflation struck Germany (because of the reparations they had to pay to France) the entire middle class disappeared, everyone lost his savings. It was then that there was a massive wealth transfer and who was the recipient of this? You guessed it, largely the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sir Arthur Bryant the British historian (Unfinished Victory (1940 pp. 136-144):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Every year it became harder and harder for a gentile to gain or keep a foothold in any privileged occupation.. At this time it was not the 'Aryans' who exercised racial discrimination. It was a discrimination that operated without violence. It was exercised by a minority against a majority. There was no persecution, only elimination.. It was the contrast between the wealth enjoyed - and lavishly displayed - by aliens of cosmopolitan tastes, and the poverty and misery of native Germans, that has made anti-Semitism so dangerous and ugly a force in the new Europe. Beggars on horseback are seldom popular, least of all with those whom they have just thrown out of the saddle."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       THIS is the root of it all. Once Jews took up these positions they kept the German's as low as they could while advancing their own. It is this tactic of racial prejudice that is one of the reasons why Jews can climb so high, its because they are pulling each other up. The German's who were suffering massive inflation caused  by the government printing too much money (because of the Versailles Treaty) had literally lost it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came the tipping point, Samuel Untermeyer, the leader of the World Jewish Economic Federation, declared war on Germany on August 6 1933 (because of the Nuremberg laws). The Nuremberg laws didn't stop the Jews however.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        .. even in November 1938, after five years of anti-Semitic legislation and persecution, they still owned, according to the Times correspondent in Berlin, something like a third of the real property in the Reich. Most of it came into their hands during the inflation..
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The London Daily Express on March 24, 1933 carried the headline Judea Declares War on Germany.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The Israelite people of the world declare an economic war on Germany. It is not sufficient that we should buy no goods made in Germany. We must refuse to deal with any shopkeeper who sells any German-made goods. What we are proposing is to bring the German people to their senses by destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now bare in mind that the German's where completely ruined, they have this super elite class of Jews who control the most influential positions and these people then have the gal to declare war on Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Count Jerzy Potocki, the Polish Ambassador in Washington, in a report to the Polish Foreign Office in January 1939, is quoted approvingly by the highly respected British military historian Major-General JFC Fuller. Concerning public opinion in America he says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Above all, propaganda here is entirely in Jewish hands when bearing public ignorance in mind, their propaganda is so effective that people have no real knowledge of the true state of affairs in Europe It is interesting to observe that in this carefully thought-out campaign no reference at all is made to Soviet Russia. If that country is mentioned, it is referred to in a friendly manner and people are given the impression that Soviet Russia is part of the democratic group of countries Jewry was able not only to establish a dangerous center in the New World for the dissemination of hatred and enmity, but it also succeeded in dividing the world into two warlike camps President Roosevelt has been given the power.. to create huge reserves in armaments for a future war which the Jews are deliberately heading for." (Fuller, JFC: The Decisive Battles of the Western World vol 3 pp 372-374.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not only did they boycott Germany economically they later started lobbying other countries against Germany. The result of all of this is the rise of the Nazi party and the subsequent world war 2 that was engineered almost exclusively by the international Jewish cartel. These snippets from Hitler's speech suddenly make a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The emancipation of the Jews was the beginning of an attack on European society. For thereby full equality was given to a people that has always formed a State within the State.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The process of industrialization meant the confluence of great masses of workmen in the cities. As industry grew, a fourth estate was formed.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The master-stroke of the Jew was to claim the leadership of the fourth estate: he founded the Movements both of the Social Democrats and the Communists. His policy was twofold: he had his ‘apostles’ in both political camps.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Parallel with this was a gradual ‘moneyfication’ of the whole of the nation’s labor-strength. ‘Share-capital’ was in the ascendant and thus bit by bit the Stock Exchange came to control the whole national economy.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the concept of Democracy, it was possible to create a State-form by which the mastery over the herd by the Jewish intelligentsia who control the organs of information is guaranteed. Though small in numbers and therefore completely hidden in the body of the people, who quite unconscious of whom they were obeying, in the end did but serve the purposes of this small stratum of society.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “The so-called ‘Law for the Protection of the Republic’ is nothing else than a means for reducing all criticism to silence. And what is the ultimate aim of Bolshevik Judaism in Germany? To make the nation defenseless in arms and to make the people defenseless in spirit. Two great aims!” (gun control)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To claim these are baseless lies is stupid because the same thing has happened in modern time. Russia and its Oligarchs were following these exact steps and were it not for Putin Russia would be controlled like America is today. America too is completely infiltrated culminating in 2001 where the neoconservatives took over office and dictated their foreign policy to Bush which started the endless wars on Terrorism and countries in the Middle-East.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parallels between Germany and America are very striking indeed, the more you read into this history of Germany the more parallels you will encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have a mentality that they can take whatever they manage to take. This is the reason why today's bankers don't feel bad about what they are doing to the world and to the country, they are exploiting the masses and as long as the masses let themselves be exploited they see no harm in doing so. This kind of morality is textbook Talmudic logic, scamming a fellow Jew is a crime, scamming a Gentile however...
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hate me for what I have written here, but these are the facts and this makes a lot more sense than just "jealousy". I don't suspect it will change your mind, it will always be us Gentiles that are the ones who's fault it is. The French revolution is taught very differently in our schools, it is taught that the working class stood up against the super elite of the country, and that it was a good thing. History is written by the victors however. Those few who exploit society until it is sucked dry are the biggest criminals in the world. They make it harder for families to live and for people to be happy. And why? They do it for their own gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy Wall Street shows us that people are beginning to notice how the game is being played out. And as always history repeats itself because we never learn from it.

       I'm afraid you lost all credibility as soon as you started quoting Bryant - a notorious, yes, anti-Semite, who even blamed the Jews for homosexuality!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The perversion which has always been a major German failing was now exploited and stimulated by Jewish caterers who, while seldom sharing such tastes, did not hesitate to turn them to their profit."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A woeful lack of perceptiveness as a historian litters his writing, such as this quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Hitler was acute enough to realize that the Marxist did not stand for freedom but for
        <strong>
         a despotic uniformity, enforced by terror and the annihilation of all who opposed them.
        </strong>
        "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Totally unlike the Third Reich at all, then. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Bryant was so embarrassed by how wildly wrong he turned out to be, that he subsequently tried to buy up unsold copies of the book. Another historian, Andrew Roberts, wrote "Bryant was in fact a Nazi sympathiser and fascist fellow-traveller, who only narrowly escaped internment as a potential traitor in 1940. He was also, incidentally, a supreme toady, fraudulent scholar and humbug."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no. You might as well just cut to the chase and use
       <em>
        Mein Kampf
       </em>
       as your historical "source".

       I don't know enough about him to defend him but nevertheless the historical narrative for Germany's explosion doesn't rely solely on the account of one man.

       “Israel does spy on the U.S., but in a wide variety of ways that can't just be reduced to handling a clandestine agent like Jonathan Pollard,” said the former official on condition of anonymity because virtually everything about Israeli operations remains highly classified. “There are many players [at work], military and civilian, [in the] defense industrial base and [among] industrial competitors, technologies and commercial systems.” They are not necessarily direct employees of Israeli intelligence agencies, he said, "but all work for the mothership."

       If israel which is trying to be a racially pure jewish country using fascism and infiltrates countries with infuriating sociopathic tactics, they are asking to be compared to the old stories told about jewish people using infuriating sociopathic tactics to infiltrate countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never used to think jewish people were persecuted for anything other than being weird dressers, but after careful study of Israel's behavior, I have to wonder.

       And examining one claim of neo-nazis doesn't make me a neo-nazi, I hate fascism and racism.  There are no inferior races only inferior ideas.

       The problem starts when an individual learns about this subject from other people instead of reading history books and understanding the middle east. a lot of the conflicts you hear about like the gulf war, Iran-iraq war, Israeli intervention in the Jordanian civil war and the recent Syria civil war trace back to very simple and basic reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       to understand the middle east you need to start from the inside, that means reading about more basic things like the fabric of Arab society, tribalism, the psychological effects of being a part of patrilocal family, effects of Islam on society and effects of ethnic and national conflicts on woman rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel itself is not too hard to understand, but what 99% of the people who criticize Israel lack is that basic understanding of Arab culture.. even Arabs themselves sometimes don't know those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: Some people say that the difficulty of arabs to be free and democratic is related to their history or their religon and some even suggest its genetic(lol) but most people that understand arab society will tell you that Arab families are completely patriarchal and dictates the life, work and in most cases the residence of their children. and this is the main reason Arabs are so prone to dictatorships.. because the grow in one.
      </p>
      <p>
       when you approach the Israeli-arab conflict then you are basically using arguments that are on the tip of a huge iceberg. someone processed and molded the information into a readable article and you use that info to make arguments.. if i was you i wouldn't be surprised if someone called me ignorant or antisemitic..

       I'm not surprised, I want to examine their assertions on the basis of their merits though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is under the influence, I believe, as the usa is, of a deep state.  Considering the risks they are taking with the ethnic heritage of jewish peoples, I kindof doubt they give a damn about jewish people as their reputation is being severely damaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a trait of fascism that the people at the top tend not to believe their own propaganda, which I think jewish people should be very well versed about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, also after reading the book goliath, it seems there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than is visible.  If I'm going to be able to talk about this type of thing(deep state) going on in my country, then I'm drawn into this discussion about israel, zionists, jewish people who may or may not support one side or the other, the real value or lack thereof of espionage, and other stuff.

       The only interest of Israeli politics is to preserve its former shape and structure, as in only "to survive".. it might surprise some people to know that israeli politics that seem so complex are actually very simple.. this "deep state" as far as a remember is some kind of old turkish secret society conspiracy and I'm pretty sure that it has nothing to do with israeli elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only thing i can think of that has anything to do with the "shadow within a shadow" type of political structure is the long dead post-revisionist communist left.. and it has molded itself into the form of "pro-Palestinian liberal Jewish anti-Zionist front".. which is biased by nature because it calls for two states to eternally separate Jews from Arab Muslims for some part xenophobic part ideological reason while it uses its money to promote "Israeli human rights fighters" which funds groups that their whole purpose is to slander Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every country has some "behind the scene" stuff but Israels' behind the scenes are not that exciting.. its non-religous and religous right VS israeli arab nationalists and non-religous left

        i need you to acknowledge that there is some serious similarity between the historic accusation and the recent historical record.

      <p>
       You mean historic accusations, like
       <em>
        The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
       </em>
       ? Or the blood libel? Or allegations that the Jews deliberately spread the plague through Europe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, there is a serious similarity: people made up anti-Semitic bullshit then, and make up anti-Semitic bullshit now. It's those spreading that kind of garbage, who poison the well and make it near-impossible for legitimate criticism and discussion.

       I'm not going on any spree, but you're going to see more crazy types losing it over this if the real people behind it don't cut it out.

       “Israel does spy on the U.S., but in a wide variety of ways that can't just be reduced to handling a clandestine agent like Jonathan Pollard,” said the former official on condition of anonymity because virtually everything about Israeli operations remains highly classified. “There are many players [at work], military and civilian, [in the] defense industrial base and [among] industrial competitors, technologies and commercial systems.” They are not necessarily direct employees of Israeli intelligence agencies, he said, "but all work for the mothership."

       And this is newsweek.  It's been going on for a long time.  It is well documented.  Jewish people, some of them working together, can work very strongly in the entertainment industry especially to prevent anyone from having a career if they are vocally not on board with the settlements, treatment of palestinians etc. etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have met a lot of jewish people, and i have sought encounters to try and understand better and in the last 2 years I have had only bad experiences.  At a peace gathering I visited the jewish camp and was told i need to read everything herbet weitzel(sp) ever wrote before I could even talk with them and they said things that are the opposite of what newsweek is saying, 'the mossad doesn't have time for this or that'.  They said I had to go, half of them wouldn't even talk to me.  They said I was picking a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lost a facebook friend, another entertainer, who said that palestenians launched 3 rockets into israel uh oh, and she unfriended me after I asked how many the israelis had launched into palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to be diplomatic here, but something has to change here if there is going to be peace, at all, ever.  It's not just israel, the russia, china and the usa are doing these things in lots of countries, and we are losing our trust among most of the world's population.  Like I couldn't go to any islamic country without being accused of being a spy, I can't go to south america without risking getting kidnapped, for the same kinds of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I want to change my country, I am going to have to change my country's relationship with israel just as much, which is difficult because if I lift my finger to, there is this brain-slug program going on around here that my only motivation must be historical, nazi jew-hating, when it is clearly not.
