<p>The fundamental structure of space-time is a quantized infinite scalar lattice geometry in the pattern of The Flower of Life. In other words, space itself is made of discrete super tiny tiny tiny packets of energy: the smallest little vibration that the electromagnetic spectrum does. These tiny packets are what you could think of as the &quot;pixels&quot; that make up the universe and since they are not square, but spherical, they are actually called &quot;voxels&quot; that organize in a 3D flower of life perfect sphere-packing geometry.</p>

<p>First discovered by Max Planck, the smallest distance you can possibly measure is the length of this universal fundamental wave-from called the Planck length: 0.0000000000000000000000000000000001616cm
(10 to the -33cm)</p>

<p>It is nearly impossible to visualize how small the Planck length is. However if you picture a little dot that is .1mm (or about the smallest thing the unaided human eye can see) and blew up that little dot like a balloon to the size of the observable universe, the Planck would then be about a .1mm dot in that universe. Or in other words, that original .1mm dot is about 1/2 way in scale between the size of the observable universe and the Plank!</p>

<p>Nassim Haramein calls these tiny energy packets Planck Spherical Units (PSU) because they are spherical, like most other structures the universe creates at all scales. These spherical waveforms overlap and perfectly pack together to form the 3D flower of life structure of space itself.</p>

<p>Using these universal voxels, Nassim calculates how many of them fit on the inside of a proton volume compared to how many are present on the outside surface area of the proton (or any black hole). This ratio, a geometric relationship, is the gravitational field!</p>

<p>Gravity is essentially a ratio of information on the inside to information on the surface of black holes in a holofractographic space-time manifold.</p>

<p>Nassim has discovered a discreet, quantized, pixelated (voxelated) way of describing gravity in which all you need to do is essentially count these little Planck Spherical Units without having to use highly complex tensor equations normally needed to solve Albert Einstein&#39;s field equations. You could place a flower of life tiling pattern around the Earth and the same geometric ratio would yield the gravitational field you are feeling right now as you read this!</p>

<p>A geometric solution for gravity.</p>

<p>The irony of it all is that this solution has been right under our noses this whole time thanks to many ancient cultures encoding this geometric relationship right into their monuments and documents in the form of the flower of life symbol.</p>

<p>The dude literally found a geometric solution to gravity using extremely simple geometry and mathematics, his black whole theory when he applies the equations gets him to within 99.9% of the rest mass of the proton. The voxels that he uses as the smallest fluctuation of energy are literally packed like an infinite flower of life lattice.</p>

<p>The geometry of the vacuum he describes looks like this: (imagine spherical torus&#39;s around the tetrahedrons to project the flower of life)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;a holofractographic space-time manifold.&quot;</p>

<p>a what? i&#39;m sorry, i love sacred geometry and all that stuff, but i can&#39;t stand nassim haramein. he presents this stuff like it&#39;s fact. he is literally the only scientist who has ever even used the phrase &quot;holofractographic,&quot; because quite frankly it&#39;s not a scientific term. this report is basically true, through the discussion of the Planck length, but the scientific validity stops when he mentions gravity. i appreciate what he&#39;s doing, trying to use science to answer philosophical questions. i think it&#39;s a valid pursuit, even though many scientists would argue that it&#39;s not, but let&#39;s be honest here. there&#39;s a reason he was so vague about how these voxels translate to a theory of gravity. it&#39;s because they don&#39;t. he literally has no math. there&#39;s no math or topological data to support anything he&#39;s saying. it&#39;s not even conjecture, because he hasn&#39;t adequately explained his proposal. it&#39;s just extremely vague stuff, catered to the alternative spirituality communities of the internet, telling them what they want to hear. and he is also one of a very small group of people who believe that spacetime is discrete. most physicists suspect that spacetime is continuous, that is, there is no smallest building block. the planck length is in reference to energy, not in reference to spacetime. and since there is 0 evidence to suggest that spacetime is &quot;made of energy,&quot; there is no evidence that spacetime is made of discrete voxels, of the planck length. it all sounds really beautiful and poetic, but it&#39;s not backed up, period. so far as our instruments can see, the spacetime of our universe continues infinitesimally, into fields so small that the smallest quanta of energy cannot exist therein.</p>

<p>anyway, i hate to sound contrarian, but i don&#39;t even see what this has to do with conspiracy. is this implying that there is some massive scientific conspiracy to shut down proposed unified theories? anyone with basic knowledge of physics or current events in physics would scoff at this idea, because pretty much every physicist in the world is looking for a unified theory with fervor. this one doesn&#39;t cut it, not by a loooong shot. the guy doesn&#39;t have any math, for fuck&#39;s sake. he sidesteps the requirement of mathematical evidence by saying &quot;uh, well, this is a geometric solution!&quot; but that&#39;s not fooling any of them. what is geometry, anyway? a visual, spatial expression of mathematics. or is math a symbolic expression of geometry? either way, if you can&#39;t explain it mathematically, and you can&#39;t even fully explain it geometrically, you&#39;re probably not on to anything big. if nassim haramein had actually made a discovery, at any point in his career, he wouldn&#39;t have published it on his blog and his facebook in such vague terms. has nassim haramein ever actually achieved anything in science, apart from misleading people to accept a sad excuse for a theory, which is supported by nothing except his conjecture and his extradimensional visions, probably caused by DMT?</p>

<p>finally, i suggest you read this as well:

    <div class="md"><p>i love how the guy just makes up his own parameters as he goes along. oh, here&#39;s irrefutable proof! Therefore, we find that the number of discrete Planck masses within any given mass multiplied by , which is a discrete quantity, will generate the holographic radius equivalent to the well known Schwarzschild radius of equation (1) so that in the case of equation (19) we have a non-relativistic form derived from discrete vacuum oscillator Planck quantities generating a quantized solution.</p>

<p>holographic radius, huh? is that just your way of pretending you made up a concept? did you just rename the schwarzschild radius so you could pretend that you came up with something new?</p>

<p>sorry, mr. haramein, but what part of your paper, exactly, proves that spacetime is composed of discrete packets of energy? what part of your paper proves anything besides the obvious fact that the planck length is, in fact, the planck length? all he has done is reiterated old equations showing that the schwarzchild radius is related to the planck length, and gone on and on for pages discussing obvious facts... clearly to avoid having to prove the predication upon which his entire thesis is founded... his assumption is based on a conjecture, for which he has literally no mathematical basis. instead of developing the conjecture, and finding corroboration in mathematical or experimental evidence, he cites equations from papers he did not write, hoping that his audience will be dumbstruck by his confusing mathematics, and will simply accept his thesis &quot;because he&#39;s a scientist.&quot;</p>

<p>the sad part is, most laymen believe him. any scientist who&#39;s ever heard of him will laugh when you bring up his name, yet somehow the public doesn&#39;t know that the guy has flat out never achieved anything, and publishes pseudoscience as fact.</p>

<p>EDIT: from the article, assuming some people don&#39;t want to click it and read it:</p>

<p>&quot;Nassim is merely playing with equations from student textbooks (these are the only references cited in the paper), things that have been explored thoroughly for decades, and he&#39;s using them in a pretty simplistic way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think this example goes some way to explain why so many people love the &#39;intuitively right&#39; feel of Nassim&#39;s ideas. It feels intuitively right to some people because his approach is simply to spot what seems to be a connection or a pattern, and link it up to the first thing that it reminds him of. He&#39;s also a master story-teller. Physics could really do with more people who can communicate like him (but who understand what they&#39;re talking about, are a bit less self-obsessed and self-promoting, and will tell the truth). Nassim Haramein is not an investigator, rigorously testing his ideas on the touchstone of reality. He is not – as he claims – a physicist. He&#39;s a fraud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A question. How is it that there is absolutely no support from any part of the scientific community for any of Nassim&#39;s ideas, talks, or research? None of his papers have been published in any scientific journal – certainly not one subject to proper peer review. Scientists seem to either treat him as a crank or dismiss him altogether. Which of the following reasons sounds most plausible? Is it...</p>

<p>(a) because the scientific establishment are afraid of having all their precious theories overturned?</p>

<p>Science loves having theories overturned. It&#39;s true that individual scientists are human and can be reluctant to accept when their way of seeing things is revealed to be false. Some will be slower to accept new things than others. But all will agree that this is part of the job of being a scientist. In addition, many scientists are deeply competitive, and for every theory beloved to one set of scientists, there&#39;ll be another set that is devoted to looking for any serious evidence they can use to pull the rug out from under it.</p>

<p>The world scientific community is an extremely diverse and argumentative bunch. Surely it would be crazy to imagine them being capable of unanimously agreeing to dismiss perfectly good ideas sitting right under all their noses.</p>

<p>This is a fact compatible with even the most cynical view of scientists – that they&#39;re more often out to prove each other wrong, even to backstab, than to back each other up. It makes it implausible that any scientist actually sees Nassim&#39;s ideas as any sort of threat. His ideas have simply never been taken seriously.</p>

<p>(b) because scientists are incapable of seeing outside the box that they were trained to think in, and are too proud to accept radical suggestion from an outsider?</p>

<p>Scientists can be guilty of narrow thinking. If you specialise in an extremely complex area, the effort of getting your head around the ideas within one framework might be so taxing that the last thing you want to be doing is considering the possibility that the whole framework might be wrong. At the same time, there are many scientists who are mavericks and ready for change, ready to throw it all up in the air. They also have all manner of values, and all manner of spiritual outlooks and practices.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of thousands of scientists in the universities of the world, and their ways of thinking are as various as any other group of hundreds of thousands of human beings - if not more so. There&#39;ll always be plenty of scientists hungry for any radical idea, especially in topics as hot as grand unified theories, provided it&#39;s got some substance.</p>

<p>There may well be unanimous skepticism about things which have utterly no scientific basis, such as someone claiming to have a theory that the moon is made of green cheese. But this is not because of any inability to think outside of the box.</p>

<p>Regarding outsiders – yes, pride and over-cautiousness can get in the way of scientists taking suggestions seriously from people not affiliated to a university. But would every single one of them fall prey to this? Again, scientists, and even scientific establishments, are surely too numerous and too diverse for this to be plausible.</p>

<p>When Garrett Lisi submitted a potentially revolutionary theory for the unification of particle physics, he was an unemployed surfer living in a camper van on a Hawaiian island with no university affiliation. (Aside from now renting a room in a shared house, it seems he still is.) Perhaps the majority of physicists initially did not take him seriously. But there were certainly plenty who did, who were waiting for someone like this to challenge everything, who looked at his work and thought &quot;you know, this guy really does know what he&#39;s talking about. He could be onto something here. And I want in on this.&quot;</p>

<p>There are so many other examples of theories being accepted from outsiders (Einstein, for one) that this answer doesn&#39;t hold any water. If he isn&#39;t getting taken seriously, it certainly can&#39;t be blamed on a complete worldwide closed-mindedness among all respectable scientists.</p>

<p>(c) because they haven&#39;t come across his ideas yet?</p>

<p>Nassim and his Resonance Project have a massive internet presence, and they&#39;ve been promoting their ideas to scientific bodies, presenting at university conferences (alongside student projects and industry researchers) throughout the world, and submitting papers to peer-review journals at every opportunity for most of the last decade. Not to mention training hundreds of people to promote their ideas for them.</p>

<p>There have been considerable efforts to put an article about Nassim Haramein, the scientist, on Wikipedia. The results can be seen here – I think you&#39;ll find the discussion revealing.</p>

<p>(It&#39;s worth noting that all Garrett Lisi did to set the academic world abuzz was to present his ideas at a single relatively obscure conference in Iceland.)</p>

<p>(d) because anyone with an understanding of science can see that his claims and his methods are not scientific in any sense of the term, and that he doesn&#39;t actually know what he&#39;s talking about?</p>

<p>I reckon so.&quot;</p>

<p>He re-describes the strong and nuclear force <em>as</em> gravitational interaction, and it works out. </p>

<p><strong>Holographic Gravity</strong></p>

<p>The Planck circles naturally distributes across the surface area of the proton horizon in such a way that they are space-filling, like the PSU’s inside the proton, creating an holographic interference pattern often called “the Flower of Life”. Now that we’re equipped with the basic structure of the proton and its relation to the quantum vacuum we may proceed to calculate essential facts about our universe.</p>

<p>We begin using our renormalized value for the vacuum density (5,1×10<sup>93</sup> gm/cm3) to derive the mass/energy available within the volume of a proton sphere; the resulting answer is 4,9×10<sup>55</sup> grams. Using the renormalized vacuum density of 10<sup>93</sup> gm per cubic centimeter, 10<sup>55</sup> gm is how much vacuum energy is permitted within the tiny proton volume.</p>

<p>We proceed by dividing the total surface area of the proton horizon by the holographic Planck circles, to learn that the proton horizon is covered by 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> intersecting equatorial circles forming the interference pattern mentioned above.</p>

<p>Now we divide 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> with 10<sup>55</sup> - that is, the number of Planck circles on the proton surface with the number of PSU’s within the proton volume – receiving the result of 5,91×10<sup>14</sup> – the exact gravitational mass needed for the proton to obey the Schwarzschild condition generating a black hole!</p>

<p>Now we have derived the holographic gravitational mass of the proton (its Schwarzschild mass) from Planck units and geometry alone, without involving the Schwarzschild equation or the gravitational equations of Einstein’s general relativity at any point. Thus Gravity has been described as a ratio of mass/information to surface area and has been accounted for completely in algebraic terms without involving space-time curvature, only through pixelation of the structure of the vacuum itself. For the first time we have mathematical proof and a functioning description of Quantum Gravity!</p>

<p><strong>Finding the Standard Proton</strong></p>

<p>We have seen how the proton achieves its holographic gravitational mass due to vacuum fluctuations within the proton volume, now we need to find its measured value when viewed from outside its horizon. This brings us to a deeper understanding of the proton wherein its quantum entanglement to all other protons is revealed.</p>

<p>The internal volume of the proton relates to its surface geometry in such a way that one PSU holographically expresses all energy/information entangled with it. If we divide the circular surface tessellations (4,72×10<sup>40)</sup> with the volume of the proton itself (10<sup>-39</sup> ) the result comes out 1,67×10<sup>79</sup> – which is the currently estimated number of particles in the universe. The result reveals a quantum entanglement through mini-wormholes with all other protons in our universe; every single Planck circle at the proton surface can be understood as a mini-wormhole internally connecting it with another proton.</p>

<p>To find the actual expressed mass of a single proton in this worm-hole matrix we must map the mass influence of one proton on a single Planck circle. We do this by dividing the Schwarzschild mass of the proton by the number of protons in the universe, which gives us 10<sup>-65</sup> (this number equals the proton mass distributed into all other protons). Then we multiply this number with the number of Planck circles on the proton surface, namely 4,72×10<sup>40,</sup> to reveal the mass influence by one single proton – one tiny wormhole connection. The result is 1,672295215 x 10<sup>-24,</sup> which is the proven Standard mass of the proton! </p>

<p>He just gets lucky, then? Using his numbers derived for PSUs he not only gets the amount of particles in the universe, but also 99.999% the size of the mass of the standard proton. </p>

<p>Coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the strong and nuclear force&quot;? LOL
and you think <em>I</em> missed something huge?</p>

<p>dude... it&#39;s the strong and <strong>weak</strong> nuclear force<strong>s</strong>... you obviously have not even a basic understanding of what you&#39;re talking about. i probably shouldn&#39;t waste another minute talking to you, except i just have to say something:</p>

<p>the strong and weak nuclear forces <em>are not</em> gravity. i don&#39;t really care what nassim haramein says about it. it&#39;s complete bogus unless he has <em>anything</em> to prove it, and he <em>doesn&#39;t</em>. you are in serious denial, man. do you think that every scientist out there is insane, and you and nassim haramein are somehow enlightened? it&#39;s like you didn&#39;t even read my responses. i strongly suggest you see a therapist, because man... you are brainwashed.</p>

<p>EDIT: the funniest part is that you asked <em>ME</em> if i had &quot;read it.&quot; look at my fucking response, dude. i quoted parts directly from the PDF you posted. i read the entire thing, and i actually understand the math, which is something you probably can&#39;t say. i don&#39;t think you even read haramein&#39;s paper, did you? because you certainly didn&#39;t read my response to it. let&#39;s be real here, dude... you&#39;re a wannabe philosopher or some shit. i understand the interest, but you don&#39;t have even a flick of knowledge about it. i&#39;m not gonna be pretentious and say you need to go and get an education, because most people just can&#39;t afford that level of debt. but you need to get online and <em>educate yourself</em> instead of just picking one author as your prophet and shilling for him. you don&#39;t have any knowledge of physics or mathematics, so how could you possibly understand what haramein is talking about? even though most of it is bullshit, i strongly doubt you understand even the basic equations he cites. so how exactly can you argue in favor of a theory of quantum gravity if you don&#39;t even know what it means?</p>

<p>anyway, there&#39;s really no sense in arguing with zealots. you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but still you will never admit it, and you will certainly never change your mind... because then you&#39;d have to acknowledge your own ignorance.</p>

<p>next time you want to prove something to a sub that is mostly full of science lovers, try using some equations... or at the very least, cite an experimental study, not a theoretical paper that is falsely labeled as having been printed in a scientific journal. nassim would be a lot better in my mind if he would stop falsifying his credentials, stop pretending that he has prestigious awards, etc. if you don&#39;t believe he does this, i strongly suggest you actually read my two previous posts, because i quote <em>detailed</em> descriptions of his fraudulent behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just want to say one thing. that last proof, regarding the standard mass of a proton being equivalent to (# of planck circles on proton surface) * (schwarzschild mass of proton/estimated # of protons in universe).</p>

<p>that&#39;s not even haramein&#39;s work... it is <em>obviously</em> true. how do you think the planck length &quot;works,&quot; anyway? there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called a <em>universal</em> constant. the trouble here is that this proof has literally <em>nothing</em> to do with his conjecture. HOW, just HOW does this proof suggest that spacetime is discrete? HOW does this proof suggest that spacetime is made of energy? HOW does this proof suggest the nuclear forces are actually gravity? HOW does this proof suggest that the universe is a bundle of resonant strings singing a magic fractal hymn of jesus and krishna and the holy whatever?</p>

<p>i&#39;ll answer that for you: <strong>it doesn&#39;t</strong>. the theory is bogus, but even worse, the &quot;proofs&quot; are bogus. this is the most sinister form of bullshit... it&#39;s not just pseudoscience, designed to fatten haramein&#39;s ego. it&#39;s flat out brainwashing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sadly, this theory is viewed as irrelevant by any modern scientist, because it is essentially based on a view of the universe consistent with the &quot;aether theory,&quot; which has been disproven time and time again. regardless, the &quot;dynamic theory of gravity&quot; has nothing to do with the flower of life OR a discreet spacetime. it&#39;s an inherently outdated theory, but even then it has nothing to do with nassim haramein&#39;s &quot;work.&quot; i would not dare disrespect the legacy of nikola tesla by comparing his work to the ramblings of the charlatan, nassim haramein. one is a true scientist, the other is a complete and utter fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading a book called <em>The Lost Light</em> lately and I would highly recommend it as it ties in with what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>It goes into the esoteric layers of meaning in the Bible below the surface &quot;literal&quot; meaning and attempts to show how it and other modern religions ultimately have their basis in ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>One of the core ideas in the book is that &quot;death&quot; in the Bible, whenever it&#39;s mentioned, refers to the death of the soul (aka incarnation into a physical body), and not the other way around.  When you read some of the scripture this way, it opens up a whole new world of interpretations/meaning/symbolism/etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m kinda going off on a tangent at this point but anyway, bottom line: the Egyptians and their knowledge base were undoubtedly <em>far</em> more advanced than is commonly known and with all of the evidence of civilizations that existed well before them, the possibilities as to this planet&#39;s true history are nearly endless.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder too. The Bible says you shuold accept the light and go into it when you die, the Egyptians wanted you to train so you could pass this trial and move onto something more. I&#39;ve been trying to look at religion with this in mind and it brings up so many questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time believing in any conclusions based on sacred geometry.  It all feels so contrived.  For instance, take your example of a FoL lattice laid over the earth.  It only fits because of the size of the circles is the same size as a common factor of the size of the earth?  What if we decided to draw the lattice that did not correspond to a common factor of the size of the earth?  It would no longer fit.  Furthermore, how does a hypothetical drawing prove anything?   There always seems to be a bit of a leap in logic when trying to extrapolate conclusions from sacred geometry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it sounds pretty psuedosciencey whenever i run across it, but i&#39;m pretty sure all information in this context really means is mass.  if you measure the earth (using a lattice structure) and measure the &#39;information&#39; inside of it (number of things with mass) they will have an effect which is proportional to an outside object to its mass (which is also geometrically/logarithmically effected by distance)</p>

<p>The geometry isnt really changing anything fundamental about how we understand the universe, its just geometry.  And using it to do the entire calculation and then noticing that distance effects it the same doesnt mean geometry is the basic fundamental reason it is a force in the first place.  I much prefer the theory of gravity effecting matter by bending space (or a 5th unseen dimension, since we cannot measure such bending with our senses.)</p>

<p>Still missing the theory. Not just warping, curling into itself. Re-read that and get back to me. Coriolis and torque are inherent parts of the universe because the universe is toroidal at all scales due to singularities at all levels (atom-&gt;molecule-&gt;planet-&gt;galaxy) resulting from this simple 64 tetrahedron geometric figure at the core of the singularity, in the vacuum. </p>

<p>He re-describes the strong and nuclear force <em>as</em> gravitational interaction, and it works out. </p>

<p><strong>Holographic Gravity</strong></p>

<p>The Planck circles naturally distributes across the surface area of the proton horizon in such a way that they are space-filling, like the PSU’s inside the proton, creating an holographic interference pattern often called “the Flower of Life”. Now that we’re equipped with the basic structure of the proton and its relation to the quantum vacuum we may proceed to calculate essential facts about our universe.</p>

<p>We begin using our renormalized value for the vacuum density (5,1×10<sup>93</sup> gm/cm3) to derive the mass/energy available within the volume of a proton sphere; the resulting answer is 4,9×10<sup>55</sup> grams. Using the renormalized vacuum density of 10<sup>93</sup> gm per cubic centimeter, 10<sup>55</sup> gm is how much vacuum energy is permitted within the tiny proton volume.</p>

<p>We proceed by dividing the total surface area of the proton horizon by the holographic Planck circles, to learn that the proton horizon is covered by 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> intersecting equatorial circles forming the interference pattern mentioned above.</p>

<p>Now we divide 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> with 10<sup>55</sup> - that is, the number of Planck circles on the proton surface with the number of PSU’s within the proton volume – receiving the result of 5,91×10<sup>14</sup> – the exact gravitational mass needed for the proton to obey the Schwarzschild condition generating a black hole!</p>

<p>Now we have derived the holographic gravitational mass of the proton (its Schwarzschild mass) from Planck units and geometry alone, without involving the Schwarzschild equation or the gravitational equations of Einstein’s general relativity at any point. Thus Gravity has been described as a ratio of mass/information to surface area and has been accounted for completely in algebraic terms without involving space-time curvature, only through pixelation of the structure of the vacuum itself. For the first time we have mathematical proof and a functioning description of Quantum Gravity!</p>

<p><strong>Finding the Standard Proton</strong></p>

<p>We have seen how the proton achieves its holographic gravitational mass due to vacuum fluctuations within the proton volume, now we need to find its measured value when viewed from outside its horizon. This brings us to a deeper understanding of the proton wherein its quantum entanglement to all other protons is revealed.</p>

<p>The internal volume of the proton relates to its surface geometry in such a way that one PSU holographically expresses all energy/information entangled with it. If we divide the circular surface tessellations (4,72×10<sup>40)</sup> with the volume of the proton itself (10<sup>-39</sup> ) the result comes out 1,67×10<sup>79</sup> – which is the currently estimated number of particles in the universe. The result reveals a quantum entanglement through mini-wormholes with all other protons in our universe; every single Planck circle at the proton surface can be understood as a mini-wormhole internally connecting it with another proton.</p>

<p>To find the actual expressed mass of a single proton in this worm-hole matrix we must map the mass influence of one proton on a single Planck circle. We do this by dividing the Schwarzschild mass of the proton by the number of protons in the universe, which gives us 10<sup>-65</sup> (this number equals the proton mass distributed into all other protons). Then we multiply this number with the number of Planck circles on the proton surface, namely 4,72×10<sup>40,</sup> to reveal the mass influence by one single proton – one tiny wormhole connection. The result is 1,672295215 x 10<sup>-24,</sup> which is the proven Standard mass of the proton! </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see a reason for this, I don&#39;t think we can continue our conversation. You are simply looking at the map and pretending that that&#39;s all thats needed to understanding reality, when you&#39;re disregarding an attempt at explaining the territory our current map explains. </p>

<p>Do you see how this can not make sense as written?  Gravity is a directional force.

<p>How can I disagree with this? :P. Of course, but there are certain shapes that are more fundamental, it seems.</p>

<p>Well, his singularity&#39;s are composed of a 64-tetrahedron array of double torus forces. </p>

<p>Based on buckminster fuller&#39;s <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cosmometry/resources/images/000/000/082/medium/ve.jpg">vector equilibrium</a> ( a shape where every side and every length is the same). 64 of these gives you the structure of the vacuum, and it can be fractal scaled up and down. </p>

<p>Here is a very quick youtube video that describes this structure of the vacuum. (Also a merkaba, a jewish star, and possibly the square and compass of masonic tradition)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA#t=474">The isotropic vector matrix</a></p>

<p>We find an exact quantized expression of the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein’s field equations utilizing spherical Planck units in a generalized holographic approach. We consider vacuum fluctuations within volumes as well as on horizon surfaces, generating a discrete spacetime quantization and a novel quantized approach to gravitation. When applied at the quantum scale, utilizing the charge radius of the proton, we find values for the rest mass of the proton within 0.069×10-24gm of the CODATA value and when the 2010 muonic proton charge radius measurement is utilized we find a deviation of 0.001×10-24gm from the proton rest mass. We identify a fundamental mass ratio between the vacuum oscillations on the surface horizon and the oscillations within the volume of a proton and find a solution for the gravitational coupling constant to the strong interaction. We derive the energy, angular frequency, and period for such a system and determine its gravitational potential considering mass dilation. We find the force range to be closely correlated with the Yukawa potential typically utilized to illustrate the exponential drop-off of the confining force. Zero free parameters or hidden variables are utilized.

    <div class="md"><p>funny, because there <em>are</em> no equations. everything you have quoted? those aren&#39;t equations. all he has done is basically reiterate concepts from entry level physics textbooks and pretend that it somehow means the universe is a fractal hologram. why do scientists joke about this guy? because he has literally NOTHING to support his conjectures. i can&#39;t even call them theories, because they&#39;re not that. they&#39;re vague anecdotes about how some geometric shapes are common in the universe and in physical topology, and then he somehow jumps to the conclusion that this means god exists and the shapes are holy. what about a fucking circle, man? circles are literally everywhere. how exactly does that prove there is a god? the mathematical equations that basically <em>run the world</em> happen to favor the circle, because of obvious, explainable mathematic reasons. the same is true for the spiral. there are <em>logical</em> reasons for the geometry we see, and they are so much deeper and more beautiful than the sacred conjecture.</p>

<p>on a side note, i find it interesting that honeybees make hexagonal honeycomb structures. it&#39;s cool because all of life is essentially based on the hexagonal structure of the benzene molecule, which ALSO happens to have a circle of three delocalized electrons spinning around it! beautiful stuff, and you know what? it&#39;s explainable by physical equations, not by religion!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read it, you&#39;d see you are again missing something huge.</p>

<p>He re-describes the strong and nuclear force <em>as</em> gravitational interaction, and it works out. </p>

<p><strong>Holographic Gravity</strong></p>

<p>The Planck circles naturally distributes across the surface area of the proton horizon in such a way that they are space-filling, like the PSU’s inside the proton, creating an holographic interference pattern often called “the Flower of Life”. Now that we’re equipped with the basic structure of the proton and its relation to the quantum vacuum we may proceed to calculate essential facts about our universe.</p>

<p>We begin using our renormalized value for the vacuum density (5,1×10<sup>93</sup> gm/cm3) to derive the mass/energy available within the volume of a proton sphere; the resulting answer is 4,9×10<sup>55</sup> grams. Using the renormalized vacuum density of 10<sup>93</sup> gm per cubic centimeter, 10<sup>55</sup> gm is how much vacuum energy is permitted within the tiny proton volume.</p>

<p>We proceed by dividing the total surface area of the proton horizon by the holographic Planck circles, to learn that the proton horizon is covered by 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> intersecting equatorial circles forming the interference pattern mentioned above.</p>

<p>Now we divide 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> with 10<sup>55</sup> - that is, the number of Planck circles on the proton surface with the number of PSU’s within the proton volume – receiving the result of 5,91×10<sup>14</sup> – the exact gravitational mass needed for the proton to obey the Schwarzschild condition generating a black hole!</p>

<p>Now we have derived the holographic gravitational mass of the proton (its Schwarzschild mass) from Planck units and geometry alone, without involving the Schwarzschild equation or the gravitational equations of Einstein’s general relativity at any point. Thus Gravity has been described as a ratio of mass/information to surface area and has been accounted for completely in algebraic terms without involving space-time curvature, only through pixelation of the structure of the vacuum itself. For the first time we have mathematical proof and a functioning description of Quantum Gravity!</p>

<p><strong>Finding the Standard Proton</strong></p>

<p>We have seen how the proton achieves its holographic gravitational mass due to vacuum fluctuations within the proton volume, now we need to find its measured value when viewed from outside its horizon. This brings us to a deeper understanding of the proton wherein its quantum entanglement to all other protons is revealed.</p>

<p>The internal volume of the proton relates to its surface geometry in such a way that one PSU holographically expresses all energy/information entangled with it. If we divide the circular surface tessellations (4,72×10<sup>40)</sup> with the volume of the proton itself (10<sup>-39</sup> ) the result comes out 1,67×10<sup>79</sup> – which is the currently estimated number of particles in the universe. The result reveals a quantum entanglement through mini-wormholes with all other protons in our universe; every single Planck circle at the proton surface can be understood as a mini-wormhole internally connecting it with another proton.</p>

<p>To find the actual expressed mass of a single proton in this worm-hole matrix we must map the mass influence of one proton on a single Planck circle. We do this by dividing the Schwarzschild mass of the proton by the number of protons in the universe, which gives us 10<sup>-65</sup> (this number equals the proton mass distributed into all other protons). Then we multiply this number with the number of Planck circles on the proton surface, namely 4,72×10<sup>40,</sup> to reveal the mass influence by one single proton – one tiny wormhole connection. The result is 1,672295215 x 10<sup>-24,</sup> which is the proven Standard mass of the proton! </p>

<p>I will though watch the documentary when I get home. I personally don&#39;t like holography based theories, as they are the sort of thing that you get from playing with equations rather than with physical thinking. People tend to forget that mathematics is the study of the possible, while physics should be primarily concerned with what is.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the entire point. The flower of life is literally the holographic 2d projection of the spherical PSUs that would be on the inside of a proton, on it&#39;s surface. The 64 tetrahedron is the geometry that the toroidal flow would be on.</p>

<p>you wake up in an elevator, in space.  no windows.   you are floating in the middle.    Now you go to sleep and when you wake up, an external force is being applied to your elevator so it pushes it up at a constant acceleration.
