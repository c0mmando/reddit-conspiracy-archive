       <strong>
        Frank Greening versus Isaac Newton
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Legge (Ph.D. Chem.), May 2009, Version 21
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of having invaded two countries that were no threat to it, America is intensely hated by millions of people. The torture of captives, the majority of whom are innocent of any wrong-doing, has greatly elevated the hatred and must have turned many ordinary citizens in these countries into “terrorists”. The only way the ordinary American people can defuse this hatred, and regain the respect they should have, is to show that they only agreed to invade Afghanistan and Iraq because they were lied to by the administration. By all means they should seek to investigate the current question of torture, and who authorized it, but they must not stop there. Most people now realize that they were lied to in order to obtain their approval for the invasion of Iraq, but few know they were also lied to in order to promote the invasion of Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people believe that the NIST report, and various papers supporting the official theory about 9/11, are substantially correct. It is, however, not safe to hold that belief. Recently one of the principal authors of papers supporting the official theory of collapse of the three skyscrapers at the WTC has been shown to be most unreliable, as will be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Greening has attempted to discredit the work of David Chandler, who recently provided an insightful proof that explosives must have been used to bring down the North Tower. Chandler shows that the rate of collapse indicates that the falling top block was exerting only about one third of its static weight on the lower, undamaged portion of the tower and thus could not have destroyed it. His explanation, based on Newton's third law of motion, is set out in this short video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG2y50Wyys4">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG2y50Wyys4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, Chandler shows that during the collapse the columns of the lower portion of the tower were providing a level of resistance which was only a small fraction of their design strength, a strength which they undoubtedly still possessed as they had not been heated. In attempting to refute this work Greening states that Newton's third law, which is universal, does not apply in falling buildings. What was that again? ". . . does not apply . . . ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton’s third law can be expressed as follows: “If object A applies a force to object B, object B will apply a force to object A, equal in size and opposite in direction.” In a fragmenting collapse there will be many components and many impacts, each one of which must obey Newton’s third law, thus the summation of the whole process must also obey this law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some recent email dialogue, slightly shortened:
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening: "I would say that Chandler's slight [sic] of hand is the implied notion that Newton's 3rd Law is universally applicable, even to a collapsing building."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I would say that the columns and/or the column connections in the damaged/fire- affected zone have lost enough of their strength so that the upper block can no longer be fully supported by the weakened columns. Thus the upper block of floors moves downward relative to the base of the tower. Is this such an outlandish proposition?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Chandler: "Yes, if you think it can avoid Newton's laws in the process."
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening: "Well, here's my reply: David, you cannot deny that an upper block of floors moved downward relative to the base of the tower."
      </p>
      <p>
       Chandler: "I never denied that. Anyone with eyes can see that is true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening: "And yet you consider this to be an outlandish proposition!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Chandler: "Only if it does so in such a way as to violate the laws of physics (aka Newton's Laws of Motion). Moving downward [at constant acceleration] through pre- pulverized rubble is no problem. Moving downward without deceleration while crushing columns designed to support several times the weight...now that's a problem [as it would violate Newton's third law]."
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening: "It looks to me like you are the one having trouble explaining what was actually observed that day! I think you need to get out of your classroom more often and take a look at real world problems. . . . these phenomena are what need to be discussed and evaluated, not your classroom physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chandler: "[Classroom physics] aka correct physics."
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening: "Newton's 3rd Law applies to bouncing billiard balls, not the interiors of collapsing buildings ........"
      </p>
      <p>
       Chandler: "Someone should sue your professors for malpractice."
      </p>
      <p>
       Greening then goes on to provide a lengthy and complex explanation, which I will spare the reader, attempting to show why Newton's third law does not apply in a falling building, but no matter how long and clever, it must be spurious as the third law is truly universal. We see here that Greening is not seeking enlightenment in this dialogue but is trying to muddy the waters. He persistently promotes arguments which are not logical but have the appearance of being logical, in which he presents so much complexity that it is hard for the public to discern the errors. The morality of such activity is open to question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either Greening is attempting to deceive for his own purposes or he is unable to understand the principles involved in Newton's third law. Either way his publications must be regarded as untrustworthy. It also follows that the work of Bazant must be regarded in a similar light, as they were co-authors in a particularly controversial paper.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where these people find the time to produce such complex arguments is a mystery, but they continue to do so. You don't have to read far into this paper to find it is unsatisfactory. In the Abstract we see an assertion that the controlled demolition theory rests on free fall and we read that the early rate of fall is “totally out of range of the free fall hypothesis”. However the controlled demolition theory does not require free fall. It is perfectly clear, and very well illustrated by Chandler's work, that the resisting force was about one third of the static weight of the falling top portion and hence about 10% of the design strength of the columns. This resistance is quite impossibly low for columns which are not being progressively severed by some additional mechanism, like explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should not be thought that Chandler is alone in finding fault with the official theory of collapse. The idea that explosives must have been involved to produce the observed effects has a long history and is based on numerous lines of evidence, discussed by many scientists. For a short study setting out some of the milestones of this effort see the following link:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the towers were not brought down by explosives how is one to account for the presence of substantial amounts of explosive residues, and fragments of unreacted explosive, in the WTC dust, as described in the following recent papers?

      <p>
       One remembers that Bazant was the leading author of the first paper to come out after 9/11. This paper provided a collapse theory based on the assumption that the top portion of the building fell as a solid block, a notion which was later adopted by NIST. The paper was immediately suspect as it came out just two days after 9/11, an unheard of feat for a scientific paper. There is good reason to be suspicious of the Bazant paper because it is obvious from the videos that the top portion of the building was the first part to disintegrate and thus did not fall as a solid block and therefore cannot have had the impact energy that Bazant calculated, and NIST relied upon, to explain the destruction of the lower portion of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that with critical aspects of American policy being based on presentations by Bazant and Greening there is much that demands a new investigation. The authorization of torture is certainly a matter of grave concern but it is just one component within an even greater concern, that the US administration of that time was involved in gross deception of the public. It is to be hoped that the present administration, which has shown some commendable attention to the torture issue, will eventually find the courage to re-open the investigation into the events of 9/11.

       So much spooky physics inside buildings. The interior of the lower floors must have been in a quantum super-state, with the support structure both existing and not existing at the same time.

       Agreed.

       Something cannot fall into something and be floating at the same time. The top of WTC7 essentially floated through the rest of the building, which was completely intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most terrifying part of ALL OF THIS is that it's not only blatantly obvious when waching the collapse of WTC7- it would
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       be insanity to say anything else. Literally nuts, crazy, insane, cuckoo to describe this as a building falling via fire damage.

       Just to clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       What deniers have been forced to conjure with regard to WTC 7 is that the penthouse, which can be observed collapsing above the roofline moments before the global collapse, somehow dropped like an anvil through the entire structure, stripping it of support beams and columns in one simultaneous achilles heal death blow.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in fact the penthouse collapse is actually a smoking gun in itself because there exists no mechanism for the onset of collapse starting at the roofline.
      </p>
      <p>
       No to mention the absurd mental gymnastics one must do to arrive at the conclusion that a small structure atop the building contained the potential energy to absolutely demolish all of the supports below, even those not affected by those TREMENDOUS OFFICE FIRES!

       This is where the newtons law comes in. It was falling onto nothing, because there was structure holding it up, providing the opposite force of the penthouse's gravity (force). It's not like it was lifted 50 feet, and even if it was  - IT STILL WOULDN'T FREE FALL.

       I might be inclined to hear an argument about the awesome power of office fires (structural damage was not listed among the causes of collapse btw.) if there existed a single, solitary precedent where a fire had caused a systemic failure of a steel framed structure. Alas, no such case exists and in fact many do exist that prove precisely the contrary.

       This is actually incorrect.  The structural damage was found to have only slightly affected the collapse sequence, but not the collapse initiation itself.  NIST ran models without any structural damage and WTC 7 still collapsed in those models (see the conclusions from the third LS-DYNA model stated on page 38).  The only real way the damage ended up contributing to the collapse was by (1) severing the water supply to WTC 7's lower-floor sprinkler system, and (2) initiating the fires on floors 7-14 that, without that sprinkler system, caused a series of lateral connections to fail, allowing column 79 to buckle.

       when you can explain harrits methodology and understand the finer points of his analyses, then you can claim his paper is worth something.
       <br/>
       (but you wont ever reach that understanding. which is kinda disappointing cos if you ever did, you would know enough to realise harrits paper is bs).

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       the
       <strong>
        falling
       </strong>
       top portion...so we're interested in the dynamic weight. (actually the dynamic load).
      </p>
      <p>
       but did the upper section of wtc1/2 have enough energy to overwhelm the floor below? (and after that, the enxt floor, and the next...)...well lets see:
      </p>
      <p>
       If a story is 4 meters high, it will take an object about 0.9 seconds to fall one story, by which time it will be going 9 m/sec.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once the collapse starts, the overlying structure will be falling at 9 m/sec by the time it has fallen one story.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we crush the collapsing story into rubble half a meter thick and expect the collapse to stop at that point, what kinds of forces are involved?
       <br/>
       We go from 9 m/sec to zero in half a meter, or 1/18 of a second. However, during that deceleration the velocity is decreasing, and the average velocity turns out to be half of the initial velocity, so the crunch time is 1/9 second. So the acceleration is -9 m/sec divided by 1/9 sec = -81 m/sec2, or about 8 g's.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the difference between a static load and a dynamic load. In the north tower, with about ten stories above the impact,
       <strong>
        the dynamic load was about equivalent not to ten stories but to eighty, nearly the total height of the building.
       </strong>

       The NIST report is better than peer-reviewed as its methodology and conclusions have been developed, reviewed, and certified by dozens of prominent engineers and experts on the subject matter therein.  Take 20 min and run the NIST authors and contributors through google.  They are an extremely accomplished group from all backgrounds (government, academia, private sector).  Them all reviewing and signing off on the report required far more scrutiny than any peer reviewed article gets.  It's not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more is that there is not a single peer reviewed article that challenges the conclusions of the NIST reports and offers an alternative hypothesis for any part of the collapse initiation or sequences.  Not one.  That silence says more than any conspiracy theorist ever could.

       That's not a rebuttal, that's an unjustified assertion bordering on name calling.  It could also be classified as begging the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple and effective rebuttal where you could conclude by "A gravity propelled collapse is junk science" would have been something like "the gravitational potential energy U of the towers is insufficient to produce the observed results since phenomena X was observed which requires at least E joules and U &lt; E".

       I've said it before and I'll say it again, Chandlers reasoning is very overly simplistic and doesn't account for what's actually happening. He assumes that the building is offering constant resistance as the top crushes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time the top impacts another floor there is a brief impulse which corresponds with a brief deceleration. This impact exerts a high load that causes the columns to fail. When the columns begin bucking they provide little resistance and the collapse continues to accelerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The impulses are brief enough that they have little impact on the downward velocity and you wouldn't be able to detect them using the methods available to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explanation fits everything observed.

       So basically: here's how it happened.  I'd like to prove it to you, but unfortunately I can't.  But just take my word for it.  That about the gist of your argument?

       How can you possibly make the claim that there were "brief impulses" and "brief decelerations" if there isn't any "method available to us" to detect them?  Are you just guessing?

      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that, because chandler doesn't consider this in his calculations, and he instead assumes uniform resistance, the calculations can not conclude one way or the other what happened. The only thing up for debate is what the magnitude of these impulses are and how long they lasted. If someone wants to prove it was in inside job, they would have to prove that we should have been able to detect these impulses.

      <p>
       Basically, Chandlers calcs are irrelevant.

       You can't say there wasn't because first of all, we don't know how much the deceleration would be. And assuming its a very tiny amount we would need some extremely in depth analysis to determine if the acceleration slowed. Not the speed, ACCELERATION.

       I actually think similarly to you here when it comes to tower 7. It fell way to easily and seemingly without resistance. But the whole argument im making to you revolves around a flawed equation Chandler made.

      <p>
       It doesn't look like there was any deceleration during the collapse.  According to your statement, it seems like there should have been about 70 instances of deceleration which I would think would be apparent to anyone who is watching the collapse in real time.  Watching the collapse, it really looks as though there was a constant speed at which the debris was falling.

       You're viewing the two halves of the tower as both being solid bodies, when you can really only count the top 15 as being a solid body. The bottom 95 are all acted on individually.

       You, in fact are viewing Newton's 3rd law incorrectly by assuming the top 15 floors are a solid mass. Thus you negate Newton.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top 15 floors were constructed with the same concrete and steel as the bottom 95 floors. That says nothing about the physics when I state that.

       Yes, however
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the 15 floors are falling
       <em>
        down

       , only one floor at a time is resisting back
       <em>
        up

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       By saying that the bottom 95 floors would've resisted the fall you're saying they act as a solid body. It's like 10 cheerleaders standing on top of one another; if you were to suddenly drop an 11th one even from the height of where it would be if the 10th were supporting it, it would plummet through all 10 of the cheerleaders under it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: for future proof of this concept lower a mass on a spring gently and then drop a mass on the spring from the springs resting height. Compare how far the spring compresses in both scenarios.

       No you're simply not understanding it. Are you about to tell me that when a 60 mph 5 ton semi collides head on with a 60 mph 1.5 ton car the two should both stop where they are in the collision because of action/reaction pairs? Because I guarantee you the semi keeps on moving.

       I don't think that's the right fallacy. I was simply asking your interpretation of the OTHER physics example presented. If you don't want to do it that's fine, I was just asking. Not everybody is trying to get you man.

       I didn't imply that. I am just stating people are questioning your understanding of it, and you could reinforce your knowledge and prove to people by extending it to an example outside of WTC7. I never meant to imply you don't understand physics.

       I understand your statement but it doesn't make sense that the speed at which the floors fell were constant. I would imagine the rate of descent would not be as fast it was unless something was destabilizing the foundation under the falling debris. My thought is that if nothing was destabilizing the columns/foundation, the rate of speed in which the debris falls would be a slower, more sequenced series of events.

       But the speed was not constant, it was slower at the beginning and speed up as more floors collapsed.  I know it is hard to see but if you slow down some high frame rate videos you see it.

       Accurate is a very relative term.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have available are videos of the towers falling, which are good for getting a reasonablY accurate measure of how fast the building falls. But if we are looking for an impulse that lasts 0.001 seconds, and all we have a video that was shot at 30fps,  then we are pretty SOL,  aren't we?

       Please allow me to clarify myself. I'm not actually trying to say that this was or wasn't a conspiracy, I am just trying to show that chandlers paper does nothing to prove that it was a demolition. Let me explain in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the official story is correct, than there would have been a series of impulses as each floor was impacted, nobody debates this fact. What we don't know is how long these impulses would have lasted and therefore we don't know if they should have been measurable from the videos we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as I stated before, Chandler does not consider these impulses in his calculations. By not considering these impulses, he has assumed they are not occurring, which means he assumes that the building is being brought down by explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in essence, in his calculation to prove that the building was brought down by explosives, he makes an assumption that the building was brought down by explosives... Which makes it completely redundant. I don't know how he could not realize this, as it should be obvious to him, which makes me think he is intentionally being dishonest.

       He is saying that the tower crushing the floors would hypothetically cause the tower to fall slower and that each floor slows the collapse a tiny bit and that this is a variable Chandler forgot to account for.

       There is no evidence. You have to think for yourself and its not rocket science. The collapsing top portion of the tower would be slowed going through the lower portion. You are either dumb, willfully ignorant, or a child to deny this. You are giving this sub a bad name.

       I didn't specifically use the word hypothetical, but it is very obviously implied that I am talking about hypotheticals here. I'm not surprised you didn't pick up on that. This is why it makes no sense for you to stick your head in the sand and continuously ask for videos.

So go ahead, tell me exactly where I'm wrong, or get out of the debate, because you haven't contributed anything to the discussion so far.

       Your original premise is that the top 15 floors are a solid mass.

       This isn't worth rebutting because it is a false premise. Everything else is called into question when you start your 'hypothetical' that wasn't a hypothetical until you couldn't prove that your hypothetical challenges David Chandler's assessment.

       Read the paper. He assumes that the upper portion of the building is a solid mass falling through the bottom of the building.  Hence he calculates a single force being applied by the uppers mass on to the lower mass.

      </p>
      <p>
       I was hoping you would make this connection yourself, but I guess not. Chandlers paper is a rebuttal of bazant, so he uses bazants assumptions to create his own model which supposedly prove the official story is wrong. Bazant assumes the top of the building is a solid piece and so chandler makes the same assumption in his paper to prove bazant wrong. Does this make sense to you so far?

       Well we know for a fact that this would happen if the official story was correct. You are assuming it didn't happen because we didn't observe it, though it is very likely that we wouldn't have been able to observe it without more sophisticated equipment.

       Please tell me what is incorrect in what I am stating here. It seems like you are starting to get threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the official story is correct, than there would have been a series of impulses as each floor was impacted, nobody debates this fact. What we don't know is how long these impulses would have lasted and therefore we don't know if they should have been measurable from the videos we have.
Now, as I stated before, Chandler does not consider these impulses in his calculations. By not considering these impulses, he has assumed they are not occurring, which means he assumes that the building is being brought down by explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in essence, in his calculation to prove that the building was brought down by explosives, he makes an assumption that the building was brought down by explosives... Which makes it completely redundant. I don't know how he could not realize this, as it should be obvious to him, which makes me think he is intentionally being dishonest.

       You don't need an equation to know dropping one thing onto a copy of itself doesn't progressively destroy the bottom one while leaving the top falling part intact enough to crash to ground level. It just can't happen, and in fact even NIST doesn't try to assert that anymore.

       That's not what happened though. The WTC was designed specifically to withstand far more, for it to collapse the way it did would require the internal column to be destroyed completely. I know the official report says "jet fuel" poured down the shafts etc but that's pretty far fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've just always found it weird that proponents of the official story refuse to even entertain the possibility that
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       but planes brought the towers down (which in all reality is pretty obvious and always has been), or that something else causing the collapse automatically implicates the government or anyone else. It doesn't.

       That's why I'm asking for the specific set of equations that show that the official story is bunk; It's all well and good to say they're designed to "withstand far more", but until that's actually quantified, it's little more than an assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that a controlled demolition of the towers doesn't explicitly indicate the government is responsible, but I don't think the leap required to conclude that it does implicate the government is as significant as the leap required to conclude that explosives were involved without understanding (or, even seeing) the equations at play.

       As is anything the official story says, because NIST has kept their data models secret for the last 13 or so years. This is because they are completely and

       There is no "leap" required. All evidence points to something other than the planes causing the collapse, because that's physically impossible in a number of ways. I don't see why "anti conspiracy" style people are so opposed to the idea, at very least it should be an Occams razor situation.

       Considering how much of the information is now "lost" or otherwise obfuscated I doubt anyone will ever get the opportunity to calculate anything with that sort of accuracy, unfortunately. All that can be done is speculation and educated guesses based on the visuals.

       Math is almost irrelevant without context, and that context has never been made public thanks to NIST. You can quote all the equations you like but they're never going to show a physical impossibility to happen.

       No, what's "blowing a raspberry" at the physics "community" is refusing to disclose your model for peer review and instead attacking critics as "conspiracy theorists". Science
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       peer review, yet people like you and Popular Mechanics are happy to believe things like the progressive collapse theory (impossible) or that air pressure blew out the windows as the building was collapsing (impossible) or that fuel that is
       <em>
        highly explosive
       </em>
       could burn for long enough to
       <em>
        weaken steel
       </em>
       that needs a far higher temperature and duration than it has to have any effect whatsoever (impossible), or that it poured down the elevator shafts before burning (lol), or that building 7 simply collapsed in on itself because of "fire" despite that never happening before or since (impossible).

       What's "blowing a raspberry" is sticking to a ridiculous story for over a decade and treating independent study as traitorous.

       Physics aside, for the controlled demolition aspect of the to be reasonable, there had to be benefit to it and there had to be people who rigged the building and there had to be some pretty specific knowledge ahead of time and some hellaciously accurate piloting of commercial airliners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please support this aspect of the conspiracy by answering a few questions. Anything plausible will do. Oh, and I'm good with saying 9/11 was a conspiracy. I'm questioning only the controlled demolition aspect of the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) How was the benefit to any conspirator made greater by the collapse of the buildings? Cheney gets his war regardless whether or not the buildings fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) How did the conspirators rig the explosives to detonate top-down rather than all-at-once as we normally see in controlled demolitions?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) How did the conspirators know at which floor to start the top-down detonations, which started at different floors in each building?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) How did the pilots manage to hit exactly the correct rigged floor for the top-down detonation in each building, which, again, started at different floors in each building?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plz feel free to downvote without comment if you find those questions too challenging. Thanks.

      </p>
      <p>
       1) Benefits to conspirators for total destruction of buildings: Shock and Awe. Read Shock Doctrine by Naomi Kline. Also, being able to eliminate building 7 during the confusion of the day is an added bonus to destroy evidence. Insurance policies as well. Research asbestos in the towers. Who knows what else was achieved during the chaos? Perfect heist time.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 &amp; 3) How it was rigged, why the specific floors: Research the 'power down' and extra 'maintenance' workers seen around the building leading up to the event. Also research which companies were leasing the respective impact zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Pilot accuracy: Non human guidance help. Radio/other remote style devices in the buildings to help guide the planes in. I don't believe the amateurs could have hit the buildings without help or experience with piloting such huge aircraft
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific knowledge ahead of time is a given, numerous reports that the attack was imminent are easy to research and find. This was obviously extremely well thought and planned out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that military exercises were happening on the same day is a nice coincidence as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel its a "if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck .... " kinda scenario, watching footage of the towers 'collapsing' shows they're being blown apart. With enough imagination and research there are numerous ways this could have been achieved, but I just can't buy the 'official' Planes and Fire did it Alone theory.

       Why would insurance companies pay out hundreds of millions in policies if it was obvious that the building owners conspired to demolish their own buildings using explosives?  There was tons of litigation over the 9-11 insurance policies, all of which was conducted by the best law firms in the world.  Do you really think they just overlooked something that, if true, would save their client hundreds of millions?  Not a single insurance company challenged paying out its policies on the grounds of controlled demolition.

       I don't think anyone can "prove" it was controlled demolition, let alone it being obvious for most people. No insurance company would have access to the information needed to prove their case in court, especially considering the political climate at the time. Going against the "status quo" and official narrative of events was political suicide, and would probably jeopardize dissenter's careers forever. A judge wouldn't be sitting very long who started pointing fingers in the wrong direction.

       Lawyers raise arguments in the alternative.  The lawyers arguing for the insurance company could have raised the demolition fraud claims without affecting their credibility, careers, or even other arguments.  In fact, if the lawyers for the insurance companies thought there was only a 1% chance they could prove the building was demolished by the owners, it would likely have been malpractice not to raise that point as an alternative theory given the amounts at stake.  It would look far worse for their careers for them to have studied the collapses and not raised those claims than to have raised them, even if they were merely plausible but non-obvious claims.  (The obvious language I used was more of a reference to the claims of the OP and many others in this thread than yours, but that was sufficient threshold, not a necessary one, for making this type of claim.)  These were not fleeting litigations--they were multi-year, multi-million dollar suits where insurance company counsel had access to the best expert witnesses in the world and the means to put them on the stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insurance companies' failure to make those arguments tells you then that those who had the biggest financial incentive to study and understand the collapses did not think it was even a fleeting possibility that controlled demolition was used to bring the towers down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So were the insurance companies involved in the conspiracy too?  How about the re-insurance companies?  How about the foreign and state regulators of the insurance companies?  There is not a single piece of evidence that even one of the tens of thousands of people involved in those companies and agencies was part of a conspiracy to cover up involvement by the US government in the 9-11 attacks.

       Sorry, let's agree to disagree. I still stand by the idea that there would be a zero percent chance of anyone anywhere ever coming close to proving a demolition claim in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as not affecting their credibility or career, that is also something that I believe to be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look how quickly you start the accusatory "so who ELSE is involved in your conspiracy theory" style of questioning and you can imagine how quickly you'd be laughed out of court or your law firm for even implying 9/11 involved anything other than 19 terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Financial incentive is a great theme to investigate and research. Look into the insider trading around that time as well as all of the companies who stood to profit from the war and the 'nation rebuilding' contracts in general. These are all pieces to the same complex puzzle, isolating a single topic like insurance won't give us the whole picture, nor does it stand as a piece of irrefutable evidence that proves the 'official story' to be 100% infallible.

       I can't prove anything, so if your mind is already made up then nothing I can say will change it.

       I agree that there is a zero percent chance of anyone proving controlled demolitions happened in court.  That's because they didn't happen and are thus un-provable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 10 years after the buildings came down there is not a single peer-reviewed engineering paper that provides an alternative collapse hypothesis to the ones offered by NIST.  Not one.  Why not?  Could it be because all of the structural engineers in the world are cowed and afraid to state the "truth"?  No, obviously not because Richard Gage reminds us that there are at least dozens of structural engineers who believe NIST was mistaken.  So why doesn't Gage, whose organization pulls in half a million a year, produce a single peer reviewed alternative hypothesis after all this time?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because the people selling these theories are either (1) incompetent to articulate them to the standards of their field or (2) are competent to articulate the theories, but know they are bunk and so do not even make a good faith effort to have them pass the scrutiny of actual experts.  Maybe Gage is afraid of killing his golden goose by actually subjecting his claims to expert critique? (99% of structural engineers ignore him now so he can say whatever he wants without much scrutiny, but it'd much harder for him to explain away the lack of support for his theories were they actually presented to an impartial group of structural engineers and then rejected.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawyers for the insurance company undoubtedly understood this very well.  They could have easily used subponeas to get Gage et al. all of the evidence they ever wanted re the collapses.  They could have provided hundreds of thousands in support for research and development of a controlled demolition collapse model.  And doing so, if the buildings were brought down by demolition, would have saved their clients hundreds of millions each (billions in aggregate).  So they must have determined that the buildings were not brought down by controlled demolition or else they were receiving in excess of the claim losses from another source.  Given that insurance companies are regulated by the states, that reimbursement would have to pass non-federal scrutiny, meaning the conspiracy would have to extend into state regulatory agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can dismiss this all as focusing on only a small part of the events that day.  But that's a ridiculous way to look at the events on 9-11, honestly.  It's akin to suggesting we ought to pick hypotheses and then just cherry pick the parts that are consistent with those hypotheses, rather than finding hypotheses that are actually consistent with all of the facts.  Since conspiracy theorists cannot explain the insurance claims in a way consistent with controlled demolition, they choose to ignore them.  What does that say about the strength of the underlying conspiracy theories proffered?  It's not just a minor hole in their theories, it is a gaping, mulit-billion dollar hole.

       I'm sorry that rational thought challenges your worldview so. It's obvious from your posts that you are very passionate about the controlled demolition aspect of this conspiracy theory. Unfortunately for you, the evidence and a rational train of thought simply doesn't support it, all the way from the falling of the buildings looking absolutely nothing like any controlled demolition we've ever seen right through there being no reason for there to even be a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, things that look like conspiracies aren't really conspiracies. Sometimes they are, but they're different from what we think they are. But holding onto our pet theories in spite of reason and evidence, and contrary to reason and evidence as you're doing, or supporting it just because a fringe of society says things that might support it, isn't healthy for ourselves, our movement, or the world.

      </p>
      <p>
       But, really, it would be very interesting if you could at least make an attempt at answering the 4 questions in my original response. At least put some thought into your theory. Flesh it out. Don't just parrot bad physics to the forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support your theory with rational, plausible thought about why and how TPTB could have pulled a controlled demolition off and you might gain converts.

       I'm not a physicist. I'm not qualified to refute the statements you copied to make your OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not surprisingly, the vast majority of the responses your thread have received also are not from physicists. Those who share your worldview circle-jerk with you. Those who don't share your worldview disagree. But as far as I can tell, only one commentor has any sort of background to have a rational discussion of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's turn the question back to you... why are you unable to answer the four questions I pose, which should be simple enough to answer plausibly for a reasonable conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can answer a lot of questions just like that for why 9/11 was a conspiracy. Why can't you answer those about why the buildings had to come down, and how they pulled it off?

       Here's my try
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I don't believe he would have gotten the war If the towers didn't fall, the 9/11 argument for starting the war wouldn't  be as strong as they needed it to be. If there hadn't been a lot of casualties it wouldn't have caused the amount of fear that they needed for their terrorist propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I believe that it can be done just by rewireing but i have no scientific background to support these claims. The detonations are usually set off by an electroshock so i guess it would be possible to wire it from top down in the same way they could wire it from bottom to top. Also the top part is already falling down so the explosions just have to weaken the structuce enough for the top part to tear down the building.
But anyway, it seems like something that is definitely plausible to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I believe that we, in modern society, are capable of setting up detonations where we don't have to detonate it all, or nothing. they would have been able to choice which floor they wanted the explosion chain to start from and pick the right floor after the plane crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) They didn't have to because of 3.

       No one can claim they know the physics of buildings and planes that are destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is obvious that the planes took the buildings down, if the act was perpetrated by the government to achieve whatever goals then they wouldn't have bothered with the bombs, as they plan clearly wouldn't have simply been to demolish the buildings. If they wanted to plant bombs they could just fake a bombing, why would they be so illogical.

       Except the people that designed it to specifically withstand a plane impact and that know that the thing could stand with half the struts
       <em>

       , and the fact that fire hasn't ever before or since taken any sizeable building down. Lets all throw up our hands and claim ignorance though, I'm sure that's much more useful.

      <p>
       Why is it out of the question that whoever took the towers down used something else but planes? Saying there had to have been explosives or something else doesn't implicate anyone (especially the government), it just means there were explosives.

       The building is filled with people and massive amounts of appliances and objects, no one can tally up the specific physics. Anything could of exploded inside. The way the tower collapsed does not indicate bombs were necessary, have you ever seen a tower collapse or get blown up with bombs?

       You are reciting statements drawn from media sources whose 'experts' have designed. Before you make an absolute statement why don't you go and confirm some evidence, test out the probability of whatever variables, hell why don't you consult multiple professional opinions instead of referring to the same propagated 'alternative' media, which is just the same horse shit you get fed for government media. They all have agenda's.
      </p>
      <p>
       People designed it, people aren't perfect and don't know everything, especially what a plane from 40 years in the future would do to the tower if it crashed into it. Fire didn't take the building down, a combination of variables did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not out of the question, it is just illogical for the U.S. government to have planted bombs because their operations are far more cautious, that would arouse too much suspicion. Also, considering there is no real evidence (REAL NOT OPINIONATED), there is no reason to even attest to the concept.

       C'mon now dude. How much of the official story have you independently verified? There are more sources that oppose the report than those that agree with it. It just happens that everyone that agrees with it is on your government's payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "agenda" is to show that your government lied about what happened. For what, nobody really knows, and that's not really the issue. It's more a case of
       <em>
        they lied to you about why so many of you got killed
       </em>
       and absolved themselves of any responsibility despite their obvious incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a bit rich to tell me everyone opposed to the official story has an agenda, when the official story is implausible and in fact impossible and the people in charge of it keep changing their tune and keeping all their data secret.

       Yes, a plane hitting the top of a tower and burning office chairs on that floor makes it collapse from the bottom and removes 90% of all resistance it should encounter on the way down. Also jet fuel that
       <em>
        is explosive in nature
       </em>
       burnt for a long enough time and at a hot enough temperature to literally weaken steel enough to bend and collapse in on itself. Also jet fuel running down the elevator shafts heated the struts enough to pull them in and buckle the sides of the building that are a whole lot stronger than the struts, breaking the laws of physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Variables.

       I think you're a wrong because you are asserting a specific opinionated theory over any equally plausible theory. It is illogical to assume one theory makes more sense because you happen to have observed the evidence, when there is an equal amount of observable evidence for a multitude of other theories that negate yours. I'm not a physicist nor an architect, hence why I'm not asserting a specific theory on how the building collapsed, I'm only stating that your theory is less plausible than others and that you're wrong for believing in a theory, instead of applying an agnostic approach to the situation. Also, you are completely missing the points in regards to 'furniture' and 'sway', nor do you have any idea how important those factors imply. The point is there are a multitude of small unnoticed factors that could have influence the way the building collapsed, with the same logic on how any event occurs - on the basis of many, many, many little circumstances.

      <p>
       I'm not commenting further because I'm not arguing against your theory, just against believing or attesting to said theory.

       I haven't actually asserted a definitive conclusion, I'm simply saying that there are many impossible factors that
       <em>
        couldn't have happened
       </em>
       and that makes the official story wrong. The question then becomes "why would the government make up such a shitty lie?"

       I'm listening, for whenever anyone feels like divulging that evidence. NIST certainly never did.

      <p>
       What? I don't have a "theory" because it's impossible to know exactly what happened. It's fairly easy to rule out certain impossibilities though. If you have a "theory" that is "more plausible" than anything then feel free to let everyone know about it. I just hope you're not referencing progressive collapse or any of the other stuff the official report backed down on when everyone realised it wasn't physically possible.

       Yes, I actually do know how those things affect buildings, and the answer is
       <em>
        not at all
       </em>
       . If building sway could be affected by furniture placement or feng shui or whatever then
       <em>
        there wouldn't be many left standing today
       </em>
       . The ratings on the strength for these places is multiple times what it has to be, there's extra redundancy on everything on purpose just for these reasons. These building sway at a slight breeze, and architects understand things like resonant frequency.

       I don't have a "theory", save for "the official story is obviously and hilariously wrong and made up, and literally cannot ever happen". Obviously something else brought the towers down. I'm not trying to speculate who or why, just that it happened. I'd kind of like to know what your government is covering their own ass for though.

       The argument is whether or not the claims of scientists pursuing the truth about 9/11 are correct. So while I do agree with you that
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       But it's not an argument, it's just some thread of mockery, so how's it an ad-hom? I thought an ad-hom was when you use an insult to prove a point. Like if I said something like "you're an idiot, and that's why 9/11 wasn't an inside job bceause you're too stupid to understand how it clearly wasn't". That would be an ad-hom because instead of an argument i'm using an insult.

       Well Newton WAS wrong. Like...everything he said was wrong but it was "close enough" we didn't notice till Einstein came about and gave us relativity. Newton was so close we were able to get to the moon using his physics and for most parts of life it is close enough to work. But in the grand scheme of things his physics ARE WRONG. They are just good enough and are used because its a lot simple to figure out than general relativity

       Under most conditions Newton's three laws and his theory of gravitation are adequate.

       Please allow me to clarify myself. I'm not actually trying to say that this was or wasn't a conspiracy, I am just trying to show that chandlers paper does nothing to prove that it was a demolition. Let me explain in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the official story is correct, than there would have been a series of impulses as each floor was impacted, nobody debates this fact. What we don't know is how long these impulses would have lasted and therefore we don't know if they should have been measurable from the videos we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as I stated before, Chandler does not consider these impulses in his calculations. By not considering these impulses, he has assumed they are not occurring, which means he assumes that the building is being brought down by explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in essence, in his calculation to prove that the building was brought down by explosives, he makes an assumption that the building was brought down by explosives... Which makes it completely redundant. I don't know how he could not realize this, as it should be obvious to him, which makes me think he is intentionally being dishonest.

       I might be inclined to hear an argument about the awesome power of office fires (structural damage was not listed among the causes of collapse btw.) if there existed a single, solitary precedent where a fire had caused a systemic failure of a steel framed structure. Alas, no such case exists and in fact many do exist that prove precisely the contrary.

       I would love for you to prove that you have any understanding of the science by pointing out exactly where I'm wrong. I want specifics, not generic calls for more evidence and calculations  (which only further proves you don't know what you're talking about). So go ahead, tell me exactly where I'm wrong, or get out of the debate, because you haven't contributed anything to the discussion so far.

       That's not what happened though. The WTC was designed specifically to withstand far more, for it to collapse the way it did would require the internal column to be destroyed completely. I know the official report says "jet fuel" poured down the shafts etc but that's pretty far fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've just always found it weird that proponents of the official story refuse to even entertain the possibility that
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       but planes brought the towers down (which in all reality is pretty obvious and always has been), or that something else causing the collapse automatically implicates the government or anyone else. It doesn't.

       I think you're a wrong because you are asserting a specific opinionated theory over any equally plausible theory. It is illogical to assume one theory makes more sense because you happen to have observed the evidence, when there is an equal amount of observable evidence for a multitude of other theories that negate yours. I'm not a physicist nor an architect, hence why I'm not asserting a specific theory on how the building collapsed, I'm only stating that your theory is less plausible than others and that you're wrong for believing in a theory, instead of applying an agnostic approach to the situation. Also, you are completely missing the points in regards to 'furniture' and 'sway', nor do you have any idea how important those factors imply. The point is there are a multitude of small unnoticed factors that could have influence the way the building collapsed, with the same logic on how any event occurs - on the basis of many, many, many little circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not commenting further because I'm not arguing against your theory, just against believing or attesting to said theory.
