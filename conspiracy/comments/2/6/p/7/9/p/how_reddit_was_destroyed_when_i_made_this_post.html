        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com</p>

<p>This took away the only tool for communicating <em>with</em> reddit <em>about</em> reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</p>

<p>2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</p>

<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny.</p>

<p>3) Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.  </p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>

<p>4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent. </p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that <em>never</em> posted again.</p>

<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed. </p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>6) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place. </p>

<p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>

<p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story. But that diligence disappears when the story is bashing somewhere else. And those who point it out are downvoted out of sight.</p>

<p>And people will say &quot;What are you talking about, people are constantly bashing the US in every thread&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes that is absolutely true. Because those people have decided to even out the score. When you have hundreds of fake accounts moving the narrative in a certain direction, then it is essential for people to come out and loudly counter-balance the propaganda.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.</p>

<p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p>

<p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. </p>

<p>And they know it. You should too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your comment but I don&#39;t think people are willfully ignorant.I can&#39;t remember where it was done or who did it but I do remember reading about an experiment - It was 3 groups, all shown different pictures of teeth, the first group were shown normal teeth and they cleaned their teeth as they always had, the 2nd group were shown mildly fucked up teeth and cleaned more often, the 3rd group were shown fucked up teeth and cleaned less than before.</p>

<p>If people are presented with a harsh truth they will switch off to cope, if you were to inform someone who has a home loan and works long hours for a corporation in hope of promotion so they can buy more &#39;stuff&#39; for their family they hardly see due to work commitments.I&#39;d assume they would dismiss what you tell them because they can&#39;t deal with the idea that their life is based on a lie.</p>

<p>People will often dismiss truth, not out of ignorance but out of fear, it is more convenient for most people to begrudgingly accept this construct of life than to deal with truth and be afraid of being dismissed and put in the &#39;crazy corner&#39; as some on this sub have to deal with.</p>

<p>A better way forward is to offer more compassion and understanding, if you want to show someone that their life is based on a lie - Let them down gently or they will reject it, if someone gets dismissed as a &#39;sheeple&#39; or a &#39;dumb cunt&#39; I doubt they will listen to what is said, I&#39;d assume they would be more likely to insult someone back rather than listening to what they have to say.</p>

<p>If someone feels insulted their pride, ego, and fear based programming will be front and centre.If people here want to make real change it will not be due to the ego and self righteousness of the members, it will be by kindly showing the non-corrupt how they work for them and how they can get by without them, it will be a struggle because how can we compete against media/advertising?, once we understand people operate on emotion and justify with logic we have a chance to offer something better than media/advertising can.</p>

<p>Sorry to the person I&#39;m replying to, I did start with a reply and then started going on about other things, I hope you don&#39;t mind and I hope someone will read this and understand what I&#39;m on about.I just want better for humans and earth and hope to empower positive change.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its worth noting the demise of digg was entirely planned as a consolidation effort.  The same consolidation of power that happens to corporate media is happening on the internet:</p>

<ul>
<li> blog = spam (removing your voice)</li>
<li> valid sources = 5 media conglomerates</li>
<li> profit motive = disqualified source (youtube vid with ads, person sells books, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The internet is shrinking.</p>

<p>They needed people broken up i  factions and hearing and approving only their preconceived notions and never allowing broadder posts to be seen. It took them decades to fracture americans so the elites could steal while they squabbled.</p>

<p>They werent about to let them stay united against the elites.</p>

<p>You must be either conservatives or progressives. United against the corruption of the true elites is not allowed and must be shutdown.</p>

<p>Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is starting to worry me. And even on TV there are constant military movies. (Not to mention TV show after TV show deifying surveillance, the CIA, FBI, etc, and torture, like 24.) This makes me wonder if they are planning another war and are trying to prime us for it. Certainly if they remove most troops from Iraq and Afghanistan they will want some place else to send them, some other justification for the huge military spending to go into the pockets of the wealthy. Like ... Boze-Allen, who Snowden worked for. Why wasn&#39;t he working for the government directly. They only do this contracting thing so some rich bastard can get most of the money for doing none of the work and so they can easily fire the workers and give them fewer benefits. </p>

<p>But they probably want a war to distract us from our real problem, the wealthy and the corrupt system called capitalism and rule of the rich, for the rich and by the rich. So they want a war in Syria and the Ukraine. It won&#39;t be their blood split, or their treasure spent, so they WANT WAR! War is always an excuse for repression. </p>

I stopped posting and eventually unsubscribed, not because I lost interest in politics but because the sub became all about censorship. Most of the leftist (or even liberal)  websites I submitted articles from were blocked on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.

<li><p>You can start with airline fuel either melting heat-conducting steel frames covered with fireproofing, or not melting the heat-conducting steel frames and the absence of any 10, or 50-storey, high tangle of unmelted steel framework  (Pretending that the beams were not welded is a lie, not an answer.) Varying, changing, claims about this minuscule amount of airline fuel melting, or not melting  the buildings&#39; steel are a central assertion of the official conspiracy theory.  </p></li>
<li><p>How a propaganda believer would account for the ejection of materials from WTC2, or the opposite - the collapse of WTC7 at free-fall speed through the path of maximum resistance - has always interested me. The film footage of the demolitions forms part of the official story.</p></li>
<li><p>WTC7 and not the in-between, actually-damaged and later demolished WTC 6. Always silence on these also. WTC7 &quot;of course&quot; is part of the official story. </p></li>
<li><p>The complete and utter worthlessness of the US of A&#39;s military might against attacks that it was, at the time of planes hitting the buildings, running drills against.   The hopelessness of the Airforce against these &quot;novel&quot; attacks (that, at that time, the Airforce was running drills to practice defending against) is part of the official story. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The core of the official story:</p>

<ol>
<li> The absolute centre of the official story is the sure-to-appeal claim that the planes were piloted by 18 (boo) Muslims (boo), [armed with non-insurance policy violating box-cutters, etc, etc] all of whom it was later found were alive. Ignoring that they didn&#39;t have tickets for the flights (which is not part of the official story), as the official story bends to claim that their passports were stolen, how do you justify the wonderfully, racist-ly convenient official claim that the actual 18 were actually (boo) Muslims (boo) ?  You probably don&#39;t know, but only two pieces of claimed footage of any of these people boarding the flights were ever released: from which no identiication has been possible of who these people are, and the footage is from different times of the day.</li>
</ol>

<p>The list is endless, both of the sillynesses of the official story, and of the observed and recorded features that don&#39;t fit the official story, and I haven&#39;t even mentioned the 6 walls of the Pentagon being punctured by the flimsy nose-section of some plane on the morning of the Pentagon&#39;s 60th birthday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government employees are far more expensive than contractors.  They have unions, pensions, and all kinds of insanely expensive benefits.</p>

<p>Contractors get crap.  At the end of the day, it costs $120/hr to staff a contractor in a $30/hr seat; while a Fed costs $30/hr plus $200/hr worth of benefits.  When you excise a Fed&#39;s position, you can&#39;t really terminate them in most cases:  the Federal Employment Act causes a lot of trouble with that.</p>

<p>The only real way to manage the Federal workforce without spending $8 trillion per year is by hiring contractors.</p>
