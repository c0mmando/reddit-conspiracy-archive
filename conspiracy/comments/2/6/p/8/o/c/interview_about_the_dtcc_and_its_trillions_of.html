        Here's a link to the interview
       </a>
       .  It was supposed to appear on 5/17 on the History Channel's
       <em>
        America's Book of Secrets
       </em>
       in an episode entitled "Secret Underground".  The person being interviewed is/was Bix Weir, the creator of
       <a href="http://www.roadtoroota.com/public/main.cfm">
        this site
       </a>
       (which is great in my opinion), and he was apparently given no word or reason as to why the interview wasn't aired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some of the topics covered in the interview which were
       <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2558389/pg1">
        taken from this GLP thread which has links to a lot of other information on this
       </a>
       (credit to the OP):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is the DTCC and why is it so secretive and important?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How can the DTCC process and clear the billions of High Frequency Trades that happen in milliseconds every day?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why are there over 300 Million stock trades that occur every day that are never processed or delivered?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How many phony and duplicate stock certificates of mining companies are there at the DTCC?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What happened to the $36T worth of paper securities that were submerged underwater during Hurricane Sandy?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why were all the gold and silver swap contracts transferred to the vault at 55 Water Street just weeks before it was flooded?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How did a huge fire erupt in the DTCC vault basement just after all the water was pumped out?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why was ex-CFTC Commissioner Michael Dunn (who argued against Dodd-Frank Swap Regulations) put in charge of the DTCC Vault just months before it flooded?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why does the DTCC hold legal title to all stocks, corporate and muni bonds, physical bearer bonds and even derivative contracts under the nominee name "CEDE &amp; Company"?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the government, Federal Reserve, exchanges and banks don't own the DTCC...who does?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why does the DTCC hold legal title to 99% of all mortgages in the world? (even yours!)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What are the ramifications of the DTCC (and their bankruptcy remote entity "CEDE &amp; Company") owning legal title to 99% of all financial instruments in the world?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Mind blowing interview.  Makes one wonder why not a single word of it was allowed to air...

       I hadn't realized what a big deal it actually is until recently either.  My attention had been mainly focused on the derivatives markets but now I see that the DTCC and "Cede &amp; Co." are also
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       pieces of the big picture, far moreso than I initially thought.

       While the information regarding the DTCC is extremely interesting, Bix Weir is a poor prognosticator at best, and something more sinister at worst. He is on record saying Obama is one of the "good guys". He has said the same thing regarding Alan Greenspan. He has a ridiculous narrative he sticks to called "the road to roota theory" where he says that we are going to go back to a gold standard and that we can just sit back because there are covert operations at the very top to get the cartel out of power, but never shows proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, read more about the flooding at the DTCC during Sandy, it is absolutely fascinating, but please, stay away from Bix Weir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Actually, for people that have never heard of the DTCC flood, there is a good synopsis with the crucial information you need to know starting at around 12:00. However I still believe Bix is scam artist who wants you to subscribe to his speculation newsletter.  The interviewer, SGTreport is great though and you guys should sub to him on YouTube.

       I just came across him and his website today so I'll have to investigate further.  I do agree with you, though, that the "road to roota theory" seems very much like a pipe dream to me on its face.  Even if he does have ulterior motives, though, I found the interview incredibly interesting and most of what he said in it regarding the DTCC I've since corroborated with other sources.
      </p>

       Perhaps he's of the ol' 90% truth, 10% bullshit camp of disinfo.
