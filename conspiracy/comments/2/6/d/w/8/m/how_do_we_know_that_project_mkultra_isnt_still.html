<p>&quot;Project MKUltra — sometimes referred to as the CIA&#39;s mind control program — is the code name of a U.S. government human research operation experimenting in the behavioral engineering of humans. Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army&#39;s Chemical Corps. The program began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967 and officially halted in 1973. The program engaged in many illegal activities; in particular it used unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people&#39;s mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have little doubt that such programs are still happening, either in deep black government projects, or contracted out to private corporations for plausible deniability. Surviving documents from the 1950&#39;s show that they achieved considerable success with &quot;Manchurian candidates,&quot; so there is little reason for them to have stopped the research, the limited hangout Church Committee notwithstanding.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you seem more knowledgeable about the subject than I am, I have a question.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H12b1Ez.jpg">picture</a> I posted reads &quot;Subject&#39;s memory was erased and her brain is that of a newborn baby.&quot; Do you believe this is real? If so, how is it possible to erase memory? I personally don&#39;t buy into it, because I didn&#39;t think science is that far yet. But then again, there&#39;s probably a lot of scientific advancements about which the general public hasn&#39;t been informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was basically nothing scientific about what they actually did, they just tortured people. If you do enough electroshock &quot;therapy&quot; on someone you can easily &#39;erase&#39; their memory. It&#39;s not at all sophisticated, just deranged and vicious -- par for the course for the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this involves a renowned psychology professor, specializing in hypnosis, performing experiments for projects under MKULTRA, specifically MKNAOMI and BLUEBIRD. a number of his experiments are detailed, quotes (from him) regarding his methodology are provided, and other pages on the site detail the complexity of the experiments. it wasn&#39;t just torture. it was the application of extremely traumatic experience, extended for enormous amounts of times, relieved only by drugs and hypnosis. they intended to create so much trauma that the mind produced its own amnesia, in SOME cases. but in many other experiments, they intended to create trauma that could be relieved by hypnosis and psychoactive drugs. they reinforced the pattern over and over again, as a means of brainwashing the subject. he would experience the most horrific pain, associated with a cue, and then a different cue would come on and the painful or traumatic stimulus would stop at the same time. over time, this reinforced a pattern of experience for the subject, so that when the 1st cue was triggered, the patient would psychologically reexperience trauma. then when the 2nd cue was triggered, the patient would go into a dissociative state. individual subexperiments attempted to associate each of these states (traumatic and dissociative) with different behaviors. thus, when the cue was triggered, the subject would DO some task. these manchurian candidates could thus be used to commit complex terrorist attacks, such as arming and firing a bomb, or assassinating a president. then, by triggering another cue, for example, the manchurian candidate&#39;s memory could be shut off, or he could lose the ability to speak, or be completely unable to say that he was brainwashed by the government. a means of programming a patsy to do some despicable task for you, as well as programming him to take full responsibility for it. the number of methods is enormous, but the purpose is generally the same. officially, the project was a failure. but hundreds, and i mean hundreds, of individuals have claimed to have been victims of the experiments, or have claimed to have witnessed them. many of these people have come forward to say that they were victims in the decades after the project was shut down, and to say that it was successful... that many of them were effectively brainwashed, and still are. there is limited objective evidence to suggest that the projects continued. but there is only anecdotal, eyewitness testimony that the projects were successful, and enormous in scope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no and no. the page i linked contains only quotes from a book. you can find the book online, i&#39;m sure. i don&#39;t know much about the author because this isn&#39;t a serious area of interest for me, but it&#39;s not bullshit. all accounts of MKULTRA say it had nothing to do with turning people into vegetables, even government accounts... did you even read what i said? the objective was for the subject to endure extreme traumatic stimuli, to the point where his or her brain repressed memory of the event and fundamentally changed. trauma makes people extremely suggestible, and drastically increases their susceptibility to hypnosis, especially when under the influence of LSD. there are a number of reasons why a psychologist would say that there is no way MKULTRA could <em>not</em> be successful. the hypotheses were based on ideas we now consider fundamental to psychology of trauma. it&#39;s essentially the foundation for PTSD and the numerous phenomena that come with it. it&#39;s the foundation of the development of deviant sexual behavior in children exposed to extremely traumatic sexual abuse. i can&#39;t imagine why you would think that MKULTRA was merely a brutish program that failed. there isn&#39;t any evidence that shows that. there is the false, minimized evidence released by the CIA, which suggests that MKULTRA was developed entirely for the purpose of testing ESP phenomena. and then there is the arguably true evidence released by Ross and a number of other authors, which suggests that MKULTRA was designed for testing of mind control, with the primary objective of creating &quot;manchurian candidates,&quot; and with the cover story of being an &quot;<em>ESP Project</em>&quot;... i have not seen a single mention of MKULTRA as being a failed project intended only to see the effects of torture and abuse. every non government source that mentions MKULTRA suggests that its intention was to determine methods for brainwashing, primarily testing effects of hypnosis, drugs, trauma, and combinations thereof. Ted Gunderson&#39;s lecture regarding the subject matter of Ross&#39; book claims that most of these experiments involved subjecting patients to extreme trauma with a &#39;trigger,&#39; then removing the traumatic stimuli, hypnotizing or introducing positive narcotic stimuli with a different &#39;trigger.&#39; some experiments involved even constant administration of LSD, for the entire duration of the experiment, including the traumatic and dissociative states, because experimenters believed that it increased the susceptibility of the brain to long term psychotic delusions. this is absolutely true about LSD, of course. there is very clear and noncontentious evidence that psychedelic drugs influence susceptibility to psychotic disorders in response to trauma. also noncontentious evidence that trauma, drugs, and hypnosis can each play a role in suggestibility of adults and especially children. also plenty of evidence that brainwashing is a very real thing, takes many forms, and is absolutely and primarily related to trauma, drugs, and hypnosis. the application of all 3, at key points, provides the triggers or cues for programmed behavior. application of traumatic stimuli with the signal of a very specific noise or visual stimulus will eventually cause the brain to permanently associate said stimulus with trauma. this has been shown over and over again with rats, to the point where we now use it as the standard to measure place preference conditioning created by pharmaceutical drugs. they do this literally all the time. i know because i&#39;m interning for a biochem firm, and this is very standard stuff in pharma experimentation. applying an electric shock to a rat, but only when he&#39;s in a certain area of the cage, will cause the rat to &quot;learn&quot; that the area is associated with the shock. the same principle can be applied to any stimulus. the subject could be forced to say and listen to &quot;i&#39;m a patsy,&quot; &quot;i&#39;m brainwashed,&quot; &quot;the CIA made me do it,&quot; in many forms, over and over and over again. each time he says such a thing, he will experience such extreme trauma that his brain represses most aspects of the experience. the only memories will be subconscious. then, these cues could be played at subliminal volume, and the patient would experience unexplainable terror, anguish, etc. then, they could begin to associate other stimuli with positive experience. while training him to claim insanity, take full responsibility for his actions, and so on... in many different ways, obviously... they would give the guy morphine. the hypnosis can be used to trigger different states, primarily a traumatic flashback state and a dissociative state. programming could be applied to both states, such that when x happens, patient will perform ß. when y happens, patient will perform ∂. this is pretty complicated and it&#39;s very difficult to find exact descriptions of the experimentation, because most people don&#39;t seem to even be interested in it. but the point is that a subject could be trained to respond in a very specific way to certain stimuli, performing complex tasks. he would be programmed to associate the act of speaking about the conspiracy with horrible trauma, and programmed to associate the act of speaking about his own guilt and insanity with great pleasure. he would also probably be subjected to other methods of torture and hypnosis, perhaps designed to erase his conscious memory of the incidents. subconscious programming, in a sense. he is not aware of it, but he is being hypnotized. or he is not aware of it, but a stimulus is invoking a dissociative state. this is the basis of the multiple personality thing. the cues basically trigger him to enter the dissociative state, where you might say he is a &quot;different person.&quot; it&#39;s not agreed upon medically that &#39;multiple personality disorder&#39; is a real thing, but there is no doubt that people can enter dissociative and amnesic states. it&#39;s possible to fragment someone&#39;s mind with certain cues that cause such traumatic subconscious experiences that they regress to exactly the same psychological state they created when the trauma first happened. by creating multiple cues with multiple forms of trauma, you could potentially fragment the mind into many parts. each part would have its own programming. i can only imagine that this takes years and years, and that whoever runs the whole thing knows a hell of a lot more than i do. it&#39;s entirely possible that this whole thing&#39;s just made up. buuut i can&#39;t imagine the whole thing being a hoax. it&#39;s not a very popular topic, so theres not much profit to be made in writing an entire book of lies, and fabricating an entire bibliography of documentation. the other problem is that mind control was mentioned by dozens of children in the franklin case. more than 80 came forward to say they were used as sex slaves, and dozens said that they were personally victims, knew victims, or saw victims of military mind control programs. it&#39;s hard to imagine that many kids all making up the same story, just so happening to corroborate, even after extensive questioning. anyway, a lot of the victims were subjected to psych evaluations, and they exhibited symptoms of extreme trauma, psychosis, PTSD, and so on. they were, at the very least, victims of an extremely abusive child sex slavery ring. they witnessed their peers being brutally raped, dismembered, dissected while alive, and murdered by satanists. these kids were subjected to the most horrific tortures imaginable, and in a sexual context. they experienced perhaps the most horrific things a human can experience... and perhaps that was the intention of the abusers. to determine what the most terrible thing you can do to someone is, get rich enough that you can perform and get away with it, and do it. i know how fucking insane it all sounds, too. when i first started hearing about it, i thought it was complete and utter bullshit. satanic child sex slavery mind control? too many conspiracies at once, right? sounds like some fuckin ancient aliens reptilian overlords shit. i pretty much ignored it until i heard about the Franklin coverup. i spent 2 days straight reading about it and listening to lectures. it was the most horrific 2 days of my life. after the first few hours, i realized that i couldn&#39;t enjoy the benefits of not believing it anymore. my psyche was no longer protected by the belief that &quot;it&#39;s all made up&quot;... which is the worst feeling i&#39;ve ever had. the documentation and evidence is so overwhelming, that it&#39;s shocking we don&#39;t learn about it in school. the coverup was so massive that the subsequent trials pitted senators against senators. some of the highest people in the highest offices were involved in the crimes, and some of the highest people in the highest offices were involved in trying to prosecute them. the franklin coverup is 100% real. it absolutely happened, and i can&#39;t imagine it has stopped since then. it&#39;s perhaps the most horrific thing i can imagine, and it&#39;s fucking real. it&#39;s so disturbing that you really don&#39;t want to believe it, but the proof is so solid that you have to. and the franklin case is intrinsically tied to MKULTRA, so it&#39;s down the rabbit hole... who really knows the truth, i guess we&#39;ll never know. but i can tell you, without a doubt in my mind, and as a pretty skeptical individual, that there is some extremely morbid shit going on right now as we speak. i may theorize a lot, but i hesitate to believe any of it. my opinion stops right at belief, because i can only believe what i can see. i have ideas about what might be true regarding MKULTRA, but i won&#39;t insult your intelligence by telling you that i believe them. the franklin case though? i don&#39;t need to believe it, because i&#39;ve seen it. there is such a massive mountain of evidence that the question of &quot;belief&quot; goes right out the window. it shocks me, to no end, that only one person was imprisoned for the crime of running a child sex slavery RING. you can&#39;t have a ring with one person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it is pretty easy to completely fuck a persons mind over and send them drooling with a gun towards their intended victims.  However, having them be perfectly coherent, &quot;cool&quot;, funny and healthy looking and then to just snap in a moment to carry out some task would be much more difficult to do.  I think that the mind control is basically only up to the first case and also for transmitting complex messages through the person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is quite possible, as others have said, and not that difficult. Fry someone&#39;s brains with enough drugs and electroshock and you can definitely reduce them to an infantile state. As the documents I provided show, they actually had much more sophisticated techniques than that even back in the 50&#39;s. I shudder to think what they can do now with another six decades of &quot;scientific&quot; development under their belts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe MKULTRA has evolved; new techniques such as electronic surveillance - i&#39;ve read about new computer mind reading capabilities that can be used (1996 by Gloria Naylor)</p>

<p>whatever is being used won&#39;t be revealed</p>

<p>edit: on second thought, MKULTA is probably <em>still</em> in existence, i&#39;m thinking elec. surveillance/drugs are being experimented on people unaware that it&#39;s being done! I forgot about a book i read: The Invisible Crime&quot; by Michael F Bell, he was drugged, a &#39;tracking&#39;(?)  chip was implanted &amp; gang stalked, he never found out why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Even back with the original MKUltra, there was a strong interest in bioelectromagnetics or psychotronic weapons. Subproject 119 involved, &quot;The remote electronic activation of the human organism.&quot;</p>

<p>Read more about psychotronic weapons in the .mil paper,  &quot;The Mind Has No Firewall.&quot; Or in Lt. Col. Michael Aquino&#39;s &quot;Mindwar.&quot; Or in &quot;Synthetic Telepathy and the Early Mind Wars.&quot; </p>

<p>US government documents as recent as 2006 discuss bypassing normal required consent for human experimentation involving, &quot; severe or unusual intrusions, either physical or psychological, on human subjects (such as consciousness-altering drugs or mind-control techniques).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the psychological manipulation is occurring right in the palm of your hand? For example, the iPhone I&#39;m typing on is emitting blue light in the 400-500 nanometer range. This is suppressing my melatonin production at night, tricking my brain into thinking it is daytime. This has impacts on sleep quality, and sleep deprivation is the cornerstone of any personality modification program. Okay, maybe that&#39;s not enough to convince you. How about the FaceBeast? Algorithms determine what shows up in your feed, so your perceptions and media content are being shaped by algorithms, your &quot;handlers&quot;. Still not enough? What about the upcoming feature that will allow Facebook to access your microphone to supposedly record any music that&#39;s playing in the background? That is a serious exploit waiting to be abused. You might think this is strictly an NSA initiative, but don&#39;t forget inQtel&#39;s role in Facebook.  Finally, what if all the photos we are taking are geotagged to construct a photographic survey of the world? Imagine having access to every geotagged photo in the world, that would be like google street view, in your home. The psychological war has evolved beyond manipulating individuals to manipulating the masses using media. Instead of Michael Aquino you have jay-z, instead of Cathy O&#39;Brien we have Edward Snowden. Don&#39;t wait for the declassified documents to prove it to you; it&#39;s right there hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>Although the CIA insists that MKUltra-type experiments have been abandoned, some CIA observers say there is little reason to believe it does not continue today under a different set of acronyms.[47] Victor Marchetti, author and 14-year CIA veteran, stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducted disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a &quot;cover story.&quot;[89][90]</p>

The multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies. They work a lot with vets who have PTSD giving them LSD and MDMA. I personally think on paper it&#39;s fantastic, but why are these dudes given the okay from the government? Just something I&#39;ve always thought about as I truly believe the mind control experiments ala mkultra never stopped. This is why they are so common knowledge. The general consensus is they&#39;ve stopped. I highly doubt that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i also should say that it is very clear to me that MKULTRA projects continued long after they were supposedly cut off. the Franklin Coverup, which i talk about in my post (linked above) provides eyewitness testimony that manchurian candidates were being created every day at the time of the franklin coverup. why would they stop? they succeeded, by all honest accounts. many people, including Ted Gunderson, a former FBI Chief, argue that manchurian candidates have possibly been used for EVERY major terrorist attack in America since the 60s, including 9/11. so who knows what they could be up to now? in my post above, i argue that it&#39;s even possible that the Isla Vista shooter was a manchurian candidate. i doubt that this is the case, as it seems more likely that he&#39;s just a very mentally ill young man, probably with borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder. BUT it&#39;s possible, and i outline the reasons for why this could be the case, in the post. at the very least, it asks a question.</p>

<p>to anyone curious about the current status of MKULTRA projects, i recommend listening to some of Ted Gunderson&#39;s lectures on youtube. he delves deep into the topics of government terrorism conspiracies, especially 9/11 and the WTC carbombing that happened years prior to 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 4 tries and accounts, I have been immediately shadowbanned for trying to post this as a new topic on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> this morning. My topics are not showing up on separate computers.  This is the closest topic that correlates with this info.  Sorry if any is irrelevant.</p>

<p>This is one of many examples of modern USA propaganda being used on its own citizens to advance an agenda.</p>

<p>In this example, TBS is conditioning its viewers to accept being secretly video recorded. The hidden camera show &quot;Deal With It&quot; on TBS has an interesting promo which is titled &quot;Do Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Original Video Link: <a href="http://www.tbs.com/video/?oid=1221220">http://www.tbs.com/video/?oid=1221220</a></p>

<p>YouTube Mirror: <a href="http://youtu.be/TevdOD5sHKM">http://youtu.be/TevdOD5sHKM</a></p>

<p>&quot;Deal With It&quot; is based on an Israeli television show and features comedian host Theo Von and a guest comedian who dare &quot;random people&quot; to pull pranks on &quot;the public.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/VDbpN6G">http://imgur.com/VDbpN6G</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/fY6rNyA">http://imgur.com/fY6rNyA</a></p>

<p><strong>Subtle propaganda is still propaganda.</strong></p>

<p>Notice the imagery of the security cameras, especially around the logos at the end, placed throughout the promo. Is this just a relative design for the show or could this perhaps be used to make people even more desensitized to the increasing surveillance state while also trying to pair the mass-surveillance ideology with a comedic atmosphere?</p>

<p>Brainwashing is defined as, &quot;The implanting of specific knowledge or propaganda into someone&#39;s brain, by constant repetition and psychological conditioning.&quot;</p>

<p>This appears to be exactly what is being seen and done here. Viewers are being subconsciously conditioned to accept being watched all the time, by the use of the content and imagery of this &quot;reality show&quot; and its commercials, which are currently being repeatedly aired +4 times an hour, as of May 24, 2014,3:30 UTC. Viewers&#39; televisions are being bombarded with the big bold words &quot;Deal With It&quot; surrounded by surveillance cameras every ~10-15 minutes.</p>

<p>I mean how much more blatant can they be about it. The name of the show is called &quot;Deal With It.&quot; Along with the title of the promo which is called, &quot;Do Nothing&quot;, these titles parallel the message of &quot;Obey&quot;, &quot;Follow Orders&quot;, and &quot;Do Not Question Authority.&quot; </p>

<p>For those who are unaware, privacy is a human right in which no one should have to go out of his or her way to obtain, according to Article 12, of the &quot;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&quot;
(source: <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/</a>&quot;</p>

<p>My only intentions of this example were to document the use of propaganda being used in the USA against its citizens, and to remind others to be aware and <strong>QUESTION EVERYTHING SINGLE THING.</strong></p>
