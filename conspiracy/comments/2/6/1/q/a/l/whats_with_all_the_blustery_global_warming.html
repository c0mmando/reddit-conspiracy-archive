    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not true. Air Pollution has nothing to do with the Earth&#39;s temperature. The Earth has been <strong>cooling</strong> for 19 straight years. Why? Because of the SUN. Our SUN is <em>directly</em> responsible for the Earth&#39;s temperature. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is insignificant as far as temperature is concerned. </p>

<p>Air pollution <strong>is a problem</strong> for sure, but <em>not a temperature problem</em>. Air pollution must be curbed, especially if we want to breathe clean air. </p>

<p>Why all the hysteria about &quot;Global Warming/Climate Change&quot;? To make the people pay more money <em>and</em> to force the people into greater obedience, which will raise still more money. The Government is broke! Obamacare failed to raise the tax win fall the government was hoping for. So, the government must scare the people into paying the money the government wants through fear mongering.</p>

<p>No, of course not. But it is not all correct, either. The point I am trying to make is that <strong>politics is the priority</strong>. Also, some of the science is being omitted, again, for political purposes. The IPCC is infamous for intentionally using incorrect data since the real data inconveniently will not agree with the political agenda.</p>

<p>This just isn&#39;t true and you should consider not using this claim in your arguments in the future because it immediately discredits anything else you may have to say.</p>

<p>Denying climate change discredits actual conspiracies and legitimate problems with the information we are given by the media. Scientists are considered, thorough, accountable, and peer reviewed. Pick a different group to gripe about, because this claim is not only true, but the consensus in solidifying everyday. You will be hearing about this for the rest of your life, and eventually you will be forced to accept it, because it will be undeniable. </p>
