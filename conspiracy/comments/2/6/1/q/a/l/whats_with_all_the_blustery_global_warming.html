       I don't know about you, but I've noticed a lot of global warming stories in the news lately, and they are all insanely fearmongering. As in end of the world bullshit. What's up with this? The elite must be preparing to institute another tax on us, if they are engaging in this level of Chicken Little dancing.

       To me, it's
       <strong>
        a good sign
       </strong>
       . The general public, and even the scientific community is becoming much more freethinking and vocal with regards to skepticism about global warming. Thus, the elite are
       <strong>
        desperate
       </strong>
       and panicking. They were hoping for a mandate for the carbon tax, Agenda 21, etc.

       The global temperature has not risen for 15+ years, according to NOAA's own data.

       With spring here the weather is warming up.  When do people pay more attention to global warming propaganda, when they're sweating as they do lawn work, or when it's -30 out and they're huddled around a fireplace.  It's the same story just reported when it "feels" more believable.

       Its not fearmongering if it true(unlike alex jones). Global warming is a problem centered around our dependency on oil an the greed of the corporations in control of said oil.

       It's not true. Air Pollution has nothing to do with the Earth's temperature. The Earth has been
       <strong>
        cooling
       </strong>
       for 19 straight years. Why? Because of the SUN. Our SUN is
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       responsible for the Earth's temperature. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is insignificant as far as temperature is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Air pollution
       <strong>
        is a problem
       </strong>
       for sure, but
       <em>
        not a temperature problem
       </em>
       . Air pollution must be curbed, especially if we want to breathe clean air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why all the hysteria about "Global Warming/Climate Change"? To make the people pay more money
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       to force the people into greater obedience, which will raise still more money. The Government is broke! Obamacare failed to raise the tax win fall the government was hoping for. So, the government must scare the people into paying the money the government wants through fear mongering.

       You mean to tell me that the huge ball of heat in the middle of the Solar System has something to do with the temp of the Earth?

The ONLY thing causing heat on the planet Earth is SUVs (period).

       No, of course not. But it is not all correct, either. The point I am trying to make is that
       <strong>
        politics is the priority
       </strong>
       . Also, some of the science is being omitted, again, for political purposes. The IPCC is infamous for intentionally using incorrect data since the real data inconveniently will not agree with the political agenda.

       Have you looked at some of the actual science (data/predictions/models)?  Once you go beyond the "97% of climate scientists agree" false rhetoric it becomes pretty clear that the science doesn't hold up to much scrutiny of any kind.

       So I'll take that as a "no" then, since surely if you had you'd realize that you're just parroting the PR talking points.

       Hey, maybe read one of the articles to find out why people are talking about it. A study was published, and like 98% of studies before it, the cause of global warming is clearly man made. Because science. Thermodynamics does not have a political party. Maybe there is some grand conspiracy here... I mean it will be hard to exploit your labor and resources for profit if we are all dead.

       And yes, to announce initiatives for environmental sustainability. That's not part of some grand conspiracy, it's because he's so much of a loose cannon he's alienated the left wing. He has to throw them this bone to prevent the party from being totally poisoned against the dems in the next presidential candidate.

       But peer reviewed research and consensus of the scientific community can't possibly be verified, or be a legitimate part of the scientific method can it? It might be a tired argument, but that's because 97% of the climate scientists, and 98% of the published papers on the subject are tired of trying to convince you of a verifiable fact.

       This just isn't true and you should consider not using this claim in your arguments in the future because it immediately discredits anything else you may have to say.

       But if you want to link me to whatever "study" you're basing it on I'd be happy to explain to you why it's false and/or why the methodology is horribly flawed.

       Denying climate change discredits actual conspiracies and legitimate problems with the information we are given by the media. Scientists are considered, thorough, accountable, and peer reviewed. Pick a different group to gripe about, because this claim is not only true, but the consensus in solidifying everyday. You will be hearing about this for the rest of your life, and eventually you will be forced to accept it, because it will be undeniable.
