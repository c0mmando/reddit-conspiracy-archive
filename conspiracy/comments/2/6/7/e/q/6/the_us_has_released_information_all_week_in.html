<p>Tuesday - US charges 5 in Chinese Military with cyber-espionage. PR campaign after the release about the Bahamas. A lot of Americans still distrust China so those people might now think &#39;u-sa u-sa u-sa oy! I guess we be needin that spyin&#39; NSA if we want to keep using forks much longer&#39;</p>

<p>EDIT: I do not feel this way about China. In fact, I am 100% behind thier response to the cyber-theft charges. I also would rather buy router made in China than one made in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st, we need to get past the US Newspeak of calling some blatant privacy invasions as &quot;surveillance&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Surveillance&quot; means monitoring of available information, i.e. security cameras on public streets.  Posting a security guard is basically having a security guard perform surveillance in an area with proper access.</p>

<p>In public, &quot;surveillance&quot; is just taking information that&#39;s publicly available.  It&#39;s completely legal (beyond some copyright issues).  Anyone can do it.  I can take my iPhone and take images from the streets.  So can the Government.</p>

<p>What US government is doing, far beyond &quot;surveillance&quot;, and it has been bombarding the public for years with propaganda to twist the meaning of the word beyond reason.</p>

<p>Hacking into someone&#39;s phone accounts or emails for &quot;metadata&quot; is still hacking.  If any private citizen do it, it would be a crime.  Yet, the government calls it &quot;surveillance&quot;.</p>

<p>No.  Let&#39;s get the definition straight.</p>

<p>Cyber-espionage is still espionage.  By installing backdoors and malwares on other people&#39;s computer systems, the US government has essentially installed thousands of &quot;Agent Smith&#39;s&quot; into computers to take information.</p>

<p>Proverbially, that&#39;s like the US government hiding a security guard in your attic, who will come out every now and then to rummage through your belongings when you are not at home.</p>

<p>You would never tolerate US government putting a secret security guard in your attic.</p>

<p>And yet, because you might not even know whether they hacked into your email accounts, you don&#39;t feel the intrusion of Cyber-espionage as much.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s still there.</p>
