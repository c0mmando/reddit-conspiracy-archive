<p>&quot;Ibogaine is an oneirophrenic (dream-creating) drug that activates the user’s long-term memory, bringing to the surface information from the unconscious and causing vast insight into one’s nature. Many therapists consider one ibogaine experience to be equal to years of talk or group therapy.&quot; -- From the official website</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, you might want to do some <em>real</em> research. A lot of what you hear about it is complete hype. It&#39;s a tool that can provide a powerful emotional experience that might help someone change their lives, but it&#39;s not a magic addiction cure the way people like you make it out to be.</p>

<p>Also, how does a drug made from a plant have an &quot;official website&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think the claims are exaggerated? </p>

<p>Mushrooms and MDMA have a greater clinical impact on PTSD/depression than any other known forms of traditional therapy. It is believed to be an incredibly effective cure for alcoholism and nicotine addiction, as well. That&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Marijuana alleviates - in some cases completely eliminates - the symptoms of certain types of seizures and cluster headaches. Before marijuana, there we no known ways of mitigating the symptoms. That&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking to people who have actually tried it. Getting information from sources other than people trying to sell their services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mushrooms and MDMA have a greater clinical impact on PTSD/depression than any other known forms of traditional therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa... that is a hyperbolic claim if I&#39;ve ever heard one. You can&#39;t just toss out a wild claim, not include any kind of source, and then say &quot;this is not an exaggeration&quot;, as though that magically makes what you&#39;ve said true. Yes, there are absolutely promising therapies involving tryptamine based psychedelics, as well as MDMA, but to claim that they &quot;have a greater clinical impact&quot; is completely without solid evidence. That&#39;s what you <em>want to believe</em>, not something that has been clinically demonstrated.</p>

<p>LSD definitely showed success in treating alcoholism in some studies in the 60&#39;s, certainly enough to warrant further investigation, but while the studies were very promising, they were still relatively small, and there hasn&#39;t been enough subsequent research to claim that the promising numbers from those studies will hold up.</p>

<p>Coming to ibogaine for opiate addiction, you hear a lot of claims about how it eliminates withdrawal symptoms, and things like that, for which the evidence is, at best, extremely sketchy. Many people selling ibogaine therapy are hucksters and quacks, and rather than actually admit it isn&#39;t perfect, they will make excuses about how the person involved was &quot;doing it wrong&quot; for whatever reasons (without, of course, admitting that it really should be their responsibility to ensure that everything is done properly, and not to administer the drug if there are any questions about this). I also don&#39;t see any reason to believe that ibogaine is more effective than guided therapy using other psychedelics.</p>

<p>Using drugs like this to facilitate powerful emotional experiences that can have a therapeutic effect should be one tool in the arsenal for treating addiction (as well as other psychological issues), but acting like it is a miracle cure is naive, ignorant, and potentially harmful. In fact, as a generally rule, <em>anyone</em> claiming to have a miracle cure for <em>anything</em> should be treated with the utmost suspicion. People who honestly want to find the optimal treatment, and take a scientific approach are ready to discredit their discoveries and methods if the evidence doesn&#39;t hold up, and they are actively working to try and prove themselves wrong, because that is the kind of approach that leads to truthful, realistic data, and avoids confirmation bias. As a result though, a lot of lay people see science being done properly, and think that it&#39;s &quot;big pharma&quot; or &quot;the government&quot; trying to hold something back, and can&#39;t understand why they aren&#39;t just blindly cheering it on and taking the word of the people who are trying to sell it at face value.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;ve posted this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> leads me to believe you&#39;re probably under the impression that &quot;the man&quot; is somehow trying to keep this a secret, despite having no real knowledge about how new drugs and treatments are researched or approved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marijuana alleviates - in some cases completely eliminates - the symptoms of certain types of seizures and cluster headaches. Before marijuana, there we no known ways of mitigating the symptoms. That&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is absolutely an exaggeration, and a very dishonest one. First of all, there are a number of treatments that mitigate the effects of cluster headaches, with varying degrees of success, and like many of those, marijuana shows a little bit of help for some people, and zero help for others. A rather large number of people even report that cannabis actually triggers cluster headache attacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.neurologyreviews.com/home/article/is-cannabis-effective-for-cluster-headache/aad45110983517bf479b47263a2a5403.html">http://www.neurologyreviews.com/home/article/is-cannabis-effective-for-cluster-headache/aad45110983517bf479b47263a2a5403.html</a> 
Here&#39;s a link to the actual paper that this article is about. Roughly 52% found its effects &quot;variable or uncertain&quot; (meaning it really didn&#39;t help one way of the other), about 22% said it actually had <em>negative</em> effects (making the headaches worse or even triggering them), and about 26% reported it was helpful. Also very important, this is a relatively small study (139 patients), and 45.3% of the participants were already cannabis users... meaning a group of people who are far more likely to be biased in favor of cannabis, and who would be heavily swayed by confirmation bias in favor of it. This means that this study is, by its very nature, very poorly controlled, and certainly lacking to kind of double blind protocol often expected of a solid study. Am I saying that it should be completely discounted as a possible treatment? No, but the kind of unbridled optimism you&#39;re demonstrating is clearly misguided and naive.</p>

<p>Tryptamines are actually more promising in the treatment of cluster headaches than cannabis is. This isn&#39;t <em>that</em> big of a surprise, considering ergotamine has been used to treat migraines for decades, and that this was something Albert Hoffman was studying when he first synthesized LSD. Low doses of LSD or psilocybin have been shown to be extremely effective <em>for some people</em>, and there is some promising research in this direction.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that you&#39;ve trotted out a bunch of unrelated drugs and conditions as though this somehow demonstrates the efficacy of ibogaine is bizarre. It leads me to believe that your optimism about ibogaine doesn&#39;t come from actual evidence, but from a general feeling that conventional treatments are somehow evil, and you should blindly trust things based on completely arbitrary criteria, like whether they&#39;re &quot;natural&quot;.</p>

<p>Like so many people here, you seem like you&#39;re quite ready to believe any medical claims that fit with your worldview, while being suspicious of those that don&#39;t... the kind of attitude where a study showing that, say, cannabis shows a slightly reduction in cancer cell division in a petri dish is &quot;proof&quot; that it cures cancer, while a study showing that its use doesn&#39;t seem to have much of a positive effect among patients is just &quot;proof&quot; that &quot;big pharma&quot; is manipulating the study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure, though I could be wrong, that to be a Schedule I (minus marijuana, of course...) a drug must have both no medical use and be addictive. </p>

<p>If you consider mental health and addiction medical issues, then Ibogaine clearly has a medical purpose.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;ve never done it myself, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone wanting to go back for seconds. Everything I&#39;ve heard is that it&#39;s a very unpleasant but very life changing experience. Similar to DMT plus Ayuhuasca plus LSD plus a kick in the dick.</p>

<p>There are websites for everything. Seriously. More websites than subreddits, so of course there will be a page for everything. Official just means that its a primary resource for information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think the claims are exaggerated? </p>

<p>Mushrooms and MDMA have a greater clinical impact on PTSD/depression than any other known forms of traditional therapy. It is believed to be an incredibly effective cure for alcoholism and nicotine addiction, as well. That&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Marijuana alleviates - in some cases completely eliminates - the symptoms of certain types of seizures and cluster headaches. Before marijuana, there we no known ways of mitigating the symptoms. That&#39;s not an exaggeration.</p>

<p>So... </p>
