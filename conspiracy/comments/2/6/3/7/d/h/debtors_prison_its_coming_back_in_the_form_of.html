       I'm learning how to defend myself, but the one thing they have is that they'll charge you for their time. So, they'l allege an injury and then charge you to prosecute you - whether or not you are found innocent. This is highway robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to let the oppressors continue then pay their court fees and pay their tickets. The only way they'll stop is if you stop complying with them. Don't plead guilty and pay their fines. Challenge their standing. Learn about standing and the applicability of their laws. And I don't mean this Freeman or Sovereign Citizen stuff. Learn about their laws and learn about how to deflect their attacks.

       They can't take everyone to court. If only three or five percent of the population started challenging them - even if they lost - the courts wouldn't be able to handle the influx of cases. I was recently at a traffic case and they had to get a lawyer to sub in for a judge because they didn't have enough personnel / staff. The lawyer was an idiot and, had I known what I know now, I could have gotten a dismissal.

       Starve them and make them work for their theft.

       They have to make it look legit.

       Disallow them their veil of legitimacy.

       They are illegitimate. Play their game only as much as necessary so that they don't have an excuse to use violence against you. Non-compliance worked for MLK and Gandhi. It can work for us too.

       That's all I was referring too as well. I have always contested any ticket I got (traffic or otherwise.).

       When it gets beyond things considered some what minor for the courts. (Such as traffic tickets, disorderly conduct and shit like that) That is when you/we need to stand our ground.

       You're clever.  And I wholly agree with the title of your post.  America needs more people like you. (And
       <em>
        criminalized

       is better than

       Actually, we are already living in an invisible debtors prison. Get behind on your payments, and you get a bad credit rating: try and find a job, car loan, or an apartment like that, and see how far it gets you.

       one thing I found since I started defending myself is that court costs go away, if you lose, you may have to pay fines, but don't worry about them tacking on additional court costs, because those seem to be a tax on the privilege of pleading guilty and use of an overworked half, or totally disinterested public defender.

       fall behind on child support payments and you'll be in debtors prison pretty quickly. they'll jail you and make sure you can't work to pay it off. i've seen it happen.
