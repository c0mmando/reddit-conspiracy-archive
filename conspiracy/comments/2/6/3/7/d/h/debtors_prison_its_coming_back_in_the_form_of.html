<p>I&#39;m learning how to defend myself, but the one thing they have is that they&#39;ll charge you for their time. So, they&#39;l allege an injury and then charge you to prosecute you - whether or not you are found innocent. This is highway robbery.</p>

<p>If you want to let the oppressors continue then pay their court fees and pay their tickets. The only way they&#39;ll stop is if you stop complying with them. Don&#39;t plead guilty and pay their fines. Challenge their standing. Learn about standing and the applicability of their laws. And I don&#39;t mean this Freeman or Sovereign Citizen stuff. Learn about their laws and learn about how to deflect their attacks.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t take everyone to court. If only three or five percent of the population started challenging them - even if they lost - the courts wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the influx of cases. I was recently at a traffic case and they had to get a lawyer to sub in for a judge because they didn&#39;t have enough personnel / staff. The lawyer was an idiot and, had I known what I know now, I could have gotten a dismissal.</p>

<p>Starve them and make them work for their theft.</p>

<p>They have to make it look legit. </p>

<p>Disallow them their veil of legitimacy.</p>

<p>Note that these particular cheaters kill people as a part of their daily job functions.</p>

<p>Quote from you...Basically the same damn thing. By pleading not guilty and challenging it you are playing by their rules in their system. </p>

<p>So now you have me confused...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sentence wasn&#39;t clear. My bad.</p>

<p>1.) Do not plead guilty.</p>

<p>2.) Do not pay their fines.</p>

<p>3.) Challenge their standing.</p>

<p>4.) Learn about their law system so that you may deflect their attacks.</p>

<p>They are illegitimate. Play their game only as much as necessary so that they don&#39;t have an excuse to use violence against you. Non-compliance worked for MLK and Gandhi. It can work for us too.</p>

<p>When it gets beyond things considered some what minor for the courts. (Such as traffic tickets, disorderly conduct and shit like that) That is when you/we need to stand our ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one thing I found since I started defending myself is that court costs go away, if you lose, you may have to pay fines, but don&#39;t worry about them tacking on additional court costs, because those seem to be a tax on the privilege of pleading guilty and use of an overworked half, or totally disinterested public defender.  </p>

<p>fall behind on child support payments and you&#39;ll be in debtors prison pretty quickly. they&#39;ll jail you and make sure you can&#39;t work to pay it off. i&#39;ve seen it happen.</p>
