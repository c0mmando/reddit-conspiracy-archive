       I'm seeing us devolving into a recognizably 3-tier society.  It will look pretty much like Robocop - the wealthy living in walled enclaves, the police enjoying a middle class lifestyle in exchange for mindless obedience and the willingness to inflict deadly force for any reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of us will scrape by in decaying cities and suburbs, terrified of both the gangsters in our neighborhoods and even more of the gangsters wearing badges.

       Only immediate and complete overhaul of the current system of monied politics could change the direction we are going.

       Public finance of all electioneering - and stiff penalties for any violators (corporate or individual) could fix things quickly.

       No that doesn't work. If you completely overthrow a system then you start with nothing. After the French Revolution there were bodies in the streets for weeks, the rats starting eating them, it was fucking horror. Its better to work with what you got rather than try to start from nothing, because nothing is worse than you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change takes generations, you have to be patient. Live your life as best you can, set a good example, raise your kids right and see small incremental change over a long time. Or you could move to a more forward thinking country and be done with it.

       Quite possible.  I believe war has been declared against the public
and this declaration is so huge and diabolical that the average man
cannot conceive that it is true.  Like shooting fish in a barrel.

       I cannot agree more. I also think the motives behind the war are so intricate and the methods of manipulation are so complex that we have no way of knowing what is actually going on. I truly believe this, and while I don't lose sleep over it I do feel bad for anyone who thinks otherwise.

       I think we're seeing a lot of actions - from the stripping of Detroit pensions to the closure of New Orleans public schools, from the Snowden revelations to the glaring abuses by our own police - actions that are pushing the American public harder and harder toward violence in the streets.

       I don't think any secret groups are purposely trying to incite unrest.  I think the tension and unrest comes just due to deteriorating circumstances due to post industrialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gotten to the point where I think this is just the nature of humanity.  There is just something innate in some people to dominate and use all resources.  To try and change that characteristic is to try and change millions of years of evolution.  I've been more of the mind to develop my spiritual acceptance of the pain in the universe in the hope that life balances it all out and that I will also experience the pleasure of the universe.

       I been thinking this for a long time. Greed is some kind of evolutionary trait that has become outdated, but it still exists in the brain. I think we as a species are getting way ahead of ourselves with technology and futurism without really stopping to contemplate how our brains work and what parts of them work for and/or against the common good. Knowledge of Self is integral to real progress as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution takes tens of thousands of years, at a minimum, and the shelf-life of a species is about 7 million years. Here we are at the beginning without really knowing who we are, but racing like mad towards a future we don't understand.

       If they destabilize things, it gives them a reason to call upon martial law, Once that happens we will become a fascist country entirely and any resistence or people too broke to support themselves will be sent to FEMA camps....where they have lovely plastic coffins to store you when they're done.....I think it could certainly happen anyway.

       I agree - I think that before the USA would go to a system of basic income for all or fair, living wages they would instead cull the working herd by creating slave labor camps.
