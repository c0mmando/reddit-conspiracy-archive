<p>Other leadership summits involving this cast of characters gets front page space, but what makes this one so different?  Why do so many politicians deny attending?  Why do so many attendees cover their faces in front of the cameras?  Why are journalists who show up and attempt to engage attendants treated as criminals, harangued by local police and security and often unlawfully searched and detained?  In an era where citizens are asked to compromise their privacy for security, why does privacy appear to be the primary component of attendee security when attendees are engaging in a public capacity?</p>

<p>why have I not seen a single front page post about this conference, which is happening RIGHT NOW, on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> or <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> frontpage?  The existance and transparency of this meeting should really be foundational to the debate which seems so topical- on privacy, democracy and the future of governance.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m just happy that the word is finally getting out. Their cover is completely blown and the battle lines are being drawn. Unfortunately, there will probably be another &quot;event&quot; like 911 that will be their final move. False flag blamed on Vets, bioattack, power grid shutdown, fake alien invasion? Who knows what these fucking psychos are planning. </p>

<p>Make the people that are important in your life aware of the info and news you think is important. Have cash on hand, bullets in your basement, and enough food and water to hold you over a while in case the worst ever came. NEVER get the mandatory shot, NEVER let them take you alive (to the FEMA camp), and NEVER get the Chip. Don&#39;t shoot til you see the whites of their eyes (don&#39;t act until there is absolutely no other choice).</p>

<p>Good luck and God speed brother. Tyranny never lasts. And when the Empire falls and the technology they are hiding is released to the public, that&#39;s when a new Golden Age will begin.</p>

<p>And yes the postal system will still work so you could still order things. I&#39;m basing these assumptions from the Soviet Union collapse. </p>

<p>If there is total societal collapse then guns, food and gold will be the only useful things.</p>

</ul>

<p>SINCE its first meeting 50 years ago, the Bilderberg conference, a secretive gathering of global power brokers, has inspired layer upon layer of conspiracy theories, which it has done little to dispute. Over the years, the deeds laid at the conference&#39;s devious door have included the creation of the European Union, the invasion of Iraq and the bombing of Serbia - all to service its most cherished goal: the creation of a world government.</p>

<p>As glamorous cosmopolitan venues go, Watford, England, belongs at the homely end of the scale. Davos it ain’t. Yet this week the dormitory commuter town just to the north of London’s urban sprawl is playing host to a galaxy of global luminaries gathered for the latest meeting of the secretive Bilderberg Group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems as if there was some acknowledgement of it in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.  The mentions re-emerge a bit with Prince Bernhard&#39;s Lockheed scandal in &#39;76.  Many of your &quot;108 references&quot; are not even referring to the conference, and the majority of those that are, are in the books and week in review editorial sections.  Nothing throughout the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s until the last decade where the focus is mostly on Alex Jones and his band of far right tin foil hatters.</p>

<p>Everything that does mention the conference is just an offhanded reference in the bio of an attendee.  The only piece prior to 2004 which might feature any depth about the conference is the 1977 &quot;Western Policies the Topic At Meeting of Elite&quot;.  I don&#39;t have my Lexis Nexus available right now, but I&#39;d be interested to see what type of expose that is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk to me when CNN, BBC, NYT or any of the media organizations that are supposed to enable transparency between elected governments and their citizens, actually publish a story covering the conference itself (rather than the kooky conspiracy theorists who protest it) and do some investigative journalism and question the politicians who continuously lie about attending these meetings.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not an argument anymore about whether or not it&#39;s a &quot;vast conspiracy&quot;.  It&#39;s proven.  It IS a vast conspiracy.  When people with this type of power meet in secret and discuss policy- it&#39;s news worthy.  There&#39;s no question about that.</p>

How do you make this assumption jump from a ration point of view that people will discuss with others and share what is in their best interests to do so.    It&#39;s no farce to understand a very rational idea about the way humans are; rich and influential will work to maintain/perpetuate  a status quo. Just as any group or organization works to do the same.  You bringing up baby rating is either you being simple or an agent of the devil baby eaters attempting to spread disinformation for newcomers or the less informed trying to get a handle on alt news type of views of the world.

    <div class="md"><p>I have continually repeated the verifiable claim that this conference is not covered and was previously denied by the media.  Your obsessing over the usage of the word &quot;deny&quot;, is an aid in your DENIAL.  Perhaps you are also aggrevated by my generalization of &quot;MSM&quot;.  To deny, doesn&#39;t require a statement of direct refutation, but can refer to willful ignorance or minimisation of the truth</p>

<p>My 6 year measure didn&#39;t account for a Time Magazine article in 2004 and several other articles which mentioned the group that year.  There was also the Jon Ronson hitpiece on conspiracy theorists in 2001.</p>

<p>Kahirsch also informed me of some NYT references which included what appears to be a fairly mainstream acceptance of the meeting during the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, though it doesn&#39;t appear to ever actually be covered by the media- only referred to.  There are even leaked minutes from some of these years available through the wikileaks archive.  In the 70&#39;s, there is less mention of the conference, but there is a times article from 1977 which may be an expose of sorts, Unfortunately I don&#39;t have access to it right now to conclude that is the case.  </p>

<p>In the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, &quot;conspiracy researchers&quot; daniel estulin and jim tucker, tracked and documented the conference.  At this point in time- perhaps due to the nature of the cold war and the conference&#39;s relationship with it, the media, as far as I can tell, did not attempt to cover the conference at all.  It was only in the early 2000&#39;s with the accessibility of information from these &quot;conspiracy researchers&quot; that the media resumed any attention to the conference, and in doing so only focused on the conspiracy theorists rather than the conference itself.  Last year was the first year, I believe, that the BBC actually sent a news team- and that was just to mock alex jones- as ronson did in 2001.</p>

<p>So if you want to continue this non argument, would you please provide evidence of any report a corporate news organization has done on this conference prior to this century?  Otherwise, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re just a troll.</p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot;</p>
