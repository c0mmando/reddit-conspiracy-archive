       I tried to run an internet search but got the same views as I always have, about his ethnic cleansing of Jews, his twisted views in the Mein-Kampf, his belief in the superiority of the Aryan race...

       <em>
        I don't want someone to advocate Hitler as being a good guy or a bad guy. I want an alternative view from the propaganda history we're fed on a daily basis

       Thanks in advance, I'm looking for a different perspective on this matter, not the archetypal view that 'he was an evil overlord with a blood lust for Jews'.

       Hitler was an extraordinary leader. He completely reformed and restored the German economy over the span of only a few years. He took Germany from a pathetic basket case to the strongest industrial nation in Europe. Until the outbreak of WW2, he was acclaimed all over the world by many leading intellectuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe most people today really comprehend the power of negative propaganda. Since the 1930s, even before the outbreak of the War, the Jews ceaselessly attacked and smeared and demonized and mocked and reviled Hitler and the Nazis in the numerous magazines and newspapers they controlled. As the decades rolled on, Jewish control over Western media only became more pervasive, and their demonization of Hitler never stopped. We see it every day even today, seventy years or so later. Every day, on the Internet, on television, in newspapers and magazines, Hitler is presented as (paradoxically) a bumbling clown and a joke, but also as the most dangerous maniac and monster of all human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, it's propaganda. It's black, negative propaganda. Hitler was a man. He wasn't a perfect man, because there are no perfect men. He was a better man than many who have been idolized and exalted by the history books. Look at Stalin. He murdered millions of his own people, and until recently he was good old Uncle Joe in the media, and all the liberal leftist intellectuals loved him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone today who thinks they understand Hitler, be aware that all you think you know about him has been planted in your head by unrelenting media and  school propaganda, every single day of your life. Unless you have deliberately stepped back from the media propaganda, and researched Hitler in alternative history texts -- texts that do not automatically parrot the media propaganda line -- you will have no way to evaluate Hitler the man in any rational or fair manner. You will simple accept the image you have been brainwashed to accept.

       No he was not, but only because no one could be as bad as he has been made out to be. Hitler and the Nazi's are made out to be cartoon level villains. All evil and dark with no redeeming qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is too bad in many ways, it obfuscates the actual truth of what happened and so occludes history. It hides the lessons we could learn from what actually happened that may help us avoid the same pitfalls and finally any kids not too dumb to come in out of the rain see the bullshit and then start thinking, "Maybe Hitler wasn't such a bad guy after all".
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a patriot that tried to fight of the early "proto-NWO" and did a remarkably good job of it. If he hadn't been pushed into war early or Russia had not been willing to hemorrhage Russian lives at the rate they did, Nazi Germany would have probably won that war. I don't know what the world would be like this m any years after, it's been a while and things would have evened out, but since I worship on the altar of liberty the thought of what might have happened is pretty scary.

       You can start by reading Mein-Kampf yourself.  Yes, he is as bad as history says.  Look at the indisputable facts of WWII.  He himself tells the story and see's himself as right.  But the simple reality remains.  He forcefully pushed his way to power, took power, then used that power to build an army and attempt to take over the world.  His own aspirations led to his downfall in Russia.  Russia was already pushed into their own country.  If he didn't want to conquer, that was the perfect place to stop.  But he decided to push.  Same with Great Britain.  He had them pushed into their own Island and made an attempt to take the island.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very very least he was a dictator with designs on global conquest.  There is nothing about a global dictatorship that is worth discussing in a good light.

       What do you mean the indisputable facts of WW2?  You're just echoing the 'official' story as laid out by the victors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also read that Hitler didn't want war at all but Churchill did and the invasion of Poland came about after a massacre of Germans.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also the 1933 declaration of war on Germany by the Jews and plenty of debate regarding whether the holocaust happened at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the kind of alternative version of events I believe the OP was asking for - no matter what you believe.

       I'm sorry, this is BS.  His actions dictate history.  Whats indisputable is he did invade poland, regardless of why.  He did try to invade Russia, regardless of cause.  He was in fact trying to conquer the world by his own military actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, unless your argument is that he didn't actually write Mein Kampf, his very words backup the goals and ideals we believe about him.  He echoed much that we know on this forum now as well, but also believed in using it.  Propaganda winning out over truth.  Propaganda as a weapon to control the masses.  Strength and victory being more important than truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a student of history and greatly resented the outcomes of WWI.  Believe man should mimic nature and be as cruel and uncaring as nature when determining the future of the nation.  Believed in motivating by emotional pulls and suppressing reason for the masses save the few who led.  Believed in violence as one of the only tools to get what you wanted and maintain it.  And believe completely and totally that the totalitarian state was the best course for current and future longevity of a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which part of his own book would you postulate is the alternative version of who he was? Seriously, you cannot read his own words and speeches and not understand that Hitler was absolutely and totally a believer in the absolute power of the state and of its leaders.   And that he believe that the less rulers the better and he believed himself to be one of the few competent rulers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can believe alternate history but you cannot discard who he was by his own words.

       So you're saying invasion even to save his own people is evil - damn, Obama and Bush must be worse than Hitler, they did it for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't read Mein Kampf yet but if he did show a hatred of Jews at that time, maybe it's because he knew they got the US into WW1 in exchange for Palestine as described by Benjamin Freedman

       Invasion to save his own people only becomes valid when A. you don't proceed to take over the entire continent B. you don't display a vivid hatred for the winners of WW1 already  C. you don't show a strong view point of believing you should be ruling the world in your own book.
      </p>

       Said nothing about blaming the Jews.  I'm on the fence about that honestly.  There are significant markers to indicate he blamed the Jews in public as a scape goat but may not have necessarily felt the same privately, which would fit with his political views in Mein Kampf.  Whether that translates to going as far as to pull off the holocaust, or that was used as leverage to say he persecuted and killed Jews, I don't know.  Then there is the evidence for the holocaust itself, which I've seen and read both sides of it.  Very difficult to say for sure but I lean towards it happening based merely on a friends grand parents growing up having the tatoo's.

       Regarding taking over an entire continent, you have to consider that  even if Germany's position was purely defensive, resources were at a premium and the only way to stop an enemy's offence is to defeat them at home, you can't just let their industry continue to pump out the weapons etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know just from recent history that almost anything can be fabricated, I mean what's coming out of the US regarding Ukraine right now is ridiculous, Russia is already believed to be the aggressor and you can be assured that it will go down in the history books that way if this thing escalates.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the bottom line for me is that I don't think he can be judged by his supposed actions without solid evidence. His autobiography might convince me one way or the other though, assuming I don't run into claims that it's not authentic. :/

       Fair point.  But then, if one side says its this way, and another that way, at this point we are merely choosing a side both having evidence that we have to decide which to believe, which would leave history completely up to our individual biases.

       I think its a perfectly fair point to be regarded. Just spewing facts without motivations behind them, but going so deep and all out on his motivations in his book 'mein kampf' is a horribly skewed opinion.

       I'm sitting here, taking my time to write my opinion, based on the books I've read, including the book he wrote himself.  I'm telling you that IMO the history is largely true since his actions and how they are interpreted match up with his philosophy and point of view laid out in Mein Kampf.  Which I have read.  When the interpretation of his actions, matches up with his own personal stated world view, it is hard to conclude that the stated history is in fact wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your response was to tell me I'm just spewing facts without motivation behind them, when in fact I'm doing the precise opposite.  His motivation in Mein Kampf shows a disdain for the European victors of WWI, a belief that he and the Nazi's had a right to rule, and a belief that a totaltarian government, led by him, was beneficial to the world even if they resisted at first.

       What I'm really interested in was who were his backers and who else was working towards the same goals? I've seen is suggested that Hitler was working with the TPTB and I've also seen people suggest the opposite. I have no idea where to even begin figuring this out.

       The Nazi rise to power was funded heavily by U.S.based industrialists, such as Prescott Bush, W's grandfather,through Union Banking Corporation. They were also supported by Henry Ford, and by the Rockefellers, who sold them nerve gas (I believe). Besides the Sutton book, check out "Trading With the Enemy," by Hingham. Also, google the Bush-Nazi connections.

       Possible, though who were the powers that be of the time? I've seen some evidence of him working with the Vatican, though much of that history they have buried.  Which leads us to the main problem.  The greater the distance between now and a previous event, the harder to discern the real truth of it.

       Read a lot already, have a lot on my shelf I haven't gotten to.  I'm a history buff but I'm afraid I don't have as much time as when I was younger and have probably 2 dozen books on my shelf already that I haven't gotten to.  Two are WW2 era books on Hitler and the third Reich.  I'll get to them eventually :)

       Hopefully no one, but I know the memes associated with the "Greatest Story Never Told" documentary, and it's about believing that the Nazis weren't the bad guys of World Wa 2. What we should really understand is that the Nazis, who were above all anti-Communist, were supported in their early days by western industrialists. The goal was to annihilate the Jews and Communists, and that's just what they tried to do.

       If you get the chance, you should consider reading Anthony Sutton's trilogy about Wall Street: "Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler", "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution", and "Wall Street and FDR".

       It all comes back to the Hegelian idea of controlling both sides of a conflict in order to further an ultimate agenda and we've seen it play out time and time again throughout history.

       Yeah, I read it. But I don't think that the Bolshevik Revolution was something that came out in favor of the international elite. I mean, obviously. Somethinglike thirteen capitalist countries all invaded The USSR a couple years after the a revolution. And then we had the Cold War.

       Not been where? I've heard Holocaust revisionism arguments, if that's what you mean. Feel free to elaborate on yours. I think the "conspiracy" that's most important to understand about the era is that the Nazis rose to power with a lot of only from western elites, such as Prescott Bush through Union Banking, and Henry Ford. The Nazis were indeed psychopath mass murdering eugenicists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another fascinating angle is the research of Joseph P. Farrell. He talks about the Nazis developing nuclear technology, which was called "The Bell." Check him out.

       Well the Allied powers got lucky to have Hitler as an opponent for several reasons: one, he got rid of all the German Jewish scientists who were the best in the world; two, he truly believed that his support among Anglo-American prot-fascists (think John-Birch society Red-Bashers) would lead to a peace treaty on favorable terms without Germany having to fight a long war and thus allowed strategic advantages to slip through his fingers after taking France; third, he eventually became so deranged that his refusal to listen to his (very competent) generals led to disaster on the Eastern front which should have been a cake-walk.

       The jews wanted to subjugate the german people by using banking cartels and by owning the biggest enterprises. with the protocols of the elders of scion the jews created a plan to rule all of europe and the world. hitler saw this happening and fought back against it. his methods were very deplorable, but he did have good reason.

       So what you are saying is "Hitler had good reason to hunt an entire religion" because they wanted to "subjugate the german people through banking." First of all germans and jews are not 2 seperate peoples, a person can be both. Also, even if the jews in banking were doing this, which you fail to evidence, how does that make it ok to kill/imprison all jews even those not involved with banking?

       It doesn't - that's where he crossed the line and lost himself, ultimately becoming like what he was originally fighting against.  He was against the central bankers and their allies in the West, though, who used innocent jews as a shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was also, ironically, funded by many of those same western banking interests which muddies the waters even further.

       So, by changing the label it makes it a totally different thing?  No, not so much.  Here is a great video explaining that:

       I was responding to the part of your response that was the same stupid "it's not the same if the letters change" viewpoint that others in this thread have been throwing at me.  As for the Bush cartel bankrolling the Nazis, that is a pretty well known fact.  What I was discussing, which I found fascinating, was the idea that Hitler was actually an American intelligence agent.

       So what's the evidence that Hitler was an American intelligence agent? I know that OSS/CIA- same thing. Did I miss a link? You want to give it to me again? genuinely curious,

       Yeah, sorry about that. I meant reading up on conspiracy/alternative views rather than the ones prevalent in mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've spent the past hour reading up on Che Guevara and how he liked Stalin, Marxism etc. and was wondering about Hitler and his motivations, why he chose to do what he did (if he at all did it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am very much aware that an alternative account might not be too different, but I've adopted a policy of not believing a word I read either 'official' or otherwise till I have researched it myself...hence the cynicism.

       The other thing to keep in mind about Hitler is that genocide was his "final solution," but others were also considered first.  If America had allowed the Jews to come here millions could have been saved.  Later on the Jews in the East of the German held territories were persecuted by the locals even before the Germans arrived so in a way they were just appeasing them.  I don't think this in any way excuses the German monsters, but we should realize that blame is found elsewhere too, another thing to "never forget."

       You all think the jews are horrible and Hitler is so great?

      <p>
       You all know your history? you know Hitler was what he hated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which not only makes him the most evil man in history for what he wanted to do (sorry unless you have blue eyes and blond hair your turn eventually would have come at the gas chambers!) but he's also the biggest hypocrite because he should been one of the first in the gas chambers.

       The really awesome book to read on the subject is "Unholy Alliance" by Peter Levenda. The Nazis has a bizarre new age religion of sorts, that was the backbone of their rise to power. It was influenced by Madame Blavatsky, and Alistair Crowley was a major player, as well. Really worth checking out this book- it's quite a story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically, though, what the Nazis were we're anti-Communists. That's why western industrialists liked them and funded them. Yes, they were just as "evil" as history makes them out to be, but they were also supported by western elites, and their philosophy was intricate and occultist.

       I didn't demand anything, this is a discussion board. I took that part of your comment because that was the part I was interested in finding more about and not only was it the basis of your entire post, but it was said in a way that asserted it as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you can't back up your assertion then that's fine with me, just know that it's very transparent to everyone reading

       You mean the ridiculous assertion you made? Yes a reasonable request would be for you to elucidate. I don't think you post here from motives of actual discussion and give and take though. If you did you would not have such reactions as above.

       I know from our previous exchanges that you are not a reasonable or logical person, so I'm not interested in opening a dialogue with you.

       All I will say is that OP posts in
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">

       So no response to my question, then?  And, thus, no basis for your assertion that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This whole thread is a Hitler apologist circle jerk.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's being posted here that would serve as "evidence of this sub being anti-Semitic"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect I won't get an answer out of you on that either.  You apparently prefer to make baseless accusations and generalizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note for the future: just because you call something "anti-Semitic" or a "Hitler apologist circle jerk" does not make it so - you actually need to have something to base those claims on.  Discussing alternative views of history, many of them written decades ago by legitimate historians (which is all most of us are doing here), does not qualify as either one.

       It doesn't - that's where he crossed the line and lost himself, ultimately becoming like what he was originally fighting against.  He was against the central bankers and their allies in the West, though, who used innocent jews as a shield.

       He was also, ironically, funded by many of those same western banking interests which muddies the waters even further.
