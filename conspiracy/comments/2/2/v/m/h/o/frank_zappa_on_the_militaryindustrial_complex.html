        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I came across this today:</p>

<p>*When a reporter for the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command interviewed Frank Zappa for the Command&#39;s news syndicate, the story was held by a superior who demanded that Zappa - who had been rather hard on the Army - answer just one more question: just who does he think will defend the country without an army?
Zappa&#39;s reply: &quot;From what? The biggest threat to America today is its own federal government... Will the army protect anybody from the FBI? The IRS? The CIA? The Republican party? The Democratic party?...The biggest dangers we face today don&#39;t even need to sneak past our billion-dollar defense system....they issue the contracts for them.&quot;
The interview was not run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worth mentioning that Zappa&#39;s family has extraordinary ties to the Military-Industrial Complex:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that Zappa was, by numerous accounts, a rigidly authoritarian control-freak and a supporter of U.S. military actions in Southeast Asia, it is perhaps not surprising that he would not feel a kinship with the youth movement that he helped nurture. And it is probably safe to say that Frank’s dad also had little regard for the youth culture of the 1960s, given that Francis Zappa was, in case you were wondering, a chemical warfare specialist assigned to – where else? – the Edgewood Arsenal. Edgewood is, of course, the longtime home of America’s chemical warfare program, as well as a facility frequently cited as being deeply enmeshed in MK-ULTRA operations.  Curiously enough, Frank Zappa literally grew up at the Edgewood Arsenal, having lived the first seven years of his life in military housing on the grounds of the facility. The family later moved to Lancaster, California, near Edwards Air Force Base, where Francis Zappa continued to busy himself with doing classified work for the military/intelligence complex. His son, meanwhile, prepped himself to become an icon of the peace &amp; love crowd. Again, nothing unusual about that, I suppose.</p>

<p>Zappa’s manager, by the way, is a shadowy character by the name of Herb Cohen, who had come out to L.A. from the Bronx with his brother Mutt just before the music and club scene began heating up. Cohen, a former U.S. Marine, had spent a few years traveling the world before his arrival on the Laurel Canyon scene. Those travels, curiously, had taken him to the Congo in 1961, at the very time that leftist Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was being tortured and killed by our very own CIA. Not to worry though; according to one of Zappa’s biographers, Cohen wasn’t in the Congo on some kind of nefarious intelligence mission. No, he was there, believe it or not, to supply arms to Lumumba “in defiance of the CIA.” Because, you know, that is the kind of thing that globetrotting ex-Marines did in those days (as we’ll see soon enough when we take a look at another Laurel Canyon luminary).</p>

<p>Making up the other half of Laurel Canyon’s First Family is Frank’s wife, Gail Zappa, known formerly as Adelaide Sloatman. Gail hails from a long line of career Naval officers, including her father, who spent his life working on classified nuclear weapons research for the U.S. Navy. Gail herself had once worked as a secretary for the Office of Naval Research and Development (she also once told an interviewer that she had “heard voices all [her] life”). Many years before their nearly simultaneous arrival in Laurel Canyon, Gail had attended a Naval kindergarten with “Mr. Mojo Risin’” himself, Jim Morrison (it is claimed that, as children, Gail once hit Jim over the head with a hammer). The very same Jim Morrison had later attended the same Alexandria, Virginia high school as two other future Laurel Canyon luminaries – John Phillips and Cass Elliott.</p>

<p>I generally agree with Zappa -- and I have some problems with Dave McGowan&#39;s work -- but McGowan&#39;s research here on Zappa, in context to all the other 1960s luminaries who had ties to the Military-Industrial-Intelligence Complex, is some serious food for thought.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Zappa&#39;s distaste for Reagan &amp; Zappa&#39;s Reagan-era clean-cut rebirth as a TV news guest with testimony before Congress got Frank killed.  But is that because Frank had some deeper information, given his own family&#39;s background?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">3</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/brizzadizza.html">brizzadizza</a> 2014-04-12</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Respectfully, a few things to consider:</p>

<p>1) Laurel Canyon was located in an inexpensive part of Los Angeles that was a short drive to the major music scene of the time, the Sunset Strip. Many musicians would have been drawn to the area due to the cheap rent/homes and the amenable cultural atmosphere. That many musicians lived in the area is no question. That some of these same musicians can be linked to a group of industries that employ a large segment of the population is not surprising, nor does that fact necessarily equate to an intelligence agency agenda.</p>

<p>2) Most military officers throughout the 60s were deployed near constantly. You take a man like Jim Morrison, who was 16 at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and whose father was already deployed, and you realize he hadn&#39;t seen or interacted with his dad for a significant part of his early life (not withstanding the complete break in communication at age 18). Even though his dad was a rear admiral in the navy, it does not mean the Jim Morrison himself had either access or inclination towards the MIC. I consider my own father&#39;s interactions with my grandfather and I am able to imagine a similar dynamic for Jim Morrison; a largely absent father during the pre-adolescent and adolescent period of life. The consequences have been in large measure significant disagreements on all aspects of life between my father and grandfather; political, military, parenting, etc. My father is not closer to the MIC as a consequence of his father&#39;s service (Lieutenant Colonel MC retired).</p>

<p>3) It would behoove any agency interested in demonstrating an expanded sphere of influence to &quot;pad&quot; its actual influence by claiming popular icons after the fact. Doing so enhances the mythos of the &quot;omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent&quot; hidden hand agencies that have been carefully sculpting every major cultural force through the last century. While I will not dismiss the hypothesis outright, I will note that it would be far simpler to have an agent present &quot;research&quot; linking said clandestine agencies to popular counter-culture figures than to have such agencies either accurately predict the popularity of any such figure, or to expend resources sufficient to purchase enough media to make their sons and daughters appear to be counter-cultural icons during and after the time of their tenure. </p>

<p>4) Finally, and admittedly tangential, Frank Zappa wasn&#39;t a hippie. He sold to bikers, free-thinkers, ex-military, and a whole slew of misfits, freaks and weirdos. He wasn&#39;t setting himself up for success in the peace and love crowd. He didn&#39;t do drugs. He never, to my knowledge, said anything supportive of the hippie movement. He seems to have had a legitimate antipathy to hippies and the peace movement in general. His objections to conservative figureheads of the eras of which he was a part could have absolutely been directed at their normative stances in morality, art, and culture. Stances that Zappa, being an iconoclast, would not support.</p>

<p>There is another researcher similar to Dave McGowan that made statements linking McKenna to the CIA through the Esalen Institute and via an out of context quote. My criticisms above apply in equal measure to that researcher as well. In all cases, psyops 101 says &quot;make them think you&#39;re a god&quot;. Any means that lead us to believe that the capabilities of militarized intelligence agencies are greater than they actually are is a huge win for intelligence agencies employing psyop tactics. The &#39;real&#39; reality could very well be that there are 400 million americans right now and no single entity has the slightest clue how to control them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Esalen and many of the New Age cults were most likely linked to intelligence.  When there&#39;s smoke there is usually fire.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Conversely, certain entities could have figured out how to very efficient control 400 million people after about a century of practice.  </p>

<p>Controlling the media, entertainment, academia, and politicians might be more effective and easier than one thinks.  And part of the way this could happen is to convince people that it&#39;s a difficult task so they don&#39;t realize entire industries, like popular music, are controlled.</p>

<p>What are the odds that so many musical stars in the 60s came from military families or served themselves?  Jimmy Hendrix.  Jerry Garcia.  Jim Morrison.  And let&#39;s not forget how important Jim Morrison&#39;s father was.  He was no random officer.  And Garcia and Hendrix left the military under suspicious circumstances . . . like they were given shitty cover stories for why they got out of the military.  </p>

<p>Also, Zappa&#39;s hostility to hippies was part of the mindfuck.  Seems to be a common tactic with the Psy Ops of the 60s and 70s.  Some of the Large Group Awareness Training seminars at Esalen would use the &#39;hot seat&#39; tactic of basically humiliating people and Zappa&#39;s condemnation of his audience is similar.  </p>

<p>I give credence to many theories from that day and age (mckenna comes to mind) but ulitmately you cant deny that the CIA had its tentacles in a lot of seminal thinkers back in the 60s..</p>
