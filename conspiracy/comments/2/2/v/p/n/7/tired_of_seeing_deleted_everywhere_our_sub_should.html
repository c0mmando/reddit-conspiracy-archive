    <div class="md"><p>Definitely good practice for the shilliest comments.  Some other reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The pigs can also edit their comments after the fact to make it look like you are saying something irrelevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Obama shills used to do this shit where they&#39;d say something butt-stupid, then clean it up after you replied, then say &quot;Y U mad, bro?&quot;  So yeah, quote content and user.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps you go back through your history and find out what slime you were responding to months ago.  Shills often delete their accounts after they reach a critical mass of stupidity.</p></li>
<li><p>Shills often repeat themselves.  I used to collect some common talking points over at <a href="/r/talkingpointstalk">/r/talkingpointstalk</a>.  Lots of repeated talking points if you watch for them, and it looks bad when you catch them.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the shills run &quot;clean up&quot; operations for their overlords.  Over on Democratic Underground, for example, they would let a thread go for a bit, then overnight delete all the subthreads where they got spanked.  The thread has died down, so people don&#39;t really notice, but the overlord gets a nice report afterward.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone mentioned once that shills get in trouble if too many of their accounts are deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand by what you say, or apologize and move on.  Who are you trying to impress, anyway?</p></li>
</ul>

If they want to retract something, they should retract it publicly, not just delete it and expect that no one else will react or oppose them. Words have meaning to those of us who lead with our intellects. I stand by every single word I gave said, and am proud that I have left it all out there for anyone to see.
