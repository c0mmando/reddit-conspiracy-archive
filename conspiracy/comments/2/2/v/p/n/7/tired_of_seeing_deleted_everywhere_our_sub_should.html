       Definitely good practice for the shilliest comments.  Some other reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The pigs can also edit their comments after the fact to make it look like you are saying something irrelevant.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Obama shills used to do this shit where they'd say something butt-stupid, then clean it up after you replied, then say "Y U mad, bro?"  So yeah, quote content and user.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It helps you go back through your history and find out what slime you were responding to months ago.  Shills often delete their accounts after they reach a critical mass of stupidity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shills often repeat themselves.  I used to collect some common talking points over at
         <a href="/r/talkingpointstalk">
          /r/talkingpointstalk
         </a>
         .  Lots of repeated talking points if you watch for them, and it looks bad when you catch them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think the shills run "clean up" operations for their overlords.  Over on Democratic Underground, for example, they would let a thread go for a bit, then overnight delete all the subthreads where they got spanked.  The thread has died down, so people don't really notice, but the overlord gets a nice report afterward.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Someone mentioned once that shills get in trouble if too many of their accounts are deleted.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stand by what you say, or apologize and move on.  Who are you trying to impress, anyway?
        </p>

       I'm working on year badge six. I have only one account at all times. And I stand by what I say. Everyone else should, too. If they want to retract something, they should retract it publicly, not just delete it and expect that no one else will react or oppose them. Words have meaning to those of us who lead with our intellects. I stand by every single word I gave said, and am proud that I have left it all out there for anyone to see. If they can't stand by their words, then frankly, they shouldn't be standing at all.

       I mean, I might occasionally say something accidental that I want to delete.  Maybe once a year.  People may be drunk or high or something.  But I don't mind being called out on something dumb I say, and it's not the drunk high people posting stuff like "You're helping the terrorists win when you vote third party because we'd be living in paradise now if Ralph Nader hadn't destroyed America and allowed Iran to cross the red line when the government was just trying to protect our freedom by gathering all that information and waterboarding is legally recognized as coercion, not torture.  Also, bananas are worse than all the nuclear waste in the world."

       Yeah. I mean, absolutely, I don't want to go after someone. I want intelligent discourse. But it's like poker. My money is on the table. I just feel that theirs should be, too.

       Yeah, the problem is that the shills are trying to BLOCK intelligent discourse.  They insert talking points, mislead, misdirect, create long distracting chains of useless tangential comments, and then delete all the sketchiest stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       User-quoting is not something I normally do, but I ask myself if a given comment is likely to be deleted because it was so blatant.

       Oh, so exposing lies (as in, [Mr_Shill: I never said that]) is "considered harassment"?
       <em>
        By whom
       </em>
       ? I don't see [M] or [Admin] next to
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       name, as you
       <em>
        warn
       </em>
       others.
      </p>
      <p>
       How often will be "considered"
       <em>
        persistent
       </em>
       , Mr. Officer Sir? Once a week? Daily? How about "as often as they lie and then delete their lies"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd go even farther; hard-code "change bars" into the comment editing process, instead of just displaying the "edited" product. Show what was there before.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for (boo hoo!) "shoving things they don't want seen into the public eye", you're forgetting
       <em>
        who put it there in the first place
       </em>
       . "They" should have thought about it beforehand.

       You sound like you have a problem with this.  We're not talking about hunting witches.  We're talking about hunting pigs.  Witches are witches, shills are treasonous, inbred pigs.
