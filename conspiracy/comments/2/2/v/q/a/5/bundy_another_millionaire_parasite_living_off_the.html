      <p>
       And I'm supposed to support his sorry ass?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got big problems with the US federal government. The Supreme Court is illegitimate. Half their members should be in jail and the rest installed by senators and presidents who should be in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every president for the last 40 years should have been impeached and imprisoned for various crimes against the people, the state, and nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature, state and federal is no better. They are almost all owned by someone and it's not we the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our entire political system is so corrupt that I can see hardly anything born of it that is worth keeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constitutional convention is overdue. And a constitutional amendment to finally, and for good, illegalize the bribery that is campaign contributions. This is the root of all corruption, and nothing will be improved until this is remedied.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as bad as the federal government is, I strongly support the Constitution of the United States. And I believe that to fix this country, we have to do so the framework it provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cliven Bundy has had his day in court. Many many times. He is not one of the powerless, the overworked, well trodden who are most abused by the corruption of the corporate state.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a rich, trust fund brat, an inherited member of the 1%, with powerful friends like the Republican governor of Nevada, and he just doesn't want to pay for the gift that is the land he's using to make money off of. His family has been squatting on public property for over a century, and he thinks he's entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
       But under his law of entitlement, we are all entitled aren't we? Who gave Cliven Bundy the sole right to use and exploit public property? Where can I get my ranch?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the same corrupt system that  gave John Rockefeller and all the other oil barons the "right" to steal liquid gold right from under our feet, and horde it and the money it gave for their own purposes. Purposes like buying our politicians and using them to create things like the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like r/conspiracy suddenly losing its mind and rallying around John Rockefeller IV because the federal government wants him to pay back some of the money the taxpayers gave him to bail out his banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The enemy of your enemy is not your friend. Cliven Bundy should be in jail, right along with the attorney general. Let them have at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We, on the other hand, should be supporting real people who really need it. Not rich, rightwing assholes who think they're entitled to what you or I would have to work for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you hate the very idea of the federal government, then you should fuck on off to another country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Founders fought and died to give us this system of government and the Constitution that defines it. Wanting to fix it is one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanting to overthrow it makes you nothing more than a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that what r/conspiracy is the home to now? Traitors?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who hate, not only what the plutocracy has done to our government, but the very nature of that government itself? The very ideals that our Founders fought and died for? Or is this Bundy insanity a clever psyop to get everyone to support a bunch of millionaires?

       Nowhere, but "1%er" is one of those catchy terms that people like to throw around these days because it's so powerful.

       The idea that some dusty rancher in Nevada is a member of the 1% (like George Soros) is fucking laughable.

       I agree with some of what you say, but the longer you rant, the crazier you become.

       Can you explain to me how you can say:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "The Supreme Court is illegitimate."
       </li>
       <li>
        "Every president for the last 40 years should have been impeached and imprisoned for various crimes.."

       <li>
        "The legislature, state and federal is no better. They are almost all owned by someone and it's not we the people."
       </li>
       <li>
        "Our entire political system is so corrupt.."
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And then say:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "Cliven Bundy has had his day in court. Many many times."
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       How does this make sense? You think he happened upon only the uncorrupted judges and courts across our land?

       Hear hear, I'm glad you wrote what you did, there's no need for the hate you're getting, but I don't agree with you completely.  Yes, the rich do buy the government to use against us through elections, but that's not the only way.  As the rich have the government in their pocket along with that comes the federal agencies, the BLM being just one.
      </p>

       Bundy is a jerk and should be paying to use the public land, but if you think that's all this is about you are mistaken.
       <strong>
        The government wouldn't pay all this expense to recover grazing fees
       </strong>
       ,
       <em>
        there's more value to that land than just letting cows eat it!
       </em>
       Whether they're gonna build a mall, install solar panels or frack it, the government is gonna make some money for the private interests that provide the most money.  Bundy &lt; whoever paid for this to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on this sub, and in wider American society do not believe that this is right just as you feel about how elections are bought.  Bundy may not be paying his fee; while the government,
       <em>
        which is suppose to represent us
       </em>
       , is stealing land to commit those crimes against nature that you speak of.  Bundy as an individual is a douche, but that shouldn't matter if justice was truly blind!

       Look how many agents are there, and think how much that costs, subtract from what they'll get and its obviously not worth it.
       <br/>
       And if you're open to evidence I suggest you browse this sub more widely than just to share your opinion, lots of good posts linking harry reid to this and the installation of solar panels and fracking in the area.  Id link myself but on my phone.  Just read new and go back a few pages, this is a recent story, won't have to go back far.

       They also don't appear out of thin air,  lots of costs in moving people around.  And even if the agents weren't hired especially for this job their salaries would of course have to be considered in an cost-benefit analysis.  Do you believe they work for free?

       That's my point, they don't work for free and they don't just get hired to go to this guy's ranch. They're based out of Vegas, so yeah, I guess cost of fuel for their suburbans should be analyzed /s

      <blockquote>

       You do know what a crime against nature is? So for 40 years presidents have been having sex with animals?

      <p>
       You're likely to get little support for your view that this was a rich guy keeping his and using others, which would be a very fair assessment. 
The government is always wrong no matter what.

       LOL&gt; Actually, I had no idea. I just looked it up and confirmed that, yes, I just accused every president since Carter of having sex with animals.

       No, actually what I MEANT though was crimes against the environment - like dumping millions of gallons of Corexit to cover up how much oil Exxon spilled into the Gulf.

       Thank you, sometimes they government is wrong. But obviously never heard the stories of 'Chicken Little' or the 'Boy who cried wolf' or learned the moral behind them.

       In the case of Bundy the government was right, but everyone got all up in arms because of his claims. Which shows how much truth is respected over "what I KNOW" that government is some nefarious organization.

       I know right, it's like instead of accepting there are already plenty of reasons to dislike the feds conspiracy theorists are always waiting for the next big one. Instead of taking action they talk of it and dislike it, get discouraged and frustrated then have no other option but to be angry at themselves for inaction. Depressing.
