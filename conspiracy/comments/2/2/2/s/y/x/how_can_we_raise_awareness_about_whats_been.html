       Based on my experience, most of Reddit doesn't really care of our existence. It's just a small group, some of whose members have vested interests elsewhere. I think it's that group that makes things difficult in this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of it is through automation: bots that downvote within seconds of posting something, another bot cross-posting everything to conspiratard (yet that's allegedly not vote brigading)... as for downvoting of individual comments, I have no idea if actual people are doing it or what. Some of my most innocuous comments get downvoted just because they appear in this subreddit. No clue who or what is pressing the downvote button there.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I'm fine with disagreement. I welcome it, actually, because then we may learn something new or uncover a different side to a story. Outright vitriol and cascading downvotes with no explanation is what I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, fixing the problem is tough. Mods have a hard enough time doing daily sweeping of trolls and banning people who create an account just to post something stupid here.

       What constitutes harassment?
      </p>
      <p>
       You acknowledge that "most of reddit disagrees" so is it surprising that people come here and disagree?
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of comments still seem to be generally "pro-conspiracy" and dissenting voices are frequently heavily downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just don't understand the problem. Do you want to be open to those with different ideas, or not? If you are then it's also likely that they'll bring downvotes and sometimes ridicule. The same seems to be true of any controversial sub.

       And why shouldn't conspiracy theories be downvoted here? A huge number aren't, and beyond that - people have different ideas about stuff. There's no uniform consensus here, even among those more into conspiracy theories.

       ...but aren't you doing the same thing? This is the second post I've seen from you that tries to spread paranoia of the sub being infiltrated and spammed with disinformation. Neither of your two posts that I've seen have contained any links to submissions that fall under this perception you have of what's happening here.

       Is it not possible to believe you're trying to poison the well? I'm not accusing you of anything, but it seems suspicious to make two posts both within the last four hours that are aimed at making people be distrustful of submissions and users here.
