<p>Possibly the most shocking revelation was made on February 24, 2014. Internal documents show that the security state is attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with “extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction.” The documents revealed a top-secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Unit, or JTRIG. Two of the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in an effort to discredit a target, and to use social sciences such as psychology to manipulate online discourse and activism in order to generate a desirable outcome. The unit posts false information on the internet and falsely attributes it to someone else, pretend to be a &#39;victim&#39; of a target they want to discredit, and posts negative information on various forums. In some instances, to discredit a target, JTRIG sends out &#39;false flag&#39; emails to family and friends. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yzpKDPH.png">A revealing slide from the JTRIG presentation.</a></p>

<p>Read the whole JTRIG presentation by Greenwald, just do it. <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">Here</a></p>

<p>Now, consider the words of former NSA employee turned whistleblower Russ Tice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Okay. They went after–and I know this because I had my hands literally on the paperwork for these sort of things–they went after high-ranking military officers; they went after members of Congress, both Senate and the House, especially on the intelligence committees and on the armed services committees and some of the–and judicial.</p>

<p>But they went after other ones, too. They went after lawyers and law firms. All kinds of–heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the Supreme Court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after State Department officials.</p>

<p>They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House–their own people. They went after antiwar groups. They went after U.S. international–U.S. companies that that do international business, you know, business around the world. They went after U.S. banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs that–like the Red Cross, people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few antiwar civil rights groups.</p>

<p>So, you know, don’t tell me that there’s no abuse, because I’ve had this stuff in my hand and looked at it. And in some cases, I literally was involved in the technology that was going after this stuff. And you know, when I said to [former MSNBC show host Keith] Olbermann, I said, my particular thing is high tech and you know, what’s going on is the other thing, which is the dragnet. The dragnet is what Mark Klein is talking about, the terrestrial dragnet. Well my specialty is outer space. I deal with satellites, and everything that goes in and out of space. I did my spying via space. So that’s how I found out about this... And remember we talked about that before, that I was worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on.</p>

<p>Now here’s the big one. I haven’t given you any names. This was is summer of 2004. One of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with, with a 40-something-year-old wannabe senator from Illinois. You wouldn’t happen to know where that guy lives right now, would you? It’s a big white house in Washington, DC. That’s who they went after. And that’s the president of the United States now.” Russ Tice, NSA Whistleblower</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres nothing here about How TOR is a fucking joke (foxacid, quantum, etc)</p>

<p>There are still thousands of fuckwits on the internet that claim to be &quot;Tech-Gurus&quot; while still telling people to use TOR, the info on said is probably the most valuable thing to come from snowden so far.</p>

<p>most of these sources link to mainstream presstitute pages like the washington post, etc</p>

<p>theres nothing here about PGP, and the very high probability that it is compromised.</p>

<p>Overall I get the feeling that these &quot;sources&quot; barely understand the info they are passing off as &quot;leaks&quot;, and to be honest all we have really seen from snowdens Gatekeepers is powerpoints.</p>

<p>I guess we can safely assume that just about all electronic communications are compromised, but I cant shake the feeling that this is precisely the narrative we are supposed to believe/get used to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but notice how Snowden hasn&#39;t released any information about on the ground surveillance in America. He hasn&#39;t expanded on anything in that topic, such as Neural Surveillance.

    <div class="md"><p>Not for nothing but I do find it a little strange how even the suggestion that Snowden <em>could</em> be a &quot;limited hangout&quot; or part of a larger psy-op gets downvoted to oblivion and ridiculed, even on this sub which is supposed to be open-minded when discussing possibilities/theories/speculations.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I&#39;m still on the fence about the whole thing.  I believe that there is more to the &quot;leaks&quot; than meets the eye, whether Snowden is &quot;in on it&quot; or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very much in agreement. The way Greenwald coordinated with Snowden to have a slow release that timed oh so perfectly with Greenwald getting billionaire money and a new website is extremely questionable to me.</p>

<p>I am still very appreciative of what has been leaked, even if much of it was stuff that people here and in other places have discussed for many years. Having it out in the open has been helpful.</p>

<p>But it feels very incomplete and contrived (in my opinion). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just giving my opinion - I don&#39;t really give a shit about downvotes.  And I wasn&#39;t really making any assertions aside from believing that there&#39;s more to the leaks than meets the eye.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of people who have expressed similar concerns and outlined their reasons for them, I&#39;m sure you can find them if you care to look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t <a href="/r/factbasedassertions">/r/factbasedassertions</a>   this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If we were here to discuss only fact based assertions then where is the conspiracy? I agree we should not just make outlandish claims about things but what is so outlandish about stating that snowden may be part of the conspiracy to disinform? Seems plausible to me and plausible is all it takes to form a conspiracy theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think Snowden may be part of this JTRIG operation. If so, most people are falling hook line and sinker. If I was going to risk my life in any way and leak documents the government didn&#39;t want leaked, I would leak the most incriminating and shocking shit right off the bat and just dump ALL the rest with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree, but I&#39;d counter that with before Snowden, most people thought such claims were tin foil hat crazy. I don&#39;t have any numbers to back that up - it&#39;s just based on personal experience. Your mileage may vary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea who would be behind it and also think we should be hesitant to make claims. It&#39;s obviously an extremely covert propaganda campaign so we&#39;d be dealing with enough smokescreen and mirrors to fool the population of the world. </p>

<p>I have a lot of reasons to be suspicious, but one of them is that he states his motivation, but doesn&#39;t have an actual statement as to why this stuff is happening. For example: &quot;america you are becoming a surveillance police state&quot;</p>
