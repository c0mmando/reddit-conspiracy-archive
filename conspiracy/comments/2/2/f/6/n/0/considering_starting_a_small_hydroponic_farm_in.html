       Dearest bro,
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to start farming then hydroponics is NOT the way to begin.  I would recommend trying your hand at growing your tomatoes in a bucket.  You can even build a really cheap greenhouse (small) out of PVC pipe and pallet wrap.  Truth be told those darn sodium bulbs drink a lot of energy so unless you have enough land for a solar farm, you're going to have a large light bill.  And if you do have enough land for a solar farm, forget the solar cells and just plant tomatoes!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are scenarios where hydroponics are worth the power needs but they are few are far between.  Look up aquaponics and consider building a greenhouse.   That huge ball of fire in the sky is free.

       See, that's the thing, I have a room that I'm not using and could be made into an indoor greenhouse, but it's got only one, small window that can't do any good than as an outgoing fan.  I'm going to need lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things I'm also going to experiment with is the use of Ormus with plants.  It's basically salt at a monotonic level to enhance it's natural electric charge to, hopefully, promote a larger, healthier, and tastier yield.

       I knew a guy who's gutters were so clogged that he (for some stupid reason) decided to grow hot banana peppers... in his gutters.  I think there were maple trees already growing or something that gave him the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways he pulled the trees and planted his banana peppers and they did really hilariously well.   Fortunately he had a 1 story rancher house because he fell off his roof while playing with his pepper plants and broke his wrist.

       I think the cape might help.

       First, whether or not you get raided is going to depend on how your local law enforcement deals with illegal growers.  If they raid you once and find nothing but tomatoes, then chances are they won't return (not worth their time or a law suit).  Should they raid you, they will probably compensate you for any damage done to your property.  I couldn't tell you what your legal options are because I'm not an attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, someone mentioned the cost of electricity making this venture untenable.  You can reduce that by going with LED grow lights instead of halogen or florescent.  You're still looking at a decent start-up cost for all the equipment (lights, trays, water line, soil, seeds, etc.), so make sure to do your research well
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       setting up.  And don't half-ass any part of it, the resulting property damage if you do could leave you homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, contrary to what some may say, you can turn a profit (depending on the size of your grow room and the yield of your produce) if you sell off season organic produce to vendors who want it (restaurants are best).  You may not get rich but it should pay for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised in Humboldt county California and have been involved in indoor grows before.  Quick story: I have a friend who was growing MJ in a decently sized indoor op for several years.  A little under ten years ago he realized he could make more money selling out of season, organic produce (especially cooking herbs) to restaurants.  So he converted his op to growing edible produce.  3 Months later Humboldt County Sheriffs raided his house thinking there was MJ cultivation going on.  He let them kick in his front door and the door to his greenhouse and he said the look on their faces upon finding an herb garden and tomatoes was priceless! They compensated him for the damage to his property (he owns his house) and have never been back since.  He has thought about growing MJ again but says he's making more with vegetables than he ever did with pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some food for thought.  If you need any advice on your grow, let me know.  I'm more than happy to lend whatever help I can.  Take care!

       Thanks, man.  All that makes sense.  I'm hoping it's possible to turn a 1-bedroom apartment into a studio with a grow-room that not only pays for itself, but helps out even more.

       It's possible.  One thing I forgot to mention was drainage in that room.  Be very careful, worst case the water damage rots away the structure (either through straight water damage or by bringing wood eating bugs in) and you fall through.  Best case, you lose some of your deposit and your land lord has to replace some sheet-rock.  Look into what plants are and are not water hogs, that should help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck!

       Maybe after filing expensive lawsuits and having all your grow equipment, weapons and cash confiscated. Years later you MIGHT get an apology and a small settlement. Your buddy was in Humboldt, where MJ has been a cash crop for generations and people are different about it.

       That is why I said this.  Mind you the law enforcement that raided my friend found no illicit substances and therefor had no legal standing for taking
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       he owned.  I would agree with you if one were caught growing MJ, but if not, law enforcement has no legal standing.  So, without MJ cultivation happening, the compensation is far quicker than years.

       Pay secondhand, i.e. not direct from your bank account atm, cash for the equipment, give a real false name and address, wear a baseballhat and sunglasses, look down as you drive to and enter and leave the shop, borrow someone else's car for the deed, burn the packaging and receipts, do not carry your mobile phone or rfid bank or id cards for any of the trip/s, if you need to ring the store block one nostril to subtly change your voice, smile a lot, face recognition has a hard time with it, get solar power to minimise electricity bill, insulate the room so it doesn't show on thermal imaging flybys. Your only growing veg so no need for odor defences.

       I understand this, but why dump your phone, id cards, bank cards and so forth?  Chances are they aren't watching these places like a hawk (and if they are, go to the specialty places as little as possible).  Thermal fly-bys are expensive, so they aren't doing it all the time.  No one from the government is going through the trash so burning receipts is silly.  I agree about the cash aspect but that is mainly because I believe credit is a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, everything you have suggested advertises possible nefarious acts and is exactly the kind of behavior law enforcement looks for.  Best advice is don't look nervous or sketchy, pay in cash, and just plain don't advertise.

       You doing this as a business?  Get that part in line.  I seriously doubt anyone will be knocking on your door unless you are buying tens of thousands worth of equipment.  Either way, find out how to get in touch with the ACLU as well, I guess.

       I am not sure you can grow tomatoes under lights economically unless electricicity is extremely cheap. Nice hobby though and youll know whrre your food come.
