       Whether you're a hardcore materialist skeptic or a New Age crystal-hugger isn't relevant to the following. What I present here is a concise timeline of what the American government has found fit to investigate concerning psychic or psi phenomena over the past several decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picture, if you will: the Cold War was in full bloom, and rumors were flying that the Soviets were developing psychic super spies. Even if it seemed far-fetched, there was no way that the CIA was going to risk falling behind in such a potentially revolutionary field of warfare, so millions of dollars were soon funneled into American research into the murky beyond. Prominent figures involved in this endeavor eventually became linked with other major areas of suspected conspiracies from JFK to UFOs to 9/11. And while you might expect something like this to involve dry clinical studies where people in lab coats monitor the efforts of supposed psychics to guess cards, it also involved much more bizarre activities. It would make a highly improbably sci-fi horror movie, but on the contrary, it is the actual dark underbelly of American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       1948 -
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrija_Puharich">
        Andrija Puharich
       </a>
       creates the Round Table Foundation to study paranormal phenomenon. Puharich is a medical doctor and army officer who will go on to help with mind control experiments like
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkultra">
        MKULTRA
       </a>
       and remote viewing projects like
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkultra">
        Stargate
       </a>
       . The Foundation itself is notable for its influence on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age">
        New Age
       </a>
       movement, science fiction, and popular culture. One woman connected with the group,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age">
        Ruth Paine
       </a>
       , will secure a job at a certain book depository for a young man named
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald">
        Lee Harvey Oswald
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       1952 - Andrija Puharich's Round Table Foundation welcomes a channeler named Dr. D. G. Vinod. Vinod relays a series of messages he claims are from
       <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/council_of_nine_fortean.htm">
        "The Council of Nine,"
       </a>
       a group of aliens once worshiped as the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennead">
        Great Ennead
       </a>
       of Ancient Egypt. Puharich and his group take the claims so seriously that they start a new institute called Lab 9 devoted to the teachings of the Council. Among those with whom they discuss these ideas is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry">
        Gene Roddenberry
       </a>
       , along with other writers who work on the show. Numerous episodes of the show will focus on interactions with discarnate, god-like alien entities, most notably in the later spin-off series

        Human Potential Movement
       </a>
       . It will have a significant impact on the New Age movement. For a few years it is highly influenced by Andrija Puharich's Lab 9 cult/government experiment, going so far as to list the Council of Nine on its board of directors.
      </p>

       1975 - The CIA and military intelligence begin the Stargate Project to conduct experiments in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing">

       , as well as Andrija Puharich. Puharich, as mentioned, is a primary figure in a UFO cult which believes it is in touch with The Nine, a group of aliens once worshiped as gods in Ancient Egypt. Perhaps not coincidentally, a film called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate">
        Stargate
       </a>
       will be released in 1994, a year before the Stargate Project officially ends. The plot of the film centers around aliens who were worshiped as gods in Ancient Egypt.

       It should be noted that the NSA and INSCOM supposedly ran similar operations codenamed

       . Puharich flees to Mexico, fearing that the CIA has turned on him.
      </p>

       1989 - Major General Albert Stubblebine and others involved in running government psychic experiments launch a company called
       <a href="http://www.psitech.net/">
        Psi-Tech
       </a>
       , which offers remote viewing services to the private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the high strangeness doesn't stop there. Here's another bizarre series of psi-related events running parallel to the ones described above:

        Heaven's Gate
       </a>
       cult. They will gain scores of followers in the coming years, and decades later will come to the nation's attention following a mass suicide motivated by a belief in salvation via extraterrestrials.
      </p>
      <p>
       1997 - Thousands of people witness
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Lights">
        formations of lights and massive, chevron-shaped craft
       </a>
       soaring silently over parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Shortly afterwards, Arizona Governor
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife_Symington">
        Fife Symington
       </a>
       holds a press conference in which he announced that they have found the culprit and brings one of his staff on stage wearing an alien costume. Later Symington will admit to having seen "otherworldly" craft himself and explain that he held the tongue-in-cheek press event merely to diffuse public tensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       1997 - The Heaven's Gate cult commits mass suicide in hopes of salvation via a UFO supposedly hiding behind the Hale-Bopp comet. The presence of this supposed UFO had just been
       <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/art_bell_heavenrsquos_gate_and_journalistic_integrity/">
        announced
       </a>
       on the Coast to Coast radio show by
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Brown_%28researcher%29">
        Courtney Brown
       </a>
       , a Ph.D. professor at Emory University, and self-professed psychic who had worked on the Stargate Project, a government-sponsored remote viewing program. In a further twist, the cult had been renting their mansion from

       , an FBI informant involved in secretly and illegally infiltrating Middle Easterners into the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more, because I promised a strange link to 9/11:
      </p>
      <p>
       1978 - Army Colonel
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Channon">
        Jim Channon
       </a>
       publishes a manual for creating psychic super soldiers based on New Age principles. He begins recruiting soldiers into a unit which he names the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Earth_Battalion">
        First Earth Battalion
       </a>
       . A member of the Battalion named Bert Rodriguez will go on to teach hand-to-hand combat skills to alleged 9/11 hijacker
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziad_Jarrah">
        Ziad Jarrah
       </a>
       . Much more could be said about the oddness of Ziad Jarrah, but that's a story for another time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final thoughts: What exactly all of this adds up to is a matter for debate and speculation. The official story is that all of this research into psychic phenomena amounted to nothing; it was a waste of time. Some documents from these programs seem to tell a slightly different story: psi effects ARE real, but not reliable enough for actual intelligence application. Some will insist that these documents are a limited hangout, and that government agencies really did discover the secrets of unlocking the psychic potential of humans and are using it regularly for black ops of various descriptions. There's no hard evidence to back up this claim, however, and independent psi researchers have never had much to show for their efforts either. If nothing else, however, this history provides an interesting look into the mindset certain persons in the intelligence world, who are willing to probe any dark corner for an advantage, no matter what occult forces, alien gods, or other unsavory realities might be uncovered there.
      </p>

       And now, if I might be allowed the slightest bit of self-promotion, I've been compiling a lot more info like this at
       <a href="http://www.deephistory.us/">
        deephistory.us
       </a>
       . I promise that there are no ads, and I'm not selling anything, it's just my personal effort to assemble a timeline of the crimes, conspiracies, and cover-ups that have shaped modern American history. It's still a work in progress, but I'd be happy to hear your feedback. Thanks for reading!

       Great post.
I'm just reading this lnk now and it's all based on stuff directly out of the CIA documents released in the 70s. Despite the redactions the content is absolutely shocking. This official documentation exists and yet if you mention manchurian candidate, hypnosis or mind control to anyone they will laugh at you like you're a loon.

       Absolutely. Some of this stuff is just too bizarre for many people to entertain as a possibility, even if we can prove it with black and white documentation. "The eyes cannot perceive what the mind cannot conceive," as they say.

       I'm not sold on that statement, but nor will I dismiss it outright. Since you've presumably done some research to come to that point of view, I'd like to ask: how does one go about doing this?

       Strange psychic stuff happens to me everyday. Once you become aware of what it is, and why it occurs, it will happen more and more often.
Think of your brain like a computer and information, themes and ideas (communication) are like programs that you download in order to run hard or software (perception).

       I appreciate you posting your info about the government and their involvement with psychic testing and energy.

       I don't have much to add besides this, since you mentioned Michael Aquino and his links to this type of research:

       I believe that ELF/ULF research is intimately related with the things you've outlined in this post.  I made a post about it a couple days ago that didn't get much traction but

       Thanks for all the links. Aquino is certainly a fascinating character. He's also been implicated in elite pedo rings, but the actual evidence for it is sketchy. Re: ELF/ULF stuff, I have no doubt that government agencies tried all sorts of high-tech methods for boosting psychic powers that the ordinary civilian researcher just doesn't have access to (unless they're very smart and have a lot of money). I recall one story about putting a remote viewer inside a Faraday cage and how that supposedly yielded better results. Once you start getting into the MKULTRA stuff, there's a lot of other bizarre and disturbing things which could be included, but I wanted to keep this post more focused since it's pretty long already. One item I'll add in this footnote of a comment is this (since it relates to the New Age stuff mentioned above):

       Makes one wonder how much of the "channeling" or "religious visions" or "voices in the head" that people report are really completely man-made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Son of Sam and Mark David Chapman (among many others) reported hearing voices in their heads that compelled them to commit their murders.

       Agreed. Some people were just born with faulty wiring, but given the

        documented widespread human experimentation

       Some of the people mentioned, such as Andrija Pujarich and Ingo Swann have written books themselves. I just took a glance at Swann's wiki page and noticed a couple of citations which you might look into:
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading the Enemy's Mind: Inside Star Gate, America's Psychic Espionage Program by Paul H. Smith, Tom Doherty Associates, 2005
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Marrs (August 2008). Psi Spies: The True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't read either of those myself, so I can't vouch for them. I have read Peter Levenda's "Sinister Forces," which goes into some of this stuff, especially events surrounding The Nine. Levenda is an occultist himself with a potentially trickstery agenda of his own, so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. "A Terrible Mistake" by H. P. Albarelli doesn't cover psi stuff in particular, but otherwise exhaustively details CIA Cold War human experimentation, with TONS of citations and references. "The Franklin Scandal" by Nick Bryant is also excellent, and although it doesn't directly deal with psi stuff, it does give some tantalizing glimpses into spook involvement with cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helps!

       Absolutely. Some of this stuff is just too bizarre for many people to entertain as a possibility, even if we can prove it with black and white documentation. "The eyes cannot perceive what the mind cannot conceive," as they say.
