In the CNN article, it stated Specialist Ivan Lopez purchased a 45 handgun and went back on base to start shooting. What was wrong with his assigned sidearm? Or any firearm that&#39;s available? Seems like they want to strike home a combination of mental illness and gun purchases. Next anyone with any kind of suspect mental illness will no longer be allowed to purchase a firearm. On a side note, even though they state he was being diagnosed for depression and anxiety, there is not one mention of the medication he was on</p>

<p>What was wrong with his assigned sidearm? Or any firearm that&#39;s available?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/04/02/here-are-the-rules-on-carrying-firearms-on-fort-hood/">No weapons allowed, and personal weapons are kept in the arms room</a>. So he wouldn&#39;t have had an issued firearm on hand, and if he had a personal firearm he&#39;d have to have checked it out of the arms room. If he decided to take out his PTSD on others, going and purchasing a new gun was likely his best choice.</p>

<p>Incidents like this, taking place where everyone around the shooter is not carrying guns due to official policy, do pretty much the <em>opposite</em> of push a gun control agenda. Instead, they make people say, &quot;Why didn&#39;t the other soldiers have guns so he could have been stopped?&quot; It&#39;s the question that has been on everyone&#39;s mind - if this base wasn&#39;t a fun-free zone, would this have played out any different?</p>

<p>If this were to be part of a gun-control agenda, it would have been an extremely foolish miscalculation, one so obvious virtually anyone would have been able to see the miscalculation beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I follow this subreddit a lot.  I just recently separated from the Army and was at Fort Hood just months prior.  If you live on post and have a family, you are allowed to keep firearms in your home as long as the MP station is tracking.  If you live in the barracks, you have to check it into your arms room.   But heres the catch to this.  He was assigned to the WTU which has barracks for the people. And his case, he would have been assigned to a barracks room, UNLESS he was authorized to bring his family.  If he did that, than chances are he has a firearm.  </p>

<p>If he lived in the barracks, he would have to have the company commanders approval to remove such firearm from the arms room and must state when he will have it back.  If he doesn&#39;t have it back in time, they will look for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres another thing.  Since its the work week, no right commander will allow a soldier who has PTSD sign out a weapon during the week.  There is a lot to do in order to allow this happen.  Commander has to talk to the 1sg, 1sg talks to the armorer... so on and so fourth.  I doubt he had one stored there.  </p>

<p>Reading some of your comments on here made me respond due to the fact I am a recently separated sergeant from fort hood who had soldiers that their POW&#39;s were stored in the Arms Room.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This particular shooting seems legit to me. Here we have a man that is on drugs for psych problems. He has access to a weapon. He has reason (in his mind) to justify killing all the people. Sick and sad can lead to lots of abhorrent behaviors, even homicidal. </p>

<p>If we continue to see everything as an inside job we not only lose sight of what it is we&#39;re actually searching for, but we lose new recruits to the kook factor involved with getting it wrong. </p>

<p>We are never remembered for the conspiracies we got right, only for those we get wrong. Be very cautious and very selective. After all, we know who our target is, we can see their work a mile away, we know their stench. </p>

<p>This is not their work. </p>

<p>Just to clarify, members of the military generally aren&#39;t carrying their weapons during the work day unless it&#39;s specific to their job (Military Police, Infantry, etc) -- As Motor Transport (a driver), it&#39;s unlikely that he would be assigned a sidearm in the first place, and his service rifle would have been safely locked in the armory.</p>

<p><em>there is not one mention of the medication he was on</em></p>

<p>General Milley (the Fort Hood commanding officer) gave a press conference in which he stated that Lopez was currently on anti-depressants and undergoing psychiatric evaluations.</p>
