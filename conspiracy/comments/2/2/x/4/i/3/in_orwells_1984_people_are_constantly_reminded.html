    <div class="md"><p>No problem. For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t care about individual people &quot;getting credit&quot; or whatever as much as I think it&#39;s especially ironic given the nature of Postman&#39;s argument: that complex discourse cannot be captured in reductive image form. I highly recommend his book(s) if you have time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see the value in convincing the population that they&#39;re being watched all the time, and I can see the value in actually doing the watching.</p>

<p>The mass surveillance is justifiable to the MSM talking heads, but one thing they couldn&#39;t put a positive spin on was the JTRIG leaks, so they just ignored them. That&#39;s one reason I think these leaks are genuine, leaked for genuine reasons.</p>

<p>Even if the limited hangout people are right I&#39;m still glad the information was leaked, I see a big positive impact on the national discussion. So if it was an attempt to scare people into submission I don&#39;t think it worked.</p>

<p>I think this limited hangout stuff is the worst kind of conspiracist defeatism, you take the best news we&#39;ve had in decades and try to figure out how it actually is a bad thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zmPfbvO.png">Leaks</a> that grease the public to dreamily enjoy their reaming.</p>

<p>What sounds familiar is... that still... few seem to even question Xmas snowjob fear tools lame <em>BS that does not add up. Example: high level tech jobs &amp; security clearances with basically a GED [o_0] &amp; few classes in computers for such high level computer expert job titles.</em></p>

<p>Shadowy goatee stubbly pseudo &quot;Dude&quot; now playing &quot;the people&quot; is IMO clearly still an active agent.</p>

<p>IMO Pseudo Dude would have been neutralized long ago... if he was truly legit &amp; the leaked info was not <strong>cunningly planned to instill fear &amp; cause gradual tolerance to the abuse of constitutional laws</strong>. </p>
