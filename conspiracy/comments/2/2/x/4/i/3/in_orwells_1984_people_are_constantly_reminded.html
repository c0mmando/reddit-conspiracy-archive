       In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant surveillance by the authorities, mainly by telescreens. The people are constantly reminded of this by the phrase "Big Brother is watching you", the maxim ubiquitous on display.

       No problem. For what it's worth, I don't care about individual people "getting credit" or whatever as much as I think it's especially ironic given the nature of Postman's argument: that complex discourse cannot be captured in reductive image form. I highly recommend his book(s) if you have time.

       In the book 1984 was it the people themselves that spied on each other or was it just the government.. because I feel like right now we spy on each other for the government too. Things like Facebook, Twitter, all the cameras people wear etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Reddit because we all monitor each other.. for example if you talk about "conspiracies" on here people will shut you down before you can even broach the subject.

       I can see the value in convincing the population that they're being watched all the time, and I can see the value in actually doing the watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mass surveillance is justifiable to the MSM talking heads, but one thing they couldn't put a positive spin on was the JTRIG leaks, so they just ignored them. That's one reason I think these leaks are genuine, leaked for genuine reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the limited hangout people are right I'm still glad the information was leaked, I see a big positive impact on the national discussion. So if it was an attempt to scare people into submission I don't think it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this limited hangout stuff is the worst kind of conspiracist defeatism, you take the best news we've had in decades and try to figure out how it actually is a bad thing.
