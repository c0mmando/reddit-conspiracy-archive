       Seriously, question every fucking idea, notion, concept, and what the fuck ever, question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of discourse in this sub, from what I have seen has been constant bickering. Try and open yourself to the ideas other posters postulate. Look at all the perspectives.

       If you accept something as fact, question that shit!

       You know why people don't keep an open mind? It's painful. It hurts to be open. You are vulnerable when you are open. If what you base your beliefs upon can be changed in an instant by new information, that throws your entire life out of balance until you assimilate the new information into your existing belief system, and that can take months or years. While you are in an unbalanced, chaotic state, trying to adjust to new information, you are weak. You cannot argue effectively because you don't know what you believe. YOu cannot lead effectively because you don't know where you are going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong people, leaders, are  certain. They don't allow doubts to enter their heads. Their certain conviction makes them strong. They can out-argue and out-buffalo others because they are so sure they are right. It's a comforting position to be in. Strong. Sure of yourself. Never suffering uncertainty or doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble is, unless you open your mind, you cannot learn anything new. You are like a fly trapped in a piece of amber -- you never change. You are strong, because your certainties make you strong, but it is quite possible that your certainties are incorrect, and you are never going to learn this, because you are too terrified to open your mind and let doubt enter there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people want the reassuring certainty. They grasp whatever perspective on reality is fed to them, and they cling to it, because it is a source of comfort and strength to them. Getting them to open their minds to new possibilities is difficult. Only if they have an innate desire to seek the truth will they ever do this, and only slowly and by small degrees, so that they are not overwhelmed by doubt. Doubt can kill. Doubt can destroy a life. That is why people are so afraid of it. They would rather cling to lies than suffer the agonies of uncertainty.

       I think this only applies to those whose ground can be shaken. You can be on firm ground and still question everything. What you say is true for the general populace though, so it is good to be aware of the situation.

       I think this is implied, one should search for that in which they are interested. It is all subjective though, some people see that, others don't.

       But accepting something blindly is the main gist of what we should aim at not doing.

       Maybe? Fuck, I don't know. Don't even care tbh. I'm just of the camp that people are generally shitty, and those with more power just happen to have the means of being massively shittier.

       I try to be a decent person, but I'm not naive enough to believe that I can ever remove greed from even my own human nature. It's a self preservation mechanism at it's core, it's just some people either can't/won't control it. When those people have insane amounts of influence/resources, which is often how they got those things unless by inheriting it, that's when you get the shit that happens in the world, and it's always been that way. Absolute power corrupts absolutely as the saying goes, but it's not like being powerful is the sole catalyst in making people this way.

       As has been said, recognition is the first step.  Discounting your potential for personal growth will almost seal the deal, ensuring you will always be scum.  Don't fall victim to this mind trap.  You will never be as evil as those who control the world from the shadows.  You will never sink so low, turning on your fellow brothers and sisters to temporarily get ahead.

I'm just not willing to buy into a mindset of bullshit platitudes and chasing some self-perfecting idealism that does little but sugarcoat the fact that when it all comes down to it, we all look out for #1, and without fucking people over to do so, I think that's totally fine.

       If the shoe fits, what else could be claimed of you.  People dissimilar to yourself have existed since the dawn of man.  And while rare, they are not an extinct breed.  They believe in looking out for their fellow man.  There are even some who put their own needs behind the needs of others. Dutifully serving, and enjoying the entire process.  The rewards of service are something I recommend you deeply look into.   I wish you the best.

       This is very telling.  I believe the exact opposite, in the truths that I've discovered that the large majority of people are naturally good, and given the opportunity to help or destroy their brother, they would choose the former.

       As stated earlier, you belief that most people are "generally shitty" says much about you and how you are.  The famous (paraphrased) quote:
       <em>
        If you meet one person and think their shitty, they're probably shitty.  If you meet everyone and think they're shitty, its probably you that is shitty.
       </em>

       It's interesting how these cowards paint it as a slam on all Jewish people.  It has not, nor will ever be viewed as such.  Its the last card these fools have to play.  Pity for the holocaust has be too drawn out to be realistic.  It doesn't give you assholes the right to treat others as you were supposedly treated.  Be the bigger man, cowards.
