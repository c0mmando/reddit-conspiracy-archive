    <div class="md"><p>If threat of retaliatory force counts as force, (sorry, do not know how to format quotes) then we can not do it without force or at least appearance to use force. However, I do hope peaceful protest remain as the vanguard for standing up and not violence, although that seems inevitable. (Yet, I find it hard to believe that men of the military (insert whatever Gov. force you wish) would be able to fire at American Citizens, like them, peacefully protesting for freedom and against corruption.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be something to oppressing gays, Jews, or other minorities as a way to keep social cohesion.  You can see it happening in Russia, and now Russia is seeking to challenge U.S. hegemony.  Pot and drug use could be the same thing.  But these are issues for national sovereignty and cultural issues.</p>

<p>From my viewpoint there are two groups seeking control.  One group is trying to use war as a way to &quot;evolve&quot; humans.  They use national sovereignty and cultural cohesion to pit nations against each other.  The other group is trying to create a one world government and to manage humans through centralized control and destroying national sovereignty.  They will allow activities like homosexuality and drug use because it serves to dissolve cultural identities.  Given these two (theoretical) groups, all efforts serve one or the other purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know where this is going but...</p>

<p>Revolution does not have to remove anyone from power, society can simply decide to do something else.  The problem is, however, that governmental institutions are like vampiristic organisms and tend to want to survive, and will thus become violent if their hosts seek peaceful alternatives.</p>

<p>Gay rights and pot use don&#39;t directly challenge authority, they simply take away a few excuses by the existing system to jail, search, or spy on people.  The system will simply find other excuses to increase its power.  A favorite is war or fear of terrorists.  A direct challenge to the system would be to challenge it&#39;s right to spy, arrest or tax people.  Those types of issues are usually a real direct threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh and I forgot. MLK wasn&#39;t the only face of the Civil Rights Movement. When attempts were made to disarm black people, Panthers got together and carried weapons in to (I think it was the) California Statehouse, and told them to fuck right off. Unloaded, so that if any of them were shot, they could point to that.</p>

<p>Malcom X was a hero too. Non-violence is best, but sometimes you have to be prepared for not having a non-violent option.</p>

<p>&quot;Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you&#39;re a man, you take it.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Malcom X</li>
</ul>

<p>Guns present + no shots fired seems very non violent to me.</p>

<p>You see the violence as fairly one sided. But that comes with years of hindsight and evaluation. At the TIME, protesters were painted by the media as the aggressors all of the time.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the Stonewall Riots. Don&#39;t forget the violence inherent in the black market. There are usually several faces to social change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its because the fed stopped doing their job and starting kicking out cattle ranchers based on this BS desert tortoise premise, even though they document their own murder of the desert tortoise. He paid fees to the county instead of the government, contending that it was state land, becuase the BLM was using cattle rancher funds to kick them the fuck out.

    <div class="md"><p>If threat of retaliatory force counts as force, (sorry, do not know how to format quotes) then we can not do it without force or at least appearance to use force. However, I do hope peaceful protest remain as the vanguard for standing up and not violence, although that seems inevitable. (Yet, I find it hard to believe that men of the military (insert whatever Gov. force you wish) would be able to fire at American Citizens, like them, peacefully protesting for freedom and against corruption.)</p>
