       We, the people actually stood up against government tyrrany and won. It finally fucking happened, and now every single person who hears about or knows about the events will realize that we have the power to change things. Someone finally took a stand against this bullshit and they came out on top, and with the sick fucked up Reid/Chinese power news its all that more apparent that these people are not working for us, they arent doing the job we elected them to do. Soon enough, itll be time for us to kick them the fuck out, time to get prepping now because the gauntlet has been thrown and it is our time to remove politicians that arent working, whether it be by peaceful means, or by force

       Threat of retaliatory force counts as force in many cases. They didn't have to threaten, they didn't have to shoot, but they showed that they could if needed.

       If threat of retaliatory force counts as force, (sorry, do not know how to format quotes) then we can not do it without force or at least appearance to use force. However, I do hope peaceful protest remain as the vanguard for standing up and not violence, although that seems inevitable. (Yet, I find it hard to believe that men of the military (insert whatever Gov. force you wish) would be able to fire at American Citizens, like them, peacefully protesting for freedom and against corruption.)

       I do not believe the Gay Rights movement or Medical Marijuana movement used violence. I also do not recall the Civil Rights movement used violence. Just wanted to play devil's advocate. Sometime violence paints the movement in a negative light.

       Just a side point.  Both of these don't really challenge power.  They are benign side issues that defray efforts on core issues like taxation, land rights, 2nd amendment issues, etc.  The power structure doesn't give a shit who you sleep with or if you smoke pot (except as an excuse to throw you in jail if you protest to much).

       There may be something to oppressing gays, Jews, or other minorities as a way to keep social cohesion.  You can see it happening in Russia, and now Russia is seeking to challenge U.S. hegemony.  Pot and drug use could be the same thing.  But these are issues for national sovereignty and cultural issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my viewpoint there are two groups seeking control.  One group is trying to use war as a way to "evolve" humans.  They use national sovereignty and cultural cohesion to pit nations against each other.  The other group is trying to create a one world government and to manage humans through centralized control and destroying national sovereignty.  They will allow activities like homosexuality and drug use because it serves to dissolve cultural identities.  Given these two (theoretical) groups, all efforts serve one or the other purposes.

       Don't know where this is going but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Revolution does not have to remove anyone from power, society can simply decide to do something else.  The problem is, however, that governmental institutions are like vampiristic organisms and tend to want to survive, and will thus become violent if their hosts seek peaceful alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gay rights and pot use don't directly challenge authority, they simply take away a few excuses by the existing system to jail, search, or spy on people.  The system will simply find other excuses to increase its power.  A favorite is war or fear of terrorists.  A direct challenge to the system would be to challenge it's right to spy, arrest or tax people.  Those types of issues are usually a real direct threat.

       What if it was called a political movement instead of a political revolution? And the goal was to change the system and get the right kind of people in power? I feel like politicians are an industry of psychopaths right now. A movement shows we have patience. I'm not dead set in my ways. Just having conversation.

       There are a few movements to take the money aspect out of Congress, such as Represent.US, In fact I plan on standing in front of a Post Office and asking for signatures to support the American Anti Corruption Act, but when there is some old west Utah war type shit going down all of a sudden people are more aware that people are raising opposition to the powers that be which should help

       The Civil Rights movement had LOTS of violence made upon the protesters. Furthermore, the media often painted them as aggressors.

       People should not bite your head off. Devils advocates make others have to form better arguments. It is important, especially in this sub, to make solid arguments.

       Oh and I forgot. MLK wasn't the only face of the Civil Rights Movement. When attempts were made to disarm black people, Panthers got together and carried weapons in to (I think it was the) California Statehouse, and told them to fuck right off. Unloaded, so that if any of them were shot, they could point to that.

       Guns present + no shots fired seems very non violent to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the violence as fairly one sided. But that comes with years of hindsight and evaluation. At the TIME, protesters were painted by the media as the aggressors all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the Stonewall Riots. Don't forget the violence inherent in the black market. There are usually several faces to social change.

       Its because the fed stopped doing their job and starting kicking out cattle ranchers based on this BS desert tortoise premise, even though they document their own murder of the desert tortoise. He paid fees to the county instead of the government, contending that it was state land, becuase the BLM was using cattle rancher funds to kick them the fuck out.

       If threat of retaliatory force counts as force, (sorry, do not know how to format quotes) then we can not do it without force or at least appearance to use force. However, I do hope peaceful protest remain as the vanguard for standing up and not violence, although that seems inevitable. (Yet, I find it hard to believe that men of the military (insert whatever Gov. force you wish) would be able to fire at American Citizens, like them, peacefully protesting for freedom and against corruption.)
