    <div class="md"><p>I just read through some of his comment history, seems pretty normal.  If your gonna call someone out like that you need to do it with quotes and what-not. Looks like he disagrees with the hoi poloi about Sandy Hook, big whoop.</p>

<p>As far as the &#39;sub being under attack.&#39; Anything labeled conspiracy is going to be scrutinized. But I remember a quote by Cicero: </p>

<p>&quot;A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch yourself lest you become what you fear. Your dangerously close to trying to incite some old-school commie group-think mob action, &quot;Quick someone&#39;s different, Where&#39;s my torch?&quot; </p>

<p>Simple rules, don&#39;t feed the trolls and look past the smoke.</p>

<p>If you feel that a user is &quot;trolling&quot; bring relevant instances to the mod teams attention. They can handle it from there.</p>

<p>But what you are suggesting seems to directly conflict with the rules. It sounds more like you personally attacking an individual instead of following the subs guidelines.</p>

<p>Find the source of their motivation and deprive them of what they desire. This is the only real way to deal with those individuals. If it&#39;s just a single individual they will eventually tire of their antics when deprived of any response.</p>

<p>This subreddit should be a place where people can discuss conspiracies without being assailed by the braying donkeys that drown out conspiracy discussions elsewhere on reddit and the web generally. </p>

<p>In addition to the brigading from the trained chimps at r/tard,  there are half a dozen hardcore &quot;braying donkeys&quot; who get a kick out of disrupting conversations in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and SnakePit is undoubtedly one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. They have specific subs for a reason. The fact that &quot;our&quot; sub (and I consider it that because this is my primary reddit page) is constantly under attack and we&#39;re powerless to do anything about it is frustrating. I mean, are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers">Steelers fans</a> trolling the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/browns">Browns fans?</a></p>
