       His comments seem to be more playing devil's advocate re Sandy Hook rather than trolling.

       I just read through some of his comment history, seems pretty normal.  If your gonna call someone out like that you need to do it with quotes and what-not. Looks like he disagrees with the hoi poloi about Sandy Hook, big whoop.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the 'sub being under attack.' Anything labeled conspiracy is going to be scrutinized. But I remember a quote by Cicero:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague."
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch yourself lest you become what you fear. Your dangerously close to trying to incite some old-school commie group-think mob action, "Quick someone's different, Where's my torch?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple rules, don't feed the trolls and look past the smoke.

       I normally would agree with you. Interesting comment. However, He needs to be banned. I am sick of seeing him and his dumb comments and his history suggests he doesn't even want to be here, he just wants to call people stupid and throw out red herrings. I stand by my request and think if the mods won't kick him, we should.

       It's easier to shut someone down with facts than it is to use personal attacks. That's why rule 10 exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel that a user is "trolling" bring relevant instances to the mod teams attention. They can handle it from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what you are suggesting seems to directly conflict with the rules. It sounds more like you personally attacking an individual instead of following the subs guidelines.

       I'm not defending the person you are suggesting be removed. I'm only pointing out the irony in your suggestion.

       Methinks this user pushed one too many of your buttons and you have made this somewhat personal. It's a lot easier to not engage with individuals who intentionally try to push your button or attempt to manipulate their opponent through emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling if the user sees this thread not only will they find that they "have won" but you will have encouraged them to continue along the same path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find the source of their motivation and deprive them of what they desire. This is the only real way to deal with those individuals. If it's just a single individual they will eventually tire of their antics when deprived of any response.

       My statement above still stands. The only way to discourage users who are argumentative is to deprive them of the argument they wish to create.

       Awareness is more powerful than getting rid of them. Getting rid of them would be to the same affect of using a band-aid on a stab wound.

       Keep showing they are scum to the point where it is mundane and their words useless because people become aware of the situation, instead of just outing them now and those in the future had no idea he ever existed.

       This subreddit should be a place where people can discuss conspiracies without being assailed by the braying donkeys that drown out conspiracy discussions elsewhere on reddit and the web generally.

      <p>
       In addition to the brigading from the trained chimps at r/tard,  there are half a dozen hardcore "braying donkeys" who get a kick out of disrupting conversations in

       , and SnakePit is undoubtedly one of them.

       Noone gets the disruption we get, we're a training ground. We are willing targets just by coming here. I expect this treatment. I don't comprehend why the rest of you don't.

       I'm not saying I don't expect it, I'm saying we should take steps to prevent it, and steps to remove the users if they are continually disruptive.

       You may find it character-forming, but I've been here long enough to find the unrelenting waves of skepto-chimps and braying donkeys incredibly tedious.

       I have to agree that their is some balance that must be met. We don't want to keep the crazies too far away, lest they actually get abducted and have awesome evidence. But, we also don't want 600 pages of troll bait.

       Exactly. They have specific subs for a reason. The fact that "our" sub (and I consider it that because this is my primary reddit page) is constantly under attack and we're powerless to do anything about it is frustrating. I mean, are
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers">
        Steelers fans
       </a>
       trolling the

        Browns fans?

       We need a hero. We need RoboMod. A mod that is unafraid to shoot trolls in the dick when they try to rape a thread into submission.

       Bad analogy. I had fun though :)

       I'm keen to hear all these cases where I am "just spouting readily disprovable information". Because you never seem to mention your counter-evidence in the many threads when I'm picking your arguments apart.
