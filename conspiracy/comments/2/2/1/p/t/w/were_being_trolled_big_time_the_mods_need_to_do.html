       Moderators aren't willing to be aggressive. They instead take the tactic of being calm and letting the tards/trolls/shills eventually break the rules. Until then we're forced to call disruptors out every step of the way.

       That said, I think the amount of bullshit that goes on in this subreddit is ridiculous. I don't know what I would do without RES tags. Probably mentally tag people.

       The most aggressive thing we can do is to let the admins know about possible bots and or off site groups coordinating to attack the new queue with downvotes. Even if we ban tard/trolls they can still vote here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must say the admins actually banned someone who spammed our modmail the other day, so perhaps letting them know is the best route on this issue.

       I'm just gonna keep an eye out for people trying to blame this all on the mods because honestly I don't know what people expect them to do. I would be OK with them shadowbanning obvious trolls, personally, I'm so done with thinking I'm having an honest discussion then finding out the guy I'm talking to is some conspiritard or shill piece of shit whose job depends on not being convinced.

       Is it possible to disable voting for unverified accounts? Real users can still use a burner email to make throwaways for privacy but I've noticed those that just like to stir the pot are frequently a new account with dust. It would take a few extra minutes for the average user but might deter those making massive amounts of unverified accounts.

       This is something you have to take it up to the admins, because they have power over it. Currently they say that upvotes/downvotes are part of reddit and therefore can't be removed.

       Apparently except as a style. We have private subs, I don't see why they have an issue with a sub simply requesting a user be verified in order to limit abuse. I get they are sick of hearing about it and often have their fingers in their ears but still..

       They seem to care more about making money than actually providing a good working platform that best suits our needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same reason all the censorship goes on deaf ears, because they don't care, and never did care about people screwing it up, as long as we keep coming here, which we continue to do.

       The only real solution, is to create a new reddit. Reddit is open source, but still no one has stepped up to create a new one.

       The only system that works is a system that adapts and grows as necessary. Evolution is a necessary part of survival. If you don't adapt, you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holding on to a flawed system based on the thinking that anything will be infiltrated is just not logical. It is a pessimistic attitude to begin, and not supported by anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure what exactly can be done here. The major subs are all run by random people who censor and probably are paid by corporations to promote certain ideas and keep out others. There are numerous alt accounts and shills everywhere. Content gets censored and truth gets downvoted. So why exactly is it too early to jump the boat? We are long overdue and should have jumped out when we found out that reddit admins don't give a shit about censorship.

       Jumping only means surrender if you own it in the first place. You don't own reddit, you are merely a user and you have no real rights here. So to jump means to find something better, rather than admit defeat. It is like quiting myspace when it went to shit. That's not surrendering... that's finding something better because it sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people like you cling on to here, and convince others not to go find some place new, then no one is going to create anything better, and we are stuck with this shithole. We have no attachment to reddit and so we shouldn't be clinging on to reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attitude is pessimistic like I said before. Reddit became popular because digg collapsed if you remember. If people said the same things then and never decided to create Reddit, we wouldn't have this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are to create something, it needs to have a good foundation. Holding on to broken structures because you don't like change, doesn't sound like a solid plan at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is calling everyone a shill, and we are having upvote/downvote brigade wars with other subs. Seriously, this shit doesn't work and it isn't so hard to see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth comes to those who are willing to work and sacrifice for it. If you don't like to fix the issues by moving to a different site, because you are too comfortable here, then that prevents growth.

       We have no attachment to reddit. It is a platform that fits our needs, and if it doesn't, we need to leave to some place better. It is simple as that. Reddit isn't my first born son that I need to stick around for.
      </p>

       A new site can fix a lot of issues that we are currently having, but can't be fixed with reddit because its in the core of how reddit works, and also admins don't want to change those things.

       cost of buying and running servers no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       the early days with small numbers, a forum can run off a single PC on broadband, then the users climb, adding extra PCs only goes so far, then you need dedicated server racks, and serious internet access.
      </p>
      <p>
       and it costs money to scale up from small to medium to large.
      </p>
      <p>
       the answer might be some form of P2P 'reddit' clone, distributed server and message database system, encryption and security, as people donate unused cycle time for useful number crunching for useful causes, so could a distributed 'reddit' be established. no frills (that waste bandwidth and storage) just users and topics and messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       the downside it might not be as 'instant' as reddit and any modern forums are, there might be minutes before messages synchronize across the system, as the old BBSes used have latency and delay before everything was topical. in the old days linked BBSes and even Usenet had to dial and send updates to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       but if the aim and goal is uncensored, this would be the way to go. it doesn't solve the shill and troll problems, but nothing really will except mods and users paying attention.

       they prob exists now, but people have to know, that requires publicity and people trying them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       remember reddit got sold to Conde Naste, its owned by a big publishing corporation, and all that that implies, its an online article magazine and PR machine to them. not a glossy one but a luddite styled one (cheap cheap to operate and run), but still a magazine style website.
      </p>
      <p>
       no doubt the corporate managers of reddit have the dream of turning reddit glossy, pictures and all the stuff that other websites do, it won't be an overnight thing, but a gradual creeping thing, hardcore text users will be sidelined to a safe reservation, the main site will look like Gizmondo or similar. glossy means banners and big paying advertizing, something corporate bonuses and promotions depend on.

       If you go to conspiracy "new", there isn't a single post that doesn't have at least [-6], even if the post is only minutes old.*

       I think this sub will be over run with people who walk the walk, so to speak, but do everything they can within the rules to ruin what it was. That means downvoting, fake posts, silly ass shit like

       Agreed, it's getting worse. My take on it is that I'll continue to speak my mind and what I believe to be the truth and judge by the downvotes whether I've struck a nerve or not (or whether I've said something wrong/stupid, but alas).

       You know OP in all fairness to the mods. It's a volunteer position and are not paid. They do have a life to tend toward. They could really just block out your rant if they wanted to do so, however they didn't. You act like karma points are so important. If your message is out there and it's true. Then who gives a fuck if it gets lots of downvotes, so long as your message reaches one who upvotes. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all in all what do you really want the mods to do? Cause if they ban a downvoter that is a shill/sockpuppet/troll etc... All they will do is create another throwaway account and downvote again and repeat the cycle and actually creating more downvotes for your thread. Because there are some organizations that pay others to act as shills and keep doing such all night. You are too obsessed with upvotes and downvotes. Seeing as you are a newb here over us veterans who are used to seeing such. Take a chill pill on the obsession on the karma count because your rant won't stop it. If you can't get over the obsession. Well then newb you are in for a lot of butt hurt while on here. Not every one will agree with you.

       Yes. Let's all do nothing about the obvious attacks on this sub. Good idea. I understand the mods have lives. I didn't realize they can't see what's going on under the hood, so to speak, as far as votes go.

       So it looks like you were shadowbanned for brigading (something you have been critical of c'tard doing here), not for talking about global warming. It may have been unintentional on your part, you may not have
       <em>
        knowingly

       been part of an active brigade, but yeah, if you were taking part in one you were going to be shadowbanned.

       They don't really have any power over that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, people are getting mad at mods like mods are gods or something. They have very limited data to go on, and very limited power over this. There is no way of knowing what specific accounts are downvoting or upvoting. If this was possible, then that's something they could work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all we know is that downvotes are happening and there is nothing we can do to prevent it because we can't connect it to any accounts. The only thing they can do is make sure that those trolls don't screw up the comments, and tell people to go to /new/ and upvote posts that are getting heavily downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else do you want them to do? If you have no other suggestions but you are just taking your anger out on mods, then I don't know what good that will do here at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to make another reddit? I am 100% on board with this. If not, this is the fucked up situation, and we have to solve this the only way we can - by browsing /new/.

       Are particular posts targeted, do you think? If not, does it matter? I'm not saying it's right to automatically downvote everything, I'm just asking about the mechanics of the site - if everything is downvoted, won't the same stuff rise to the top that would have otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it that when people are looking at their list of multiple subs, conspiracy posts won't be as high compared to other subs, so they'll appear later in the queue? I'm having trouble expressing my question clearly, I think, but I didn't know it worked like that.

       Downvoted submissions can get caught in spam (even if it only has one downvote) and not show up at all, unless moderators approve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvoted submissions don't show up on frontpage, because according to reddit, "no one likes the submission, and so there is no point showing it more people."

      <p>
       In short, reddit is flawed and we need something better.

       Oh, thanks for the explanation. I see there are a few different ideas for alternative systems. I know that other communities have partially solved these issues with private subs, but I'm not sure if there are any of the conspiracy style, or if a private sub would even be suitable for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine there could be some sort of system of "trusted readers" on a given sub that would control the only downvotes relevant to the categories you describe, appearing on the front page and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ed- actually, now that I think about it, I do still have a question - what would happen if every single post to a sub was downvoted the same amount immediately? What would appear on the front page? And is that what's going on? I imagine it's hard to be sure. And what do you mean when you  say "frontpage" do you mean of the sub itself or of /all or the feed of a particular user with custom subs?

       Private subs do exist like
       <a href="/r/conspiracyv2">
        /r/conspiracyv2
       </a>
       and some others. However, there are much fewer people, and therefore much less content. They don't give out invites easily (only the moderators can do this ). It doesn't work out that great sadly.

       The only kind of control we can do is upvote those downvoted submissions. Reddit allows anyone to downvote or upvote, and there is no record of who did what, for the moderators of the sub.

       Yeah, I just meant hypothetically, not that reddit had the trusted users functionality now. Might be a workable system, though, for moderators to implement at their discretion. I actually think the mod system is one of the other big flaws of this site. There should be options for mods themselves to implement democratic procedures, but now this is just becoming my fantasy community discussion site and not reddit.

       The only issue is that even mods can't be trusted on some of the subs.  Even here the mods get hated on a lot and suspected of censorship from time to time, and some of us even believe the mods are not trust worthy at all. So even mods can't be trusted with that completely. Trusted voters would also have the same issue, because it is hard for those people to gain the trust of all the users of the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course many of the things I am saying is with reddit in mind, and could actually be fixed with enough thought if someone were to build something better. Elections could be a part of it, and common sub names such as politics, news, worldnews, etc shouldn't just be given to any random person to claim and control  (which is what is going on with reddit) - which is why there is a lot of censorship.

       I agree 100% about mods on many subs not being trusted, but I still think it would be an interesting experiment - surely some subs would democratize more than others, depending on their mods and users, and that would be a benefit in and of itself, even if it's a failure more widely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just thinking you could do various levels of trusted users - like, top upvoted comment scores - you could even allocate powers by percentile (I mean powers like we discussed earlier, restricting frontpage-forbidding DVs to these users).
      </p>
      <p>
       When you talk about "random person" do you mean that these persons should be known within the site? Or without, maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of sheer curiosity, I do wish the admins would take the "experiment in democracy" idea further, but as a conspiracist I'd guess there are certain hard limits to the experiment related to the ownership and so on.

       When reddit started, all subs were up for grabs. Basically whoever randomly decided to create a sub using the name "conspiracy", or "news", became the moderators and basically the owners of the sub. The first reddit users basically get all the good sub names. These people weren't selected by admins or reddit, but just random users that first picked those names and created a sub based on it. So it isn't really democracy at all. All subs are the same as any other, and the creators/moderators have right to censor anything they please because reddit is not a democracy, and the subs can only have content as those mods wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only democracy here is with downvotes/upvotes, but with shills and alt accounts, even that is gone. Now this is basically the best site for pushing propaganda because moderators can censor posts and control content that people read, and shill accounts can downvote/upvote comments to make people falsely believe one idea is more popular than an another.

       Seriously, people are getting mad at mods like mods are gods or something. They have very limited data to go on, and very limited power over this. There is no way of knowing what specific accounts are downvoting or upvoting. If this was possible, then that's something they could work with.

       So all we know is that downvotes are happening and there is nothing we can do to prevent it because we can't connect it to any accounts.

       What else do you want them to do? If you have no other suggestions but you are just taking your anger out on mods, then I don't know what good that will do here at all.

       Downvoted submissions can get caught in spam (even if it only has one downvote) and not show up at all, unless moderators approve it.

      <p>
       Downvoted submissions don't show up on frontpage, because according to reddit, "no one likes the submission, and so there is no point showing it more people."
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, reddit is flawed and we need something better.
