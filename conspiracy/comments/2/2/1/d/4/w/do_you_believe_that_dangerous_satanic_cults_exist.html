       If you believe the Franklin cover-up book by John DeCamp there is "Satanic" or at least ritualistic aspect to the international pedophilia ring that serves the Global elite.

       <strong>
        John W. DeCamp (born July 6, 1941) is a former Republican member of the Nebraska Legislature and author of the book The Franklin Cover-up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Born in Neligh, Nebraska, DeCamp joined the United States Army during the Vietnam War. In 1975 he initiated Operation Baby Lift, which evacuated 2,800 orphaned Vietnamese children.[1] He was later assigned to serve as an aide to former CIA director William Colby, who was Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam at the time. Beginning his campaign for election while still stationed in Vietnam, DeCamp was elected and served four terms as a Nebraska state senator, from 1971 to 1987.

       Try Enochian Communications system by the Pythagorean Order of Death. I  actully logged into this through meditation in the 4th dimension scared the fuck out of me AT FIRST! I have cleared my system for the most part still working on a few minor details. I have battled gods and demons and still ticking, I look at it this way, if I'm still alive I'm not a threat. Just feel bad for all the bozos who think their reality is THE reality. Like lambs to the slaughter. At first I felt like I had to fight these people, but once you get it, you realize some people just do not deserve to live, scary realization. I trust in myself and the creator.

       People deserve to have the truth presented to them without deception.  As to wether or not they deserve it doesn't matter. What's important is that the evolution of the species is based on its accurate factual perception of itself...

       Cults exist. Religious cults. Occult cults. There may even be a few Satanic cults, although they likely wouldn't call themselves that. Those who call themselves Satanists say they don't believe in Satan. Those who believe in Satan don't call themselves Satanists, usually. Don't confuse Satanism with Luciferianism. Luciferians are not Satanists. They see Lucifer as a source of light -- the name means "Light-bringer." They do not see Lucifer as evil, or see themselves as evil. They are seekers after occult secrets, hidden knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there are no groups of individuals who knowingly, deliberately make a pack with Satan, as the witches of Europe were supposed to do by the demonologists of the Catholic Church during the 16th century. A few small groups like this may exist, but they are very likely made up of teenagers and drug users who don't even know what they are doing. Large, well organized cults of Satanists among wealthy people are not very likely. Satanism is 99% myth, and maybe one percent reality.

       I don't think the problem is who is worshiping what,  the problem is the harm being done to us and our planet, by a few few, too wealthy and too powerful people.   What they are worshiping is not the problem.

       Yes, but those that are truly dangerous remain in shadows. They do not suffer from ego and the need to publicize. They are in positions of power, and I do not mean government. They are very few, and very dangerous. And most of all, above suspicion. If you can point your finger at one, then you are mistaken.

       You might want to take some time to think through the 'logic' yourself instead of parroting other people. Humans have been figuring out things we can't directly observe for hundreds of years. How do you think we make any progress in astronomy?

       We can know about things we cannot directly observe. One can determine a stone was dropped in a pond simply by observing the ripples it creates. This is actually the basis for a lot of discoveries in astronomy too.

       Unless you see the stone going into the pond, it is presumptuous to say it was a stone. It could have been caused by any number of different things. I haven't seen any 'ripples' in the world which would lead me to assume that Satanism can have any real effect.

       Agreed, the extent of their effect is unkown but you'd be silly to think that ritual abuse does not take place. There is overwhelming evidence that there are groups out there who do these things. Whether they have any real influence or positions of power is unkown.
