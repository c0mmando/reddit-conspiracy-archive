<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeCamp">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeCamp</a></p>

<p><strong>John W. DeCamp (born July 6, 1941) is a former Republican member of the Nebraska Legislature and author of the book The Franklin Cover-up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Born in Neligh, Nebraska, DeCamp joined the United States Army during the Vietnam War. In 1975 he initiated Operation Baby Lift, which evacuated 2,800 orphaned Vietnamese children.[1] He was later assigned to serve as an aide to former CIA director William Colby, who was Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam at the time. Beginning his campaign for election while still stationed in Vietnam, DeCamp was elected and served four terms as a Nebraska state senator, from 1971 to 1987.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try Enochian Communications system by the Pythagorean Order of Death. I  actully logged into this through meditation in the 4th dimension scared the fuck out of me AT FIRST! I have cleared my system for the most part still working on a few minor details. I have battled gods and demons and still ticking, I look at it this way, if I&#39;m still alive I&#39;m not a threat. Just feel bad for all the bozos who think their reality is THE reality. Like lambs to the slaughter. At first I felt like I had to fight these people, but once you get it, you realize some people just do not deserve to live, scary realization. I trust in myself and the creator.</p>

<p>The threat likely lies within. </p>

<p>People deserve to have the truth presented to them without deception.  As to wether or not they deserve it doesn&#39;t matter. What&#39;s important is that the evolution of the species is based on its accurate factual perception of itself...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cults exist. Religious cults. Occult cults. There may even be a few Satanic cults, although they likely wouldn&#39;t call themselves that. Those who call themselves Satanists say they don&#39;t believe in Satan. Those who believe in Satan don&#39;t call themselves Satanists, usually. Don&#39;t confuse Satanism with Luciferianism. Luciferians are not Satanists. They see Lucifer as a source of light -- the name means &quot;Light-bringer.&quot; They do not see Lucifer as evil, or see themselves as evil. They are seekers after occult secrets, hidden knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there are no groups of individuals who knowingly, deliberately make a pack with Satan, as the witches of Europe were supposed to do by the demonologists of the Catholic Church during the 16th century. A few small groups like this may exist, but they are very likely made up of teenagers and drug users who don&#39;t even know what they are doing. Large, well organized cults of Satanists among wealthy people are not very likely. Satanism is 99% myth, and maybe one percent reality.</p>
