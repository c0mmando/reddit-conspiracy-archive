        Why is Guinea's Ebola Outbreak so Unusual
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's play outbreak sleuth... an Ebola outbreak has quickly spread amongst distinct regions in Guinea almost instantly. Ebola quickly goes to work at killing the person afflicted. So how does an Ebola "flare-up" happen across a country simultaneously ? Specifically since it requires close contact to spread?
      </p>
      <p>
       “We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases,” -Mariano Lugli of Doctors Without Borders.
The country has chosen to send its citizens a text to stop eating Bat Soup. Theres a bit of evidence supporting bats as being an ebola reservoir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ebola had previously never been outside of central Africa... yet here it is appearing on a costal country... 700 miles away from Congo where it previously had been focused almost a decade since the last substantial outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more pressing is the apparent disagreement of whether or not Ebola is affecting these people.
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26717490">
        This source is claiming negative tests...
       </a>
       This source is
       <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/guinea-mobilization-against-ebola-epidemic">
        claiming the Zaire strain
       </a>
       Do we have a hybrid Hemorrhagic fever epidemic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could bats be a hybridizing reservoir for an eventual plague? Or could something more.... intentional... be at play?
      </p>
      <p>
       This ebola is interesting.... lets do some research.... something like this most certainly must have popped up in human history a time or two.... Oh thats interesting.... Ebola is a thing of 1975 and on. Its closest relative, Marburg, start in 1967. Where was Marburg virus first found.... oh thats interesting.... Monkeys in Soviet Russia.
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/25/world/russian-scientist-dies-in-ebola-accident-at-former-weapons-lab.html">
        NOW WHY WOULD RUSSIA HAVE THESE MONKEYS?

       You see what direction my

         “There’s a huge lab there [in Siberia],” he said. “It used to manufacture biological weapons in the old Soviet Union days. They had 5,000 people working there, and they made all these pathogens.” After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the lab’s existence came to light. “Scientists from all over the world were invited in to destroy it. And they destroyed all the stocks, but still there were 5000 employees who knew how to make [the biological weapons], and those guys were being recruited by everybody from North Korea to Iran. So the U.S. government stepped in to fund the research to make vaccines and antidotes for these terrible weapons. And that’s how I got involved.”

       Ill give 10 bucks to anyone who can find out what this guy did before the last 12 years because I haven't found shit on him.  All I got is the mysterious quote of "US Govt stepped in.... And thats how I got involved."  Wheres his money come from? He apparently owns laboratories all over the US?   WTF are they doing in there? He's also allowed into SL4 Bio-Weapons labs.... but has no credentials of a scientist....  So 10 bucks..... anyone... who is this guy?

       EDIT:
       <a href="http://digitalcommons.hsc.unt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&amp;context=topjournal">
        Well I have his father traced to opening an emergency response hospital in De Leon, TX pg 11
       </a>
       but I still have no idea where he's climbed the ranks to be in SL-4 biolabs.  So that kind of explains the source of his money.

       <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a430462.pdf">

       From some of the linked articles, it does look like he has a PhD and his website claims that he is a biologist.
      </p>

       He appears to be in the business of locating plants and animals for pharmaceutical research and developments. I'm not sure why you are harping on this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the spread of the ebola, there could be a staggering number of possibilities for why an outbreak is occurring at the coast, and none of them have to be nefarious.

       He doesn't.  Watch the video. 3:25 "Fredeking did not attend college." If he did, then where did he go? Because he doesn't state it on his facebook.

       <li>
        <p>
         he's funded research that was publicly warned as illegitimate in 2002 which he tried to hide the fact he was responsible for funding it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         in lieu of the above, he has mysterious access to TWO SL-4 biological agent labs - with no academic credentials. Involved with Ebola at both.  His company appears to have access to ebola and offered inactivated ebola and marberg up for sale on his website.... this is a fact you can find only by discovering an archived version of his site.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         his website has him in a devil outfit, him looking for "the devil downunder", finding "the devil in the details", "Choose a continent or isolated island and Terry Fredeking will surely have a related story of intrigue, mystery and science! "...  a bit flamboyant to cause a raised eyebrow....
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         he's also got a big thing with bats...and guinea just texted the country to stop eating bat soup....  Theres a story in Popular Science about him entitled "One Part Bat Drool, Two Parts Dragon Blood" so if hes got live specimens somewhere and he got experimental ebola on hand..  then he's got the pieces of the guinea outbreak puzzle in his possession at some time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         he was on the Board of Directors of a African aid group started by him and some friends that was in the area in the last 5 years. This is a fact you can find only by looking at a cached version of a page.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We got two needle-prick events, one at Fort Dietrech and one at VECTOR at the same time he is funding research at both labs on Ebola. The woman in Russia died, a fact VECTOR hid for a month for revealing it publically.   Both were women. If I were in that position, and I know what was going on was evil... I think the most effective way to shine the light on it and get it to stop would be to sacrifice myself with a needle prick event.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20020077276">
          He's got a patent on  Ebola vaccine/treatment to sell made of Hookworm saliva. His name and the head of VECTOR is on it only.
         </a>
         . Problem is, he hasn't had an ebola outbreak in a decade. He AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF SMALL PENTAGON FUNDED LABS have an interest.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So... Interest in Ebola... Interest in Bats.... Access to Ebola... Quotes about biological weapons... Was in the area of the outbreak in the last few years.... Involved with research warned by the FDA..... The ebola outbreak is highly abnormal in that its something never been seen before.....  Stands to benefit greatly from an Ebola outbreak with his hookworm research....
      </p>
      <p>
       These would be the reasons I am harping on the fella.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No doubt a staggering number of possibilities...  But this fella has all the pieces of the puzzle in his pocket.....  and they just fell out on the people of Guinea - and I have yet to see anything that explains how he came to be in possession of those pieces with the appropriate authority - other than hes got money.  And even then, at no point does nefariousness have to be involved.... accidents happen... but certain accidents can only happen if you have certain things.... and he has these certain things.

       FYI the "ebola for sale" on his site is Ebola antibodies. Not the actual virus. IDK about the rest.

       It appears to be "inactivated virus" which means at one time it was activated.....  And keep in mind, thats his hidden archived site... not their current one.  I like how you've used your newly created account to comment on my article. I feel so special. ;)

       Whoops, sorry, didn't scroll down on the zoological specimens. Kinda weird having stuff like Marburg and Ebola being sold on a crappy-geocities-looking website like that. "Permit Required" Yeah, right.

       The web site is weird. His personal web sight is weird. The lack of info about who he was prior to say 1999 is weird.  His access to high profile Bioweapons labs is weird.  His knowledge of Bioreprat's lab is weird in that he was in a position to respond to a very hushed need (think of the people who knew about Bioreperat or VECTOR in 1997). The legal proceedings that name him, with him trying to get his name off a warning caused by research he funded is weird. All the devil references on his personal website is weird.  That radio interview is really fucking weird. Everything about this fella is weird.

       That being said, it looks like the little science generated by his initiative might have been somewhat productive... so who knows...

       Its not like I started my day going, Im going to uncover a conspiracy about ebola.... i just kinda saw the headline and started googling and just happened upon this fella by mere chance.

       Lol. Now I got 6 upvotes.  I should be very clear no evidence at all points to Mr Fredeking involvement in an Ebola bat-based outbreak in Guinea....  that being said, hes clearly a wildcard in the world of Ebola....
