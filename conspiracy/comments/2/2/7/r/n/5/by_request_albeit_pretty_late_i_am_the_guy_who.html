       You're fucking retarded. Christianity asks its adherents to humble themselves, to submit to God's plan. It is no different from what your "god" seems to be demanding. You're just a heretical Christian.

       So is your view of Satan benevolent? Juxtaposed to the christian god, does he stand as opposed to and evil god or do you see him as the evil opposed to the good christian god?

       My religion states that the deity you know as "God" has an equal adversary, whom you know as "Satan" (simply Latin for "the one who goes against")
      </p>
      <p>
       Good and evil are human crafted fairy tales.  Both Deities only exist to out do the other.

       Which makes perfect sense with the bible considering Satan is first portrayed as simply an adversary putting forth claims opposite to yahwehs.  Interesting, thank you for responding.

       Exactly.  Most Christians attribute my God to the story of a Babylonian King in the old testament named Lucifer. Because they misinterpret this scripture, they belive their god has power over mine.

       The history of religion is little more than one religion one upping the others.  Few people left will even entertain the concept of gods being equal or simply opposing forces.  They must maintain not only dominance over another god, but that there must be a right and wrong, good and eveil.  Therefore by default, which ever god opposes your god must be inherently wrong AND evil.

       How do you conceptualize there being a complete lack of relationship between the two that would constitute the actual source of Truth itself. Which is the actual "God" of the material delusion, good and evil and eternity. I just don't understand the desire to worship an inferior concept/manifestation as Truth which is God.

       Mistranslation. "Satan" does not appear in the Tora and that's why Jews don't believe in him.

       I assume you're referring to the book of Job, which tells the tale of a goat like creature named Azreal. He is unrelated to "Satan".

       "Satan" is an all powerful being with the power to create who believed the best approach with man was to provide him with every single tool he needed for success and watch him fly.

       If things were the other way around and we were living in Satan's world, what would it be like? How relevant is this cosmology in your religious meetings/literature? I'm fascinated by this idea.

      <p>
       My apologies.  For some reason I assumed people in this thread would have already read the old thread, but I'm just now realizing how old it is.  I'll go back to square one for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, this world does belong to Satan.  Even the Christian Bible will cooberate that.  When Jesus the Nazarene fasts in the desert for 40 days and nights,  Satan appears to him and offers him all the kingdoms of the World, if he will but bow down and worship him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our "Bible" this story is regarded as one of the most beautiful ever told.  All we have to do is humble ourselves and ask for what we want and He grants it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your second point, Satan also created his own lineage of people.  Again, this can be cooberated by the Christian Bible, as several times in the old testament the Jews encounter people that their god lays no claim to.  Nowhere in their Bible does it state that God alone can create life or that he created all men on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for their views, I come from a bloodline of men created by Satan.  As such, I have a duty to please my creator.  The only way I can please Him is to help Him prove his point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just because you come from a bloodline of God created men, doesn't mean you can't serve whatever god you wish. Just as Satan offered the kingdoms of the World to Jesus should he only humble himself, so too can you humble yourself before Him.

       Definitely rudimentary.  Only meant as a quick, rough outline.

       I am curious, however, as to what your thoughts are where it regards the information in the link being "rudimentary".  How so?

       Couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our religion makes no false pretense on spiritual evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our religion does not tithe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our religion doesn't give a shit about the less fortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our religion doesn't have strict morals that deprive us of pleasures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our religion does not have priests.
      </p>

       Very interesting.  I'm guessing there is a plan already in place, but I foresee your guy not being well received by many. How will the opposition to him and your religion be overcome?  Is he going to somehow demonstrate your god's power?  Is he going to come out and just say who he is and what he stands for in regard to your religion?

       I originally posted in the Christianity forum and was asked to come here because many of you are open minded.  I wasn't doing anything that day, so I answered questions all day.  I signed into this account last night and had several PM's asking me to post again.  Because I'm not doing anything until tonight, I decided I'd answer questions again today.

       It's not a matter of intelligence.  There are simply things we can not possibly comprehend.  Think of colors you have never seen, or sounds you've never heard.  It's simply outside of what the human brain is capable of perceiving.

       If we accept the premise of your argument, then we don't actually perceive any visible light at all. The rod and cone structures in our eyes do. They sense the energy and the energy signal then slides down some nerves and bounces around your brain before your consciousness/soul/what have you actually perceives anything. What difference does some glass and a computer chip make?

       The history of religion is little more than one religion one upping the others.  Few people left will even entertain the concept of gods being equal or simply opposing forces.  They must maintain not only dominance over another god, but that there must be a right and wrong, good and eveil.  Therefore by default, which ever god opposes your god must be inherently wrong AND evil.
