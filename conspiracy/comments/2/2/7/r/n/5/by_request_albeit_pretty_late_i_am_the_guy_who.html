    <div class="md"><p>The history of religion is little more than one religion one upping the others.  Few people left will even entertain the concept of gods being equal or simply opposing forces.  They must maintain not only dominance over another god, but that there must be a right and wrong, good and eveil.  Therefore by default, which ever god opposes your god must be inherently wrong AND evil.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies.  For some reason I assumed people in this thread would have already read the old thread, but I&#39;m just now realizing how old it is.  I&#39;ll go back to square one for you. </p>

<p>First, this world does belong to Satan.  Even the Christian Bible will cooberate that.  When Jesus the Nazarene fasts in the desert for 40 days and nights,  Satan appears to him and offers him all the kingdoms of the World, if he will but bow down and worship him. </p>

<p>In our &quot;Bible&quot; this story is regarded as one of the most beautiful ever told.  All we have to do is humble ourselves and ask for what we want and He grants it. </p>

<p>To your second point, Satan also created his own lineage of people.  Again, this can be cooberated by the Christian Bible, as several times in the old testament the Jews encounter people that their god lays no claim to.  Nowhere in their Bible does it state that God alone can create life or that he created all men on this planet.</p>

<p>As for their views, I come from a bloodline of men created by Satan.  As such, I have a duty to please my creator.  The only way I can please Him is to help Him prove his point. </p>

<p>Also, just because you come from a bloodline of God created men, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t serve whatever god you wish. Just as Satan offered the kingdoms of the World to Jesus should he only humble himself, so too can you humble yourself before Him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we accept the premise of your argument, then we don&#39;t actually perceive any visible light at all. The rod and cone structures in our eyes do. They sense the energy and the energy signal then slides down some nerves and bounces around your brain before your consciousness/soul/what have you actually perceives anything. What difference does some glass and a computer chip make? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history of religion is little more than one religion one upping the others.  Few people left will even entertain the concept of gods being equal or simply opposing forces.  They must maintain not only dominance over another god, but that there must be a right and wrong, good and eveil.  Therefore by default, which ever god opposes your god must be inherently wrong AND evil.  </p>
