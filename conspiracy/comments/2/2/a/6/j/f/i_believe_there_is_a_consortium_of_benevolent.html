    <div class="md"><p>So I guess you&#39;re not rich and powerful then? Probably because you&#39;re a decent law abiding person who thinks of others and doesn&#39;t ruthlessly and tirelessly pursue monetary gain.</p>

<p>I would think that in order to become rich and powerful enough, to a point where you can influence populations, you might have to exploit people, take advantage of loop holes and such and as the saying goes - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. </p>

<p>This sub is most likely populated with pessimistic types anyway (look at any of the submissions). If some wealthy people tried enriching the lives of the poor, I think some other rich types would see this as a bad example that makes them look bad and would probably work to destroy them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve been in a position to take bribes or rise to a position of authority by colluding or at least ignoring malicious corruption and have never taken the bait, not because I&#39;m necessarily a better person or even a good person, really, but because my brain is wired that way. I have little interest in controlling others, I&#39;m far more interested in creating fantastic works and building a clean legacy for myself.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t sit around plotting ways to control people. I sit around thinking of ways to design better cities, better living spaces, better ecosystems, and spending my spare time philosophizing and theorizing on inspiring ideas.</p>

<p>I used to work on a farm in the summertime when I was a teenager. The idea of sitting around spending the majority of my time obsessed with manipulating whole populations of primates (human beings) is akin to sitting around on a farm deriving some sort of glory out of - and justifying my superiority complex by - manipulating a barn full of dairy cattle.</p>

<p>Being a dictator is a hell of a boring way to spend your life when you could be focusing your energy on your own healthy self-development. Being a dictator in and of itself is a symptom of unhealthy self-development. You can&#39;t be right in your mind and oppressing millions of people at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not strange at all and it&#39;s not as rare as you claim. This subreddit quite frequently celebrates the results of &quot;benevolent conspiracies&quot;.</p>

<p>That is, if you&#39;re extending the definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot; to mean &quot;any discreet agreement of purpose among some group of people.&quot;</p>

<p>This subreddit (and most &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; forums in general) are focused on conspiracies which are not in the public good (they may be &quot;benevolent to an inner circle, but not to society as a whole). The sidebar...</p>

<p>over there --&gt;</p>

<p>says &quot;a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful&quot;, which falls outside of &quot;benevolent&quot; in the context of your post.</p>

<p>The problem I&#39;m struggling with in responding to your post and recent question is that they are not, typically, what is considered &quot;conspiratorial&quot; because they&#39;re not motivated to harm or deprive the many in favor or to the benefit of the few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about that. People have been taught to be unreasonably cynical and view optimism, positivism, and utopian ideology as foolish hogwash. The only reason we as a society are so fascinated and preoccupied with violence and conflict is because we&#39;ve been trained to deprive ourselves (and each other!) of joy, love, and healthy fellowship.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s starving for peace and quiet, and a basic healthy standard of living. The average person desperately needs a little utopian philosophy but if the malicious powers that be allow us to dwell on utopia rather than dystopia we may start to desire that type of lifestyle for ourselves and will become disgruntled if we are not allowed the same basic human rights that are portrayed in utopian fantasy films or television shows (clean water, safe shelter, healthy food, access to good quality medicine, peace of mind, a healthy ecosystem).</p>

<p>TLDR: Malicious PTB won&#39;t allow utopian television shows or movies, which is why there are so few of them, because it may give people funny ideas and spur them to fight for a healthy standard of living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your optimism, unfortunately I don&#39;t share it. As a species we evolved in an environment that encouraged violence and beating anything that got in your way in the pursuit of food, mating, shelter etc. Co-operation and &#39;civilisation&#39; came much later in our evolution. Others from the same species were always something to be wary of, even afraid of, because they compete for the same resource as you and will most likely injure or kill you for their own gain.  The idea of utopia is a grand dream, but I can&#39;t see our basic animal nature allowing us the chance. No matter how much you yearn for it and work towards it, there will always be another who wants to tear down what you built through greed or envy. This is why there can never, ever be peace on earth. We are not built for it.  We haven&#39;t been taught any of this, we are born this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, while we may spout &quot;equality for all&quot; and advocate it, human beings are not all the same species. We are all hybrids of different hominid species. This is not a popular opinion, but different species have different behavioural traits. This is also not a popular opinion, but some of us are more evolved than others, or at least have been fortunate enough to be blessed with above average critical reasoning and empathic abilities. The problem with discussing these findings is that some people use this information to advocate eugenics or racial superiority, which is malicious and xenophobic.</p>

<p>Point being, I think there are warring humans, and peaceful humans, and we can&#39;t all be lumped into the same species. Personally, I am a peaceful human. If war came to my region I wouldn&#39;t stay and fight, I&#39;d pack all my belongings, meet up with my folk, and migrate somewhere peaceful. Most people stay and fight though. And die or are oppressed. Which confuses me to no end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be interested in hearing more about the mixing of the hominid species. I was aware of the recent discovery of the homo-neanderthalensis genes present in our DNA, I didn&#39;t know there were others. You&#39;re right about those opinions being unpopular, but I think, and don&#39;t take this the wrong way, I also believe them to be dangerous. The amount of cross breeding the human race has done over the thousands of years of our evolutionary history pretty much ensures we will all have some DNA from each species of hominid, we are all hybrids. I do not believe that any of us is either more or less evolved than any other, in the same way that wildly different-looking dogs are all the same species and are as evolved as any other dog and should all be afforded the same individual rights. </p>

<p>As for running when conflict arises, this is always going to be the most sensible option. But is it going to lead to the most desirable outcome? Imagine that an invading army comes and lays siege to your town, you may have no choice but to fight to survive.  Also, what happens when this invading force continues to encroach on the land in which you live. If you manage to escape, great! But then where do you go? Where is safe for you and your family? The next country? The next continent? As long as they let you in, fine, but what if they don&#39;t?  Human beings will always covet their neighbours land and resources, hence there will always be war somewhere. </p>

<p>I do not believe that any of us is either more or less evolved than any other, in the same way that wildly different-looking dogs are all the same species and are as evolved as any other dog and should all be afforded the same individual rights.</p>

<p>Hm. Except wildly different-looking dogs have wildly different behavioural traits and physiological characteristics. The Labrador Retriever has webbed toes and a layer of fat that most other dogs do not possess, to enable it to swim in freezing water to fetch wild fowl. It&#39;s not so much that the Labrador is <em>more</em> evolved than other dogs but simply more equipped to perform certain tasks. Labs aren&#39;t <em>better</em> they&#39;re just <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>So too with humans. Some of us have behavioural and physiological characteristics that enable us to perform specific tasks better than the average person. Doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re <em>better</em> than the average person, only <em>different</em>.</p>
