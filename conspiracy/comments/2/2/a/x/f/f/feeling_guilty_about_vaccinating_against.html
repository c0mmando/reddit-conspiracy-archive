        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all I am posting this here and not in a parenting or advice subreddit because there is this huge pro-vaccine circle jerk movement on reddit and I want to get opinions from people who are on both sides of the fence not just a bunch of people telling me to get my kid all the vaccines asap. Forewarning: this is really long and ranty.</p>

<p>My son is 18 months old and I just got him his first two shots last week. I held off because his dad is very anti-vaccine, and very much a conspiracy theorist. We have close friends with kids who haven&#39;t vaccinated and are very against it. I am agnostic about conspiracies usually, and am on the fence about vaccines. I have actually had more people in my life try to talk me out of vaccinating rather than into it.</p>

<p>I was with my baby-daddy for most of the pregnancy but we split up right before the birth. He has a lot of paranoid delusions and thinks people in the government and in his personal life are plotting against him. He believes conspiracies he&#39;s read about and ones he has entirely made up on his own. He has grand delusions that he is really important and people are watching him and basing global trends on his actions. He will not agree to disagree, he will flip out or continue calmly arguing his point until the other person flips out or shuts up.</p>

<p>When I tried to bring up the vaccination issue recently he brushed me off. He said he&#39;s gotten cut by rusty metal and not gotten tetanus and he&#39;d rather his son have no tetanus than inject him with just a little bit. When he&#39;s talked before about why he&#39;s against vaccines he has this Darwinian &quot;kids who are gonna die of measles should probably just die&quot; speech. He also likes to talk about what a strong immune system our son has. I&#39;m not really worried about our kid dying of whooping cough either, but I don&#39;t really feel comfortable with him infecting a kid with a weaker immune system who then dies. I don&#39;t think he has done research as much as he has a strong distrust of mainstream authority and assumes if Steve Quayle and Natural News are against it then it&#39;s bad. He is totally into Steve Quayle even though he is not Christian or conservative and most of the people who read that site think people like him are gonna burn in hell with Barack Obama the anti-christ.</p>

<p>I am a little concerned about the aluminum and mercury content and the possibility of the side affects that are known risks. I have looked at research for both sides and it all is so fear based and makes me feel like either way I&#39;m a bad parent. I think flu shots are a scam and that vaccinating for hep B is a good idea but shouldn&#39;t be done right after birth unless the mom could be a carrier. I wanted to get our son vaccinated for polio and tetanus, and was willing to compromise on mmr and chicken pox since he feels so strongly about it. I decided to just get him vaccinated without dad&#39;s consent or knowledge (tdap and polio). I&#39;m feeling really guilty and worried about future shots. The doc I went to said he requires his patients get all vaccinations except flu. I really liked him overall, but I can switch if I decide to not get all the shots. He was somewhat understanding of my concerns and said if I come every 6-8 weeks and get 2 shots at a time my son will be caught up within a year. Now that he&#39;s older and has had time to build his immune system naturally, I&#39;m less concerned with him getting both vaccine reactions and vaccine preventable diseases. Both are horrible and unlikely but scary as fuck. </p>

<p>I am concerned about his dad finding out. We have 50/50 custody with no official agreements. We are on good terms and I believe he is a good parent. We are both very flawed people. I don&#39;t want to tell my son to keep secrets from his dad but thats what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t want to lie to him if he notices the injection mark. I feel like no matter what I do it&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>TL;DR son&#39;s dad is anti-vaxxer and I&#39;m debating vaccinating secretly against his will</p>

<p>So how?  Because I am having trouble with a couple of stalkers, seems to be the same one or two, but many names, same techniques/style. I just don&#39;t respond to the comments and move on, but they persist, it is a little creepy to continue to receive nonsensical and leading comments after saying bye, discussion over.</p>

<p>So how to tag?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, Then  you might have a way to  have your kid get  Shots he legitimately needs( do research, since the polio and Tetanus shots are definitely needed), and  Also A way to   logically Explain to your Ex Boyfriend which vaccines are good and which definitely aren&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to take a chance here, with my regular account, not a throw away.  You said you wanted opinions from people on both sides of the issue, and even though I do not think that I have a side I will tell you of my experiences.  My kids are not vaccinated.  I never set out to not vaccinate.  My parents vividly remembered whooping cough, diphtheria, and polio outbreaks, and I remember my brother getting measles when I was four. (1964) The doctor came to our house, and I can still feel the fear of the darkened room.  I was given a gamma globulin injection and came down with a weak version.  When my oldest was born in &#39;94 he had had a hard time getting here so our doctor said to keep him away from others to prevent HIB, and to give his first DTAP at 2-3 months.  I remember being brave but knowing it would not be fun for him.  My husband was talking to him and he was so cute and laughing, and then his face crumpled and he cried.  It took a session of breastfeeding before he was calm enough  to put him in his car seat for the drive home.  He fell asleep on the drive back, and did not wake when I put him in bed.  About an hour later he screamed.  It is still the most heart wrenching scream I have heard.  His wail was a keening noise, his eyes were rolled back and his back arched.  He could not stop to breathe.  I called the doctor, and he said to meet him at the ER, where we spent several tense hours with oxygen and constant monitoring. It took a week before he was latching on properly and smiling again.  What if we had had an ace of a kid and took his edge off of him by that set of shots?  I will never know.  His doctor told us that we should not give him further vaccines.. He wrote us a letter for his health records.  Two years later and we had a second son.  We waited for four months,  did the DTAP with him, and this time went through keening, uncontrollable crying, followed by a severe temperature drop and hours of lethargy, and no nursing. His leg swelled up so bad his knee could not bend.  My husband and I said fuck this, Never again.  Our two younger sons have not had a single shot.  Do I worry?  You bet I do.  I homeschool because, partly this issue.  And I worry about people thinking I am some uneducated hick, conspiracy nut, or religious whack-job.  I am not.  My kids are all healthy.  I want my older sons to make up their own minds about the HPV, hepatitis and meningitis vaccines, and they have discussed them with me.  I sort of hope they do, but...I cannot tell you that I think it a good idea to vaccinate your son, and not tell his father.  The issue is trust, not vaccines.  If you have a cooperative relationship with the father, being sneaky on this, might ruin that.  I want to point out that it bothers me how frequently the officially recommended schedule of vaccines have changed since I had my first son, twenty years ago.  The sheer number of shots is astounding, starting almost as soon as the kid arrives, and I cannot help but think if this was such a sure thing, why all the changes?  I am not on the autism band wagon, but neither am I on the rah-rah-pro all vaccine wagon, either.  I am not advising one way or the other on the shots, but I am advising you to keep honesty in your relationship with your ex.  If you feel strongly that you should vaccinate, maybe he should come with you to talk to the doc about it.  I can tell you most kids do not have severe reactions, and it will make your life easier when it comes to school registration.  It is not a law, but, boy, do they hate non vaccinated kids. Also, check out The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).  If they were as safe as they say, it is a bit disconcerting at how much money has been paid out, and under very strict guidelines, too.  Best of luck, and happiness to you and yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your two children, whom you&#39;ve probably invested into your own fear of getting shots you deem harmful (even though there is tons of evidence to the contrary), became deathly afraid of a pinprick that could have saved their lives. &#39;His leg swelled up so bad it couldn&#39;t bend&#39;? Sounds like allergies, not some harmful substance designed to kill people. Did you get him tested for medicinal allergies? I bet you didn&#39;t, and blamed it straight on the vaccines.</p>

<p>You know what happens to a child that falls harmlessly and sees its parents worry and fuss? It starts to cry. You know what happens to the same child of whom the parents laugh and ensure it isn&#39;t a big deal? It gets up and laughs it off. This is no different.</p>
