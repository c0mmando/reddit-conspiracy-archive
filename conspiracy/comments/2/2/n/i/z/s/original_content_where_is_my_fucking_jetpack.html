       As told by history, after Tesla's death
       <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">
        the FBI was contacted by the War Department (now know as the less ominous Department of Defense)
       </a>
       , his papers were declared to be top secret. If you read up on Patent Law, you may find some interesting information: The U.S. Patent Office has a nine-member committee that screens patents in order to protect "national security".
       <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181">
        U.S. Code › Title 35 › Part II › Chapter 17 › § 181
35 U.S. Code § 181 - Secrecy of certain inventions and withholding of patent
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whenever publication or disclosure by the publication of an application or by the grant of a patent on an invention in which the Government has a property interest might, in the opinion of the head of the interested Government agency, be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner of Patents upon being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent therefor under the conditions set forth hereinafter.

       If Tesla's claim about free energy and anti-gravity are true, the consequences to the world economy and world powers would change the world overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories all over the world, yet never see the light of day. If the new energy technologies were set free world wide the change would be profound. It would affect everybody, it would be applicable everywhere. These technologies are absolutely the most important thing that have happened in the history of the world.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it on the ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety, at higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of "holes in the air" or downward currents. It will ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in a wind, for great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanical action." - Nikola Tesla in New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 15, 1911

       If you had a flying machine powered by an infinite energy source, it would render international borders useless. No more "no-fly" lists, TSA, groping... basicaly all forms of government control of the masses would collapse. Some of the companies that would take a hit:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        J P Morgan (banking, energy, railroads, US Steel)
       </li>
       <li>
        Edison &amp; General Electric (oil &amp; energy, railroads, aviation, war industrials, banking)
       </li>
       <li>
        Rockefellers (oil, banking, Nazi connections through IG Farben)
       </li>
       <li>
        Rothschilds (banking, oil &amp; natural resources, connections to Kuhn Loeb &amp; company through Jacob Schiff )
       </li>
       <li>
        Ford motors (motors, war industrials)
       </li>
       <li>
        Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co (banking, ship yards, railroads, IG Farben)
       </li>
       <li>
        Du Ponts (chemicals &amp; war industrials, General Motors, IG Farben)
       </li>
       <li>
        Vanderbilts (railroads, ship yards)
       </li>
       <li>
        Boeing Company (aviation)
       </li>
       <li>
        Lockheed (aviation)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Oil &amp; energy, steel and other natural resources, railroads, ship yards, aviation, car industry, spare parts, logistics, banking &amp; finance, military industrial complex are some of the reasons to steal and keep this technology hidden.

        June 1989:

Inventor Adam Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate a small version of his Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator at the UN in New York.  At the last minute Trombly was forced to do his demonstration at a church down the street.  Afterwards Trombly gave a speech in Dag Hammarskjöld Auditorium at the United Nations in front of an international audience. A few days later, Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate the same device at the US Senate Banking and Finance Committee in Washington. Only Senator Carl Levin and a "handful" of staff were in attendance because the Senior Bush Administration called hundreds of Senators, Congressional Representatives and their staff members for an "off-the-cuff" discussion of the Clean Air Act at the exact same time as Trombly’s demonstration.  The oil administration successfully diverted attention away from the technology in an effort to censor Trombly. Subsequently his lab was raided by the FBI, millions of dollars of equipment was taken and he was threatened and required "for reasons of national security" to cease his research.

       An elite group of people and the corporations they run, have gained control over not just our energy, food supply, education and health care, but over virtually every aspect of our lives. And they do it by controlling the world of finance, not by creating more value, but by actually controlling the source of money. When you follow the money, it will take you to up the levels of a pyramid. We are at the bottom level, going about our daily lives. Above us is government, people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control us, whether or not we agree. But who controlls them? At the next level are the corporations. Many would say that it is now corporations (a "corporatocracy") and not nation states, that rule the world. To acquire the world's resources and control the markets, this corporatocracy must to have access to cheap money. The big corporations get their loans with special rates from big banks, which means that those who control the major banks, the money elite, ultimately control the corporations which in turn control goverments and finally the people.

       This is probably true. People before recorded history were a lot more tuned to the frequencies of the universe, like animals that guide their navigation by means of Earth's magnetism, which is where this "aether" energy source supposedly comes from. In essense, our "civilized" society has devolved rather than evolved since this knowledge has been lost/hidden from the rest of society.

       It's definitely been hidden rather than lost.  And I think a huge part of the reason why the people today aren't as "in tune" has to do not only with our shittier diets but also with the effect of background radiation from 70 years of nuclear energy/detonations/waste being let loose all over the world (among many other things, but those are probably two of the main ones).

       So... why would 'rogue' states other entities cooperate in preserving the status quo? Why did Nazi Germany play by the rules of American patents and corporations when they ran out of oil? Why is Iran futilely attempting to construct nuclear reactors? Why is China destroying their own soil with mining and fossil fuel pollution? Why is North Korea still in a virtual dark age?

       If you read the post, you will see how I state that banks run the show. As George Carlin put it, they don't care about you. At all. They don't care if you're Chinese or African. If keeping people in line and dependent of any government means destroying something in the process, so be it as it has been.

      <p>
       Wayne Henthron - from Los Angeles built an "Electrometric Auto" in 1976 that managed to regenerate its own electricity. In normal stop and go driving it gave several hundred miles of service between recharges. The system worked by the wiring of the batteries to act as capacitors once the car was moving along with four standard auto alternators acting to keep the batteries charged. With little official interest in his system the inventor resolved to make the car available to the public to do so, is now involved with the World Federation of Science and Engineering - 15532 Computer Lane, Huntington Beach, CA, 92649.

        Source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Joseph R. Zubris - developed in 1969 an electric car circuit design (

        US PAT #3,809,978

       ) that he estimated cost him $100 a year to operate. Using an old ten horse electric truck motor, he worked out a unique system to get peak performance from his old 1961 Mercury engine that he ran from this power plant. The device actually cut energy drain on electric car starting by 75%, and by weakening excitation after getting started, produced a 100% mileage gain over conventional electric motors. The inventor was shocked to find the lack of reaction from larger business interests, and so in the early seventies began selling licenses to interested smaller concerns for $500. Last known address was Zubris Electrical Company, 1320 Dorchester Ave, Boston, Ma, 02122.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Diggs - developed at an inventors workshop (I.W. international) his "Liquid Electricity Engine" that he believed could power a large truck for 25,000 miles from a single portable unit of his electrical fuel. Liquid electricity violated a number of the well known physical laws that the inventor pointed out. The inventor was also aware of the profound impact the invention could have upon the world's economy - if it could be developed.

       ) - a 65 year old Swedish inventor made a major breakthrough in the field of Thermo-electric engines with his "Hot and Cold Engine" - based on the fact that wires of different metals produce electricity if they are joined and heated, the inventors secret breakthrough is said to give more than 30% more efficiency than regular motors, and with a radioactive isotope for power (hmmm?!) it could be completely free from oil.
Volvo of Sweden bought the rights to this in 1975.

       Firstly, that doesn't take away from the fact that there isn't a prototype of any sort that I can see (which is especially weird considering this is the era of the internet). Secondly some of the evidence he uses are not that great. For example Eugene Mallow, who's murder is usually attributed to a robbery, not intentional assassination. Stanley Meyer, who was actually sued for defrauding investors with his inventions, and for good reason. And a few others. So in short, I question wether there even
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       such orders, or if it's just people trying to get publicity for their "inventions" by claiming they are being actively suppressed (which is actually a pretty good way to get publicity mind you).

       So you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       live in land of conjecture and opinion. Look kid, I know your thing is debunking stuff, but your flimsy arguments just don't hold any water. Tesla proved Edison wrong, so what makes you right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to bet you would be the one in the crowd watching and cheering as Edison electrocuted the elephant to prove how "dangerous" AC was.

       Faking an assassination is easy. If you think it's impossible maybe you shouldn't spend anymore time in this sub before your mind effectively explodes. Not that it would be a bad thing.

       You too have made some flimsy arguments. And my Tesla got things wrong argument does still stand. That's not to say I've never made flimsy arguments, but I'd disagree that all of my previous arguments are flimsy.

       In the era where information can easily be accessed/distributed via the internet, I'd think someone would have posted such things for others to make prototypes of, and for someone to then have made a prototype of said device. That was what I was getting at with that point.

       Ohhokie1 you clearly are an idiot, search up "how to make free energy tesla" into google there should be some videos on how to make the concept for radiant energy using less then 100$ in supplies which is not much i might add, i tried it out and made teslas concept radiant free energy device and it proves that there is free energy even though i could only get up to 1 volt ( i live in a high rise so it works better for me )out of nothing, it still proves his theory and makes it fact, once again if you haven't been told this before do some RESEARCH before you go talking out somewhere the sun dont shine.

       C. Even still, it's technically not "free" energy. He's not claiming free energy, which is an efficiency greater than 1. He's simply claiming a cheap source of energy readily available. While technologically and intellectually it would be incredibly advanced, it's no more "free" than wind power, solar power, etc.

       Free energy does not mean "we can do this practically for free, in terms of monetary cost"
      </p>
      <p>
       Free energy means you are literally creating energy, rather than changing it from one form to another. Creating energy from nothing is impossible, it doesn't take much thinking to figure that out.

        As for the claims that this power was “free energy” not just in its inability to be metered but also its generation, it seems that they stem from ignorance of how Tesla had designed the facility; the transmitter was to be powered by a 200 kilowatt Westinghouse alternating current generator driven by a Westinghouse auto compound engine. Some conspiracy theorists claim instead that it was to be powered by Tesla’s apparatus for the utilization of radiant energy,” but again, the conspiracy theorists fail to understand that “radiant energy” isn’t “energy all around us,” but rather, is defined as energy in the form of electromagnetic waves– in essence, what Tesla patented is no more a “free energy” device than a solar panel is.
In fact, in the patent, Tesla specifically mentioned that “The apparatus being arranged as shown, it will be found that when the radiations of the sun or of any other source capable of producing the effects before describe fall upon the plate P an accumulation of electrical energy in the condenser C will result.”  This isn’t nearly as mind-blowing as somehow tapping into the æther for an unlimited power source would be, but then again, isn’t it par for the course for conspiracy theorists to pretend reality isn’t interesting enough?

       It has nothing to do with
       <em>
        creating

       energy.  It has to do with
       <em>
