<p>I mean....AIPAC might fit the bill, but even that&#39;s pretty public about their lobbying efforts and where the money&#39;s coming from. But...many of the posts here just arn&#39;t about AIPAC...they&#39;re about U.S. military aid and shit...which like I said, both Kissenger and Conservatives have rather openly laid out their reasons for. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t agree with the relationship, by all means, all the power to you, but I think that many posts here on the matter are more appropriate for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because dual citizens hold posts that allow them to manipulate the process to channel us taxpayer funds to a country that normally wouldn&#39;t be receiving them. The average non-coastal American could give two fucks about Israel&#39;s security. We&#39;re more concerned with things like jobs, housing and food ....here in America. But through influence peddling, blackmail and outright bribery the agenda of the Israeli Govt. (Not the jewish people as whole) takes center stage and usually gets it&#39;s way. Also for an ally they have a pretty large intelligence(mossad) presence here , they&#39;ve spied on us and been caught numerous times and they tend to target American companies and the govt. when it comes to theft of intellectual property/technology. But despite all this they still get sweetheart foreign aid and defense deals. In all fairness we treat the saudi&#39;s the same way and they&#39;re equally as shitty on the same level.</p>

<p>So? You know how much the military is spending, you know how much they&#39;re cutting. You see the process right before your eyes and critize it on the surface. That&#39;s my point. </p>

<p>The Israeli arms dealer selling weapons to Iran <em>is</em> a conspiracy and we should posit theories about whom he is connected to and what his motivation is. </p>

<p>But official military relationship between that of the United States and Israel are not conspiracies. They should be criticized, sure; held up as a secret master plan? No. Because they&#39;re not.

<p>So what are you saying?

<p>Their budget should be cut 90%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see the process right before your eyes and critize it on the surface.</p>

<p>Wealth iniquality in America is public information. So how come what Americans think the rich take in is so freakishly far off from what&#39;s happening?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, good question, r conspiracy has some of the group who say every fault on the planet is caused by Jewish Bankers, the Jewish NWO, and in an extraordinary bit of confusion, the Jewish led neo-cons. (extraordinary because as you say conservatives are openly supportive of Israel, have always been.) </p>

<p>You are forgetting that other old and strong branch of U.S.  conservatism, still unacknowledged by most elected Republicans and/or the remaining conservative Democratic.  </p>

<p>That particular branch of conservatism was the root of U.S. Conspiracy movement,</p>

<p>until the acts of the 1960s, the assassinations,  all the CIA programs we have been discussing here, plus Watergate, Iran Contra, 9/11, Iraq War, N.S.A. programs etc. </p>

<p>They are still part of U.S. conspiracy movement and part of this sub.</p>

<p>Nope, just offering perspective. You&#39;re offering a reddit search result as some sort of fact, that&#39;s way worse.</p>

<p>r/politics is a conspiracy anyway, it&#39;s called r/politics but it&#39;s got the white house in the header, shouldn&#39;t r/politics be about general political discussion and r/usapolitics be about American politics and r/worldpolitics be about every country&#39;s politics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading you&#39;re comments here makes me think the jidf is paying you pretty nicely, but I&#39;ll bite. For starters ill concede that some posts here could be better suited for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and some could be in both.  I also can&#39;t speak for why anything here is one way or another, I&#39;m just a user.</p>

<p>My reasons though, are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The public knowledge on how much we give them/support them isn&#39;t known by most, and purposely so.</p></li>
<li><p>That we send billions there while there is so much suffering here.</p></li>
<li><p>That the legitimacy of the country of Israel is itself conspiracy/conspiracy related topic.  Therefor making the support of such one as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The injustices and crimes committed by the Israeli government yet our unwavering support.</p></li>
<li><p>Our support of Israel is a major reason of tension and conflict with an almost entire region of people and with the worlds second largest religion. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can expand on each and will probably think of more.  Hope this helps, look forward to hearing from ya!</p>

<p>Fuck you alright. I can&#39;t express my opinion without being labelled a fucking shill, are you god damn serious? Is my freedom of speech and expression not respected here, but instead trivialized and mocked? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t possibly hold a different opinion unless I&#39;m a paid Israeli shill. Fucking seriously dude, I&#39;m sick of the implication. It defeats healthy conversation and such off-the-deep-end accusations with no corroborating evidence is the very enemy of skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha ok bud, sorry to see you so butthurt about it.  I have to say I&#39;m not too surprised with you finding a reason not to address my points, but I digress.  For starters I never said &quot;paid shill would say&quot; as you apparently misquoted in your response.  I also never threw anything out a window, let alone everything.  You asked a question, I don&#39;t know how one throws that out a window when responding?  Next shills/jidf are far from a &quot;off-the-deep-end accusations.&quot; (also why plural? i mentioned one thing...singular)  Shills and the jidf are a very real enemy and problem here of what you claim to want, &#39;healthy conversation.&#39;  I reaaaally hope you&#39;re able to get the rest of that sand out of your vagina soon.  Look forward to your response saying how you wont respond!</p>
