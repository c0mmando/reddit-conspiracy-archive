<p>The FDA and the doctors in their infinite wisdom approve and distribute dangerous addictive drugs that kill tens of thousands of people a year. The opiate problem is out of control, and much of the time it starts at the doctor&#39;s office. The biggest thing people are upset about are 50 non-fatal cases of the mumps?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s sort our priorities. The education system is a joke, whole cities are failing, generations of children are growing up in hopeless conditions in this country, set up to fail from the start. Why are people so angry at those who have the slightest misgivings about vaccination, when there&#39;s a million worse things going on in this very country to be angry about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If unvaccinated children are bringing diseases into vaccinated populations, they are now carriers infecting everyone, vaccinated and not.

<p>Unfortunately, viruses in their infante beauty mutate frequently, especially when they can pass so quickly within a population, like a crowed of unvaccinated children.

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense needed.</p>

<p>A vaccine contained culled or non-infectious live version of different viral strains. Our body&#39;s memory T cells imprint on the virus, creating a snapshot of the virus configuration and strain, to formulate appropriate antibodies.</p>

<p>There is limited to NO ability for the host to contract the strain issued in a vaccine. Despite what the media sometimes portray&#39;s incorrectly. Most likely individuals contracted the live strain prior to vaccination in those cases.</p>

<p>See what types there are:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bull shit.
The H1N1 vaccine did not cause narcolepsy, or a zombie virus.
Vaccines don&#39;t cause anything. Immune response to pathogen acquisition sometimes causes immune flare ups and auto-immune responses. This is so rare, and so far between, you&#39;re more likely to die from being run over by a pop machine. Stop fear mongering and do your research friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not peer-reviewed research sorry.
If you want to understand how or why this manifested in the children perhaps you should study auto-immune responses and how they activate following certain vaccines. There are no doubts potential and known side-effects. But I think we can agree the side effects of opiates, barbiturates, SSRI&#39;s, chemo-drugs etc have more severe side effects, and more common too....</p>

<p>The chances of contracting a negative side effect from the vaccine is akin to death by pop-machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that, nor implied it. I admit correlation, but not causation.
I simply said your &#39;media&#39; sources aren&#39;t peer-are viewed studies on the subject. They&#39;re written by reporters with basic to no scientific knowledge, and aren&#39;t considered science fact without being peer-reviewed by professionals in the field.</p>

<p>I know it exists, the point is WHY it exists. And my argument is that it&#39;s an unfortunate side effect. But again, pharmaceuticals are known for side effects, it&#39;s out of our realm of control as each individual reacts differently. And yes mistakes have been made with vaccines. But thankfully science is able to make improvements, reduce harm, and increase efficacy.</p>

<p>And yes, this is very debatable. Because people like you don&#39;t understand causation vs. correlation.</p>

<p>Because a side effect happens in a drug, we should stop using them? That doesn&#39;t bode well for chemotherapy, better tell those cancer patients. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>2009-2010 on the Pandemrix vaccine in Finland contributed 4-19 years observed an increase in narcolepsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They cite no sources, and only mentioned an increases they haven&#39;t even said for sure it was the vaccine that CAUSED this, they simply show a correlation. Do you understand what peer-reviewed means?</p>

<p>Again that is not a peer-reviewed source.
This is a peer reviewed source. And they even state the linkage is weak, and plenty more research needs to be done to determine if the adjuvants were indeed to blame. Your sources do not touch enough on this with the basis of fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The role of the adjuvant in particular warrants further research before drawing conclusions about the use of adjuvanted pandemic vaccines in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033536">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033536</a></p>

<p>And...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We consider it likely that Pandemrix vaccination contributed to the increased incidence of narcolepsy in Finland in 2010 in HLA DQB1*0602 positive children. Our observations warrant further studies on the role of different environmental factors as well as pathogenetic studies to understand how a vaccination/adjuvant and other environmental triggers can cause narcolepsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033723#pone-0033723-g003">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033723#pone-0033723-g003</a></p>

<p>So again, there is defiantly correlation, but no CAUSATION.
Please for the love of science understand that. Researchers now have to find other contributing factors, other than just &quot;assuming&quot; it&#39;s ONLY related to the vaccines. This assumption you&#39;ve made is UN-scientific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest that you give this article from the NIH a read:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/</a></p>

<p>And yes, there are, statistically, a greater number of kids with narcolepsy thanks to the H1N1 vaccine (certain lots of it anyhow). My brother is the parent of a vaccine-damaged child (as am I)--his kid was one of the unlucky narcolepsy patients (his kid must now take a drug called &quot;Xyrem&quot; to manage the narcolepsy twice daily.)</p>

<p>My son was damaged by the MMR--the day before &quot;shot day&quot; he was a perfectly healthy, happy little boy--now he has lost most of his speech and fine motor skills and spends the day either spinning in his Johnny Jump-Up or hugging himself furiously--he no longer wants the touch of his mother or me anymore.</p>

<p>DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS FEELS????</p>

<p>Sure, &quot;they&quot; tell us that vaccines are safe...but wait, isn&#39;t this the same &quot;they&quot; that fabricated a false H1N1 pandemic? The same &quot;they&quot; that caused three steel-framed skyscrapers to literally turn to dust? The same &quot;they&quot; that admits to doing radiation experiments on mostly low-income black people living in the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis? The same &quot;they&quot; that kills around the world--without cause or warrant--basically performing extrajudicial assassinations??</p>

<p>Hey, if you want to trust this group of slimeballs you go right ahead my friend. It doesn&#39;t matter to me. All that matters is that I have to look my son in the eyes every day (if and when he will even make eye contact with me...now) and realize that had I just listened to my instincts--just went with my gut feeling!--I would have a different boy--in fact, the one who is smiling into the camera at me in the picture I have on my desk (pe-MMR).</p>

<p>I did the research. Now I know that the research was &quot;cooked&quot; and I have to live with that every time I try, and attempt to, make eye contact with my son.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry little guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry that your son has regressed.  Really I am, but it&#39;s not the vaccines that did it.  </p>

<p>You want to believe that it&#39;s the vaccine.  You really do.  You&#39;ll believe any asinine story put out by people with vested interests in order to believe that something caused this.  Your son, who was happy and healthy, who was going to grow up to be the quarterback of the football team, or President of the United States, will not be now.  I get it - I&#39;m a parent too.  I can&#39;t imagine the pain and anguish this must be like.  You need a reason.  Someone to blame.  Someone to point the finger at and say &quot;This guy - this guy right here - he stole my child from me&quot;. Some reason to grasp at, because genetics and environmental happen-stance seems incredibly random.  Too random to be satisfying.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracy.  There&#39;s no boogeyman.  The people who push these conspiracies sell books, or make money off their YouTube channels, or solicit donations to their foundations.  They are the ones guilty of the same shams that people accuse Big Pharma of.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists like believing they know more than everybody else, because it makes them feel superior.  The smug satisfaction that&#39;s on every face of &quot;Well, you&#39;re just a sheeple, and don&#39;t know any better.  Everybody is too stupid and too weak to know what I know&quot;.  And yet, when asked for proof of any time, all I ever get is more questions.  A question is not proof.  It&#39;s just a question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry of everything that&#39;s happened to you, but listening to people that tell you that your son is the way that he is, because of <em>them</em> (whoever they may be) is simply you being manipulated.  Manipulated by giving you an object to blame, while lining their pockets with money and attention.  This used to be called religion - something people rally behind, with absolutely no proof, giving explanations with no basis in fact.  Here&#39;s the collection plate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whereas I truly do appreciate your heartfelt comments I just cannot get behind them.</p>

<p>I had a son who was walking and talking (at just over 13 mos!) one day--ONE DAY after the MMR I have the son that I have now.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to tell me that this is just coincidence?? Hell, even the packaging information for the vax listed &quot;autism and autistic spectrum disorders&quot; as an (albeit very small) &quot;side effect.&quot;</p>

<p>In this case it&#39;s pretty clear what caused my son&#39;s condition. I should have not bought into the pro-vaxxers arguments. That was MY fault and I ALONE am to blame for allowing an unsafe product to be injected into my son.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m telling you that it&#39;s just coincidence.</p>

<p>The packaging information will include absolutely everything - even things that are not causatively linked - to protect themselves against lawsuits.  If they put an item in there saying that a side effect was car accidents, it would be apparent that there&#39;s no causative effect - they were just protecting themselves from litigation by not omitting it.</p>

<p><em>EDIT: If this were not the truth, why would the entire heathcare industry assert and show proof of vaccine safety, only to freely admit it in vaccine packaging? They&#39;re going to run a gigantic conspiracy, then admit to it in product packaging, because they&#39;re afraid of lawsuits?  That&#39;s absurd.</em></p>

<p>If you followed the vaccination schedule, your son was injected six times between birth and 12 months.  If autism and vaccines were completely uncorrelated - as I and every other respected member of the scientific community have shown - then even in 3% of cases, autism will appear following an injection (assuming an acute onset) - six days for the vaccination, six days following it is 12 days of a 365 day life, or 3%.  If your vaccination schedule was somehow off (you went back twice or three times to space out the vaccinations) the odds are even higher, purely based on correlation and nothing else.  </p>

<p>If what you believe was true, the incidence of autism in the unvaccinated would be either significantly lower, or altogether absent.  It&#39;s not - it&#39;s actually the same.  If what you believe was true, the incidence of autism in societies like Japan - where the vaccines were delayed by 9 months - would have a similar delay in autism diagnoses.  It didn&#39;t.  The only difference there was that vaccine preventable diseases increased.  Every study - every shred of evidence - points that vaccines are largely safe and do what they say they do.</p>

<p>You want to blame yourself because it feels good to be able to explain the world.  There has to be a reason why this happened. There&#39;s not. Things happen randomly. When you can blame someone for this, you can still believe that your son wasn&#39;t always going to get this.  That&#39;s not as comforting, I know, to think this was always going to happen, but it was.</p>

<p>You are being manipulated to believe there is more here than there is.  It&#39;s how religions recruit people; it&#39;s how terrorists recruit seemingly intelligent people to blow themselves up in crowds; it&#39;s how the weak are contorted to serve the strong.  They find your pressure point, and they make you feel better.  They give you a target to hate because it stops you from blaming yourself as much - even though you&#39;re not to blame.  By doing so, you become a follower to them - they can control you.</p>

<p>I really am sorry things turned out like that for you, but it&#39;s really not your fault.  There is no one to blame.  This just happened.  Shit happens.  It&#39;s callous and flippant, but it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>They are anything but 100% proven.  9/11 has not been proven. JFK has not been proven.  MKULTRA was declassified, and did exist, and did awful things.  But that doesn&#39;t necessitate the existence of <em>every</em> other conspiracy.  Or secret project, which I&#39;m sure the government has thousands of.  </p>

<p>You have yet again, not shown any proof that <em>this conspiracy</em> - namely, that all vaccine and medical companies involved, have conspired to damage people by causing autism or asthma or any number of problems, on purpose <em>with a purpose</em> and hidden it.</p>

<p>Forget the rest, which is just chatter to muddy the issue.  Prove this to me. Just this.  Show me proof, and I&#39;ll gladly, and willingly, admit I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>Well the House Select Committee established the following 2 conclusions, based on the evidence available to them:</p>

<p>The term &quot;conspiracy&quot; is defined as: an agreement between persons to break the law in the future, in some cases having committed an act to further that agreement.  So, by that strict definition, the terrorists of 9/11 did commit a conspiracy.  But the colloquial &quot;conspiracy&quot; used by this board refers to an act by the government or large ruling body against the public.  This has not been proven.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not proof - that&#39;s &quot;a high probability&quot; based on acoustic examinations.  There&#39;s no shell casings.  There&#39;s no witnesses.  There&#39;s no film evidence.  There&#39;s no ballistics.  </p>

<p>As I just told the other guy, even if you believe the &quot;official narrative&quot; of 9/11, it&#39;s <em>still</em> a conspiracy by definition, my friend.  You&#39;re so caught up in proving me wrong that you forgot to even think about what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that they&#39;re lying?</p>

<p>And where&#39;s the third one that you alluded to in your initial comment when you said &quot;at least half&quot; have &quot;absolutely no basis in truth whatsoever&quot;?</p>

<p>As for Jekyll Island, even wikipedia concedes that it was a conspiracy:</p>

<p>&quot;Picture a party of the nation&#39;s greatest bankers stealing out of New York on a private railroad car under cover of darkness, stealthily riding hundred[s] of miles South, embarking on a mysterious launch, sneaking onto an island deserted by all but a few servants, living there a full week under such rigid secrecy that the names of not one of them was once mentioned, lest the servants learn the identity and disclose to the world this strangest, most secret expedition in the history of American finance. I am not romancing; I am giving to the world, for the first time, the real story of how the famous Aldrich currency report, the foundation of our new currency system, was written... The utmost secrecy was enjoined upon all. The public must not glean a hint of what was to be done.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so very much wrong with your statements.
Causation is not correlation. I&#39;m sorry for your issues, but have you ever had your child tested for Autism or other related diseases or disorders? There is NO link between MMR and autism, that study was faked and proven unscientific, retracted, and the gentlemen DR. Andrew Wakefield is now a disgraced former doctor accused of torturing innocent autistic kids for the sake of &#39;finding scientific proof&#39; which was proven to be false. And people like Jenny McCarthy, toting about how her child contracted autism from MMR vaccines. Only to be proven wrong when doctors indicated her son didn&#39;t actually have Autism, he suffered from an unrelated treatable condition.</p>

<p>A isn&#39;t always B, A doesn&#39;t always cause B, A and B may occur simultaneously, A May influence the start of B, A and B may be influenced by C...and so on. </p>

<p>So who are &quot;they&quot; you can&#39;t spew out a random allotment of random conspiracy theories that are unrelated. Somehow I don&#39;t think the questionable events of 9-11 correspond to vaccination reactions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&quot;did&quot; your research, or else you would truly understand the difference between causation and correlation. Like at all, even the tiniest glimmer of scientific hope has been lost on your comments. </p>

<p>Good luck, and please don&#39;t assume you have the answers, talk with a professional..... For the sake of your children at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh... You read abstracts and know it all? Read closer:</p>

<p>Study 1 -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period. Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion: parental reporting is not a &quot;causation&quot; this is not concrete, nor proving a thing, but a correlation. </p>

<p>Study 2 -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, we cannot draw definite conclusions regarding the link be- tween Al adjuvants and autism based on an ecological study such as the present one and hence the validity of our results remains to be con- firmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaks for itself</p>

<p>Study 3 -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t set out to prove anything, simply evaluated various claims based on research, inconclusive.</p>

<p>Study 4 -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stemming from this evidence, we suggest that an inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, might be related to pathogenesis of autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is inconclusive as well, they tested a very small population, and their research was never picked up by any mainstream journals for further testing. Only 3 authors? I wouldn&#39;t trust this fully.</p>

<p>See a few trends here!? I won&#39;t bother with the remainder. You spent 3 seconds on google, and I just spent 30 seconds of my time and IQ, again; showing your inability to discern scientific fact from using google to justify your opinion and bias. </p>

<p>Pay close attention to study 5 as it reviews all the reported literature and sums up my points for you. <strong>there is no link between MMR and Autism</strong> dispute what you believe! feel or think. <strong>you, are, wrong...</strong></p>

<p>TL;DR: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism. These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations. These studies, in concert with the biological implausibility that vaccines overwhelm a child&#39;s immune system, have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism.</p>

<p>All in the name of science, and education, I hope you learned something today.</p>

<p>Thank you, and goodnight!</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re telling me that the conclusions of the papers don&#39;t matter anyway since that&#39;s not &quot;how science works&quot; and they&#39;re only &quot;unfounded research papers&quot;.  Which is it?</p>

<p>Not to mention that everything I linked to provides actual data. Where do you think their &quot;research&quot; is coming from?</p>

<p>You are still demonstrating you have NO idea what you&#39;re talking about. The quotes I highlighted are the conclusions of the study. Again, they state they don&#39;t establish anything but correlation. Causation is indisputable evidence that their thesis is correct. They did not attempt that in your posted papers. So yes I am disputing you.</p>

<p>What do you do for a living may I ask? I&#39;m just trying to narrow down your lack of scientific understanding (no offence) if you&#39;re still in school, keep studying friend, hard!</p>

<p>You only read abstracts. You don&#39;t make conclusions without reading the study,knowing where the study was published, whether it was well received by the community, evaluating the methods of study, and reading the WHOLE study, not just an abstract.
You made up your mind that you had proof after 5 minutes on google, and no actual proof to substantiate your claims, at best, you provided links that prove MY point. <strong>causation IS NOT correlation</strong> please for the love of your personal deity understand that.</p>

It&#39;s a mostly unknown disease now, but will only stay that way if the rate of vaccination is kept high. Eventually if you keep it high enough it could go the way of smallpox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but we can&#39;t vaccinate well against the flu because it changes quickly, which is part of what makes it deadly. You can get the flu one year and it can still kill you the next. You can vaccinate against measles though, and it will drastically reduce your chances of getting it, so you should vaccinate for the sake of those who can&#39;t. Put yourself in the position if someone with an immune compromised child who cannot get vaccinated. The only thing keeping them safe is everyone else being diligent about vaccination. If you vaccinating against measles gives you no inconvenient, but decreases the chances of them getting a deadly disease, why not do it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For when you doubt science, you doubt what it means to exist in today&#39;s society. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No offense, but oh brother. All hail science and the way it has completely eradicated all problems on earth through its mighty and wisdomy ways. </p>

<p>80% of science is fueled by corporatism and capitalistic money-hungry, agenda-driven reasons. And above all that are ego-driven, self-serving scientists who know the only way they&#39;ll ever be published and taken seriously is if they pander to the above.</p>

<p>And after all that, don&#39;t get me wrong - I love science. I love the nature of observation and awareness, and that&#39;s much of what science SHOULD be about. Instead, it&#39;s used as a tool to tell people what to do, instead of how to look. It&#39;s used as a stick with which to beat anyone who has a wild idea or a differing opinion. This abstract concept called &quot;science&quot; is now a weapon instead of a finger that points to something to look at. It&#39;s a justification for hate speech, for removal of freedom, for eradicating everything that makes humans beautifully, poetically, magnificently chaotic and irrational. </p>

<p>And the SCARIEST part about science is that when people with differing opinions or the ability to spot a potential problem (like those within vaccinations) are browbeaten at best, and threatened with loss of life at worst, for simply asking a question, &quot;Should we look into this, scientifically, a little closer? Should we see if there&#39;s a better way?&quot;</p>

<p>Wow great statistic, did it hurt coming out of your ass?</p>

<p>Your views on science are misguided. There are of course instances of fraud. But the scientific community as a whole is responsible for everything we now have, and will have in the future, including being alive today. Without vaccines, majority of our 7 billion people would not be alive today, and our boarders would certainly not be open for travel.</p>

<p>You focus in so few instances of corruption, and let it taint your view of &quot;80%&quot; of science as a whole. If you lose faith in Science as a process what do you have left? Faith? Good luck. A world that suppresses science, and debates in the public the validities of scientific fact, without any proof to back it up, is not a world I want to be in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The frothing at the mouth blaming &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; is simply a ploy. They want a fight between pro and anti so no one will actually pause and question just how bloody effective are this vaccines? Why are so many of the people being infected already vaccinated? They already trot out the tired old &quot;herd immunity&quot; gag, but enough doctors have come forward to make that one pretty unstable. So it is best to make us fight so we do not pay attention the the man behind the curtain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically vaccines have been very effective, do you think smallpox just took a century off or something? Hospitals and clinics no longer stock the equipment to deal with polio because they never see it anymore. I think the main issue is they became a victim if their own success which lead to people going crazy with producing them, similar to how antibiotics were overused. But I don&#39;t think you can question the effectiveness of the principles and practice behind vaccinating, of which herd immunity is a central part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the sudden publicity has to do with several recent news stories regarding the re-emergence of diseases which haven&#39;t been seen in the US in decades. I think the most recent outbreak was mumps, and there were others before that. These are occurring exclusively in unvaccinated immigrant populations in large cities. I believe the sudden campaign against anti-vaccine people is simply a reflexive effort by progressives to deflect criticism away from immigration advocacy, and try to pin future outbreaks on Americans not endorsing vaccines.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even scarier are the number of fucking zealots and pop-culture zombies in these threads calling for people&#39;s kids to be taken away and people to be held down and injected.  Fucking terrifying stuff.  These people are playing with fire and they don&#39;t even know it.  Even if the hive is correct and vaccines are safe now, if these kind of policies get instituted this is exactly the sort of shit powerful people tend to take advantage of.</p>

<p>I know the &quot;Slippery slope&quot; argument is considered a logical fallacy, but in this case forcing medication on people is a slippery slope with some pretty good fucking precedent.</p>

<p>Negative reactions are <strong>common</strong>.   Severe negative reactions are way more common than anything the vaccines claim to prevent.  It is well established that the FDA, the CDC, and of course Big Pharma go to great lengths to try to shift the blame for negative reactions to anything other than the vaccines to falsify the statistics so they can continue raking in the money claiming it is &quot;safe&quot;.</p>

<p>My son was forced to have a 2nd MMR, after he had a severe negative reaction to the 1st one, or he would not be allowed to attend any school in the area.   I had a severe negative reaction to it as a child as well.</p>

<p>99.99% of the pro-vaccine community couldn&#39;t care less, and I guarantee they will down vote this en masse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a peer-reviewed paper to share that it&#39;s the whooping cough &quot;mutating in unvaccinated populations&quot; that&#39;s causing the problem?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s my understanding that the scientific community has expected, for 25 years now, that pertussis is going to mutate anyway and make a comeback. </p>

<p><a href="http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Citation/1987/02000/The_return_of_pertussis.1.aspx">Here&#39;s a paper written on pertussis in 1987</a>, and a relevant quote:</p>

<p>&quot;... a careful study of the changing epidemiology of pertussis in the United States reveals ominous trends. These trends reflect that with the continued use of present day pertussis vaccine, even if 100% compliance were achieved, it is unlikely that pertussis could be eradicated. In fact it is logical to anticipate resurgence of the disease with a change in the age groups affected.&quot;</p>

<p>The point isn&#39;t eradication by 100% in vaccinations. The point is to provide a stable basis for herd immunity. If even 90% of the population is vaccinated it creates a &#39;viral shield&#39; allowing the virus to likely end it&#39;s life cycle without finding a new host.</p>

<p>Like it or not viruses are designed to infect. They will always find a way. We cannot sit back and watch it happen, we have to act based on a threat. Do you know how many millions of people died from the Spanish flu in the early 1900&#39;s? If something similar were to envelop our population today, you wouldn&#39;t vaccinate yourself and your family? That would be akin to a death sentence in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of &quot;herd immunity&quot; is a bunch of hooey when it comes to vaccines. Why? Because they aren&#39;t effective enough.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that? If the vaccine WORKED, then there would be nothing to fear. You wouldn&#39;t have to worry about becoming infected because you are protected. Yet, frequently when there are outbreaks, fully vaccinated people are infected. </p>

<p>So why would that be? Herd immunity is supposed to be obtained so that those who can not get the vaccines are protected.</p>

<p>The other odd issue is this, the golden standard that proving something works is 95% or more success. A 5% error is allowed. Meanwhile, many vaccines have efficacies far less than 95% and some are significantly lower (even at its best, the flu vaccine is a mere 50% effective).</p>

<p>If those rates were being evaluated for any prescriptive medication, it would never be approved by the FDA.</p>

<p>Did you know that the CDC advises against people having titers done because it may in fact show that they are not immune? Their response to that is &quot;make sure you keep your immunization records up to date, because that is the proof that you are immune&quot;. WTF? If the titers are negative, people need to know.</p>

<p>I would love, love, love to see a national scale study done on titers for every disease we vaccinate for- something that checks the titers 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after immunization. I bet we would be shocked by the results.</p>

<p>Knowing these lunatics it would probably come up as the vaccines losing efficacy after 6 months and so they start recommending that the entire population have an entire battery of vaccination every 5 months....just to be safe.  </p>

<p>Vaccines are plenty effective, herd immunity will not be achieved if there is enough unvaccinated people running around mutating the disease. Herd immunity is a well documented, well researched area of epidemiology. The higher rates of unvaccinated children et al are the cause of the fluctuations in efficacy of vaccine immunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Hmmhmmm, sure. Then explain why there are fully vaccinated people during many &quot;outbreaks&quot;.</p>

<p>Explain why the CDC has switched from urging the elderly (who, for years, the CDC declared needed the vaccines, along with infants, the most) to get vaccinated, to urging young people around them to get vaccinated (because vaccines are not that effective in the elderly, at all.</p>

<p>Now, why did it take years to determine that vaccines are not, in fact, that efficacious in the elderly? Why wasn&#39;t this known during the development of various vaccines? How are they determining efficacy?</p>

<p>Is it through evidence of positive titers? Well, let&#39;s get 1,5, 10, and 20 year titer studies done.</p>

<p>Either they work or they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>&quot;In early clinical trials, the efficacy of a single dose of mumps vaccine was &gt;95%, but estimates of the effectiveness in field evaluations have been 62%–85%&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=6016061&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=6016061&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32261/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32261/</a></p>

<p>Note that in the mumps outbreak, the rate of infection for certain fully vaccinated populations was roughly equal to the rate of infection in unvaccinated children.</p>

<p>This happens all the time. And the CDC&#39;s answer? Well, there just wasn&#39;t enough herd immunity.</p>

<p>lolwhat? If the vaccines worked, then the vaccinated would not acquire the disease.</p>

<p>Acquiring a wild infection and establishing immunity to it naturally almost always confers lifelong immunity. When we don&#39;t see that with vaccines and the powers that be start talking multiple boosters, we might want to look a little harder at how effective vaccines really are.</p>

<p>But, but, rates of infections have dropped! Personal hygiene, household hygiene, uncontaminated water supplies, better nutrition, uncrowded living conditions, healthcare, barrier protections, and early identification and quarantine are wonderful at preventing the spread of infectious diseases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re essentially advocating for allowing children to contact MMR, polio, serious strains of the flu, and more? That&#39;s what vaccines do, without the risk of actually contracting the disease. They never ever claimed vaccines to be 100% effective! nor that herd immunity is req&#39;d 100% of the time. The goal is to get our society exposed to pathogens before they enter a population, or during, to slow the infection rate.</p>

<p>Your understanding if basic virology is limited to what you can google.</p>

<p>We can claim they don&#39;t work. Yet you&#39;re sitting here in a world that would be very grim without the invention of vaccines. Stop mixing in personal bias with science fact, and maybe we&#39;ll progress as a society. </p>

<p>And fact is we cannot survive in our modern world without vaccines. The unvaccinated world would drastically drop in population, suffering would be enormous, and the world would cry out for vaccines. Is that what your utopia looks like?</p>

<p>Our best defenses against the spread of infectious disease have and always will be healthy populations (adequate nutrition, adequate rest, adequate access to healthcare) in hygienic living conditions (clean without overcrowding) combined with early identification, quarantine, and the use of barrier protections.</p>

<p>How the hell do you think Ebola outbreaks are handled? With proper population education, the sources of outbreak are prevented and the spread of outbreak when it does occur is limited. For viruses that rarely kill or have few serious adverse outcomes, it is absolutely absurd to half-ass attempt vaccination. For those that do, the same methods that are utilized for Ebola would be fine. We have the resources and the levels of communication necessary to support that approach to something like polio.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>And I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from mild and less serious complications such as diarrhea to more serious ones such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia),otitis media,acute encephalitis (and very rarely SSPE—subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), and corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring). Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus. The death rate in the 1920s was around 30% for measles
- Gardiner, W. T. (2007). &quot;Otitis Media in Measles&quot;. The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology 39 (11): 614.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a 30% mortality rate is very serious! thankfully vaccines have made that less than 0.3% today! but that doesn&#39;t mean it will stay that low.</p>

<p>Our best defences are as you stated, but you&#39;re missing the biggest defence, immunity. Provided by vaccines, and exposure. It&#39;s far healthier and safer for our bodies to received a culled virus,than alive one, a trained monkey could tell you that. </p>

<p>Ebola is different than most viruses, the mortality rate is 90% +.
It&#39;s pathogenesis is different than most viral strains as well.
You cannot compare airborne illness to a virus that is non-related in terms of transmission. The infection routes are so different that would be like comparing water to ethanol.</p>

<p>Ebola is what I like to call the potential andromeda strain, with the right mutation, it could spread to majority of the world population wiping out the human race. Do you have any guess as to what would save humanity? A vaccine. And trust me, Ebola is the last thing you would EVER want to spread, google; hemorrhagic fever. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the late 1950s, even before the introduction of measles vaccine, measles-related deaths and case fatality rates in the United States had decreased markedly, presumably as a result of improvement in health care and nutrition. From 1956 to 1960, an average of <strong>450 measles</strong>-related deaths were reported each year (∼1 death/ 1000 reported cases), compared with an average of 5300 measles-related deaths during 1912–1916 (26 deaths/ 1000 reported cases) [2].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/Supplement_1/S1.long">Link</a></p>

<p>And in fact, the current death rate for a measles victim in good health in the modern world, with proper medical attention, is almost nil.</p>

<p>You are misconstruing what a fatality rate is. If the fatality rate of the disease (regardless of medical care) was actually 30%, then we would still have measles death in the U.S. every year since we have had outbreaks. But we don&#39;t and it isn&#39;t because of vaccinations. It is because it was an unremarkable childhood infectious disease, that when it occurred in healthy children, complication and deaths were few and far between. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to google Ebola. I know damn well what it is.</p>

<p>There are many viruses, that with the right evolution, could substantially put a dent in the human race. While we&#39;re talking of things we should be scared of, why don&#39;t you google &quot;prions&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the number of vaccinated people getting sick is statistically far lower than non vaccinated. Statistics, as in, non anecdotal evidence, which is what we&#39;ve both used.   </p>

<p>I mean, its kinda obvious. Before vaccinations, pretty much everyone got measles, mumps, rhubella, polio, pertussis, the list goes on. And people died from it all the time. Visit a cemetry with graves from around 100 years ago, a significant number of the graves are children who died to these diseases, it wasn&#39;t even news when it happened, because most families lost children to it, they even had the one headstone for multiple dead children. Since vaccinations, this has changed, so that a child dying from measles makes the national evening news because it just doesn&#39;t happen anymore.    </p>

<p>Vaccinations are effective, arguing against this is arguing against history. Vaccinations are as safe as any modern medicine. Children get sick and sometimes die from being given standard antiobiotics (eg, allergic to penicillin or the like), but the number who survive lethal infections because of them far far far outweighs the potential for risks.    </p>

<p>Antivaccination as a stance (as in, a broad stance against vaccination, not  stance that says &#39;I am worried not enough testing is done&#39;) is basically saying, &quot;i would prefer to return to a time when the number of children killed each year by measles, mumps, polio and pertussis was numbered in the thousands, instead of the tens&quot;. Is that position reasonable?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, I would not like to return to that time when we had far less access to clean water, good food, good hygiene...without access to these things we were definitely creating a disease environment.  There is quite a bit of evidence out there that shows that illnesses such as MMR and polio were steadily on the decline after World War II due to people eating better and not living in war torn poverty;  decline in these illnesses was happening before the vaccine was introduced. 
Dr Joseph Mercola, Dr Richard Moskowitz, and Dr Robert Mendelsohn are some Dr&#39;s who have written about this extensively.  Viera Scheibner is a micropaleontologist who wrote &quot;Vaccination: 100yrs of Orthodox Research Shows that Vaccines Represent a Medical Assault On The Immune System&quot;....it&#39;s a thought provoking read. </p>

<p>Louis Pasteur, the &#39;father of modern germ theory&#39; took much of his work and distorted it from fellow French Academy of Sciences member Antoine Bechamp. It would take hours to break down the fundamental differences here between the history of what went on, and each mans perspective on germs, disease and their environments, but needless to say; on Pasteurs deathbed, he admitted that Bechamp had been correct.  Unfortunately mainstream medicine continued to follow Pastures work and not Bechamp.<br/>
Had Bechamp&#39;s work not been distorted, we probably wouldn&#39;t be seeing vaccinations today or at the very least it would be an entirely different thing. </p>

<p>I find it incredible that people will knowingly admit to what is contained within a vaccine and on some level think that is ok to inject into the bloodstream. I recall a doctor laughing when I said there was formaldehyde in a vaccine...she said &quot;yes, but this table you are touching probably has more formaldehyde in it than a vaccine&quot;. I replied &quot;yes, but I&#39;m not injecting the table into my six month olds developing immune and neuro system am I&quot;. I can touch my babies diaper too, but if I injected it i reckon I might not feel too good either! </p>

<p>I also wonder about things like the pertussis vaccine being injected directly into the bloodstream.  Whooping cough is spread not through blood but through the mucous membranes and when someone comes into contact with it the body has a natural defence mechanism; a system of protocol in fighting it.  Injecting it bypasses all those natural defence systems.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m sure we could both go on and on and on about who&#39;s right, who&#39;s wrong and for what reasons. I&#39;ve come to see the vaccine debate as almost a religious one. You&#39;re either a believer or a non-believer, and neither one of us is likely to convert.  I absolutely respect the right of all people to do what they think is best for themselves and their children.<br/>
 I think however its important to understand that people who do not vaccinate do not take that decision lightly and usually spend a great deal of time researching...mostly because they are forced to constantly back up their decisions with as much information as they can...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, aside from the fact that pasteurs deathbed recantation is a fabrication, it kind of has no bearing on this debate. Even if pasteur did decide his ideas were wrong, subsequent decades of science have shown that germ theory is correct. Shit, the guy who figured out ulcers were created by bacteria did it by culturing a shitload of them in a beaker, observing them with a microscrope (you know, to make sure they were actually there) and then drinking the whole lot. He then got ulcers, caused by the germs, kind of blowing behamp out of the water.   </p>

<p>Secondly, vaccination has a proven to work even in cases where clean water and sanitation are not available (eg, the third world, today). Polio was on the decline in rural Afghanistan until the Taliban spread the word that he polio vaccine was actually given by the Americans to sterilise them. People stopped using it, and Polio is on the rise once again. fantastic for all those children with no access to first world medical care.   </p>

<p>Thirdly, if you&#39;ve exposed your child to car exhausts, you&#39;ve exposed them to a wonderful cocktail of chemicals from the exhaust which has got into their blood via their lungs. It sucks, but cars are convenient, especially in Aus where it is hard to get anywhere with a bicycle unless you live in a city (where everyone drives a bloody 4wd, for some unknown reason). I find it incredible that people are so pissed off at vaccines, yet are happy to breath in the air in cities, eat food grown hydroponically, touch plastic (which gets plenty of stuff into your blood via your skin), etc etc etc.    </p>

<p>It might seem odd to inject the pertussis vaccine into the bloodstream, when the disease is contracted via the air. But i think its because you&#39;re connecting two things that are unrelated. Think of it like a building with some awesome padlocks and doors on it, and a security team on the inside. The padlocks and doors are your mucous membranes, and you can improve them with healthy eating, exercise, washing your hands and avoiding unhealthy people. The security team is your immune system. The vaccine goes into your blood to train your security team, basically saying &#39;hey guys, if the bad guys get through the doors and locks, or maybe come in a back window when the doors are being tested by the common cold, here is what pertussis looks like, so get some training in on how to take him down&#39;. Think of a vaccine as training for your immune system.    </p>

<p>I worry about your last point. Many of the people I have had this debate with seem to have a very skewed or rudimentary understanding of how a vaccine actually works. You would think if they had done their research they would have a very concrete understanding of what medical science has to say about how they work.    </p>

<p>As to your second to last point, well, i agree. The sad thing is that people seem to switch sides because of the worst things. A recently vaccinated child suddenly gets terribly sick, leading to someone taking a stance against vaccination. An unvaccinated child contracts measles and dies, leading to the family to get vaccinated.     </p>

<p>Regardless of all that though, thankyou for a very civil discussion. They are few and far between when tackling this topic. I wish you and your family safety and health, regardless of which side of the road you choose to walk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An isolated anecdote and a very interesting story (I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I&#39;ll definitely look into this!), but it doesn&#39;t really mean much in the grand scheme of things. Unfortunately the situation in your small town is not the situation in the vast majority of the world. Perhaps there is some weird unexplained environmental factor coming into play, or perhaps the folks in your town have similar genetics and are unusually susceptible to disease. Keep in mind that polio, a disease that the general public thinks is a horrible scary nightmare, only caused disease in about 4% of people that became infected (the vast majority would never have known). Further, it only caused paralytic disease in about 0.1% of people that became infected. Still, we&#39;ve come up with a very safe means of eradicating this disease, so why not use it and save thousands of people from horrible, life debilitating paralysis?
Also, Australia is a very unique area, you are very isolated from the rest of the world and there are certain diseases that just aren&#39;t very common down under ;). Please wear sunscreen though!! I believe I&#39;ve read that 1 in 3 Australians will develop some form of skin cancer. Most skin cancer (even malignant skin cancers) are very curable if diagnosed early, so be sure to see your doctor promptly if you find any unusual lesions :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because it&#39;s so much more profitable for a company to make $30 on a vaccine than for lengthy tests, palliative care, end of life hospital care etc. 
what would you suggest? Say that this is some crazy world where vaccines actually are efficacious and have saved thousands of lives... Should they be free? How much money would too much? At what point is it a conspiracy because a company is charging a fee for their service?
I feel bad for people that see nefarious conspiracies everywhere... Most scientists are amazing people that work very hard to make the world a better place. A lot of corporations take advantage of their products to make money, but that is capitalism. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the best system (because it isn&#39;t..) but it&#39;s what we live in, and it doesn&#39;t mean that vaccines don&#39;t work. 
It&#39;s only frustrating to me because a person&#39;s decision not to vaccinate does not harm that person, it harms their child and other children that may come into contact with their child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most scientists? I&#39;m not getting the same impression.  People working in science are no more moral or socially conscious then any other group of professionals. The fact that the vaccine industry is a racket isn&#39;t a comment on Science or Scientists.  It&#39;s a comment on greed and lack of care. Making money is fine. Vaccines aren&#39;t free. Most vaccine development is financially motivated. Not about saving kids or what&#39;s best for humanity. Most. Not all. Being aware of that is a step towards promoting change. Why can&#39;t we have vaccines that are 100% safe and effective? Why promote and legislate useless, dangerous vaccines? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vaccines aren&#39;t useless. They are very, very safe, but of course they aren&#39;t 100% safe nor effective. There will never be a vaccine that is 100% safe or effective. We live in a culture of risk averse people that are scared of their own shadow. Medicine is NOT safe. Tylenol can kill you very easily. This isn&#39;t because some nefarious mad scientists thought it would be fun to torture the masses with a poisonous drug, it is because ANYTHING can kill you at the right dose (including oxygen, water, or snickers bars). 
Scientists certainly aren&#39;t all moral, and I doubt they are any more or less moral than any other large group of society, but that isn&#39;t the point. Human nature in general is GOOD in my opinion, and MOST people want to leave a positive mark on the world. If you have a different opinion regarding human nature, then you certainly will have a lot of different views about issues like vaccination, but you&#39;ll also be a pretty miserable person. 
I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re wishing for something that just isn&#39;t going to happen if you think we&#39;ll ever develop any sort of medication that works 100% of the time with absolute zero side effects. If you understood the incredible complexity of the human body, you would maybe have a better understanding of why this is. And this is coming from someone that has an incredibly good understanding of the human body from a societal point of view (medical school), but in reality has a piss poor understanding of how it works because we as a species have a piss poor understanding of how things work. We just aren&#39;t there yet. Sorry :/ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... ugh, it&#39;s a tough issue. I want to respect your autonomy because it IS your body. But the science really is there, and it&#39;s just a very, very weak argument against vaccination. In the end though, you may have changed my mind about something... personal autonomy is more important than big brother protecting you against something.
I&#39;ll tell you this though, and it means nothing because it&#39;s anecdotal based just on my experience, I don&#39;t know one person in my class that is &#39;in it for the money&#39;. I&#39;m $300,000 in debt to get my degree, but that is worth it to me because medicine fascinates me and I want to do good in this world. I want nothing more than to help people, and I think the best way I can do that is by being a doctor. I promise you that most doctors feel this way. I know there are some evil fucks out there that have no problem exploiting people&#39;s health problems for personal gain, but that is not most doctors (that I&#39;ve met and experienced). 
As long as I&#39;m comfortable and can afford to pay back my loans, I don&#39;t care how much money I make. I want to be a different doc that looks at the patient as a whole and tries my best to encourage their health without toxic drugs. Look into osteopathic medicine man, it&#39;s really a great philosophy. &quot;The human being is a unit of body, mind, and soul with innate healing mechanisms&quot;. I want to encourage people to attain health naturally in every case that is possible, and if that isn&#39;t possible, I will judiciously use modern medicine to do what I can to ensure their health. 
It doesn&#39;t mean much as a single person, but I&#39;m in this to help people. And with all that being said, I will certainly give vaccinations and recommend all of my patients vaccinate themselves and their children. When new vaccines come out, I will be cautious and do my research before subjecting my patients to a new drug. But regarding the majority of the vaccines that are out now, I will be employing them in my practice. </p>

<p>Edit: Sorry for the lengthy response, I just want you to know who I am and where I&#39;m coming from. You seem like a nice, reasonable guy, and I just don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m some evil dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of &quot;herd immunity&quot; is a bunch of hooey when it comes to vaccines. Why? Because they aren&#39;t effective enough.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that? If the vaccine WORKED, then there would be nothing to fear. You wouldn&#39;t have to worry about becoming infected because you are protected. Yet, frequently when there are outbreaks, fully vaccinated people are infected. </p>

<p>So why would that be? Herd immunity is supposed to be obtained so that those who can not get the vaccines are protected.</p>

<p>The other odd issue is this, the golden standard that proving something works is 95% or more success. A 5% error is allowed. Meanwhile, many vaccines have efficacies far less than 95% and some are significantly lower (even at its best, the flu vaccine is a mere 50% effective).</p>

<p>If those rates were being evaluated for any prescriptive medication, it would never be approved by the FDA.</p>

<p>Did you know that the CDC advises against people having titers done because it may in fact show that they are not immune? Their response to that is &quot;make sure you keep your immunization records up to date, because that is the proof that you are immune&quot;. WTF? If the titers are negative, people need to know.</p>

<p>I would love, love, love to see a national scale study done on titers for every disease we vaccinate for- something that checks the titers 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after immunization. I bet we would be shocked by the results.</p>

<p>80% of science.</p>

<p>Wow great statistic, did it hurt coming out of your ass?</p>

<p>Your views on science are misguided. There are of course instances of fraud. But the scientific community as a whole is responsible for everything we now have, and will have in the future, including being alive today. Without vaccines, majority of our 7 billion people would not be alive today, and our boarders would certainly not be open for travel.</p>

<p>You focus in so few instances of corruption, and let it taint your view of &quot;80%&quot; of science as a whole. If you lose faith in Science as a process what do you have left? Faith? Good luck. A world that suppresses science, and debates in the public the validities of scientific fact, without any proof to back it up, is not a world I want to be in.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, there <em>is</em> scientific evidence linking vaccines to autism.  Just because you choose to ignore or dismiss it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>And what authority do you have to be handing out parenting advice to strangers on the internet?  That&#39;s pretty fucking pompous on your part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong again.
Partially, because yes, science is my religion.</p>

<p>The scientific method is to test hypothesis and prove them right, not to just prove theories wrong.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like arguing that the existence of the welfare department is to keep people poor by encouraging them to remain jobless. That&#39;s just an inverse way to look at it.</p>

<p>Air, water and food do keep people alive, good job, you passed grade 1.
But what makes our water sources safe?  &amp; Delivered to your door? What grows your food? What allowed food production to be as amazing as it is today? Defiantly not science. </p>

<p>Your narrow views are depressing.</p>

<p>Most of the conspiracies talked about on here are mindless delusions.</p>

<p>Like what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was using a rhetorical technique to show how your argument was fallacious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference is that my argument wasn&#39;t an argument at all, I simply listed proven conspiracies.  There was nothing fallacious about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9/11 has not been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newsflash, my friend - even the &quot;official narrative&quot; is a conspiracy by definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JFK has not been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well the House Select Committee established the following 2 conclusions, based on the evidence available to them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy. Other scientific evidence does not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President. Scientific evidence negates some specific conspiracy allegations.</p></li>
<li><p>The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee is unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>You have yet again, not shown any proof that this conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did you get the incorrect idea that I was trying to?  All I was showing is that your implication that &quot;conspiracies are mindless delusions&quot; is itself a mindless delusion by pointing you in the direction of some proven ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forget the rest, which is just chatter to muddy the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit.  You&#39;re the one who went on the diatribe about how no conspiracies exist and that there &quot;is no boogeyman&quot; and all that bullshit which is why I was responding to you in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the number of vaccinated people getting sick is statistically far lower than non vaccinated. Statistics, as in, non anecdotal evidence, which is what we&#39;ve both used.   </p>

<p>I mean, its kinda obvious. Before vaccinations, pretty much everyone got measles, mumps, rhubella, polio, pertussis, the list goes on. And people died from it all the time. Visit a cemetry with graves from around 100 years ago, a significant number of the graves are children who died to these diseases, it wasn&#39;t even news when it happened, because most families lost children to it, they even had the one headstone for multiple dead children. Since vaccinations, this has changed, so that a child dying from measles makes the national evening news because it just doesn&#39;t happen anymore.    </p>

<p>Vaccinations are effective, arguing against this is arguing against history. Vaccinations are as safe as any modern medicine. Children get sick and sometimes die from being given standard antiobiotics (eg, allergic to penicillin or the like), but the number who survive lethal infections because of them far far far outweighs the potential for risks.    </p>

<p>Antivaccination as a stance (as in, a broad stance against vaccination, not  stance that says &#39;I am worried not enough testing is done&#39;) is basically saying, &quot;i would prefer to return to a time when the number of children killed each year by measles, mumps, polio and pertussis was numbered in the thousands, instead of the tens&quot;. Is that position reasonable?   </p>
