       So like, a lot of theories involve the government using actors over here...But why? What would the point of putting actors during these attacks instead of doing an actual one? Where's the logic in creating a risky film scene instead of just doing the actual attack where it'll be real as possible? Why risk getting caught using fake actors in Boston Bombing when the government can just bomb it themselves and create the realest scenery?

       <strong>
        A lot of theories involve the government using actors over here...But why?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because people don't trust our government and our government gives people reasons not to trust them. They have planned false flag attacks that would require use of actors in the past (i.e.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">
        Operation Northwoods
       </a>
       , so we know they've been thinking these things for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even today, they conspire with foreign governments to spread disinformation on the internet using actors (i.e.
       <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">
        Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIiOztc52g">
        Cass Sustein thinks agents should infiltrate conspiracy theories online
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Every spy working for our government is an actor as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What would the point of putting actors during these attacks instead of doing an actual one?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of using actors is control and direction. We use spies because they are trained and are given direction on what to do - in this way, their actions will be more predictable and measurable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know exactly what "attacks" you are referring to, but it's the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, actors would be necessary in a situation where the government needed an event to occur, but did not have intelligence that a third party (a terrorist group or something) was going to commit such act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you mentioned Boston, as a hypothetical, if there was a police officer (actor) in a position close to the bombing, where that immediately afterwards he could give direction on what areas to block off, etc, it could help set up a specific perimeter to limit video of certain areas to allow for someone to escape with a decreased likelihood of identification.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Where's the logic in creating a risky film scene instead of just doing the actual attack where it'll be real as possible?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you refer to here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why risk getting caught using fake actors in Boston Bombing when the government can just bomb it themselves and create the realest scenery?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       See my answer above, if the government decided to actually do the bombing, that might require actors to limit people from gaining access to certain areas to prevent them from witnessing things, etc. It's a form of misdirection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        With all that said, the easiest, safest way for the government to pull off a false flag event is to simply intercept a terrorist plot and to secretly open doors for them along the way without revealing themselves and to pretend afterwards that they were just mistakes.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Some examples of this could possibly be to
        <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/2001-memo-warned-bin-laden-aviation-cadre">
         have one official turn a blind eye to seriously troubling intelligence and call it a lapse
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130051">
         rubber stamp visa applications and call it sloppiness
        </a>
        . Then, instead of holding those people who made these "mistakes" accountable and firing them, give them promotions, and build a new militarized branch of government: let's call it the Department of Fatherland Security.

       Start false protests? I would probably send a few CIA guys to some local community college and get a gathering maybe post some flyers put out a few feelers. Then another few CIA guys do something to get someones attention fueling the fire. Wait it out do it again before you know it people are joining your "cause" that you set up for them. Did you see all the protest pictures from Ukraine before the president was outed? You think all those tire fires and bloced off streets were random? Hell no. I will be dollars to donuts russia played a major part in the riots and protests. Making sure to guide things along the way.

       Well, first of all, people over seas aren't the ones they are trying to protect right? Second, Yup, just might feel guilty about killing the people I've sworn to protect, a little, especially considering all those folks overseas I bombed.

       If after 9/11 Americans took it as a religious assault and simply decided to forgive as the religion their brethren were slain for promotes. Then the attack doesn't matter, it happened so in that sense it's real, but if the reaction doesn't garner the results the attacker wants then as long as nothing too crazy happens it should all be as if he never existed.

       Well the attack was real, but if the Americans reacted in an unexpected and especially beneficial way to themselves and (hopefully and probably) the rest of the world then the attack wouldn't have been justified in the minds of the attackers. (Death is rarely a reason unto itself, that takes a wacky to believe in death as result and desire)

       So I guess it's opposite of what you just said

       The exact opposite, if Americans had taken it in stride and just said Meh, bund to happen or We should forgive, then 9/11 would have been a failure.

       So the ATTACK is real, but the aftermath is a conspiracy? I'm asking how do you tell apart government-sanctioned attacks and actual terrorist attacks. Everyone knows the government loves taking advantage of a horrendous aftermath, but who created the horrendous incident? How do you tell it apart?

       I'm saying it doesn't matter. Did bin Laden do 9/11 or was the govmt behind it. If it was treated in a more rational manner it wouldn't matter. No Patriot Act, No Afghan War, maybe even no Iraq! It doesn't matter who did 9/11 what matters is that it happened and was reacted to in the way it was.

      <p>
       The still small voice. Sometimes its the thing that you know and your mind rejects and you fight against the knowledge. It can take years to realize that that is what happened.  You have to master your reaction to an incident, then the incident itself doesn't matter. YOU are the active player, YOU are the decider.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've taken to the mindset that attacks like 911 or Newtown are bound to happen. Wacky shit occurs,

       Well, I happened to turn on the TV as the bombing and I live in MI so there really is no reason why the Boston Marathon should have been on TV. The bombs were so obviously black powder based that I looked at my friend and vice versa and we both said "Gunpowder!?" but why Boston? Why a marathon? Then the injured started to become clear, and the number's were ginormous for black powder device (taken chemistry, lived in the country).  Couple that with the Newtown incident and the Piers Morgan and everything does just look suspicious. TOO neat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the 'gov't' was behind the attacks, but I know I am still too emotionally invested in a "good" U.S. Government to really look at it rationally, just as there are a lot of people who are far too invested in the other direction.

       we looked at the photos.  it's self evident.  then the actors.. this Carlos guy - we look into his history and association.  The Rene Fielding, the moulage, the fake wounds the flash was the wrong colour and sound and damage was wrong.   the placing was wrong.  the push for the narrative is obvious.. I could go on and on, is there a job offer in this?

       Since you think your hot shit thinking you know it all , and appear to be very convinced this is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll bring up an example , relativley recent example.
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 10 , 1990 "Nayirah'' allegedly on holiday in Kuwait , gave a speech in front of a congressmen , this speech was a very emotional testimony about babies being pulled out of incubators forcefully and left to die by Iraqi soldiers. This testimony infuriated many Americans. I mean these are the actions only truly evil people would be capable of and on live TV Nirayah with tears streaming down here face was recalling the terrible day that she wouldn't wish upon anyone and it was shown across all media stations for weeks even radio I remember it. It made many people who were on the fence about intervention in Iraq immediately ok with an invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit here is the video
       <a href="http://youtu.be/LmfVs3WaE9Y">
        http://youtu.be/LmfVs3WaE9Y
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pisses you off doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well turns out that testimony was completely bullshit . "Niyarah'' was actually the Kawaiti ambassadors daughter trained by a professional PR firm for expert delivery on that bullshit speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her speech reached an audience of an estimated 53 Million americans  .
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer your question , well theres a big difference in a random witness and an expert that is specifically trained to deceive and manipulate public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revelation was made after Kuwait was liberated.

      <p>
       That was your question. I provided an answer with an example of why the government would use actors in lieu of witness testimony to their gain. I guess since it didn't qualify as one that you can use to belittle the members of our community it just won't work for you now will it? ? Now you want to narrow it down to very specific scenarios it just seems like your wanting to change the topic entirely that's o.k.. I was under the impression that an actor conspiring with the media and a P.R. firm to change public opinion by creating a batshit insane witness testimony and the goverment publicizing the ordeal for their personal gain would qualify my mistake apparently this has nothing to do with your question gotcha.

       It's not the government.  They're not the ones in charge.  The government is the smoke screen organization that T(real)PTB put up so that the majority of the people don't know who's really in charge.

        The Corporation

       This is not to say that it's the corporation that's the "top dog", however.  No.  There really are secret societies and occult orders that exist which have great power (The Vatican is more than "just a place for mumbo jumbo religion", fyi).  The point I'm trying to make here is that your question is actually not even an applicable one.

       That is to say that the government

       Real witness tell real stories, if you use actors you control almost every variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree the BMB theories about actors seem far fetched, I know I am not well enough versed in the arts of disguise to really tell if some of those people were veterans already maimed or whatever. (I'm referring to the photoslides we've all seen) What I do know is people from different places look different, and I do know little makeup and a change of clothes transforms a person, just look up Jenna Marbles on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use actors you can also control the coverage far better and the subseqent story. If everyone presented at the beginning says the same thing, a rogue witness or two just looks like a nut.

      <p>
       Because real dead bodies, real blood, your fellow countryman's blood, your ally's blood, will have a REAL effect on you and all those who witness it. You may create a radical on your side, and if you know the history of assassinations you realize how dangerous that is.

       So what rogue witness will they have if they just have a dude bomb the marathon? Everyone will say the same thing won't they? They saw two explosions. Or have one dude commit the massacre at Sandy Hook, whose gonna believe him saying that he was hired by the government?

       I believe "they" have used many people to carry out their crimes only to abandon them once the deed is done. Once they say the gov. told them or was actually behind a crime they are viewed as complete crazies. Consider that some were telling the truth.

       No, that's why you don't take an eyewitness word for something, and instead have a trial to figure out what happened.

       This is a variable, if you have a nefarious purpose you will try and control as many of these as possible, Why not
       <em>
        not

       kill anyone and just scare the shit out of everyone and let them think you did? No dirty hands AND the result you want. (in theory)

       Had to make sure a nice little Christian boy died so they could have their heart-wrenching narrative. Also, its hard to push the OMG amputees narrative if the "bombs" turned out to be duds or otherwise failed to meet their objectives for their narrative. Search also "Agenda Driven News"

       Not really. You pretty much just said you wondered why a terrorist attack was on a sensationalist national television, assumed what was used, and something about Pier Morgan making everything look neat.
