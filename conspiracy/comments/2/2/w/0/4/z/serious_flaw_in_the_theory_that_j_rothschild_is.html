       It's an interesting connection for sure between four passengers on flight 370 and the patent they shared with Rothschild's semiconductor company, but here are the problems with the theory:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If a Rothschild patriarch wants something, they buy it. That family measures their wealth in trillions of US dollars. They could easily buy out each of those engineers and pay for it out of pocket change. Why make an entire plane disappear just to get to a few people who can be bribed with more money than they'd make in a hundred lifetimes?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If buying them out doesn't work, bring in the jackals and scare the fight out of them. Elite families have been connected closely with the U.S. and British intelligence agencies going back generations. They have access to armies of mercenaries and top people in the intelligence agencies. It's a lot easier to employ the dirty tricks squad than hijack an airplane and dispose of the passengers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If scare tactics don't work, individual "wet" operations can pick off the other patent holders, drawing a lot less notice. It's not necessary to take out a plane when an "unfortunate accident" will do the job. Plus, it's a helluva lot cheaper.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The first rule of secret operations is to keep them secret. Hijacking a plane and generating a month (and more) of 24-hour publicity is sheer stupidity from an intelligence operation point of view. How many of us would know about that patent otherwise? Not I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something really fishy is going on with flight 370, but this theory to explain it just doesn't add up. Am I missing something here?

       the flaws in this theory are much more obvious: 1. none of the patent holders were on the flight and 2. the assignee of the patent is freescale not the individuals....

       my limited understanding of patent law is that any one individual who holds the patent is free to license or produce it without the consent of the others. Is this correct?

       it doesn't matter either way in this case.  the sole assignee (owner/beneficiary) of the patent in question is already freescale. the individuals listed on the patent are the inventors and given credit as such but only the assignee is the owner of the patents and its rights.

       3) Take out a plane and get the people who would notice this thing riled up.  They're already labeled "conspiracy theorists".  Nobody in any sort of position of power that could be even a remote threat to the Red Shield would take them seriously.  And even if a few of them did, so what?  Trillions are pocket change to them, and corruption in politics runs deep.

       Maybe the purpose of the operation was not to actually hijack a plane but to get people like you to think about a possible Rothschild conspiracy and to create a mystery surrounding the alleged event.  It's more of a psychological operation than it is an actual operation.

       My guess is a failure or fire of some sort and it went down; or perhaps that story about some cargo from the Maresk Alabama being on board the plane.

       The possibility of exposure to something secret, contagious and deadly on a mass scale crossed my mind. The plane is remotely taken over and flown to a facility where the contagion can be contained. Everyone exposed dies and the secret is buried with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Except for our female lead, a scrappy toxicologist who studies WMD and epidemics during her free time when she isn't running her lab at Stanford or volunteering at an animal shelter. Scrap that, make it an orphanage. A few other passengers live to have time-filling dialogue with her that reveals her back story. She sends a mysterious picture with a message secretly embedded in it to her husband, played by Nicholas Cage, a commando for a private mercenary firm who got out of the game after seeing too much wanton killing in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       With incredible powers of deduction he figures out that she and the other survivors are being held at a secret underwater base in the middle of the Indian ocean, controlled by the firm Cage used to work for. Call them ... Darkwater. On the base they have a bioweapons lab where the Armageddon Virus, the contagion that killed everyone on the plane except the female lead and her lame supporting characters. They are held captive together for scientists to study them and figure out why their bodies resisted the Virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow by the end, Cage's character will save his wife and her comrades, take out the bad guys, and rescue the kids at the orphanage. Which will alleviate his guilt over a particularly bad incident when his mercenary squad carelessly wiped out a school full of brown children. It'll happen just as the bad guys figure out why the few passengers survived, and the main bad guy -- the same leader of Cage's squad most responsible for killing the kids -- makes the decision that the survivors are no longer needed. Collateral damage. Then, boom mutha fucka there goes yo head.

       What nonchalance? The U.S. has put something like $7 million into the search efforts, if I remember correctly.

      <p>
       ...what? No. These connections are completely illogical. You're taking "works at technology company" and turning it into "capable of making the Chinese instantaneously get ahead of the United States with micro defense technology" (whatever the hell "micro defense technology" is supposed to be).
       <br/>
       Yes, they worked at Freescale. That doesn't mean they were capable of some magical technological leap that would push China ahead of the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole Freescale thing is just absurd. People just 'latched' on to it and it's turned into countless theories ranging from "the Freescale employees made the plane invisible" to "the Freescale employees were defecting to the Chinese", neither of which make any sense.
