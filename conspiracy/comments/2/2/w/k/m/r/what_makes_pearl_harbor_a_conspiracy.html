       I am very skeptical of all conspiracy theories but do realize that some most likely are true. My friends are conspiracy theorists and often bring up Pear Harbor...Conspiracy Theorists claim the military intercepted the Japanese code and knew exactly when and where they were going to attack... The military did intercept the code and realize that there was going to be an attack, but they did not know where the attack would be... The military sent reinforcements to the Philippines because that seemed to be the place that would most likely be attacked.  So basically, what's the conspiracy?  Is there something I'm missing?

       they knew the harbor would be attacked, so they kept all thier ww1 equipment, and min. personal there, while sending all the shiney new aircraft carries and what not into "manuvers" up in the alaska island chain. which was a matter of defense as much as it was one of convience.

       The memo outlined the general situation of several nations in World War II and recommended an eight-part course of action for the United States to take in regards to the Japanese Empire in the South Pacific, suggesting the United States provoke Japan into committing an "overt act of war".

       Ok, did some more reading and looked at the memo... It sounds like the United States was somewhat pushing for a Japanese attack in order to shape public opinion, it is hard to say whether they indefinitely knew that Pear Harbor would be the place that would be attacked by Japan.

       Pearl Harbor is pretty much the "go to" false flag event because the others that are easier to show evidence for are less well known.  I could shout "Remember the Maine", "Remember the Gulf of Tonkin", "Remember the Lusitania", "Remember the Liberty", from dawn til dusk and the majority of people wouldn't know what I was talking about.  When I say, "Pearl Harbor" though, people take notice. 
     Hawaii was a known point of attack and Pearl Harbor was the foremost military presence, so it was likely that it would be targeted.  There's evidence there.

       At the very least, we didn't give Japan very many choices
       <em>
        other than attacking Pearl Harbor
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan was already at war -- so moving that fleet from San Diego to Hawaii must have appeared to be in preparation for upgrading the embargoes affecting trade with Japan to a naval blockade.
      </p>
      <p>
       And those ships had only been based in Hawaii for a short time when the attack happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it certainly looks like we positioned those ships as both a credible threat
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       as bait.  I suspect that somebody hoped,
       <strong>
        <em>
         wanted
        </em>
       </strong>
       the Japanese to take the bait and attack while their (Japan's) oil supply was still unmolested.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even have to squint very hard to see that as a conspiracy.

       Roosevelt wanted the US in the war in Europe. The conspiracy is the degree to which he knew in advance Pearl Harbor would happen and did nothing to prevent it.

       It a called radar and scout aircraft, ships.  This is in the immediate lead up to the attack.  Protecting ones goddamn jugular.  Tue basics.  Disregarded.  There are many parallels to the staged events on September 11, 2001.

       The fact that we knew it was going to happen.  That an entire squadron can penetrate our safest port in the Pacific with impunity, and we "couldn't have seen it coming." Thus is called staged fiction, and just like every other war starter in the modern US, a false flag.
