<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/22vt90/a_precious_moment_with_george_w/">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/22vt90/a_precious_moment_with_george_w/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s filled with Pro-Bush commentators and anyone who says anything negative gets massively downvoted. </p>

<p>I mean, I could understand if it were Obama as there are still a lot of Obama-lovers out there. But Bush?! Are there really still people (on reddit much less) who love this guy?</p>

<p>This smells fishy to me. Like the Bush camp hired a PR firm to start rebuilding his reputation and this is one of their efforts to re-ingratiate the public on the Bush family. </p>

<p>I mean... one guy says &quot;Cool guy&quot; and gets 17 upvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think that reddit had been as co-opted as people have been saying, but that thread STUNK to high heaven of a PR firm upvoting the stuff they want and downvoted the stuff they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>I mean, how does &quot;cool guy&quot; get 17 upvotes? And at the bottom of the thread all the negative comments all have 12+ negative votes so they are pushed out of view. </p>

<p>No way that is happening based purely off average redditors. 99% of reddit hates Bush. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The giveaway is how hard Bush and Cheney fought to prevent <em>any</em> independent investigation of <em>the greatest crime in American history</em>. He only allowed it after strong pressure from the wives of some of the victims and even then he installed one of his neocon henchmen, Philip Zelikow, as the gatekeeper to control the direction.</p>

<p>The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btcEJQac82A">knew they were set up to fail</a> and they knew the Pentagon lied to them.</p>

<p>There is much evidence indicating the Bush administration&#39;s foreknowledge of 9/11.</p>
