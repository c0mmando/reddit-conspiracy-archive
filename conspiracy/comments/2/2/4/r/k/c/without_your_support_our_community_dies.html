       is being targeted. However you wish to look at it the new submissions queue does not lie and we need our regular(friendly) readers to keep this in mind. Many decent posts are getting hammered with down-votes, admins have been informed and already removed a number of shit-muncher accounts who existed solely to downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not expect readers to upvote shite, i down-vote here myself regularly and do not always agree with what is suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said many decent posts and contributions are targeted and never get the attention they sometimes deserve and this is where we need to rely on our community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please browse the new queue and try to keep relevant and decent material alive. The sub is growing and in light of NSA scandals, Ed Snowden and Media manipulation on so many fronts and regarding many important issues
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has never been more relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let down-vote brigades rule what is read and what is ignored here and help fight the good fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Erdogan asked for a false-flag war against Syria, I'm asking our readers to start an honest war against mindless down-voters.

       Outsider here. I'll be honest with you; I disagree with most of the major view points here. But I subbed a while back because I enjoy getting the alternative view it provides. I find a lot of it to be really bizarre, but I also like questioning things recently and I enjoy the perspective you guys provide as I consider myself open to new ideas. I never comment and I rarely vote, either up or down. But I browse the /rising/ queue of my front page, so I see a lot of things here when they're young.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion as an outsider? You guys are your own worst enemy. I'll see a title that looks interesting and open it up just to see comments bitching about downvotes and mass brigades and whatnot, or if the theme needs to be changed because a non-truther made it. And maybe that's just because I'm floating around the rising topics most of the day and don't often check in on the hot topics. But I'd like to see the intelligent discourse a group such as this could provide, but it's like threads can rarely get there without tangets about downvote bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the fix is, but it seems like there's a lot of back and forth here that takes away from the topic at hand and that's disappointing. Sometimes it seems you guys are more intent on proving some sort of corruption on Reddit instead of looking at the topic itself. If there is indeed a conspiracy to take you guys off topic, I would say it's working because an outsider like me, someone who's not a "true believer" isn't very often coming back to see what made the top threads of the day.

       The constant barrage of complaining is off-putting. There are over 200,000 subscribers, but every thread I go into, I have to read about 5 downvotes and how it is an attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       It has really soured me. I'll probably be banned for criticizing the subreddit now, but the constant discussion about attacks and censorship completely takes away from trying to discuss actual issues. I find stories every day. Nothing seems to be disappearing. But reading every post, you would think it is.

       It depends on what you like but I enjoy the more fringe ideas rather than just plan criminality. I'm already not surprised by that stuff. If you like the far out stuff

       I'm trying to model the sub from our Conspiracy &amp; Paranormal show The Higherside Chats after a few of these other subs but there's only 95 people in the sub and while everyone likes this type of material, they really just wait for me to post a new show. I'd definitely love more posters of conspiracy stuff over at

       Your criticism is well crafted even if incorrect, and very respectful even if critical.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't be banned for being a thoughtful commentor.  The people who get banned for being critical of this sub sound like "omg you're all racist loons!" And "the joos did it!".

       Now the problem we are talking about which isn't apparent if you browse our front page has to do with new submissions.  People have been getting multiple down votes within seconds of making a new submission.  This is not only frustrating but it messes with thread rankings and makes sure that only low effort posts make it to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't think that conspiratard is 100% at fault.  We have some political groups in here that are militantly opposed to any post that isn't sucking the cock of Obama and others who are opposed to anti Republican posts.  We have global warming junkies and other junkies that have strange voting habits (I suspect).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we have many problem voters that are problematic for different reasons.

       I was actually banned though recently in a free energy thread, arguing how it breaks laws of physics, and arguing against the machine. Because the mods thought I and several others were brigading from another subreddit, everyone who disagreed in that thread was banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       These heavy handed tactics are also something that subscribers rightly criticise about this sub, I didn't bring it up here before because I thought I would get banned again, 'for attacking the sub' or something. I was not ok with what happened despite me saying, it's cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that there are some who don't like this place but I am just a normal guy giving an alternative opinion, not a shill/brigador.  like the op said, the users (and mods) are often their own worst enemy. And they need to realise that, before this sub can improve.

       There has been a theme going around in SRD that this subreddit needs to be banned by reddit. Nuked by the admins.  W/e.

       They are drumming up support for such an action and this might be a side effect of that support.  Rest assured that these people have short attention spans and things will return to normal.

       It's simple: everytime a reasonable discussion might take place, a debunker and/or r/conspiratard comes up and derails it with his incessant denials, subject changes, logic fallacies, rejecting logic based on source labeling (ad-hominem), empty contradiction and the best of all degrading the subject after empty rebutals just to dismiss it as "irrelevant" "it means nothing anyways" when proved wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a constant and it has shaped most of its users to deal with anyone that disagrees with them in the same way because we are just beyond tired of debunkers and r/conspiratards derailments.

       Paraphrasing your comment.  Not trying to pull a fast one on anybody.  Nor would it, since the source comment is unedited, and anyone with an ounce of thought can also clearly see this.  Are your feelings hurt?  Is that why?

       I'll explain this to you simply and clearly once again.  Replying to you in this thread.  Only in this thread.  Challenging you on your highly flawed take on the events.  Calling you our when you speak lies.  None of these things could possible be construed as "stalking" or "harrasment."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad to watch the distractors cry when they horribly botch their stated objective.  When they are not able to trust, turn, or distract from the damaging conversations at hand.  Keep trying though.  You've got to work hard.  Get all your facts down.  And be able to lay them down clearly and concisely, if you want to sway public opinion. I can tell you with certainty that playing the pathetic 'woe is me' victim card will NOT work.

       Holy crap, did you just accuse me of being part of the JIDF?  Achievement unlocked!  I'm a fairly secular reform Jew from the midwest, so this is news to me, but wow, this is actually the highlight of my internet life.  Creepy and insane you may be, but you just made my day, you adorable little nutcase.  Thanks so much!

       I have grown tired of the derailments. In the past I have tried keeping it up with the waste of time and eventually got exausted and end up with insults and degrading replies as a child, even to this day I repeat this in my weakest moments. I decided to leave the sub until the infestation was reduced. I return and it starts growing again constantly so I have decided to refuse arguing with r/conspiratard members all at once but I haven't done the same for debunkers, for now.

       You chewed him out because he didn't exactly agree with your position that "Fires could not have caused obliteration of those buildings, only demolition can, period." for which you provided not one tiny bit of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with "truthers" is that there is no known explosives that could have been smuggled into the buildings for a controlled detonation because it would require MANY TONS of explosives. You just can't hide that. This means that either everyone in all the buildings was in on it (ridiculous), a previously unknown explosive that's vastly more powerful than anything known (speculative), or science fiction nonsense like earthquake machines (stupid).
      </p>
      <p>
       "False flag" is at least worth discussion because that's about what's going on inside the minds of the hijackers, and it's vastly more likely that investigators didn't know exactly what was in their heads. There was significant speculation about their identity as well. "The Israelis were behind 9/11" strikes me as more plausible than earthquake machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder why there is more speculation about 9/11, which was on video, as opposed to the completely unsolved anthrax attacks that followed 9/11 and led to mass hysteria and the Patriot Act. Given that the anthrax was apparently traced to the US military, this at least appeared to be a "false flag" operation of some kind.

       It's fun how people like you rest the fact that it couldnt happen on fantasy.  It wouldn't have been tons of explosives.  As well, the calculations have been completed already, and a 20 man team could have easily rigged all core columns.

       Now what you believers of the official government issued conspiracy theory is that if what they claimed was true, every single support in both towers would have had to have failed catastrophically at EVERY SINGLE POINT, AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.  I don't know why you haven't yet picked up on this, but life doesn't work like that, I'm afraid.  Do you know what does though?  As we've stated all along, the fantasy of a staged event. Hollywood.

       Yes it is... extremely complicated. It's not as simple as you think dude. The buildings are complex structures that you don't understand completely. Not just beams and floors. And a lot of those guys aren't even remotely in the correct field to have any more say in the matter than a layman.

       I have hundreds of prior controlled demolitions that show how a building reacts to planted exlosive charges.  I also have dozens of collapsed buildings.  Exactly zero exhibit actions seen in other building collapses.

       Claiming that a person is incapable of understanding the obvious use of conventional explosives in the staged 9/11 event is incredibly foolish.  A pathetic attempt at supposting another government lie.  Sad.

       I, as well as you, are fully capible of researching the obviously staged event.  You, for some foolish reason, can only stand to prop up the fictional government issued cospiracy theory (shill like behavior?).  All thr while, claiming this "highly complex" collapse cannot be understood by simple investigation and research.  A degree now is required, in your mind.  Those who wish to know the truth are easily able to find it.  It requires work.  It does not require a masters degree in engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly suggest you do the smart thing, and look to the words of the lead architect of tye complex.  Look into the protections that were over-engineered and built into the skyscrapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have completed this, try to find one other time in history where a building collapse leaves pulverized dust.  One where the entire building comes down.  As though ALL key support structures were removed at the EXACT same time.  Frankly, either perfect "collapse" is not possible without the removal of ALL supports.  With some deep investigation, you will find that the inner core, which was not affected by the impacts of the planes, was able to keep both towers standing by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another huge piece is dealing with the kerosine accelerant.  Of which, 95%.burned up in the massive fireball of impact.  Not leaving enough fuel to cook the steel to temperatures hot enough to partially weaken the steel.

       Yes it would. I don't know a lot about demolition, but I've talked to several demo and pyro people about this and they said many tons. It would take several 18-wheelers just to transport the explosives.

      <p>
       A single person could do it all given enough time. Could 20 men do it all in less than 12 hours (ignoring that people worked in the WTC at night)? No, not based on the volume of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this would be impossible to hide. I don't know how the workers were supposed to miss tons of ampho or plastic explosive and wires strung everywhere. Again, those same demo people told me this would be completely impossible to conceal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the WTC was mined with explosives, the thousands of people inside the buildings absolutely
       <strong>
        HAD
       </strong>
       to know about it and willingly sacrificed their lives. And the survivors, first responders, many New Yorkers that worked nearby, etc. have all conspired together (10,000+ people) to keep the secret for 14 years.

       The problem isn't the time needed to install the explosives, but the fact that they are impossible to conceal. One person in the building for a few minutes would likely detect the explosives, let alone thousands of workers.

       How many were officers and firemen?  How many of those deaths are not supported by the SSDI?

       The power outages and work performed in the towers in the EXACT areas of impact was more than enough time.  This is why WTC7 was "pulled" when the plan didn't work as they expected.  To not leave any explosives or evidence, it was taken down as well.  The smoking gun in all of this is the collapse that goes against all known physics as well as history.

       Just as an example of how biased he is, in his next reply he continues insisting that explosives are impossible to conceal and that one person in the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives.

       <p>
        The problem with "truthers" is that there is no known explosives that could have been smuggled into the buildings for a controlled detonation because it would require MANY TONS of explosives. You just can't hide that. This means that either everyone in all the buildings was in on it (ridiculous), a previously unknown explosive that's vastly more powerful than anything known (speculative), or science fiction nonsense like earthquake machines (stupid).
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       You start your attack using the same logic fallacy the user I mentioned before used. Your biased imagination is not evidence for rebutal, it is just a biased imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that logic had any merit then you wouldn't even dare to disagree with us when we said years ago that it is impossible for any tall building to globally collapse due to office fires and it is also impossible for it to achieve free-fall speeds, especially since we have the entire history of mankind proving this. But after 13 years we know pretty well how much you guys have no problem in believing in impossible scenarios being possible so why do you keep using that logic to refute our arguments is beyond my comprehension.

       All of this still doesn't gives him the right to be a liar and try to weasel out of what he agreed to do by trying to deceive me with empty vague words. One of the few things that show how despicable a person is is to go back in his own word multiple times just so he won't agree with someone through deception and cheating.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "False flag" is at least worth discussion because that's about what's going on inside the minds of the hijackers, and it's vastly more likely that investigators didn't know exactly what was in their heads. There was significant speculation about their identity as well. "The Israelis were behind 9/11" strikes me as more plausible than earthquake machines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The fact that the majority of the US still to this day thinks the war against Afghanistan was because the 9/11 terrorists were from Afghanistan while in fact none of the terrorists where from there and instead most from Saudi Arabia strongly suggests the US intentions of pushing to a war by any means necessary.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I also wonder why there is more speculation about 9/11, which was on video, as opposed to the completely unsolved anthrax attacks that followed 9/11 and led to mass hysteria and the Patriot Act. Given that the anthrax was apparently traced to the US military, this at least appeared to be a "false flag" operation of some kind.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because 9/11 was the start of everything, once you take that one down all of the rest crumbles. The Iraq 100 000 deaths was all based on a lie, publicly admitted lie about them having nukes and the public turned a blind eye to this horrendous bloodshed caused by their military war thirst. If something has horrendus as that was exposed and still almost no one cares about it, trying to do the same to the rest would meet the same result. This is why the 9/11 is the most focused, at least IMO.

       Yes, the same could be said regarding the testing for explosive residue in the wreckage.  But alas, they never did that.  Can you tell me logically why they didn't spend 30 seconds and $80 on an explosives field test that every fire dept has?

       NIST and the UL were 100% unsuccessful in attempting to recreate their ridiculous theory of collapse.  They have not to date proven that simple unaccelerated fire fell all three towers that fateful day.  They have refused to, under grounds of laughable "national security." Any more ridiculous attempts at telling us how our eyes were all wrong in seeing the clear results of conventional explosives in WTC 1, 2, and 7?  Give it an honest go.  I challenge you to make even a single point.  To date, in this thread, a goal you've sadly been unable to do.

       "Truthers" like to hint or "sort of" claim that the WTC buildings were secretly mined with explosives or destroyed with earthquake machines.

       The proposed conspiracy theory promotes a secret government that appears to be incompetent and corrupt, but it actually brilliant, talented, and efficient and has chosen to use almost all of that for secret manipulation for some mysterious end.

      <p>
       This view seems depressing to me, since it's presumed that everyone is really just a slave to "them". And "they" are so incredibly powerful (moreso than Stalin or any real-world dictator) that there isn't one iota of hope of stopping, disrupting, or having any affect on their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said previously, if you're correct than literally the only options are joining the conspiracy or painful death. Are you trying to get the attention of "their" recruiters or something?

       Now since it never happened before and you cannot prove it to be false, my dumb logic is as valid as yours and we get stuck at personal interpertations of the same event using assumptions over assumptions while ignoring the history as an important indicator of such things being impossible.

       This is the second time you talk about this kind of subject without me ever mentioning anything like it. Why do you feel the need to mention these can only be justified as means to strengthen your argument by using unnecessary extremes as means to ridicule my side, unless I am wrong and you will admit to have been incorrect in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you mention "
       <em>
        absolutely no evidence whatsoever is neither logical or reasonable
       </em>
       ". Thank you, this is what truthers have been saying about the NIST report for years since they also made multiple impossible claims without absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Sadly you debunkers only see this argument fit for when it is convenient for you because when we use it then it becomes meaningless. Like practically every debunker does.

       So are you seriously trying to claim that when the firemen entered the buildings, magical explosive waves emanated from their bodies that destroyed the buildings? I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, what you're just implying, because you don't have an iota of evidence, is that the buildings were under observation by the conspirators who remote-detonated the explosives hidden inside when they saw firemen entering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea why the "truthers" insist on sticking to this "magic explosives" nonsense when other conspiracies are vastly more likely. Even if you want to go "false flag" by the US government, you don't need magical explosives. You don't even need Islamic militants, the hijackers could have been disguised. They didn't even really need to be disguised, because the only way we know their identities is because the government just declared it, they could have been white neo-Nazis for all we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you might argue that wouldn't have destroyed the buildings, but completely destroying the buildings was irrelevant. Little damage was done to the Pentagon and the White House plane didn't even hit. The point was the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't begin to see why the US would do all of this secret explosives nonsense when it's so much easier and cheaper to do it this way. US hires neo-Nazis to fly planes into buildings: Handful of agents to run the Nazis, a handful of agents to fake the ids of the hijackers. In theory, you could do this with as little as 10 people and a very low budget.

       From the wiki article you cited:
"Red iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, commonly known as rust) is the most common iron oxide used in thermite. ... All of these examples use aluminium as the reactive metal."

       How is this a "strawman"? I'm directly addressing your evidence that thermite residue was found in the building. I'm not even questioning the claim, but assuming that it was found.

      <p>
       I guess the "derailment argument" is my questioning how the office workers missed large quantities of thermite in the building. It also burns slowly and is brighter than the sun. Somehow you don't consider the logistics of how an explosive can be used to be remotely relevant to whether it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       used. You can't use TNT underwater, so you assume that any underwater explosion is TNT.

       Again, logic fallacy resulting of a biased imagination and even accuse me of not presenting anything.

       time in the entire history of mankind, one simply because of small office fires and at free-fall speeds.

       EDIT: To prove even more how useless it is to have a discussion with you, you are the kind of person that states with clear conscience that it is impossible to conceal explosives and that a anyone inside the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives when in fact

       Great work pulling that directly from my post you replied to.  When you come up with insults of your own, then your trash might just he worth debating.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would he nice if these fools actually tried.  They can't debate FACT, so they do stupid shit like this to get a rise or distract from the damaging (to them) conversations that we have here.  The truth apparently is quite damaging to their position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they could try a little harder to make the vote manipulation even just slightly less obvious.  When you see an abnormally low vote count on non insult posts, you can be relatively sure of its accuracy.  So much effort in an attempt to silence the open discussion of truth.  The topics they attack with ferocity is quite telling.

       Of they can't hide their lies in a wall of text, discouraging the average simpleton from even reading past the first sentence, what else can they do.  That exchange was truly pathetic.  You can tell he doesn't even believe what he's saying himself.  It was clearly a staged event.  Clearly.

       Because that's another derailment tactic.  The intelligent commentary gets buried below pages of distracting banter with shills.

       I look at it differently.  If you go to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and try to post something "transparent" about the Obama administration, it will get removed.  Similar to Tesla in
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       .  Stuff doesn't get deleted so much here, and what does is logged in
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship
       </a>
       .  So you get more noise here, but also a lot more transparency.  Which is more like the real world.

       Viewing submissions and comments by new or controversial allows you to step over the noise more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also one think i think we need to realize is that their down-vote bots and what not are probably no where near as strong and plentiful as they could be, and i think this is intentional. If they were to use their full capabilities on down-voting i think it would be insanely obvious. So instead i suspect that they have been using a lot more of their resources in up-voting certain comments and submissions. It would be far less suspicious and most people would hardly notice.

       You would be right, except that he claims it happens every time, which is a false generalization. In fact, it happens very rarely. Often debunking
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       done with facts, but that is not what is represented in his comment.

       Rational responses always welcome. I have ran into this before myself. If I have come to dislike a person because of past experiences then having a bias is easy to overlook. I purposefully throw around different personalities online just to learn about the psychological effects of conversation through different lenses. Just a thought that we should all base our serious discussions on nothing but facts because the personalities we dislike could literally be anyone / anything.

       It was, because (and I stated this) it proves nothing. Freefall was already factored in to the building's collapse, and there is no evidence of a demolition. Proving it was marginally longer is irrelevant to the situation as a whole.

       When you fail to address points put forward in argument, and then surrender in a childish fit, I would certainly consider it losing.

       Yes yes. So your proof is presence on this forum. Which makes exactly zero sense because there are thousands of others that fit that description. So what you're really telling me is that you have no

        actual

       Why? Can you explain your leap of logic? Because last time I checked, proof has to be universal. Just because it's proof for you doesn't mean it actually makes even the tiniest modicum of sense for anybody else.

        is
       </strong>
       annoying however to go into a topic and have the posts be off-topic complaining. We should have a better system for dealing with that and keeping content on topic while resolving any issues. Like a Meta subreddit could do.

       Perhaps the reason why it keeps coming up is because no action is taken against it by Reddit. Imagine I came into a sub-reddit you use every single day and disrupted your discussion and called you an asshole and a lunatic constantly. It goes beyond trolling and it's a constant that has been done before even Reddit was around by the same people. People will come out of the wood work and play it down as trolling and make my post look paranoid but it isn't. It's been a long campaign of censorship that effected Digg to the point of nearly shutting down. Their admins removed the people that came here and setup conspiritard, why have Reddit not done the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Censoring people and trying to bury posts is not trolling, it's censorship. People on Reddit just don't care enough to rectify problems like a large number of people every day that listen to bullshit, get fed bullshit and do nothing about it.

       Moving meta discussions from this subreddit to another will only serve to keep people in the dark about what is happening, why all their content is being downvoted. Look at the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , now look at it with the meta topics removed.

       If you are being sincere.. i will tell you i've been here for awhile. It's an actual thing that is happening. Skeptards have lost the plot. This sub IS soured. And now it is what it is. Skeptards posting trolls and laughing at them as if they were real. There are more skeptards posting fake threads than people actually interested in conspiracy THEORIES. It is what it is.

       That's the point. Disrupt, dilute and make it look like all of the sub is only about complete bullshit. That's why you get blanket name calling accusations in an absolute fashion because that's what people want and people do listen to it. I'm sure their is some people on conspiritard that are their for a bit of a laugh but the mods aren't. Conspiracies expose the politics and the actions they don't want to go away.

       A theory is a supposition, an uncertain belief. So don't feel bad for wanting an open place to discuss IDEAS. Talk about UFOs if you want. WHO GIVES A FUCK. It's FUN. These skeptards are completely frustrated idiots who haven't a novel thought in their minds. If the idea doesn't come from a paper they don't understand or CNN they can't operate.

       It makes us look stupid. Instead of being the people who have done good work on 911 and other serious conspiracies, we become the crazies who believe there are aliens among us. I'm not saying they should be censored but we shouldn't encourage them or upvote them.

       Doesn't make me look stupid. I don't find it offensive or threatening at all. Who cares if someone wants to believe in UFOs or bigfoot?  I would be more concerned associating myself with someone who believed in the US government, the NSA, Monsanto or Pfizer. Those people don't just look stupid.. they are stupid.

       You don't need to apologise for anything you post. I tend to stick to things that some people would perceive to be more based on reality but that doesn't mean I scoff at the idea of U.F.O's and such but I can see why some people think those topics might be detrimental to how this sub-reddit looks. The idea that this is a free thinking ground where topics can openly be discussed without censorship from mods is going in the direction a lot of the world is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredibly important to maintain the idea that people should be able to formulate theories and opinions, present facts and expose crimes and corruption without fear or ridicule. Those kind of tactics of manipulation and intimidation are the reason why so many crimes are left unanswered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The setup here is probably one of the best set of rules I've seen. No topic is censored, people either like it or don't and they up vote and down vote. Other sub reddits ban sites, submissions and even yesterday, Bipolarbear0 told people to refrain from speculating on the Fort Hood shooting in the post he/she created. The idea that you can't speculate or look for answers that aren't given to you by government mouthpieces is really disturbing to me. If that's all we had the ability to receive, we'd be completely fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think now is a good time for a suggestion I have for people that post here.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Take more time to consider the information before you post
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Check out the information before you post it, not just the headline
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try and supply multiple sources for you post
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try and use source material if it applies
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try and accommodate skeptics by using sources they trust
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Start reporting people that are not here for discussion to the mods and do your part
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All of these things would help this sub-reddit in a huge way.

       a practice of posting extensive sources is debatable and potentially a double-edged sword. a theory with proof is no longer a theory and speculation requires no proof. as for "accommodating skeptics" --fuck them.

       Aliens (fictional) will be used to further enslave us.  9/11 appears to be the lead up to the exceptionally great lie.  That enough will buy, and turn their hateful hearts towards this created "common enemy."  Carefully watch for it as the economy nears collapse.  While they may exist, they very likely are not visiting earth.  Only humans fucking with other humans they deem lesser.  As they have since the dawn of man, sadly.  Nothing ever really changes.

       Clinton is publicly backing disclosure.  Couple the around the clock bombardment from alien television programming, with the run up of more and more famous names t back this so called demanded disclisure.  This is all a CIA fantasy dreamed up as they were tucking with MK Ultra (mind kontrol).  Getting a heard-on for world domination through subversion and lie.  Through secret society who now claim Switzerland home.

       <em>

       Yeah, the confirmation of the NSA cellphone thing (Which was my big one. Cameras on both sides man....) was my "I dont give a shit anymore" moment.  After that things like Convair 9/11 hard drive analysis became more possible/plausible.

       The "Tesla censorship" was due to spamming of stories, probably by Tesla flacks (they're big on social media). You might like the company, but they're not 50% of all technology. Tesla has certainly been adequately covered by reddit.

       I'm not a fan of GM and Ford and their lock on the domestic auto industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is just crazy. Tesla is a tech media
       <em>
        darling
       </em>
       . They get enormous and constant positive press. Especially considering that they are a tiny boutique automaker like Ferrari.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps all that press means that they get some negative press too, but they negative press Tesla has gotten over QA problems is really nothing next to the negative attention GM has received over recent product recalls (which led to fatalities), for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the incumbent automakers are blocking electric cars, that just isn't so. I've driven electric cars. I like electric cars. But there remain serious logistical issues with batteries involving range and charging that have yet to be overcome. Lots of people are working on higher-density batteries, but it's a tougher problem than you may think.

       if you remember it was that guy all the fuss was about who applied for and got the job of mod cos his mate suggested him, or some shit and refused to quit for a few days despite the whole community wanting him to. i dont remember his name, i dont really want to... but one thing for sure he didnt belong here and his heart was not in the right place when he made the css. remember the sea of pyramids and all seeing eyes that got axed after a few hours?

       We can win, the targets of the down voting tribe are very politically motivated.  If the title doesn't please them or the link site, or the OP.
Down it goes, to oblivion.

       I scan the new page upvote conspiracy items, never mind if I agree, It if it a conspiracy related post I will upvote, even If I have no agreement.
       <br/>
       I am very flexible on what is considered conspiracy by the OP, questions are good, speculations are fine, a new view sometimes surfaces from someone who is not too buried in the details of their own previous conclusions.

       Yeah.  I mostly upvote good stuff too and occasionally downvote if I think something is obvious spam or outright mockery of anything related to conspiracy.  I think we are winning too and as someone else again pointed out, if we weren't doing something right we wouldn't be getting this kind of attention.

       My main concern is disingenuous moderators are admin on reddit intentionally thwarting our efforts here through shadowbans and outright censorship like what seems to be the case in the Bostonbombing and Sandyhook subreddits.  Autobots also concern me if anything with such and such a word or from a particular site is automatically set to get a downvote for every upvote or something of that nature.  But I don't have the skills to accurately identify that or combat it if I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just remember when the front page of reddit used to be a place where I learned about people like Bill Hicks, Mitch Hedberg, and Nikola Tesla and where we collaborated and organized things such as the SOPA blackout and the Colbert/Stewart rally, which turned out to be a bust, but showed the power and potential of a social media user base that a site like Reddit has.

       Is it possible to not just constrict the 'Conspiracy' label - as this has come to be more about independent truth, awakening/exposure, and just try to recognize the root of public agendas. Conspiracy does justice, but its label in todays society doesn't do as much justice for what this community strives for.

       This Biffingston character is a complete fool.  "My sister, she was a flight attendant on 9/11.  And, uh...coincidentially I was scheduled to fly to Jersey (slimeball) on 9/11.  It's disrespectful to discuss the obviously engineered 9/11 operation."

       Discussing fact and truth is not disrespectful.  You've attempted, just as all the other shills who claim to have lost magical family members during the Sandy Hoax.  Flare claims to help their nonexistent credibility, then focusing in on the emotional ploys.  Anything to get the world to stop doscusso.g the truth.

       You've brought that up a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you my take. I enjoy discussing conspiracy. if someone has a wacky idea about bigfoot banging a space alien it doesn't offend me. It can be interesting and entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's not of interest is a sub where the majority of posts are unimaginative trolls by juvenile tools. That's where we are at with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . As a result i need to keep myself entertained by examining the mental behavior that is overwhelmingly presented here. When you follow it along you end up on
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . And honestly, it's a really interesting thing that is happening. They are unknowingly trolling themselves by posting their own troll submissions on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . I find that interesting and I'm likely going to follow it to it's tragic conclusion.. When it becomes so obvious that a larger reddit majority will become aware of it and it will become a meme, providing years of enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is part of the story. First the majority of sincere subscribers here need to become aware of the novel event unfolding. And as a result, the skeptards will have an opportunity to, since they make up 50% of the activity here.

       Fight fire with fire.  They CONSTANTLY post links to new threads here, and people wonder why the new queue in consistently downvoted.  I think more people should be aware of the constant brigading that goes on.

       They don't seem to have 1/50th kf our thread/comment volume.  The poster seems to be trying to insult you for stalking them, when it's incredibly easy to review their recent bullshit.   Failed.  You can easily find it.  Either by the linking bots, or by a quick 5 minute visit.

       OP is a stalker-type personality.  He follows everyone who posts in this sub and obsesses over it.  Id wager to say that if I did a search of his screen name, it would be on more than just Reddit, and involving exactly the same things.

       I asked in the other thread; for the cause of transparency, and what could help prove that we are actually being targeted, could you or another mod post the correspondence between the admins? I, and I'm sure many others in this sub, would love to see proof (not that you're lying) that there actually were trolls downvoting everything en masse.

       It seems very clear that this sub
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       under attack, and the rate, tenacity and staying power of the efforts indicate that it is not being carried out by a few pimply-faced kids out for the laughs via ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently SOME of the posts, comments and information are touching nerves - and is being taken seriously enough to warrant a concerted effort to SHUT YOU UP.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what are the topics being discussed in this sub that have attracted the attention of the Killer Bees?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it UFO's and aliens? Not likely. Is it the NSA debackle? Nah, that is being discussed broadly across many "mainstream" subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is it that is being said that they are willing to work so hard to censor via their "downvote DOS attack"?
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer that, it may be productive to look at WHO is mounting the attack, and see if we can find common denominators among the members of that group: What are their commonalities? Which topics to they find the MOST irritating and "offensive". What topics cause them to rant, rave and fling accusations on the "moral character" of the sub and its members?

       Good idea to sticky this - there are probably a lot of legit users here who mainly browse the "hot" queue or just check into the sub now and then and may not be aware of the rampant vote manipulation that's been occurring (which seems to have gotten much worse over the last week or so).

       I stick mostly to the new posts, the hot is very disturbing in what makes the top, most days.  The worthier posts are there sometimes, but further down.  If I peruse new, I can up vote conspiracy items.  I don't discriminate according to what I personally consider rational ideas.
       <br/>
       I am not really a conspiracy chaser,  I only follow the national dialog and our status as individuals in our own nation, (rapidly diminishing), and am fine with aliens and illuminati, even if I don't consider those ideas helpful. I am fine with having them on the thread. The bigger the tent, the higher the number of good ideas, no one is forcing us to read what we disagree with.

       Yeah man, this place is a shadow of what it used to be when I first came here.  The intellect has shot way down.  There used to be masterminds at work here, and there still are, but all the negative attention I think has rightfully spooked some people away.  When you start to look at FEMA camps and their coffin supplies, DHS buying up all the ammo, Sandy Hook shit coming after peoples guns, ad infinitum.  They're thumbing their nose at this place and simultaneously deploying so much propaganda and internet warfare.  I mean there is a whole cyber battle group in the us mil for christ's sake.  Imagine what they're trying to do to foreign nets.  And the fact is, folks in this sub prob aren't debating any of them, they're not here to converse.  They're here to down vote like crazy.  Hell, reddit is conde naste right.  Sure wouldn't be hard to blackmail the share holders to clamp down this place considering that much of the NSA data center bullshit is used for corporate espionage.  I mean, wall street is stealing at miliseconds.  The whole world is in on it.  What purpose does this sub serve to money?  Nothing.  It hinders these greedy enterprises.  Wouldn't want that in a country whose economy is based on buying consumer goods aka cheap, needless garbage.

       I had a five year account and after about 3 months of coming to this sub it was shadowbanned. I could not believe it. They said it was for participating in a vote brigade from conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes you wonder how a sub like
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       can exist. Isn't that entire sub a giant vote brigade? I didn't even know vote brigading was a thing until I came here. I used to do it all the time because I thought it was normal. I'd find a link to an interesting thread and then go there and vote as I'd normally do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all of a sudden I do that with a thread from conspiracy and I'm shadowbanned. A 5 year account gone without even a warning. Disgusting.

       Pretty sure there is more than one user per account as well.  Think about how one of them could possibly mod 70+ subs. There are several accounts that mod way too many subs for it to just be a hobby.

       IMO, it's a team that is gaming the system.  Doesn't  make sense that they are somehow just a coordinated "volunteer" group.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       which i wasn't even aware i had participated in a brigade. when i asked the admins for evidence or a link to what i had voted on i never received a reply, banned for doing something i didn't even have knowledge of.

       50% of the activity on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is from skeptards. They are so lost in their troll attempts they are inadvertently linking fellow skeptard trolls from here to

       .

      <p>
       They are pointing and laughing at their own BAD troll attempts under the delusion that they are real posts. Honestly, it's one of the funniest, most bizarre things I've personally witnessed on reddit or any other forum/discussion community.. And I've been doing this since the days of fidoNet.

       will be like openly announcing you love eating shit.

       Obviously all of those who are clicking the downvote button (which this post is about) believe it has value of some sort, otherwise why would they be doing it?  Unless you, too, believe that it's just a bit of "fun" continually refreshing the new queue on this sub and downvoting every submission.

       I have found myself in a pickle.  I worry I don't know what is bullshit and whats not a lot of times.  Or what has been debunked before or what is a legit submission.  So (generally) I fear to upvote, as i could be bumping a dis-information post, and I don't downvote because I fear it could putting down the truth. :/

       So up-vote to promote discussion and leave a comment asking for clarification.  Whether I like an article or not, I up vote if I think that it is discussion worthy, not to promote belief.  I think a lot of people here do that.

       The price of a pickle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how I go about things. I (usually) either vote or comment, one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I vote, my vote means: I think this topic is interesting, needs to be discussed, or is something I'm curious about and would like to read others' opinions on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I comment, my comment stands on its own merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works very well with reddit's processing for the hot (front page) list.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a post to be in "hot", the reddit processing considers
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       the voting and the commenting. This is how you can see something in the "hot default 25 list" that only has a few votes, but also has several comments. I've seen posts with as few as 20 total votes (e.g., 15/-5) but also had 10 or more comments... as high as number 5 on the hot front page.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I fear to upvote, as i could be bumping a dis-information post
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is where the comments mitigate. I've upvoted posts I thought were potentially disinfo, because I saw comments underneath discussing that fact - thus, my vote was for people to see the discussion about the disinfo, not necessarily to believe the posted link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be afraid. Participate. If you want to see something discussed, but don't have something to immediately offer, upvote... get others' input... come back later and learn from it. If you comment, great; especially if it's a productive comment.

       That's jumping to conclusions.  Assuming something actually is happening (I honestly don't really care enough to really dig into it to find out), it could just be a small group of people who either hate some people here, or just don't like the general idea of this sub.  Doesn't necessarily mean it's a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, come on, it's a sub on a website known for memes that has some 200,000 subscribers, far less active users.  Very unlikely it is some actual concerted effort to censor information or quiet dissent or any such things.

       I never look at the front page. I just browse new until I see something interesting. It's easier to make my own opinions that way.

       I will contribute to this discussion in this way. We must look at this situation as we do our constitution. We cant stifle the right to free speech but we do need to figure out a sensible solution to our problem of people having the ability to hide what they deem too sensitive.  The moment we divide ourselves we have only helped them destroy us as a whole. I do hope we all figure out a way to bring

        Looks like the mods of /r/conspiracy got tired of multiple front page posts claiming vote brigades so they made a sticky about it. Still not getting that people naturally downvote out of disgust and stupidity of the posts though.

       The Oculus bot has been providing evidence AGAINST vote brigades by providing a timestamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the bot's comment states a timestamp score of 64|20 - 44 karma for this thread 5 hours ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is now at 225|92 - 133 karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since being posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , this thread has
       <em>
        gained
       </em>
       karma, thus disproving any allegations of a brigade.

       I honestly don't know what you can do. Any posts that include a hot topic or corporation name in the title get downvoted into oblivion immediately. If you obscure it a little, it takes a little longer, but you'll eventually get stomped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll continue to stick to the new queue and continue to post links I find worthwhile despite it, though. If only because I find it really interesting to see what gets a rash of downvotes before any human actually could have read the headline...

       I'd just like to point out that some of us (I won't name names) have given our daily support to this sub, only to be kicked off it for trivial imagined infractions. That cools you down pretty damned quick when it comes to loyalty to the sub. But here's an idea -- instead of kicking off people who contribute daily at a significant level, try kicking off the trolls and shills and brigaders for a change.

       I posted a sort of heartfelt appeal to reddit about this issue on
       <a href="/r/self">
        /r/self
       </a>
       last night, got a lot of downvotes, but a surprising amount of upvotes. I think it was 120 up 100 down when I checked this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damnedest thing, it got more upvotes,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       less downvotes in the first hour than a very similar post I made here, asking for advice on how to reach out to other subreddits for support.
      </p>

       I slap that guy who told me it was pointless to try with my 120 upvotes.

       This is very true. I regularly check r/new and it is so fucking obvious that there's a downvote brigade here at work 24/7. I've seen posts down voted that were barely 1 min old. Is there a way to block the IP address? 
So much good content is being wasted by these troglodytes and it's really hurting this sub.

       I've seen subs where within the sub they remove the downvote (this was a while ago, haven't seen it recently as I recall), but it has limited usability.  Similar to how some subs let you have flair after your name (for instance in
       <a href="/r/losit">
        /r/losit

       ).

       That hurts more than helps.  All you need to do to downvote is uncheck the "enable subreddit style" box on the right side of the page to be able to downvote again.

       That's a bad idea, even were it possible. We need the downvote to indicate that a post is wrong for the sub.

       I always check the new section and give an upvote to something that deserves attention. I suppose they can't stop everyone because some quality posts always make it to the main page. It doesn't make any sense to me the people who come here and because they genuinely dislike the community downvote things. Shills will be shills, but its a shame that some cant consider the fact that people want to talk about a subject(s) that make them uncomfortable.

       I wouldn't consider this forum a community. Even a few years ago before the diggtards showed up everyone was attacking each other. That's ok though - it's like the thunderdome. Say what you have to say and move on. I see a lot of what the mods say and do here as the same as the govt. if they really wanted things to improve for the better they would make changes to accommodate this being a better place. Instead they make rules like rule #10 that have only made it worse. You don't want downvote brigades? Disable the voting. This place has taken a slide and is most likely on its way out but shit happens and things change and we may hopefully find some other place for a while but don't start with the sentimental "community" bullshit. At least try to go out with the illusion of dignity.

       Don't make a new one.  I'm critical of some conspiracy theories and I get downvoted into oblivion for it.  Yes I have commented on conspiritard too, but I do believe there are conspiracies in abundance.  Just the popular ones grate with me,  especially when there is quite good evidence against a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch how I get comments removed from askreddit - I'm about to post a quite good question, but it'll be pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Question I'm about to pose is 'If I book a holiday in Egypt and there's a public stoning of a 12 year old prostitute taking place, will I face prosecution in the US or Europe if I join in and bounce some rocks on her skull?'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is a resounding NO!  I already know that I wouldn't, just as I wouldn't face prosecution if I travel to Syria, join the rebel forces for two weeks, rape a few Christian children and then murder their entire family and eat their hearts on a live streaming webcam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is nobody addressing these issues?  The laws make no sense - if you travel to Cambodia and have sex with an under age prostitute you will face prosecution in both the US or EU - so you can't have sex for money with one, but you can murder an underage prostitute in another part of the world, and you can rape one if you're a member of an approved rebel force?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy!  This is going on right now and thousands of people are exploiting it!

       Hi guys, just made this here account, pretty much solely for the purpose of this sub and for participating in the discussions herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a couple of hours to read and scan through all the various posts before I created this account, and then I saw this stickied post, so I thought I'd leave some input.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest problem with a lot of what gets posted here is the same problem most news sites have, and that is sensationalised post headings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys (the guys guys, not the people that are here only to rot this sub from within, and to them I recommend fucking a landmine), please try to be unbiased in the way you present information. Information is a thing which gets put through the prism of the mind that's interpreting it anyway, there is no need to attach bias to a piece of information before people have a chance to find out what the subject at hand actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the downvoting problem this sub seems to be experiencing, all I can say is this: persevere. If you see misinformation or something equally suspect, report it. If you see something as a relevant piece of information that
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be seen, upvote it regardless of your personal feeling towards the subject matter. The thing about a place like this is that everyone is here for a reason. And while it may not be for the same
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       reason you are here, these things we share in common with each other are beyond the scope of our personal prejudice. We are all in this together, so let's act like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I would just like to thank everyone involved in this sub and everyone involved in the spreading of information that is relevant to our survival as a species. It saddens me more and more each day to see my fellow man completely enslaved by their own kind, be it through financially crippling mortgage payments or through the thick layer of blubber that is reality TV. We all
       <em>
        exist
       </em>
       on the same planet, but unfortunately we are not all
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       the same planet, if you follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these people, they don't know any better. They only have what they have been able to absorb from their environment, coupled with their own curiosity and fearlessness, however limited it may be. And the thing is, none of us started out the way we are now. We all share a similar past of an uninformed existence. But we are here now and that is what matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thank you, each and every one of you, for this. For each monolithic oak that has stood the test of time came from a tiny seed, unaware of its own significance at the time of being said seed. We are the seed. Let's get to work.

        How is a submission's score determined?
       </p>
       <p>
        A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are "fuzzed".

       One could only blame "vote fuzzing" for what we're seeing if it had always been like this. The massive downvoting of good posts and upvoting of troll posts is a fairly recent development. It was also sporadic at first but is now constant.

       Disable downvotes. You might end up with crap on the page but it may be the only option to keep the good stuff there as well.

       Either that, or make sticky posts about each issue that way they can't downvote them into oblivion. A sticky each for NSA, manipulating the internet, Sandy Hook, 9/11, etc.

       How can we honestly determine if a person is a shill or troll without witch hunting. Also you can do that for yourself with Reddit enhancement suite. Though only you can see your tags.

       When a submitter submits to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , they should make a comment on their own submission to the new queue, to nudge others into clicking it. Users who see this link should reply with a link to another submission in the new queue that is relevant, that way even if things get downvoted there's still links to them in other threads, able to be discovered by users browsing these threads years from now

       I agree with this concept as we have other subreddits but they are not as strong. If we can clarify and organize great subs that can cover all the bases, we can potentially multitaskingly migrate and build up those communities as well as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that if it is possible, to maybe a way for reddit to introduce a tier system for new accounts to earn the privilege to downvote, or a way to reflect the choice of negative contribution over positive contribution.

       Because that's another derailment tactic.  The intelligent commentary gets buried below pages of distracting banter with shills.

       I look at it differently.  If you go to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and try to post something "transparent" about the Obama administration, it will get removed.  Similar to Tesla in
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       .  Stuff doesn't get deleted so much here, and what does is logged in
       <a href="/r/uncensorship">
        /r/uncensorship
       </a>
       .  So you get more noise here, but also a lot more transparency.  Which is more like the real world.

       The Oculus bot has been providing evidence AGAINST vote brigades by providing a timestamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the bot's comment states a timestamp score of 64|20 - 44 karma for this thread 5 hours ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is now at 225|92 - 133 karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since being posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , this thread has
       <em>

       karma, thus disproving any allegations of a brigade.

       Why? Can you explain your leap of logic? Because last time I checked, proof has to be universal. Just because it's proof for you doesn't mean it actually makes even the tiniest modicum of sense for anybody else.

       The problem isn't the time needed to install the explosives, but the fact that they are impossible to conceal. One person in the building for a few minutes would likely detect the explosives, let alone thousands of workers.

       Do not waste time with this debunker, he doesn't care at all about what you say, he will ignore everything and continue throwing his blind belief.

      <p>
       Just as an example of how biased he is, in his next reply he continues insisting that explosives are impossible to conceal and that one person in the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the mind of a person interested in having reasonable discussions, this is the mind like a child that has his ears covered and spits the nonsense fantasies that he believes to be possible without a shred of common sense. It's borderline pathetic.
