<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/manna">r/manna</a></p>

<p>The only thing that makes me a little uneasy when thinking about it is what do you do with all of the people who get automated out.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the term &quot;basic income&quot; floating around a bit more lately.  At least people are starting to talk about it openly.  Something will need to be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot about one thing. Taxes. Taxes keep the rich rich. If there is no economy, and no one has a job because robots do every job, then the tax base is erased, and so is the need to produce any product, because no one can purchase what they are selling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t write this story.  Just sharing it to start discussions.</p>

<p>I think the point the writer is trying to get across is that we will all still be taxed, up until there is no need for us.  When there is no need for us, there is no need for our taxes.  We will all be on welfare, basically.  Except for them who will have all needs met, without having to deal with us, because the bots will do that.  The elite may just conscript us into fake wars in order to control population at that point.  &quot;you are conscripted Mr. Jones because you have no other use in society.  Please get on the bus, grab your gear.  Enjoy helping your country.&quot;</p>

<p>Just one scenario that could happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>also, just to add.   They don&#39;t really need our tax money right now as it is.  They just create their money whenever they want.  It&#39;s all based on nothing anyways.  It was based on gold and silver in exchange for work.  Then it was backed by oil.  Now it seems to be backed by us believing it to be real, and nothing else.  Even &quot;real&quot; paper money only makes up less than 10% of money now....how long will it be until we have no physical money?  Just money run by bots.</p>

<p>Even the stock market was exposed this week as being fake, and just a game the rich play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there was no other people on the planet but the rich, then they wouldn&#39;t be rich. It&#39;s like batman and the joker. They need each other for the other to even exist. Rich people get off more on watching someone be humiliated to wait on them hand and foot because they know that that person is in awe of them, or jealous and envious of the lifestyle they live. If they had no one to compare it to then your just a comfortable person with robots. If inequality becomes too great people always say fuck this and start rebelling. If no one rebelled to the situation described in the essay, then they frankly deserve to be in that situation. I for one would rather be dead and die fighting then live in the situation described.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good!  I&#39;m glad you would rebel!  I would be standing right there with you.  The thing with the story is that it happened over time.  The lifetime of the one individual who sounded like this happened over his lifetime.  So it didn&#39;t just happen over night.  The Elite took over the country bit by bit.  Slowly they took control of every aspect of each persons life until they all sold all their possessions and owned nothing in the end.  The end being when they were sent to the boarding homes (fema).  They had nothing to fight back with, and no support to fight back.  It became more of a psychological case than anything else.  You should really read it all the way, so we can talk about it more.  :)  love sent your way, have a great day!</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go with construction for now.  As it is way to all over the place in design and implementation.  Even though I am seeing most new buildings being made the exact same.  How many of the same style highrises do you see in your city?  I see only a few different plans being used for anything in the last 5-10 years.  Most are concrete structures with the same floor plans on every level up to the top.</p>

But that&#39;s the funny thing about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/futurology">/r/futurology</a>. Here we see the technology as a tool of the oppressor and there they see it as a means to free ourselves.

<p>&quot;&quot;The real interesting question to me is at what point does Project Australia attempt to assimilate the rest of the world into their system? Maybe the rest of humanity will attack them, maybe they&#39;ll reach out and ask for help? It&#39;s interesting to think about.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was thinking as well.  Australia would probably incorporate other countries that wanted the help/tech/and lifestyles.  It would be hard to turn down when your country is a pit of despair, and then you see a country that is 1000 times more advanced in everything.  Then again, the other countries could want to take over Australia, as it has resources and freedoms.</p>

<p>What I would see happening though is that the people of Australia would start to go offworld in some sense.  Since they already made the space hotel, it would be easy for them to start developing tech that would terraform the moon and mars for habitation.  Once everyone started to invest their time and credits into that project it would probably happen in no time.  I like this idea best of all.  A resource and respect fed colony on other planets where they strive to make paradises happen.  Once this was completed or even just implemented, the stars would literally be the limits.  :)   One day I hope to see our world strive for this type of system.  There really is no other way that makes sense to me.  Love sent, have a great day! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But is it really?  :)   I for one see this outcome happening in some ways in our lifetimes.  I listed the name of the book, chapter 1, and the name of the author.    The rest is always up to the reader to interpret fact, or fiction in everything.   Should the MSM also tell you what they talk about as all being fictions as well?  </p>
