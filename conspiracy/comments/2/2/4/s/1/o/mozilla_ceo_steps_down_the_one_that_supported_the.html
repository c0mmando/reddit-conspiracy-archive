Have you never had a job that had ideologies you didn&#39;t agree with but still had to follow them because you represent a company? He did nothing to show that he would not follow Mozilla&#39;s outlook that was in place before him. </p>

His clearly wrong take of the matter should not have been discussed.  He works for the corporation.  If skmething he personally believes in can adversely affect the business, he needs to shit bis tucking trap and do his job.  Mozilla has unfortunately lost much ground to Chrome, and with them not focusing as heavily as they should have on mobile browsing, this could be perhaps a good move for the cpmpany.

<p>I think it is sad that people would be willing to throw babies out with bathwater. The privacy point and the gay marriage issue are TWO issues and seeing the privacy issue take a blow for ANY reason, in this political environment is not good.</p>

<p>Because they do not exist, as with all other ideas.</p>

<p>Your natural &quot;rights&quot; exist so long as you are able to defend them; there is no natural force that exists to assist you in doing so, or which guarantees that you have access to them. They are ideas, nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, lets not get personally insulting here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being dramatic at all, I&#39;m saying they&#39;re both bad.  Some people think the gay rights issues are worse than the privacy issues.  Others feel privacy is a much more important than gay rights issues.</p>

<p>Clearly you feel gay rights aren&#39;t as important, that&#39;s fine, but others would disagree.  Personally I don&#39;t put a weight on either, I consider the privacy point good, but I also think it&#39;s bad that they oppose gay marriage.  One doesn&#39;t have to be worse or better than the other.</p>

<p>In any case, whether it was his personal donations or not doesn&#39;t matter. If he works for a company and that company feel the actions of an employee undermine it&#39;s message, it&#39;s their right to fire him. And I&#39;m guessing the company would have got a lot of pressure from LGBT groups. It&#39;s 2014, we don&#39;t need bigots anymore basing their prejudice on religious beliefs drilled into their heads or people that are just ignorant.</p>

<p>Yes, how dare anyone organize to criticize their corporate masters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have no legal basis for their demands</p>

<p>Total strawman.  They weren&#39;t seeking a legal remedy.  They organized to exert pressure on a corporation in order to hold them to what they perceived to be a higher standard. It&#39;s something more of us should be doing.  That said, it&#39;s not a battle I personally would have chosen.  $1000 bucks to this &quot;culture war&quot; cause or that is hardly damning behavior in my eyes.  Also, I find it disturbing that only the intervention of another large company (OKCupid in this case, Google in the case of SOPA) seems to make much of a difference these days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The three board members who resigned sought a CEO from outside Mozilla with experience in the mobile industry who could help expand the organization’s Firefox OS mobile-operating system and balance the skills of co-founders Eich and Baker, the people familiar with the situation said. They did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eich was a dumbass for getting involved in unpopular political campaigns, but I have a feeling this was just an excuse to kick him out for other reasons. These things are usually about money.</p>
