    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking, too. Some news channel I saw this morning reported the campaign finance story complete with illustrative graphics. So time and money got put in to reporting it...a little. But it&#39;s not the 3D model of a 777 they apparently need to show 40 times a day to make it worth the expense.</p>

<p>That they moved on to an &quot;if it bleeds it leads&quot; story so quickly just shows how few people actually cared about it in the first place. Local traffic reports probably would have sank this story.</p>
