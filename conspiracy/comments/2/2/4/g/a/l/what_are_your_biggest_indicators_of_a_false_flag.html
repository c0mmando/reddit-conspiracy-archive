       I noticed the talk of false flags is a lot more common now. It seems like almost every day there are new proposed false flags taking place. My big question is what are your personal biggest indicators for false flags. What makes your mind click to think something is amiss? Is it the parties involved? The timing? The location? I know this will tend to be different from person to person; im just trying to get a little insight on why you all think some of these events may be distractions or have a hidden agenda?

       So, for example- you just assume that it is a flase flag purportrated by whoever could possibly benefit from the false flag attack? It is an automatic assumption that if someone could benefit for any reason (obvious or obscure) it is a false flag? Or do you have a threshold for benefit/action ratio?

       You asked for
       <em>
        indicators
       </em>
       . An indicator is neither evidence nor cause to jump to a conclusion. It is, however, reason to at least look at beneficiaries as possible perpetrators.

       Correct. Indicators tend to be similar innature, whereas evidence will be totally different from each occurance. Im simply wondering- with lack of immediate evidence, what usually blares out to some as "false flag".

       Wouldn't you think that the recent abundance of false flag discussion has ensued from the leaks in the Turkey government? Have you read about that debacle at all?

       That seems like the easiest confirmed example of a false flag operation.

       Ah, but what specifically about an even would make you think false flag. Are there any emotional indicators that just make it happen. For example there is a decent amount of false flag talk about the recent Fort Hood thing, or the Malaysian airline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not questioning the veracity of the claims, im just wondering about personal triggers.

       A well executed false flag operation isn't going to have "indicators". That's the dilemma. All we can do is speculate.

       Two things that indicate media deception;
      </p>
      <p>
       1) hedging their statements when hedging is unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the sun
       <em>
        appears to have
       </em>
       rose in the east this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) when Sydney Corcoran (BMB) describes her mothers injuries, she says
       <em>
        we think
       </em>
       that part of the bomb hit her in the legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) when media fails to hedge when they should hedge.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) authorities confidently say Tsarnaev's killed Sean Collier to get his gun, even though there is absolutely nothing to support this.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) authorities confidently proclaim a ridiculous motive with zero supporting evidence. For example, "they hate us for our freedoms" ( where do they come up with this shit?)

       Since we are not privy to the conspiracy behind a false flag, the most important things to look out is how people behaved during and after the event. For instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Did anybody appear to have foreknowledge? (Larry Silverstein who should have been in the WTC, but had a short notice "dentist appointment")
       </li>
       <li>
        Did key officials behave in an unreasonable way (eg Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld on 9/11)
       </li>
       <li>
        Did "bystanders" at the site behave strangely (eg Carlos Aredondo at the Boston Bombings)?
       </li>
       <li>
        Did law enforcement or medics behave in a way that was contrary to their duties (Sandy Hook, Boston)
       </li>
       <li>
        Was a crime scene not declared when it should have been (WTC)?
       </li>
       <li>
        Did the "victims" injuries appear fake (Jeff Baumann et all at Boston).
       </li>
       <li>
        Victims have no back stories or legit documentation (Sandy Hook victims, Boston)
       </li>
       <li>
        Officials immediately name the culprit (Lee Harvey Oswald, Bin Laden, James Holmes, Ryan/Adam Lanza etc)
       </li>
       <li>
        Was evidence destroyed (WTC/Sandy Hook)?
       </li>
       <li>
        Was a victim's death declared "suicide" by the police and reported in the media straight away, before an autopsy (Aaron Swartz, etc etc)
       </li>
       <li>
        Was the "suicide" verdict inexplicable (David Kelly etc)
       </li>
       <li>
        Was the official report a nonsense (NIST)
       </li>
       <li>
        Were the designated perpetrators immediately reported as being on anti-depressants (Lanza, Holmes, Fort Hood etc etc).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The list goes on.

       Not when what you're searching for is something that is opinion based, something to gather up more variables we the people would site as a source for our spotting false flag events. Allowing you to then address these particulars in your future false flag attacks thus preventing us from spotting the flase flag event and allowing you to continue mind-fucking the genpop.

       Are you not paying attention to what OP is asking you?
He wants to know what triggers what in your mind. Think about it, if the people who are performing these false flag attacks learned how to perfectly pass their attacks off as the legit thing than where would we be? If they learn how to turn their false flag attack lie into a perfectly working reworked version without any triggers that would "Trigger" us to think false flag and begin questioning it to find the truth.
The questions are to mathematical and have a theme of automation. Like they were predeterminedand assorted answers along with questions designed with intent to cause bleeding of information. If you think I'm crazy Than hypocrisy thy name is r/conspiracy

       Or, perhaps- I just want to understand people better as a genuine personal interest.

       I dont appreciate your assumption that I have negative goals in mind, certainly not while jumping down the throat of other people with a similar mindset as my own. And crtainly not while calling everyone with a mindset with the slightest inclination to differ from you a hypocrite.

       My opinion and comments were approached with a demeanor like if I'm am idiot, from a community of people who are scene as idiots by the rest of the world. So how is that going to come across?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to know what personal trigger an individual has in order to understand what constitutes a false flag event buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't generalize all of "you-people" in the carton that you would have others think I did, it was more of a if the shoe fits wear it type of thing. I'd you think I'm crazy for believing what I stayed up above than you fall in the category of a hypocrite.
So no one is to be offended if they are of unbiased mindset. There in last the problem, for if you've taken the side neutrality you've already chosen the side of the oppressor.

       Your comment of "Nice try CIA mole" was at first approached by myself as a sarastic remark. Mostly because you made a rather incredulous claim preceeded by the largest leap to conclusions i have ever seen someone make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you responded to another person who interpreted it as sarcasm by insinuatong that anyone who has a similar minset is a hypocite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there could be a reason, possibly because I have a father with the same mindset who assumes everything is a false flag. Perhaps I want to better understand my father. Perhaps I  dont have bad intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your response should have been to downvote and move along. You added nothing to the conversation at all in any way, amd personally attacled myself and what I would assume is the majority of users on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems we may have reached an impasse, and since i likely would never change your mind that I am trying to build the perfect false flag- i bid you adieu.
