       I realize that they are simply jerking each other off but it seemed like the perfect time to bring up the conundrum. They obviously have found that the best way to limit any investigation is by screaming harassment/doxxing at every turn. I asked time and time again how one can investigate without doing such things and they could not provide a legitimate answer. Shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about you guys here?

       . You'd think that they'd enjoy when a truth seeker wanders into their realm. They can pick me apart and downvote me with their group mentality. But even my words there must be too much for them.

       Trolls get really mad when you talk about crisis actors, so whatever you do never bring up crisis actors, because bringing up crisis actors is the same thing slandering victims

       i guess I'm confused why we are allowed to name names with some criminal suspects, but not with other criminal suspects, especially when the criminals are the ones investigating themselves and discovering nothing wrong.

       There were no victims. You are probably referring to crisis actors. Don't call the crisis actors. They need time to get into character.

       A private investigation on your own is a different thing than a crowd-sourced blog-space free-for-all.

       thats been proven beyond doubt regarding both Boston and Sandy Hook, the remaining question is who organized it and why, what purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       its possible its just all just 'bread and circuses', something to keep people amused and/or occupied with trivia, and away from the real corruption and crimes in high govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       the CT people put their cards in the game, to them its political and criminal life and death, when and if the truth hits the MSM, lots of people are going to go court then jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the high policy people who put the hoaxes into place, sent out their chess pieces, its just a game with disposable pawns, something the CT people prob didn't think about when they went along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       100 million reasons CT and Newtown are happy at the moment, also 100 million reasons for the public to be suspicious.

       I haven't seen that. I keep seeing people
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       that, but I haven't actually seen any proof... it always boils down to the personal information of the owners of likely rental properties. (Why does this guy own all these houses and why do they all have this date and zero dollar payoff - all questions which have been readily answered many times).

       I've seen zero evidence of conspiracy, just irresponsible DOXing of private individuals.
