        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is the right sub to post, but I just had a somewhat insignificant story that I was hoping to get to the bottom of or at least understand better.</p>

<p>A few months back I went to the grocery store to buy a few snacks and dinner for the night. I paid with my debit card, and went about my night as usual. A couple of days later I realized that I had misplaced the debit card, and began to look all around my house and car for it, knowing that the last time I used it was at the grocery store. I had no luck in finding it. I then asked my family if they had seen it around, and asked a friend who accompanied me to the store that night the same thing. Both said that they hadn&#39;t seen it and that I should report a missing card and get a replacement. </p>

<p>The next day I received a notification from my bank that a replacement debit card was being sent to me as they had reason to believe my card may have been found or stolen from where I last used it (the grocery store). I thought this had solved the question of where my card went until two days later I find the missing card in my a pocket of the shorts I had worn that night. At this point I was weirded out just wondering how they would know my card was missing if I had never reported it, and only discussed it with my friend and family.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m asking is if there is a logical or reasonable way that the bank could have known the card was missing? This all happened in about a 5 day period and I just don&#39;t understand what would have alerted them besides listening in on my conversations. (My family or friend did not contact my bank either, I asked them and they were creeped out by the story as well.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I have a similar story. I lost my debit card somewhere on my way home from work, probably when I got in or out of my car. I spent maybe 24 hours looking for it and only talked to my roommates about it being missing. I went to the bank the next day to cancel the card and order a new one. When I got there they told me someone had already deactivated the card. They couldn&#39;t tell me how or when it was deactivated. I know it wasn&#39;t cancelled for fraudulent activity, because I would have been notified. I have no idea why my card was cancelled before I asked to cancel it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very similar to my situation. Only had phone and in-person conversations about the card being missing. Checked my card activity to make sure it wasn&#39;t stolen. Seems far fetched, but the only way anyone (the bank) could have known about it would be listening to my conversations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yours is more suspicious than mine just because my card was actually lost and someone could have found it and called. This is unlikely because my drivers license and student ID were in the same wallet as my debit card, and you&#39;d think if anyone were nice enough to cancel a found card, they&#39;d probably try to get me my wallet back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know how cost prohibitive that would be? One thing I can guarantee you is that no business would voluntarily spend billions of dollars on a program that wouldn&#39;t help them grow their business and would risk absolutely destroying their business if their customers found out. </p>

<p>Our government rarely makes sense because it is a mixture of motives and goals. Businesses always make sense because there is only one goal.</p>

<p>There is something missing from your story. Something you haven&#39;t noticed or failed to account for that explains the situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming you probably use that card often so maybe they noticed that you weren&#39;t using it for the past 4-5 days and notified you that they we&#39;re sending you a new one because they fought you lost it. Banks often check for unusual activity in an account to combat and prevent fraud; so maybe someone noticed that your balance was the same for the past 5 days and assumed you lost your card.</p>

<p>Or someone you told actually did call the bank but their just not telling you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I had thought about that, seems like a strange policy to send out a replacement after such a short time though. I imagine many people go several days without using a card, and I still do quite often. They&#39;d be sending out quite a few replacements for no reason.</p>

<p>Could be though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure but, maybe it&#39;s just extremely easy to get a new card like this as long as the &quot;person&quot; has your information(Assuming if someone else tried this with your situation). Not sure what you had to tell them to get a new card(ID e.g.) but I think their way of handling such situations is just plain shitty. Could be something else too of course don&#39;t leave that out.</p>

Its possible a coincidental fraudulent charge was attempted or your bank acquired a database of stolen information directly pertaining to their services, like your cards info with thousands of others being sold.

<p>And yeah after that I assumed maybe one of my parents had called for me, but they denied it and were just as puzzled as I was. Same with the other two people that knew it was missing. </p>
