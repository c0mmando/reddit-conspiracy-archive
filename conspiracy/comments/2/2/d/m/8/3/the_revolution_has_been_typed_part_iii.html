        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thank all the people who&#39;ve responded thus far to this proposal and yep, if you&#39;re a dick with me I may turn around and be a dick with you. There&#39;s been a common point made about the two earlier essays on how to go about global reform in a peaceful manner which tells me I&#39;m missing something in those initial explanations.</p>

<p>A brief recap, Project for a New Economic Century outlines a simple platform whereupon three committees would co-develop a new monetary system that belongs to the people not banks.  These committees would be composed of a cross section of people from an average community, artists and experts representing a wide range of fields, backgrounds, wealth and beliefs. Together, with input from the rest of the population, they would develop a monetary system that has the unique feature of carrying a commonly agreed upon code of ethics which would strive to make life better for just about every living thing on good ol&#39; planet Earth.</p>

<p>“He who controls the spice controls the universe.”</p>

<p>― Frank Herbert, Dune </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take control of the lifeblood of the system by saying fuck it to their money, their rules and their corruption and create a better currency, a better economy. A monetary system with rules and freedoms which protects the individual and the family and society and punishes the ones who are hell-bent on wrecking the human race.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my point and what follows is the point I’m deducing some people feel is lacking from the earlier posts on Reddit:</p>

<p>I only described the general composition and duties of the committees yet failed to properly define the proposed people&#39;s currency and how it would work.</p>

<p>True.  </p>

<p>I believe those more refined tasks are up to a whole bunch of people not just one person. </p>

<p>Yes, this claim of revolution simply sets a stage where all those great ideas floating out there have a place to be heard in a mass media kind of way and be acted upon if enough people think that yeah it is a good idea after all.  </p>

<p>I figure this process stands a very good chance of making life much, much better for most of us and would greatly improve the destiny of our lot.</p>

<p>Of course I have further ideas on the committees and what this new money could be, how it could work and what it could change and make happen. ..</p>

<p>BUT THAT&#39;S NOT NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE TO SAY OR CONTRIBUTE to the Project for a New Economic Century. </p>

<p>This plan does eventually require the participation of most of us in order to work. Might as well begin now with the Reddit community.</p>

<p>Still not satisfied?</p>

<p>Ok, if I was part of one of the committees I would push for something like this to happen:</p>

<p>Look at the available research, discuss it, listen and hold vote(s) in regards to using the new money in the killing of whales. If the vast majority of people do not want their money to be used in the killing and harvesting of whales those acts would be subject to the strictest regulation of the people&#39;s currency and be outlawed. Any individual(s) or corporation(s) that somehow uses the people&#39;s currency to slaughter whales would have their accounts frozen and assets seized. Countries would be fined. People would still have the traditional right to hunt whales; they would just have to do it without using this monetary means for any aspect of that act just like it was done traditionally.</p>

<p>Does that sound a little too harsh or fascist? Fret not, penalties and rewards have always existed in the system, even in utopias like Star Trek and Free Markets. This plan is about giving the people a chance to write the rules and not have it dictated to them by a handful of crooked rulers.  </p>

<p>In taking this drastic approach to a global problem the three common ground committees would first invite whalers and whale eaters to speak their minds, be heard, change minds. The whalers would also be offered future opportunities like being paid to clean up the pollution in the ocean or combating the effects of global warming and corporate greed on the open seas through means that most people believe is effective and necessary. Done right this new monetary model would produce a treasure trove of new career options and investments in worthy occupations across your country and theirs as well.</p>

<p>So there you have it. A basic idea of one way the people&#39;s currency could work. <strong>I&#39;m not proposing that everything we don&#39;t like be banned.</strong> There would be different levels of incentives and consequences in this monetary system. Common sense and healthy wealth would be the goal.  Some of the bad stuff humans do is necessary for our survival and prosperity. Although from what I&#39;ve read, seen and heard over the years many of our deeds can be done in a more humane, fair and logical manner. </p>

<p>Lately it seems like a lot of things are lining up bit by bit for the system to have complete control over the populace and to have it relatively soon. It appears that over the years a perverted code of ethics has allowed a very small percentage of the population to continually do terrible things and be rewarded for it obscenely.  I&#39;m proposing we change all that in the nicest way possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there <em>hmmmok</em>. Must admit I was taken aback by your plan for economic reform. Parts of it reminded me and a few others of Robert A. Heinlein&#39;s <strong>Starship Troopers</strong> an enjoyable tale about Earthlings with really cool weaponized suits constantly at war with &quot;bugs&quot; on other planets. Meanwhile back on the home planet only war veterans are considered citizens and have the right to vote.</p>

<p>Sure it made some sense in that sci-fi saga but that&#39;s not the kind of society I want for my family or their kids.</p>

<p>The Project for a New Economic Century is not about building a better economy based on warfare. It proposes using a new monetary system for a more peaceful, recovery based economy that puts the survival and well-being of humanity ahead of the suicidal tendencies of the corpocracy.</p>

<p>Which is why one of the first groups invited to take part in the development of the people&#39;s currency are veterans and soldiers. Who better to listen to and learn from when it comes time to dealing with mankind&#39;s violent nature. Our natural born aggression.</p>

<p>Have a hunch that most warriors are screwed and ignored repeatedly these days by their corporate political masters. And as great as the rush of war is, turning everything up, transforming you and your brothers into superior beings there is also that darkest of dark sides.</p>

<p>And no matter what, in order to be the best warrior in the world you have to leave your loved ones behind. Which is where the second best warriors come into the picture. Many battles have been fought over the ages but nobody really wins at war except a handful of bankers, talkers and businessmen.</p>

<p>To hell with that I say.</p>

<p>I say we should continue to fight for good, honourable reasons like when women and children are truly being threatened by thugs who are often linked to those very same goddam bankers, schemers and businessmen. Someone has to stop the assholes of the planet. For the good of us all.</p>

<p>And they should be treated with great respect.</p>

<p>But definitely not as the boss <em>hmmmok</em>. Sorry.</p>

<p>Been there. Done that. It sucks for just about everyone. Including the warrior king in the end.</p>
