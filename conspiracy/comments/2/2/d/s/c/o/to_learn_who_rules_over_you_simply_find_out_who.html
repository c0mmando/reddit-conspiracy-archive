<p>Some guy gets into an authority costume, 
grabs some social engineers, makes people feel
good about themselves, gets them all to agree to agree...</p>

<p>Then he starts fucking them in the ass one by one, lets
them back out into the crowd... and they say
&quot;LISTEN! THEY ARE FUCKING  PEOPLE IN THE ASS&quot;
and then out of the crowd comes a huge chant of...
&quot;YES WE CAN YES WE CAN&quot;
and then they throw eggs at nay sayers.</p>

<p>Except we can criticize Obama now. 
We cant criticize isreal though!

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Can&#39;t criticize Israel???</strong> What are you talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rabbi David Nesenoff of RabbiLive.com</strong>, on the White House grounds with his son and a teenage friend[46] for a May 27, 2010, <strong>American Jewish Heritage Celebration Day</strong>,[47] questioned Thomas as she was leaving the White House via the North Lawn driveway.[numbers - click the link] <strong>When asked for comments on Israel, she replied: &quot;Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine.&quot; and &quot;Remember, these people are occupied and it&#39;s their land. It&#39;s not German, it&#39;s not Poland...&quot;</strong> When asked where Israeli Jews should go, she replied they could <strong>&quot;go home&quot; to Poland or Germany or &quot;America and everywhere else. Why push people out of there who have lived there for centuries?&quot; She also mentioned she was of &quot;Arab background.&quot;</strong> A one-minute excerpt of the May 27, 2010, interview was posted on Nesenoff&#39;s website on June 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what happened next? Helen tried to apologize!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it was too late. She was a MARKED WOMAN, and as fear of retaliation and retribution due to &quot;guilt by association&quot; spread, her friends and associates began shunning her like a LEPER</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas&#39;s agency, Nine Speakers, Inc., <strong>immediately dropped her as a client because of her remarks</strong>.[61][62] Craig Crawford, who co-authored Listen up, Mr. President, said &quot;<strong>I ... will no longer be working with Helen on our book projects</strong>.&quot;[63] Her scheduled delivery of a commencement speech at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, was <strong>canceled by the school</strong>.[64] The <strong>White House Correspondents&#39; Association, over which she once presided, issued a statement calling her remarks &quot;indefensible</strong>.&quot;[65] In January 2011, <strong>the Society of Professional Journalists voted to retire the Helen Thomas Award for Lifetime Achievement</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even Pres-i-dent Obama chimed in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On June 7, Thomas abruptly tendered her resignation from Hearst Newspapers.[67] The next day, in an interview on NBC&#39;s Today Show, <strong>President Obama called her remarks &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;out of line&quot; and said her retirement was &quot;the right decision.&quot; He remarked that it was a &quot;shame&quot; her celebrated career had to end in such controversy</strong>, and at the same time he recognized her long service covering U.S. presidents, calling her &quot;a real institution in Washington.&quot;[68] Her comments also garnered rebukes from numerous others, including White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, former special counsel to and White House spokesman for President Bill Clinton, Lanny Davis, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There, see?</p>

<p><strong>You CAN criticize Israel.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>saying ashkanazi=ask a nazi is disrespectful to ashkenazi jews </p>

<p>assuming all ashkenazi jews are bad people or nazis is no different than claiming muslims are all terrorists.. neither which are true..</p>

<p>that in itself is an anti-Semitic statement and one of the reasons why this subreddit is gaining attention throughout reddit for racism because of a number of outspoken members here (not just against jews)</p>

<p>anti-semitic has several definitions in the english language.  despite most arabs and most jews being semitic in origin, one definition of the word is specifically regarding jews. according to the way language works, it is still valid as it is one of the definitions of the word and not ironic. it is an interesting TIL fact though for those not aware what semite means. saying &quot;you are the shit&quot; is a positive term despite the word breakdown for example but maybe not the best example haha</p>

<p>you can criticize all you want but it is about showing respect and understanding where people are coming from. but maybe logic doesnt work here so downvotes incoming</p>

<p>you can&#39;t get real news in the US anymore... maybe online but usually that is slanted to whatever agenda/ideology the particular site espouses.  sometimes I wonder if there ever was factual news sources or just better covered up agenda.</p>

<p>Is that easier for you to understand what the fuck all I wrote?</p>
