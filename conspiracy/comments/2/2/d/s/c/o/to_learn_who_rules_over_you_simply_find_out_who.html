       Pretty accurate quote right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some guy gets into an authority costume, 
grabs some social engineers, makes people feel
good about themselves, gets them all to agree to agree...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he starts fucking them in the ass one by one, lets
them back out into the crowd... and they say
"LISTEN! THEY ARE FUCKING  PEOPLE IN THE ASS"
and then out of the crowd comes a huge chant of...
"YES WE CAN YES WE CAN"
and then they throw eggs at nay sayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except we can criticize Obama now. 
We cant criticize isreal though!
Or their infernal lobby. 
I felt like getting this off my chest.

        Can't criticize Israel???
       </strong>
       What are you talking about?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Rabbi David Nesenoff of RabbiLive.com
        </strong>
        , on the White House grounds with his son and a teenage friend[46] for a May 27, 2010,
        <strong>
         American Jewish Heritage Celebration Day
        </strong>
        ,[47] questioned Thomas as she was leaving the White House via the North Lawn driveway.[numbers - click the link]
        <strong>
         When asked for comments on Israel, she replied: "Tell them to get the hell out of Palestine." and "Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land. It's not German, it's not Poland..."
        </strong>
        When asked where Israeli Jews should go, she replied they could
        <strong>
         "go home" to Poland or Germany or "America and everywhere else. Why push people out of there who have lived there for centuries?" She also mentioned she was of "Arab background."
        </strong>
        A one-minute excerpt of the May 27, 2010, interview was posted on Nesenoff's website on June 3.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what happened next? Helen tried to apologize!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But it was too late. She was a MARKED WOMAN, and as fear of retaliation and retribution due to "guilt by association" spread, her friends and associates began shunning her like a LEPER
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thomas's agency, Nine Speakers, Inc.,
        <strong>
         immediately dropped her as a client because of her remarks
        </strong>
        .[61][62] Craig Crawford, who co-authored Listen up, Mr. President, said "
        <strong>
         I ... will no longer be working with Helen on our book projects
        </strong>
        ."[63] Her scheduled delivery of a commencement speech at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, was
        <strong>
         canceled by the school
        </strong>
        .[64] The
        <strong>
         White House Correspondents' Association, over which she once presided, issued a statement calling her remarks "indefensible
        </strong>
        ."[65] In January 2011,
        <strong>
         the Society of Professional Journalists voted to retire the Helen Thomas Award for Lifetime Achievement
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even Pres-i-dent Obama chimed in:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 7, Thomas abruptly tendered her resignation from Hearst Newspapers.[67] The next day, in an interview on NBC's Today Show,
        <strong>
         President Obama called her remarks "offensive" and "out of line" and said her retirement was "the right decision." He remarked that it was a "shame" her celebrated career had to end in such controversy
        </strong>
        , and at the same time he recognized her long service covering U.S. presidents, calling her "a real institution in Washington."[68] Her comments also garnered rebukes from numerous others, including White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, former special counsel to and White House spokesman for President Bill Clinton, Lanny Davis, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Hoover Institution senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson.

       You also can't criticize Judaism without being labelled an anti-semite.  We can't even criticize the term anti-semite, having no real correlation with European Jewry.  Where did that term even come from?  I don't know,

       saying ashkanazi=ask a nazi is disrespectful to ashkenazi jews
      </p>
      <p>
       assuming all ashkenazi jews are bad people or nazis is no different than claiming muslims are all terrorists.. neither which are true..
      </p>
      <p>
       that in itself is an anti-Semitic statement and one of the reasons why this subreddit is gaining attention throughout reddit for racism because of a number of outspoken members here (not just against jews)
      </p>
      <p>
       anti-semitic has several definitions in the english language.  despite most arabs and most jews being semitic in origin, one definition of the word is specifically regarding jews. according to the way language works, it is still valid as it is one of the definitions of the word and not ironic. it is an interesting TIL fact though for those not aware what semite means. saying "you are the shit" is a positive term despite the word breakdown for example but maybe not the best example haha
      </p>
      <p>
       you can criticize all you want but it is about showing respect and understanding where people are coming from. but maybe logic doesnt work here so downvotes incoming

       While at the same time I support his right to freedom of speech. I think it hurts the reputation of boards like this when we defend his freedom of speech without criticizing him... Is it logical to have a pissing match with a random Jew that you come accross during your protests? Not so much. Is it rational to refer to putting them all into camps at the end of the video and only leaving out the ones that profess to your beliefs? Not so much. He shouldn't have been jailed, but none the less, some of what he said was fucked up.

       yeah but I just see it as venting - you don't often get the chance to confront people like that..  similar to what you see here really in the vaccination or climate change threads, some call for anti-vaccers and climate deniers to be killed and they get voted up!

       If a courtroom can convict someone like that. Then there is no courtroom. 
A judge goes to judge school. I went to highschool. Does that make me a highschool? Education is nothing. Knowledge is everything. Knowledge is driven by the inquiring mind, the school is driven by the almighty dollar.

       We have 1 radar base in Israel, staffed by 120 personnel. And 1 navy base at the port of Haifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how that would prevent a two sided discussion of things like Palestine in the MSM.   If anything, having a Navy base there, should have made the U.S.S. Liberty news worthy when it happened.

       the MSM isn't really supposed to be criticizing anything, just reporting what is going on.  though I suppose they do under report when Israel is doing something considered wrong.  they under report everything important and over report Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian.  I think the MSM is dying though... look at CNN and its desperation for ratings with the Malaysian airlines thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can't get real news in the US anymore... maybe online but usually that is slanted to whatever agenda/ideology the particular site espouses.  sometimes I wonder if there ever was factual news sources or just better covered up agenda.

       I feel like conspiracy people have a black/white, us/them mentality.  if you say something... anything.. countering their worldview they jump down your throat and call you the enemy.  They ascribe that mentality to everyone else, which is why they see conspiracies everywhere.  not to say that they aren't sometimes right...

       You are correct. Realize that you are talking to a bunch of zombies who do not know they are zombies, and who resent being informed that they are zombies. Don't expect any thinks from them for telling them what they are. But I wanted to say that a few of us are not zombies, and we know that you are correct.

DO go this way, DONT go that way.
We dont like one guy, thats the point... we dont 
like the "guy" they put in "office" they just get another.

       There is a flaw in Rockran's logic, anyway.  You aren't allowed to criticize this subreddit *on this subreddit.

       Therefore, if this subreddit rules you in any way, it is limited to this subreddit, as you can criticize r/conspiracy all day long at various locations and other websites with little recourse from employees of Reddit.

       This quote is used as a very specific brand of propaganda.

       It's always used to point out the political spin of "antisemitism"- which is a very real thing.

       Absolutely.  I've seen posts where conspiratard actively promotes hitler quotes to get this sub to upvote.  It's the association fallacy and a very strong form of propaganda.

       People criticize Israel all the time without real repercussion.

       Do you know who you aren't allowed to criticize in America? Blacks, homosexuals, trans, the handicapped, etc.... Not that you

        ever

       should.

       In the United States, I think anyone should be allowed to criticize anyone else. (not to the harassment levels that drive teens to kill themselves, obviously)

       I'm saying that just because some twits in CA decide to make something illegal doesn't mean the whole country is ran from Tel Aviv. CA passes stupid laws as a matter of habit.

       Your anger issues are clouding your ability to think. You are focusing on an aside, not on the point of my comment. I will rephrase in your dialect, for your sake.

       This is the gawd damned US of A, and we can say whatever the fuck we like about whoever we like. Those fucking pinkos in California are trashing the First Amendment.

       yeah but I just see it as venting - you don't often get the chance to confront people like that..  similar to what you see here really in the vaccination or climate change threads, some call for anti-vaccers and climate deniers to be killed and they get voted up!
