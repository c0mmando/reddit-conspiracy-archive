       I don't think this is the right fight. Partly because of how easily this can be spun into the Republican-Democrat dichotomy. Gun nuts vs. environmentalists. Obviously I don't really think it's that simple but it will be portrayed like that by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more cut-and-dry things to go to the mattresses for, like wealth inequality, rich people being above the law and mass warrant less domestic spying.

       I am suspicious that the conspiracy websites are being whipped into a frenzy about this.

       He stopped paying fees to the BLM because they are supposed to use the fees collected to help the ranchers.  Once they ceased doing this, and began buying out the other ranches Bundy stopped paying the fees to them, and instead
       <strong>
        attempted to pay the fees directly to the county
       </strong>
       .  The county refused his offer so he had no one legitimate to pay the fees to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But please, do try and convince me that someone whos family has been working that land for well over 100 years is "living above the law" by refusing to pay a fine for something they have been doing without incident for generations.

       Okay, to start this off I am quite fascinated by the whole conspiracy landscape but I think most of them are dumb, and this is probably the dumbest of them all. I have a unique point of view on this subject, as my family experienced in a way, less than two generations ago, (I currently live in America, also i'm 14 so I apologize for any spelling errors on mobile). Anyways, I believe I have a unique view on this because I am a native Sami, my Grandmother and Grandfather were born in Norrbotten, Sapmi. They we're in a way expelled from their land using superior economic capabilities, and acquiring the ways in some very shady ways. My Grandparents we're forced to move to a suburb of Stockholm and live like the rest of the modern Swedes, but when my Grandparents moved, they only spoke Lule of the Sami script. This caused them to experience a lot of racism from surrounding people, they ended up learning Svenska after much time, they gathered enough money to move to America, where they started a family and raised kids. What the whole point of me trying to say here is that my whole family isn't 'upset' like these people are, my family understand that times change things change, you can always live like you did in the past. 100 years isn't that long, and having to pay taxes on land owned by the government so you can graze your cattle is in my opinion perfectly acceptable. I don't know why I included my family story as people I know will likely read this and know that I am ethnic Sami.

       Don't take this the wrong way, but you are only 14 and have little life experience.  This is the curse of being young.  I'm sorry your grandparents and other family were forced off of their land, but this does not excuse our government for sending in armed thugs to try and steal a mans property, especially when the rancher has done 0 damage to the land that the BLM can quantify.  When you get older and begin to actually see the abuses of the government directly effecting you, your friends, or your family, you may begin to change your tune.

       -Mike Combs By SHIREE BUNDY COX:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I have had people ask me to explain my dad's forward stance on this BLM fight. Here it is in as simple of terms as I can explain it. There is so much to it, but here it's in a nut shell. My great grandpa bought the rights to the Bunkerville allotment back in 1887 around there. Then he sold them to my grandpa who then turned them over to my dad in 1972. These men bought and paid for their rights to the range and also built waters, fences and roads to assure the servival of their cattle, all with their own money, not with tax dollars. These rights to the land use is called preemptive rights. Some where down the line, to keep the cows from over grazing, came the bureau of land management. They were supposed to assist the ranchers in the management of their ranges while the ranchers paid a yearly allotment which was to be use to pay the wages and BLM to help with repaires and improvements of the ranches. My dad did pay his grazing fees for years to the BLM until they were no longer using his fees to help him and to improve. Instead they began using these money's against the ranchers. They bought all the rest of the ranchers in the area out with they're own grazing fees. When they offered to buy my dad out for a penence he said no thanks and then fired them because they weren't t doing their job. He quit paying the BLM but tried giving his grazing fees to the county, which they turned down. So my dad just went on running his ranch and making his own improvements with his own equipment and his own money, not taxes. In essence the BLM was managing my dad out of business. Well when buying him out didnt work, they used the indangered species card. You've already heard about the desert tortis. Well that didnt work either, so then the threats began and the court orders, which my dad has proven to be unlawful for all these years. Now their desperate. It's come down to buying the brand inspector off and threatening the County Sheriff. Everything their doing at this point is illegal and totally against the constitution of the United States of America. Now you might be saying, "how sad, but what does this have to do with me?" Well, I'll tell you. They will get rid of Cliven Bundy, the last man standing on the Bunkerville allotment and then they will close all the roads so no one can ever go on it again. Next, it's Utah's turn. Mark my words, Utah is next. Then there's the issue of the cattle that are at this moment being amateur. See even if dad hasn't paid them, those cattle do belong to him. Regardless where they are they are my fathers property. His herd has been part of that range for over a hundred years, long before the BLM even exsisted. Now the Feds think they can just come in and remove them and sold them without a legal brand inspection or without my dad's signature on it. They think they can take them over two boarders, which is illegal, ask any trucker. Then they plan to take them to the Aucion Richfeild and sold them. All with our tax money. They had paid off the contract cowboys and the auction owner as well as the Nevada brand inspector with our tax dollars. See how slick they are? Well, this is it in a nut shell. Thanks"

        One of the things you said I disagree with most, it isn't up to him how they spend the money, you don't get to decide where your taxes go, my parents don't want their tax money going to the Israelis oversees, but they still pay taxes.

        They weren't owed to the county.

       1) Just because the federal gov't swoops in and lays claim to land that was at one point the property of the state/public does not make it ok for them to do what they want with those that live and work in that area
      </p>
      <p>
       2) This was not a "tax" that he was refusing to pay.  This was a fee for services mandated by the BLM.  They are supposed to be supporting the ranchers in the area with the money they receive.  They have failed to do so, so he refuses to keep paying them.  The fact that you
       <strong>
        cannot
       </strong>
       choose where your tax dollars go is one of the many reasons taxes shouldn't be handled by the federal gov't.  They should be strictly voluntary and handled at a local and/or state level.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I realize this, I mentioned that to show that he wasn't looking for a free ride, he just wanted his money to actually go toward something that is helpful to him, not something that is trying to force him off his land.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Shame the colonists didn't do this, could have avoided that whole pesky "revolutionary war" thing /s
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  Perhaps, but if that were the case they would have warrants and the like, and wouldn't be tiptoeing around the seizure of his property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the government is "right" according to the written letter of the law
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       mean you are wrong for protesting against abuses, even if those protests turn violent

       1.tax
taks/Submit
noun
a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.
synonyms:   duty, tariff, excise, customs, dues; levy, toll, impost, tithe, charge, fee
       <br/>
       2) You don't get to decide where the money goes though. He had no legal right to the land.
       <br/>
       3) Or maybe he was smart enough to know that the government is going to come in and take this back, he knew that he owed them nothing.
       <br/>
       4) You obviously don't understand what I said. Trying to pretend that you want to pay by 'trying' to pay it to someone he wasn't supposed to is just a genius way to gain public support without paying your 'fees' (taxes)
       <br/>
       5) They did... It's not wrong but you have to get people to agree with that it is abuse. I don't believe it is, and I know many people don't.

       Y'know LOIC was just a DDoS tool? Nothing really special? All it does is take down a website for a day, and get a bunch of script-kiddies raided by the FBI. Don't use it. Taking down a government agency website, that no one gives a fuck about anyway, isn't worth federal time.

       I'm still on the fence about this being a huge trap. This wouldn't be the first time the USG has baited the militias into an exposed position. I have to view calls to 'organize' with some suspicion as well. Clearly, persons have already organized. Calling for slacktivism at this point only paints a clear target for media and ideological whitewashers to attack while ignoring the larger issue at play.

       I think the less attention this event gets, the better. If the situation turns south, it could spark something we really don't want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, both sides WANT this to blow up. Everyone hoping for a revolution will finally have their "They drew first blood!" excuse, and the government will have its "Rise in domestic terrorism" excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I say this situation needs to be diffused, even if it means that man has to lose his land and cattle. Cards are stacked way in favor of the government winning if it comes down to bloodshed.

       I think we should up the anty a bit: Time to start taking names and doxing these brownshirts. After we have built our database of brownshits we start paying them visits in their personal lives; when they're off the clock. At their homes, in their church, at the local market. It's time to start holding them personally accountable for the actions they force upon the average American. This will get their attention like nothing else. Right now they get to return home and take off the uniform and blend back into society. We need to remove that privilege from them.

       We should organize and tell the idiot rancher to stand down and agree to stop grazing his cattle on land he doesn't have permission to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should also organize and tell the idiot militia to stand down and go home.

       There is nothing defensible in the rancher's position. He and the militia with him need to stop being asshats before another tragedy occurs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I have had people ask me to explain my dad's forward stance on this BLM fight. Here it is in as simple of terms as I can explain it. There is so much to it, but here it's in a nut shell. My great grandpa bought the rights to the Bunkerville allotment back in 1887 around there. Then he sold them to my grandpa who then turned them over to my dad in 1972. These men bought and paid for their rights to the range and also built waters, fences and roads to assure the servival of their cattle, all with their own money, not with tax dollars. These rights to the land use is called preemptive rights. Some where down the line, to keep the cows from over grazing, came the bureau of land management. They were supposed to assist the ranchers in the management of their ranges while the ranchers paid a yearly allotment which was to be use to pay the wages and BLM to help with repaires and improvements of the ranches. My dad did pay his grazing fees for years to the BLM until they were no longer using his fees to help him and to improve. Instead they began using these money's against the ranchers. They bought all the rest of the ranchers in the area out with they're own grazing fees. When they offered to buy my dad out for a penence he said no thanks and then fired them because they weren't t doing their job. He quit paying the BLM but tried giving his grazing fees to the county, which they turned down. So my dad just went on running his ranch and making his own improvements with his own equipment and his own money, not taxes. In essence the BLM was managing my dad out of business. Well when buying him out didnt work, they used the indangered species card. You've already heard about the desert tortis. Well that didnt work either, so then the threats began and the court orders, which my dad has proven to be unlawful for all these years. Now their desperate. It's come down to buying the brand inspector off and threatening the County Sheriff. Everything their doing at this point is illegal and totally against the constitution of the United States of America. Now you might be saying, "how sad, but what does this have to do with me?" Well, I'll tell you. They will get rid of Cliven Bundy, the last man standing on the Bunkerville allotment and then they will close all the roads so no one can ever go on it again. Next, it's Utah's turn. Mark my words, Utah is next. Then there's the issue of the cattle that are at this moment being amateur. See even if dad hasn't paid them, those cattle do belong to him. Regardless where they are they are my fathers property. His herd has been part of that range for over a hundred years, long before the BLM even exsisted. Now the Feds think they can just come in and remove them and sold them without a legal brand inspection or without my dad's signature on it. They think they can take them over two boarders, which is illegal, ask any trucker. Then they plan to take them to the Aucion Richfeild and sold them. All with our tax money. They had paid off the contract cowboys and the auction owner as well as the Nevada brand inspector with our tax dollars. See how slick they are? Well, this is it in a nut shell. Thanks"

       Yeah, just give in right? I mean it's not like they will just keep telling us where we can live, and how right?? I mean, the Fed's are totally within their constitutional right huh???... Oh wait? They're not?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to draw the line somewhere. They will keep regulating everything if we let them, and then taxing it. The government is taking a huge over-reach, yes. These people are doing the right thing. This is a lot bigger than just some rancher not being able to use public land for his cattle.

       The more and more militia with guns show up at that ranch, the more feds will arrive too. And the more heavily the feds will be armed.

       So the people in law enforcement, in your opinion, should be mindless drones who follow their orders unquestioningly without bothering to consider whether they're just or moral?  That's really what you're advocating?

       Why stop there - the gestapo were just following orders, after all.  The operatives involved in Project Phoenix?  Just following orders - no harm done.

       You really think that the "checks and balances" still exist? You must enjoy the bubble your living in. We have a full fledged oligarchy. Its not a conspiracy, or fear-mongering. Quit burying your head in the sand and acting like the government is acting in the best interest of the people. It cares nothing for the people unless your a special interest group or minority group that can be bought in exchange for their votes and ignorance.

       I imagine you could find the specific answer somewhere in the court documents and legitimate news articles covering the incident.

      <p>
       From what I read, Bundy did pay (the state) grazing fees but later stopped so even he, at one point, agreed that he didn't have the right to have his cattle graze freely.

       Exactly. I have a feeling that he hasn't done so because the court will rule against him and require him to pay up for the past 16 years that he has illegally grazed. AFAIK, currently it's only being requested that he pay this year's grazing permit and every year from now on so long as he keeps his cattle there. Seems like a more than reasonable request.

       I don't think it's about his checking account. At this point he's risking his life and the life of whatever family is left in that ranch with him.

       All they have to do is raise a gun at an agent an they will shot. That would be a.worst case senerio though, like they issue warants and are trying to enter the home, not likely to happen unless the militia stays around. Without the militia they just take the cattle to pay the permit fee, sure he will be pissed lots of fear mongering will go don but in reality he just made a lot of extra money by not paying the fees for the last 20 years.

       Im just going to keep reporting you. If you have alternative viewpoints by all means share them but stop acting like this guy is some snobbish lucky-above-law mooching crime lord and telling anyone in this sub who is against females being smashed to the ground by cops, or security, or whatever the fuck they are nowadays, that we're all crazy assholes.

       Report him for what? What rule of this subreddit has he broken?
      </p>
      <p>
       The report button is not an "I disagree" button. Trying to get opinions banned because you disagree with them is censorship. This is supposed to be a forum in which everyone is free to express their views.

       I reported him because of his comment history in which he consistently insults nearly everyone and distracts, derails and derides as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I in no way tried to 'get opinions banned'.

       On the other hand, your /u/ is one that caught my eye the other day when you and a whole shitload of other /u/'s, all with similar ages and various karma, were all derailing, conflating, and agreeing with each other nonstop in the most curious ways. So now that you've reappeared on my radar, I might ask the mods to look at you as well. Because I'm pretty sure you're the same guy. I've seriously had enough of the manipulation on this sub and I don't give the slightest, sweetest fuck about machine gunning that blessed little report button if it forces the mods to look at the bored scum that are here to do nothing other than attack and insult and downvote.

       Well that response was more ridiculous than I anticipated. You are the type of poster who makes this forum look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Now that I think about it, let's see the posts you mention about me agreeing with other posts in "the most curious ways".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious if you'll admit to pulling that out of your ass or if you'll try to provide some ridiculously flimsy evidence. Those are the only 2 possibilities I see here.

       He stopped paying fees to the BLM because they are supposed to use the fees collected to help the ranchers.  Once they ceased doing this, and began buying out the other ranches Bundy stopped paying the fees to them, and instead
       <strong>
        attempted to pay the fees directly to the county
       </strong>
       .  The county refused his offer so he had no one legitimate to pay the fees to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But please, do try and convince me that someone whos family has been working that land for well over 100 years is "living above the law" by refusing to pay a fine for something they have been doing without incident for generations.
