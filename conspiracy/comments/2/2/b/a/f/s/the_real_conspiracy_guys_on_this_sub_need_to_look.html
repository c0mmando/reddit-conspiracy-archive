       OK...I believe there may actually be dots connecting with this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       After noticing that
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22ayjx/exclusive_usiran_war_plot_exposed_falseflag/">
        this post from /u/AlwaysCensored
       </a>
       regarding a possible false flag event in the Strait of Hormuz was getting heavily down voted, 
I recalled that the
       <a href="http://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=9164263">
        Maersk Alabama was last seen in the Strait of hormuz...and it's still there.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now...as some of you may recall, a couple weeks ago there were
       <a href="http://deadlinelive.info/2014/03/19/malaysian-flight-370-hijacked-by-us-navy-to-protect-suspicious-cargo-newest-updates/">
        reports
       </a>
       that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU)  stated that Flight 370 was already under GRU “surveillance” after it received a “highly suspicious” cargo load that had been traced to the Indian Ocean nation Republic of Seychelles, and where it had previously been aboard the US-flagged container ship MV Maersk Alabama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within 24-hours of off-loading this “highly suspicious” cargo load bound for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370,
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/2-ex-navy-seals-on-maersk-alabama-died-of-respiratory-failure-police-say/">
        the two highly-trained US Navy SEALS assigned to protect it, Mark Daniel Kennedy, 43, and Jeffrey Keith Reynolds, 44, were found dead
       </a>
       under “suspicious circumstances.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Now...
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/20xanv/mystery_plume_explodes_from_new_mexico_military/">
        a couple weeks ago I posted this
       </a>
       . About a week later there were reports that the "suspicious cargo" was
       <a href="http://greatgameindia.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/mh370-mystery-suspicious-cargo-destroyed-in-a-massive-explosion-near-1945-nuclear-bomb-test-site/">
        taken and flown from  Diego Garcia to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico
       </a>
       . (I know it's an off source..but it's hard to find uncorrupted established sites now.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P31VRYfzhvk#t=63">
        This is a good video about the explosion.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After all that my thoughts are, was it really the "cargo"? Or is the real load still on the Maersk Alabama in the Strait of Hormuz in waiting for an event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, just some Saturday night musings... your honest thoughts?

       is a link to the 2 soldiers deaths onboard Maersk Alabama. According to it, the suspected reason these 2 Navy Seals died was respiratory failure from Heroin use.

       Man, I've gotta say, it really looks like you could be on to something here. Any theories on what the cargo could have been? Or is, if it wasn't destroyed?

       hey, take it from an ex-junkie here, its not like that if you can control it or keep it in check. maybe they had been injured and ended up getting hooked on their painkillers, eventually moving onto heroin? just putting it out there because i know plenty of people in prime physical form, as well as people in the military who have heroin problems.

       I can see the addiction to stimulants.  Special Ops personnel and even some military pilots  are often given stimulants like Adderall(I believe the navy calls them golden wings, IIRC).  To stay awake and alert for long periods of time.  I can't see how something like Heroin would come into it.

       Even if this was all true it's not as damning as all the confirmed truths right in front of us. The time for idle theorizing is behind us. It was perhaps once a hobby, now it's terrifying truth. 370 speculation is a distraction even if true, we have all the info-munition we need, time to hit the pavement.

       BIN is exactly the same as Reddit, the posts are made by users. Some turn out to be shite, others can be really good. I don't know why there is a concerted effort to shame BIN for this, it makes no sense since we are doing the exact same thing here, just in a shorter format.

       Before It's News it loaded with alarmist fear mongering ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the primary reason people view it as shit, because the website format itself does look shitty, it's very unclean and cluttered with many different clashing colors and ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very busy page, as opposed to reddit being super clean and having everything clearly delineated from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - BIN looks like a fear monger profiteering site taking advantage of stupid people who actually believe the power company fears this little device that will save you blah blah bullshit.

       Not that I feel I have to justify myself to anyone here, but I have been a user of this sub for a very long time. Much longer than the age of this account. I would also be happy to have other mods verify how long I have been here and the likelihood of me being a shill, as there are mods here who know my history on this sub over the years. I have done absolutely nothing to this user, I don't know why he attacked me or where he is finding basis for these attacks. However, I would appreciate it very much if this were dealt with soon. I reported this well over an hour ago, I have been called a shill probably a dozen times and have even been threatened with doxxing. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to go through my comment history and see what my purpose for being on this sub is. I really don't feel like telling this guy that "he has a point" when he says I am a shill is how this is supposed to work. Like I said, if you or anyone here doubts my history on this sub, I would be happy to direct anyone to the mods they need to talk to to verify how long I have been a contributor here.

       Well, since you warned the guy I have since been called a shill by him probably half a dozen more times and now I have just been called a shill by a completely "different" user. At what point does the warning actually become action? I don't come here to argue with assholes or start shit. I come here to discuss conspiracies, as I do on a daily basis. Frankly, I don't care what the guys bots say or what he says. I have never been accused by anyone other than him of being anything other than a contributor to this sub. This has been going on for hours now. You yourself have said that you show me on RES as an upvoted user and him as someone who has a history of harassment. I come to Reddit to relax and to learn what I can, however if in doing so I am going to be subjecting myself to some psychopaths trolling then I am sure I can find something better to do. Is there any chance that someone is going to put a stop to this soon or is this going to just continue? Because if it is then I guess there's really no point in being here.

       I think you're on to something with the Seals on the Alabama.  And I'm also watching Diego Garcia closely- the navy is gearing up for something over there, but whatever that is- it's military, even if there are black detention sites involved somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tensions are building.  The Islamic World and Russia are being pushed further and further east by percieved western encroachment.  Iran and Pakistan are conducting a join naval exercise in Hormuz today.   Iran is ramping up their navy to protect interests in the gulf and caspian.  It looks like they're even starting to worry about Hormuz- they're even investing in a oil port in Jask to bypass the strait while piping in product from the caspian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pirates are starting to venture in there, but I can't imagine that's enough of a threat so far from Somalia. A false flag would give NATO justification to put more of a naval presence in the region if they think there's an increased threat based on recent gas discoveries and infrastructure investment.

       It's interesting the part about it being followed by the CDC and CCDCP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a biological weapon, or something related was aboard this flight - the CDC and CCDCP would be all over it.   Did agents die from possible exposure to this weapon?

        a story published by Sorcha Faal

       I know who Sorcha Faal is. When the story first broke, Sorcha was one of a few who were reporting it. Because Sorcha was involved I immediately dismissed it. However, the original reports were before the alleged transport of "suspicious cargo" to NM. There was obviously an unprecedented huge detonation of some sort at White Sands.

       There seems to be Navy Seals dying where ever there is a serious Black Op in progress...this is what caught my attention and warranted a second look.

       Stop, the "explosion" radar signature is a haboob from 3/12/14.  Here is an article:

      </p>
      <p>
       It went from New Mexico into north Texas, yes, toward Amarillo.  There were smaller haboobs in Colorado as well on the same day.

       I'm not trying to derail your hypothesis but most people believe the 'explosion' in New Mexico was probably the military testing radar chaff.  If you google - radar chaff new mexico - you'll get lots of info.

       Chaff has a very different radar signature. Very distinct and not what we saw.

       Well, since you warned the guy I have since been called a shill by him probably half a dozen more times and now I have just been called a shill by a completely "different" user. At what point does the warning actually become action? I don't come here to argue with assholes or start shit. I come here to discuss conspiracies, as I do on a daily basis. Frankly, I don't care what the guys bots say or what he says. I have never been accused by anyone other than him of being anything other than a contributor to this sub. This has been going on for hours now. You yourself have said that you show me on RES as an upvoted user and him as someone who has a history of harassment. I come to Reddit to relax and to learn what I can, however if in doing so I am going to be subjecting myself to some psychopaths trolling then I am sure I can find something better to do. Is there any chance that someone is going to put a stop to this soon or is this going to just continue? Because if it is then I guess there's really no point in being here.
