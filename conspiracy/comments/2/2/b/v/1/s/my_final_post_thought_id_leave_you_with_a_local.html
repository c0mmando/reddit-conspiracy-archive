       I knew this guy. I was friends with his daughters for a number of years. He was one of the last good CO's that the Sheriff's office had. It was crushing for me and my friends when this happened and was a driving factor to keep doubting everything I was being told. His name was Richard Keyser and he was a correctional officer at the Pinellas County Jail. This guy was a worker, cared for the guys that he was tasked with guarding and took great care of his wife and daughters. He was not depressed in the least the last time we spoke. He did have back problems but they weren't debilitating, like the kind that you would get after 12 hours of walking in a jail after 15 years on the job. The area where this happened is known as the Pinellas County Criminal Justice Center. It encompasses the Pinellas County Jail, the court house and the Pinellas County Juvenal Assessment Center. as well as the former boot camp facility, Now being used as the K9 training ground. This was no accident, no suicide. This was flat out murder.

       Bro, I've been on here for around three years +/-. I've had to make so many accounts because of bans and with-out-my-knowledge deactivation's. I've watched this site go through some shit but with Conasta behind it its all over but the crying, and I dont feel like being here when it all comes tumbling down.

       Just so you know what I'm about, I'm a navy veteran and I'm starting a radio show VERY soon. I want to submit my information to Reddit, but that will no longer be my only medium. You are right. This place is a circlejerk for the status quo.
      </p>

       I'm curious, now that you are leaving Reddit, will you be switching to another site or have a portfolio of sites or neither?

       No not switching to anything. Dropping the computer and the interwebz all together. Moving somewhere far away, and just going to live the best I can with what I know. Sure, I'll keep trying to shed light on the fucked shit that goes on, just at a very limited basis. The paradigm has shifted and there are more people like us now than ever before, and it's just going to get bigger. I've seen and done my fair share. I'm leaving the rest to the better equipped. I hope you all have a great year, and may the rest of your lives be just as fulfilling.
