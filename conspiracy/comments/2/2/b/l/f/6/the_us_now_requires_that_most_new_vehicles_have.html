If not, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/31/autos/rear-facing-cameras/">here</a> it is. <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/in-car-internet.htm">Here</a> is a story about how a quarter of the cars on the road in America will have internet by next year. So it&#39;s probably a pretty safe bet that almost all cars being built past 2018 will have an internet connection. License plate scanners will be the least of our worries when this time comes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always put a piece of tape over the camera lens, just like a web cam.</p>

<p>I have one and there are several issues with them:</p>

<p>1) since it&#39;s a video camera, if you are backing up towards the sun, there is so much lens flare you can&#39;t really see anything.</p>

<p>2) if there are dark shadows and bright surfaces, the video contrast ratio makes it impossible to see anything in the shadows, again, not good.</p>

<p>3) if you have been driving in rain or snow, then water or ice ends up severely distorting if not outright obscuring the lens, making it useless.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though, if you put a sticker over the lens and are involved in a backup collision, you could get sued.  So make sure it&#39;s easy to remove the sticker quickly!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to disappoint, but if you have in dash GPS or real time traffic or satellite radio...you&#39;re already completely track-able by anyone with a smartphone and the government can track you speed, direction, music choice, and driving habits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if your vehicle was built after 2007 it has an installed black box that can be downloaded by anyone with the connector. (Think of the Progressive plugin you see on TV. That thing just reports back to Progressive so they can figure your liability.)</p>

<p>Also, any car built after 2011 has the ability to sync with any vehicle equipped with the internet (Think Dodge Ram or your bluetooth enabled smart phone) when you drive past them on the highway to update your data. Unless you have satellite radio and then it does it automatically while you drive. </p>
