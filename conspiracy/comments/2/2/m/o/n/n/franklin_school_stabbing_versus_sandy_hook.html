<p>There&#39;s a huge difference between high school students and elementary school students. None of the kids at Sandy hook had cellphones; they were way too young. And as for teachers: elementary school students require way more supervision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s getting to the point where I&#39;m too depressed to even bet money on it. I wish, just once, I wasn&#39;t right about this stuff.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m pretty much convinced that the &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; false flag theory is a false flag in itself, it does a fabulous job of taking the attention of the meds the kid was taking in that case, too. And when the police and judges and coroner help by redacting or omitting the data, I truly believe they&#39;re complicit in those murders and any future murders caused by the same &quot;adverse reactions.&quot;</p>

<p>It sickens me the effort some take to hide the true cause of these crimes and saddens me how many people fall for it. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually do a search. I called out the first two ops who called it a false flag. One admitted to be trolling and the other refused to say why he thought it was a false flag.</p>

<p>So yes, people do post things here to try and make the community look bad and people like you eat it right up. Find me an op that will defend this point of view with actual points of discussion and I&#39;ll eat my hat. Hell, find me a single poster positing this. You can&#39;t because anyone who suggested it was challenged and they all backed down. You might want to look past submission titles if you want an accurate representation of this community, anyone can submit anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiritards are &quot;disinfo agents.&quot; &quot;Agents&quot; does not necessarily mean corp/gov. Every post yesterday were Conspiratardians. Really makes you want to go back in time and see who the &quot;Sandy Hook false flag!&quot;<sup>1</sup> initiators really were.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Though I don&#39;t really blame the Sandy Hook false flaggers. Isn&#39;t that a better story? That all those little kids are alive and everyone&#39;s an actor and it&#39;s just a big plot to take er guns, and not the reality, that some kid lived in his basement like a trapped animal, got hopped up on the crazymeds, then killed his mom and a bunch of first graders? Jesus, who can blame any rational, moral, good human for choosing to believe the former story over the latter...:(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think the false flag conspiracy theory is far more horrifying. You also are implying there is consensus as to the story of that day. There isn&#39;t. Even among those who don&#39;t believe the official narrative. 
The reason I am more terrified of it being staged is because it would be used as a Trojan Horse to usher in far more than 26 murders. </p>
