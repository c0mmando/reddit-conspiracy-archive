       Suppose vaccinations were used both as a tool for good as well as bad. The fact that they prevent or rid certain diseases may be true, but why couldn't it also be a practice in controlling the populace? There is evidence of vaccines linking to certain sicknesses, and as we all know the connection between vaccines and autism has been burned to the ground. Suppose this was an argument distract and dissuade people from the actual reason for vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that the original creator of vaccines had good intentions, but put into the wrong hands, anything can be manipulated for worse.

       Here are some excellent resources, to cut a long story short vaccines are an attempt to induce highly profitable autoimmune diseases and allergies, these are lifelong complications which leave the victim dependent on drugs for life, that means serious money for the pharmaceuticals.  You are no use to them if you are healthy, they need you to have symptoms, symptoms which require treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do they get away with this?  It's mainly through incredibly poor so-called 'Vaccine Safety' studies; they do not use real controls in their studies, only other vaccines i.e. no saline solutions to compare against, their idea of a control is another vaccine with Aluminum, Formaldehyde, Aborted Fetus etc, but just without the Virus.  This is clearly junk science, then the 'Safety Study' goes on for at most a few days, yet autoimmune diseases from vaccines can take 2 months, 6 months or even 2 years to appear after a vaccine.  So, that's how they get them through 'testing'.  The next part of the scam is not tracking vaccine damage, they make almost no effort to track the harm the vaccines are doing, it's just voluntary reporting, and given how long vaccines take to cause disease very few will deduce that the vaccine caused their illness.  It's estimated that at most 5% of vaccine damage is reported, but already $Billions have been paid out in compensation.
      </p>

       Absolutely, if the body was left alone autoimmune diseases would be incredibly rare, but we keep on injecting agents (adjuvents) which are designed to trigger immune responses; this means that we end up with lots of unwanted immune responses as well as the ones which were planned.

       Absolutely, I wouldn't touch antibiotics unless I was on my death bed already with bacterial pneumonia.  People vaccinated after a course of antibiotics are often severely harmed.  Sames goes for Tylenol / Paracetamol which makes vaccine damage far more likely.

       If you're making a list of importance to judge the world on don't you think what you choose to ingest, be it food, liquid and especially directly into your bloodstream, it would be one of the top priorities?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that it may be your personal preference on what you choose to consider but this post was written to propose that vaccines should absolutely be questioned.

       The former head of vaccines at Merck found HIV and a Carcinogenic Virus (SV40) inside the Polio Vaccines, he's on video confessing this.

       For anyone who is short of time but wants to get a fair idea of both sides of the vaccine debate I'd recommend this award-winning documentary

       It tends to be that a specific drug company will sell a vaccine that regularly causes a specific complication, and of course they sell the drug to treat that complication.  So like you say it's not essential that all the drug companies have got together on this, any individual drug company can use this tactic i.e. they sell you the problem and then the long-term solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an example of Bayer doing exactly this, they even admit so in their own documents, people went to jail for this in some countries.  They sent out products contaminated with HIV to increase the sales of their HIV drugs, it was an injectable blood-clotting medicine used by hemophiliacs.

       PS The shills will always try a cheap shot on that and say "It wasn't a vaccine", well it wasn't a vaccine on that occasion, but it's the same business strategy at work of sending out contaminated injections.

       The basic way to look for the truth about vaccines is to look into the reputations of the corporations who make them; these are criminal corporations who are regularly fined huge sums of money for knowingly putting dangerous products on the market.  With vaccines they have a conflict of interest, as they profit directly from vaccine damage; they sell you drugs to treat the symptoms which their vaccines induced.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these corporations were in China the execs would me executed by firing squad for their crimes.  In the USA, Big Pharma lobby(i.e. bribe) the government for laws to allow them to get away with murder (literally).

       The Chinese vaccine schedule is one which I haven't looked into personally, however I have heard of what happens when doctors take bribes from pharmaceuticals there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has the biggest childhood vaccine schedule by far, that's why the US has the worst infant mortality rate in the first world.

       It'd be interesting to compare the studies and practices done in different parts of the world. One thing I think worth mentioning are allergies and how common they are here compared to anywhere else in the world.

       The people who were vaccinated were known to be more likely to go down with Small Pox.  In the end it was only way they started using quarantine that Small Pox was eradicated, that info came for a chap directly involved with the final stages of the eradication.

       I think the anti-vaxx talk is Russian propaganda.  You gotta remember, the Ruskies tried this before under codename
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_INFEKTION">
        Operation Infektion.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a cruel yet brilliant idea.  If there's a medical technology that is keeping Americans healthy and safe, if via propaganda you can make them willingly refuse, thereby sickening themselves and the rest of the population, an adversary can inflict major damage on us without every actually being present -- just transmitting bullshit ideas that the sheeple eat up.

       Yes yes, I've just posted it all above, lots there.  I was once pro-vaccine, I used to believe in them all, now over years of intense study I've knocked them off one by one, I still believed certain vaccines even a number of years back, but now I've read too much, the whole thing is a scam I'm sorry to say.

       There is only one and it is only when given in the Third World, it's the single Measles vaccine (not the triple shot MMR) when given in the malnourished Third World, this actually does genuinely improve infant mortality rates.  This shows that if vaccines were in the right hands and used with sound logic instead of "Let's profit from spreading disease" then there could at least be some good that would come from them.  Unfortunately they're currently in the hands of criminals and are being abused.

       Wonderful, thank you so much for the info and your time.
If you haven't posted about these studies before, or in a while, you should. There's a lot of great counter arguments for those that may want to see them.

       Have you come to any conclusion that certain vaccines are beneficial?

       It should make you rethink your understanding of autoimmune. The body works perfectly. There's a causation behind every reaction.
