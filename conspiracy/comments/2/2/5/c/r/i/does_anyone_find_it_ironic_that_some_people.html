<p>I rarely venture into the realms of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, but I made an exception today. </p>

<p>I think I was called a racist more times today than I have in my entire life, and only because I associated myself with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Yet this sub (and my submission history) is full of material that focuses on exposing the racist, psychotic elite...the disconnect is baffling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, though it&#39;s <em>much</em> less prevalent than it was in the past. Markedly so. It used to be a persistent, glaringly obvious thing that no objective person could have denied (though past mods tried to). It was a HUGE black eye on this sub going back a year or two ago.</p>

<p>These days, aside from the odd user or two most of that is gone. The mods do a good job of culling the worst stuff when it appears. Outside of a small handful of users - only three comes to mind - you rarely see overt anti-Semitism here anymore. Anti-Israel stuff, yes, but that&#39;s not the same thing as anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Pretty damning evidence. The last time he was reported, I gave him one final warning. At this point, there would be only one reasonable course of action left to take.</p>

<p>While some <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> regulars have in fact posted anti-Semitic material here, that does not change the fact <a href="/u/4to3">/u/4to3</a> has posted legitimately racist material here as well, and has failed to abide by our agreement to cease posting this type of content. As such, he is now banned.</p>

<p>Furthermore: I would like to apologize to anyone who may have been offended by his or anyone else&#39;s offensive remarks. Racism is not something this sub condones nor tolerates. Nor do we tolerate trolling, harassment, personal attacks or false accusations of racism or any other unfounded accusation of rule violations. Trivial violations who do not harm or offend anyone will be removed. Moderate violations will result in a warning. Repeated violations after a warning or extreme violations will result in a ban. </p>

<p>If you see evidence of legitimate rule violations, please report them. If you feel a repeat offender has slipped under our radar, message us and we&#39;ll get to the bottom of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here a little less than a year, and while I have seen a few overtly anti-Semitic posts / comments, most of those that are <em>accused</em> of such are actually anti-Zionist - critical of Israel, its policies and the disproportionate influence that Zionists wield on the policies of the US and other nations.</p>

<p>When you <em>do</em> see overtly anti-Semitic posts/remarks, there is a good chance that they are being posted by the r/conspiratard boys, who are always working overtime to smear the reputation of the sub and its members.</p>

<p>Anyone who has read my posts knows that I am a vocal critic of Zionism - which is Jewish Nationalism and is <em>itself</em> a disgusting form of racism.</p>

<p>Accusing  someone of being &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; because they oppose Zionism is about as logical as accusing someone of being &quot;anti-white&quot; because oppose the KKK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accusations of racism against us are merely tactics used by them to defame us. People who haven&#39;t taken the time to study what we represent, get turned away easily when others claim we are racists.  There are certain terms that have a big negative connotation to them because of the history behind it, and can be used by some as a quick way to get people on their side. Lies travel faster than the truth. </p>

<p>So I am not surprised at all that there is no truth to it, and yes you are right, the opposite is actually closer to reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a poster who is regularly called a racist, yeah, it is a bit ironic, particularly since the ones leveling the accusations are usually from the biggest tribe of racists on the planet. But it&#39;s not racism that is politically incorrect, it&#39;s the wrong kind of racism. Blacks can be as racist toward whites as they like, including assaulting them physically on the streets for no reason, and nothing is ever said about it in the Jew-controlled media. Women can be as bigoted as they like toward men, and nothing gets said about it. Jews can say anything they like about anybody, and they are protected by the sacred Holocaust. The &quot;racists&quot; are the white Christian males, especially those that speak about the hypocrisy of the rest of society. It&#39;s the politically incorrect racism that gets slammed in here, not racism in general, which is regarded as just fine and dandy by the &quot;useful idiots&quot; who enforce political correctness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s a conspiracy against white men?  Perpetuated by who?  The majority of the people in positions of power are white men themselves.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is against the masses of all ages, races, nationalities, creeds, etc. to keep us all divided and fighting amongst ourselves.  What you&#39;re doing only serves to keep us divided and plays directly into the hands of those who are conspiring against you (and me, and everyone else, including the blacks, jews, asians, etc.).</p>
