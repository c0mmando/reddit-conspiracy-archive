       I've been a hardcore skeptic with interest in conspiracy theories for a long time, and I just discovered Graham Hancock.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is an archeologist/journalist/historian/philosopher, and he has blown my mind since I discovered him.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of his primary hypotheses is that there was an ancient global civilization which was almost totally wiped out by the great floods ~10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.  As a student of history with an interest in ancient history, this theory makes the world a much more sound and sensible place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than writing a novel in this title post, I'll urge you all to google "Graham Hancock" if are not yet familiar with him, and hear what he has to say about our world.  If nothing else, he is an example of an outside thinker who has been systematically ridiculed and discredited unfairly by those who hate his ideas.

       Currently reading Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock, really interesting book with tons of evidence that supports his theories. If you're at all interested in ancient civilizations, I suggest you give it a read.

       If you like graham, you might also find interest in Loyd Pye, Zechariah Sitchen, and David Icke. If you look at all of their work 1st, William "Bill" Milton Cooper will connect the remaining dots for you. If your not afraid if the word God, Chuck Missler has great work too. All have an array of lectures and presentations available on the Tube. Love and Light.

       Icke is the only name there I recognize, and I don't stay with him.  Either he is going way over my head or spitting BS because I just don't see eye to eye with Icke when listen to his speeches.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I like about Graham is his scientific integrity.  He never makes claims which are false.  His theories come from evidence, and the holes he pokes in the existing 'story of civilization' are gaping.  As a student of history, I have the utmost respect for Graham as a historian.

       After being a follower of Icke for a while I had to stop paying attention to what he was saying. Some of what he was saying I could prove for myself but a lot of it, even if true, is stuff I can't change. It's a lot of fear porn and he doesn't really offer too many solutions for all these bad things which he points out.

       Icke is far removed from the others, as they are from eachother. To learn, you need to be able to heat everything and not believe a word of any of it. If you pick and choose the info, disregard something because of personal opinion on source, or believe a word of what you hear from anybody, and you'll surely miss something important. My recommendation is that you hear everything, from everybody, good bad or indifferent, and let yourself see the truth that fits your world best.

       There is no "belief" involved here my friend. Hearing all without bias is a simple necessity when seeking information. It is the same concept as a jury. If the jury were to say "don't hear him because he represents the defendant", then there is unarguably a lack of proper investigation. And to point at one man and say "if you don't like him you won't like the rest" is nothing short of a closed mind. I mean in no way to offend, but this ought to be regarded as common methodology when dealing with any kind of research. Love and Light ;-)

       Ok. I've obviously miscommunicated my point, or you're hearing about it wrong. Why focus on star child? What part does that topic have to play in this discussion? If what you're doing is attempting to disprove the wealth of scientific research across dozens of topics by Lloyd Pye by calling on a single piece of information, you only further illustrate the point I'm trying to make. You hear star child and your belief is that upon hearing the info, you are required to either believe or not believe. Throw belief in the garbage my friend. Just hear. Nothing is irrelevant, and nothing is the answer to that which you seek. Please, I've stated a very reasonable reccomendation regarding research and study. I meant in no way to specifically call upon you and you alone to take a defensive stance against my words. Love and light. ;-)

       I actually read Chariots of the Gods, and it's almost pure speculation.  He claims that aliens cross-bread with humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems much more likely that what helped carry our early civilizations was an even earlier civilization, not aliens.

       Check out The Sirius Mystery by Robert Temple. The book was written in '76 and if O remember correctly goes into detail about the Dogon tribe in Africa and their knowledge of the multiple stars in the Sirius system. Pretty interesting read.

       the ancients were the Atlanteans and the Lemurians.

       id recommend looking into Doreal's translations/channeling of The Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean.

       you do not have to believe it at all, i just recommend a read-through again and again, and think about what you read, something will 'click'.

       It sounds interesting, but I gotta be skeptical.

      <p>
       Channeling of ancient tablets from Atlantis which talk about ETs sounds like fiction to me.  Maybe I'm just a bad skeptic, but that sounds too outrageous to be true.

       Yes but he is not writing as an archeologist. He mentions this like once every few pages in his books. That is why his books are so good. He is not making baseless claims as somebody with no credentials but is using the work of actual archeologists to question the orthodox views.
