        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello. I&#39;ve never really read much about conspiracy theories, but recently I stumbled upon David Icke&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke#Reptoid_hypothesis">reptoid hypothesis</a>. </p>

<p>I was just curious if this theory is considered true within the larger conspiracy theory community, and if so,  are Icke&#39;s writings considered definitive on the subject? This question is not meant as any sort of attack or to rile anyone up, I&#39;m genuinely curious about whether or not this theory is widely believed.</p>

<p>Edit: thank you all for your courteous responses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reptoid hypothesis is not widely accepted, it represents a small faction, mostly David Icke fans. Icke is one of the most widespread promoters of the theory, I am not sure if he created it, but he has popularized it.  Icke&#39;s writings are &#39;pop&#39; definitive on the subject. I&#39;ve actually read them all out of curiosity, its very interesting. I do not subscribe to the theory, but I see how he makes at least a mildly convincing case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In general no, it&#39;s usually used to lampoon conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The people who seem to buy into it are the ones that generally claim they have psychic communications with aliens, and that there&#39;s some big war with multiple aliens fighting over the nature of humanity.</p>

<p>A lot of them will even weave Judeo-christian beliefs into it, with them representing the side of darkness and Satan, and the good aliens being agents of God.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a much smaller group of people with more extreme ideas, and without judging too much, usually there&#39;s more going on with those people than just being skeptical of official stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s easy to poke fun at the esoteric world, and to roll your eyes at their outlandish theories, it&#39;s not so easy to dismiss them entirely. Our inability to have direct knowledge of things outside of our own experiences, and the very bizarre nature of humanity and existence itself, leaves us with a giant universe of possibilities where anything can have legitimacy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that &quot;reptilians&quot; are running the planet, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if shape-shifting aliens are behind the curtain. Anyhow, I wish this sub was a little more lenient in discussing this subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can see no one here thinks Icke is on to something, May I offer my comment for all to see to be sacrificed on the downvote alter?  No one else that I know of has identified our enemy with a descriptive name and poignant narrowing down of who the enemy is. Our enemy is Rothchild Zionism and based on studying the patterns of these gangsters one can conclude that he has identified the culprit with such accuracy that I believe he is on to something beyond logic statistics and even proof . Sorry but you have been programmed to interpret this information through a solid world , logical brain . He may be wrong or misplaced on this, but he is right about our enemy and thinking outside the box to consider a wave form universe outside of the spectrum of visible light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe we should start respecting ants a lot more then! Sometimes I kill them and I feel so guilty...I really do! They are so tiny, but so...alive! Who am I to take their life away?</p>

<p>Save the ants! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think at one point he was on to something, but then just started connecting a lot of nonsense together.</p>

<p>I think that initially, when Icke was talking about reptilians, he didn&#39;t mean it as literally as he does now. He was talking about the people who rely on the &quot;reptilian mind&quot;, eg. The psychopathic leaders of religious, financial and political institutions. He was talking about this group of interconnected people that do have a lot of power in the world. Then he started saying they were literally shape shifting lizards from another dimension, which just makes the whole theory sound ridiculous.</p>

<p>He also makes claims about the reptilians taking children and eating them.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m sure plenty of you have read the stories of TPTB kidnapping children, using them as child prostitutes, sex slaves, and murdering them. There&#39;s been some cases where major child sex trafficking rings have been uncovered, and involved some important political and corporate people.</p>

<p>So I think initially he was on the right path. He knew about these psychopathic groups in power, how they&#39;re kidnapping and abusing children, etc. Then somewhere along the line he got everything twisted and turned the &quot;reptilian minded psychopaths&quot; into literal &quot;reptilian aliens&quot;.</p>

<p>That said, his theories aren&#39;t too popular around here. They&#39;re pretty extreme and unsubstantiated. I&#39;ve found his theories and writings tend to be more popular in the &quot;New Age&quot; crowd, rather than the serious conspiracy theorist crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I want to give the man any publicity, but his &#39;performance&#39; or whatever the fuck he did at the Oxford Union is on Netflix (UK) if you have access to it. It&#39;s a pretty good way to dip your toe in the water if you&#39;re interested in his theories. One of my best friends read a couple of his books and from what I&#39;ve heard of it they&#39;re full of wildly unfounded theories. 
Icke takes pride in &#39;connecting dots and seemingly unrelated events&#39;, though many contend that this is in fact a save-face justification for the absence of any serious evidence to back up a significant portion of his claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find David Icke to be somewhat a conundrum. I think some of the things he has to say are on point and insightful. Then, he&#39;ll throw in some crazy-ass theory that is so absurd that you are too embarrassed to even mention him so that you don&#39;t get associated with his ideas.</p>

<p>In short, I like listening to him when he isn&#39;t talking about lizard people.</p>

<p>I may buy into some crazy conspiracy shit occasionally but I do not believe that the world&#39;s elite and influential are a separate species of shape-shifting lizards.</p>
