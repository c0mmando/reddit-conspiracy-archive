       The theory is that it was planned for a few reasons.  To get public support behind two major wars, and get a better foothold in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       To divert lots of money to the armed forces, private contractors, and weapons manufacturers, of which powerful people are supposed to be heavily invested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       To erode rights through the patriot act, when they knew they could pass it without much push back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you won't find many people that will argue against the fact most of these things actually happened, even those who believe the official story will agree with most of these points, at least to some extent.  The big question is, was this planned by the government, or were they just taking advantage of a situation that fell into their laps.

       I think that if 911 was an inside job it wasn't much different than what happens to a bill in congress. One guy has something that he really wants to get done and he writes up a plan. Then everyone else is like "Sure, I will help you, but we gotta do this too". Call them earmarks of evil.

       Why was it necessary to destroy an entire building to destroy evidence? Why were the time-tested methods of shredding and incineration, which have been employed with total success for decades prior, and utilized successfully since, necessary in this case?  Instead of rigging a building with never-before-used fireproof demolition equipment and risking the exposure of those documents by launching them into a busy city, why not instead remove them and dispose of them safely, the way it's always been done?

       I don't think any of it happened for just one reason, and I think destroying records was just something that might have been seen as convenient to do at the time while everything was already in the works, call it a double play?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, who says they weren't properly destroyed prior to the attack to prevent just such a thing as them flying into the streets like you said? Who says they were destroyed at all? Maybe they were just relocated and their known whereabouts were obliterated to halt any attempts to find them?

       The "government" as a whole was not responsible, just a few key members within the government (Cheney, Bush, Rumsfeld), some senior advisers and individuals in the military-industrial-media complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well the "longer term benefits" that others have outlined, there were some more immediate, tangible benefits too. From memory, and if you want more information, just type the key words into google.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Larry "pull it" Silverstein and other unnamed investors bought the lease on an asbestos-filled white elephant called the World Trade Centre for a ridiculously cheap price of $100 million. It was cheap because the estimates for removing the asbestos ran into the $billions. All this was conveniently avoided by the destruction of the whole complex on 9/11 and it also resulted in a huge double-dip insurance payout of $5 billion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The destruction of part of the Naval Intelligence Office at the Pentagon also destroyed the documentation relating to (and the enquiry into) the $2.3 trillion Iraq fraud announced by Rumsfeld on 9/10.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Large quantities of gold bullion were stored in the WTC and this is reported to have been removed just prior to the destruction, by persons unknown. Certainly most of this gold was never found, and is unaccounted for.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Valuable financial information in the WTC offices of Cantor Fitzgerald was destroyed on 9/11 including the ownership of Treasury Bonds and other debt instruments worth many $billions. Most of the individuals who might have been able to provide information or testify on issues relating to the above financial instruments were conveniently killed in the collapse.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ongoing investigations into financial fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission were terminated after the collpase of Building 7, where the SEC kept all their most sensitive files.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, you see, the beneficiaries made almost unbelievable amounts of money directly from the 9/11 attacks. These people and others also made $trillions (from taxpayers) in the form of additional defence spending by the US government since 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       A final thought goes to the victims, because there were a lot of real victims of 9/11, and some of them were clearly deliberately put in harm's way to ensure their everlasting silence.

       If you don't understand what they got out of it, it's because you don't understand the differences in legislation between now and pre-9/11 days. Which is not an insult. Probably no one completely understands it, but I'll attempt to explain some of the highlights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is now a "battleground for the war on terror" for an indefinite period of time, according to the 2011+ National Defense Authorization Acts. This decree could not have cleared Congress without the egregious example of terrorism represented by the 9/11 attacks, and it has a slew of consequences that have indefinitely transformed the US into a police state "for as long as the war on terror continues." (under Congressional inquiry, the Pentagon admitted this may be 20 years or more, and refused to define an end-date) Among the many, and often subtle, differences this makes is that the US military now has jurisdiction on domestic soil. There's a good reason many of the founders warned The People against allowing such a standing army on domestic soil. It makes insurrection nearly impossible, as we saw with the 2011+ Occupy Movement, now that we have documented evidence of the military and intelligence conspiracy against that movement, and others like the Tea Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 also catalyzed the expansion of powers granted by the 1950 Defense Production Act, with its current incarnation, The National Defense Resource Preparedness Executive Order (EO 13603). This Order grants fascistic power to the Executive branch and immunizes it against the checks and balances of the other two branches. And the key difference between it and the 1950 DPA, for those who try to convince its the same thing, is that those powers are no longer just for "times of war" and "emergency situations." They can now be used in "peacetime" and "non-emergency situations." (those quotes are from 13603)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the matter of "indefinite detention" which, contrary to the president's worthless signing statement, can very much be used on US citizens to detain them without probable cause (on suspicion of "belligerence" alone, and the Pentagon refused to define this term, under Congressional inquiry), lock them up without trial or access to a lawyer, and hold them "for as long as the war on terror continues. The reason that signing statement is worthless, btw, is because right before they have the authority to detain you indefinitely, they strip your citizenship for the suspicion of belligerence. So you wouldn't technically BE us US citizen anymore if they decide to use it on you. Or they can just assassinate you, like they did to Michael Hastings and Anwar al Awlaki.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you beginning to see the differences it has made? I'm just trying to be brief, but I could literally write you a book of all the significant changes directly attributable to 9/11, and still only have scratched the surface.
