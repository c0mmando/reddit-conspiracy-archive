    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/newsletters/research-quarterly/v23n4.pdf">Indeed, the 
CPG cautions that benzodiazepines should be used especially 
cautiously in combat Veterans with PTSD because of the high 
comorbidity of combat-related PTSD with alcohol misuse and 
substance use disorders (upwards of 50% of comorbidity) and 
potential problems with tolerance and dependence.</a></p>

<p>Basically, VA docs are throwing Xanax or Klonopin at PTSD vets, even though it doesn&#39;t really help, and creates a substance abuse threat. The VA itself says it&#39;s a bad idea, but the docs either haven&#39;t heard them say it, or they&#39;re just not listening. They&#39;re making the problem worse, and what may have been the passing interest in suicide that happens now and again to all of us may be pushed into a guarantee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it is intentionally however I don&#39;t think anything will effectively be done about it. We still don&#39;t have our shit together for people who fought in Vietnam let alone those who need help after our other, more recent excursions into the killing fields. I doubt it is about profiting from suicide, but cutting budget costs in &quot;non-essential&quot; areas. The human resource cost is almost always the one that is easiest to externalize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a veteran, I also took two tours for the team, because it wasn&#39;t serving at all it was more invading, in Iraq. Bi-polar runs in my family, and I know I have it, as well as ptsd. I would like to see more veterans try a natural route, marijuana and mushrooms in particular. Until recently I have been an avid smoker and frequent user of mushrooms, usually once or twice every two months, but living in a state that has no program medical or legal makes it expensive since most of the black market drugs are controlled by the government and many agencies. It has done wonders for me and made me more at peace. To me it seems that they want us to die, and they want to throw experimental medications to se what happens to us mentally and physically. It&#39;s a disgrace, it&#39;s an injustice to past and present veterans and until we take back our country, it will keep on going on until it&#39;s time to fight the real enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My very rough calculations indicate that this is about twice suicide rate for the US. A better comparison would be with a group who have similar characteristics - background, out-of-military profession, wealth, geographical area etc - but aren&#39;t vets.</p>

<p>Calculation:</p>

<p>100000*(22 * 365)/21200000 =&gt; ~38 per 100 000 compared with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate">19 per 100 000 for men in the US</a>.</p>

<p>Numbers:</p>

<p>22 from the title</p>

<p>365 days in the year</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/veteranscensus1.html">21.2 million veterans of which &gt;90% are men</a> - with &gt;90% of vets being men, I figure it&#39;s most suitable to compare the overall vet suicide rate to that of men in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that&#39;s less people voting against you.  I know politicians are puppets but think about this politically for a moment.  You can put money for veterans care, and reap all of the veterans votes, or you can just not care and veterans will slowly disappear.  It is similar tactic to how politicians do with the poor.</p>

<p>edit: though it has come to my attention, if you want to organize a coup, it is very good to have a vet who KNOWS what combat techniques will be used on civilians in order to flush them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think its that so much as the beaurocracy being operated is being operated by people who have never served and have no idea what needs to be done. Its just a numbers game to bean counters. The system is setup to reward those that save money not setup to reward those that actually help or fix the problem. </p>
