    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. This is like when that woman who had something to do with Obama&#39;s birth certificate died recently and people said he was &quot;tying up loose ends&quot;. They waited a little long for that one, didn&#39;t they? </p>

<p>It&#39;s frankly absurd to say that this guy&#39;s death is to cover up something. It&#39;s been almost a year; why the hell would &quot;they&quot; wait so long? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like it...  28-year old are supposed to die very seldom.  It&#39;s possible of course, but it&#39;s quite suspicious -- and ESPECIALLY when the Tsarnaev case is involved.  Unfortunately, I cannot pin it down.  But if ANYBODY else knows, now is the time to put it on the table...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit. Thanks for pointing out the obvious. In case you think we are supposed to be a court of law, here in r/conspiracy, we are not. We are supposed to be looking for possible connections and conspiracies. That&#39;s what we do here. Obviously, if there is no connection, we should say so -- once it&#39;s been determined. However, you would only have us read a couple headlines and then decide: &quot;Case settled.&quot; If that&#39;s how you want it, go to r/news. You should like it there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your default setting is to assume, till proven otherwise, that its the most complicated answer and not the simplest one? That seems a bit backwards, no? </p>

<p>This case in particular, cleaning up loose ends, a year later? Kill just one of the cops amongst the thousands involved? Kill a cop that had little contact with the bombers since he was hurt so early in the process? Not kill the members of the arrest team that shot the living bomber when that entire event is considered a lie by many conspiracy weirdos? </p>

<p>This is a simple case of dude wasn&#39;t healthy but seemed fined, and finally it caught up with him. I am surprised these easy to see questions and answers don&#39;t immediately come to your mind here. </p>

<p>Serious question, why do you not look for a simple and plausible answer to scenarios to better prove a possible real conspiracy? If you call everything a conspiracy, then nothing is a conspiracy. </p>
