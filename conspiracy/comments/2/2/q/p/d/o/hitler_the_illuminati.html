    <div class="md"><p>WWII was fought because he double-crossed them; Germany took back control of its money and destiny from the illuminati controlled cabal of international banksters when the Nazi&#39;s came to power, and sought to liberate the rest of Europe in the same manner. It isn&#39;t widely known that he hated freemasons more than he did Jews; so much so that they didn&#39;t usually survive long enough to ever get into a concentration camp. He didn&#39;t expect to be stabbed in the back by the Jesuits though; he thought Mussolini had taken care of the pope by creating the papal state, and so did Mussolini; maybe the pope thought so too? A good case is being made that he was a Rothschild bastard, and survived the war without reprisal because of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My view is he didn&#39;t double cross the international cabal of bankers as he never really had a deal with them in the first place.  The stuff about the cabal secretly financing him and he being a Rothschild bastard or agent is false propaganda imo.</p>

<p>He did not totally crush them though and this appears to have been a trait or tactic Hitler showed to his opponents.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Schacht">Hjalmar Schacht</a> is an interesting character (warning--Wikipedia cannot be trusted on this topic and should only be used as background info) .  He was the Minister of Economics and then the head of Germany&#39;s Central Bank until 1939.  He had ties or was friendly to American and British bankers and was evidently providing information to the head of the Bank of England during war so he could be considered a traitor.  He did implement National Socialist economic policy but resisted implementing the policies when WWII started and his approach was more in line with the Western cabal of bankers.  So Hitler kept this guy with ties to Western bankers close to him until he was a hinderence then dropped him.  </p>

<p>Who knows what was going on.  Maybe Hitler knew Schacht was giving information to England so he wanted to keep him close and eavesdrop on him and feed him disinformation.  Hitler didn&#39;t have him executed though and simply pushed him aside.  </p>

<p>Likewise, when Germany <a href="http://zioncrimefactory.com/2013/12/05/the-nazis-gave-rothschild-bankers-the-boot/">seized private banks like the Rothschilds banks</a> he didn&#39;t execute Baron Louis Rothschild but instead later released him probably because of appeals from the former King Edward of England (via abdication).</p>

<p>N.S. Germany did have transfer agreements with the Zionists to settle Jews in Palestine, and Hitler did renege on that during the war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, entirely. There is absolutely no evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, to suggest he is/was in any way related to the House of Rothschild.</p>

<p>In regards to them funding his endeavors, you can&#39;t really say for 100% certainty one way or the other, though there does appear to be at least some degree of involvement at least via third party financiers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emil Georg von Stauss, the president of Germany&#39;s largest bank, the Deutsche Bank, lent Hitler a portable Remington so he could write his infamous anti-Jewish banker manifesto &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;</p>

<p>Von Stauss, a principal Nazi Party fund raiser, also was a longtime business associate of the Rothschilds.</p>

<p>Hitler dictated &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to typists Rudolf Hess and Emil Maurice during his cushy eight-months stay at Landsberg Prison in April- December 1924. (His five-year sentence was commuted. He had a two-room suite with a view and was allowed to receive gifts and visitors.)</p>

<p>Von Stauss was part of a &quot;Hitler support group&quot; consisting of wealthy Illuminati. Helene Bechstein, the wife of the piano manufacturer pretended to be Hitler&#39;s adopted mother and smuggled out sections of the manuscript. She took care of all Hitler&#39;s expenses and hoped he would marry her daughter Lotte. Franz Thyssen, the chairman of United Steelworks sent Hitler a birthday gift of 100,000 gold marks.</p>

<p>This account was taken from Rudolf Hess&#39; letters by Belgian author Stan Lauryssens, (&quot;The Man Who Invented the Third Reich&quot; 1999, pp.130-135.)</p>

<p>It contradicts the image we have of Hitler in 1924 leading a grass roots fringe party. In fact, he was a front man for the international bankers he pretended to oppose.</p>

<p>Both Nazism and Communism were fake opposition concocted by Illuminati bankers. As we are dragged kicking and screaming into the next world war, let&#39;s recall that the people who issue our currency are behind every war and control both sides.</p>

<p>DEUTSCHE BANK, VON STAUSS AND ROTHSCHILDS</p>

<p>The Deutsche Bank helped to create Hitler because he represented war profit. During the Second World War, the Deutsche Bank profited when it took over banks and industries in occupied countries, &quot;Aryanized&quot; Jewish-owned businesses, and confiscated Jewish accounts. (See Harold James, &quot;The Deutsche Bank and the Nazi Economic War Against the Jews&quot; 2001.)</p>

<p>Before becoming president of the bank, Von Stauss was General Director of Steaua Romana, a Romanian oil company owned by the bank. He was Managing Director of the European Petroleum Union, (EPU), an oil cartel. The E.P.U. was &quot;an international association of industrialists whose object was to make the greatest possible profit on their products.&quot;</p>

<p>The EPU represented the Rothschild interests, the Nobel interests and the Deutsche Bank interests. The latter two probably included Rothschild interests.</p>

<p>After the Nazi seizure of power, Von Stauss coordinated the war buildup at major German corporations such as Daimler Benz and BMW, who were connected to the Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>One book describes him as &quot;an enigmatic character of the Wiemar and National Socialist periods, albeit one who has rarely been given his due in historical studies.&quot; While a major supporter, he never became a member of the Nazi Party and &quot;always maintained good relations with prominent economic figures who were Jews such as his colleague Oscar Wassermann at the Deutsche Bank.&quot; (David Bankier ed. &quot;Probing the Depth of German Anti Semitism,&quot; 2000, pp 256-257.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was instrumental in Aryanizing Jewish assets, even those of Jews who had long ago converted and intermarried. Clearly, there were in-Jews and out-Jews, i.e. Illuminati or not.</p>

<p>Agreed.  There clearly were some funds from international capitalists/bankers/industrialists that ended up in the NSDAP coffers and in the Third Reich generally. </p>

<p>My view, based on what I know now, is that some funding of the party and Third Reich was inevitable and not indicative of ideological collusion.  One, these international bankers/industrialists/etc. probably funded most parties in order to influence affairs.  Hitler and and the NSDAP probably took their money thinking they would not be influenced by it.  Two, it&#39;s hard to be an industrialist in Weimar Germany and not have contacts or funding from international bankers.  Even those that were ideological National Socialists, like Thyssan, the guy with connections to the Bush family, probably had these connections because this is where industrialists went to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">get capital and expertise</a> on expanding their international operations and managing their property:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thyssen owned the largest steel and coal company in Germany and grew rich from Hitler&#39;s efforts to re-arm between the two world wars. One of the pillars in Thyssen&#39;s international corporate web, UBC, worked exclusively for, and was owned by, a Thyssen-controlled bank in the Netherlands. More tantalising are Bush&#39;s links to the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), based in mineral rich Silesia on the German-Polish border. During the war, the company made use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The ownership of CSSC changed hands several times in the 1930s, but documents from the US National Archive declassified last year link Bush to CSSC, although it is not clear if he and UBC were still involved in the company when Thyssen&#39;s American assets were seized in 1942. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the description you cite of Von Strauss working with Jewish banking interests and international industrialists/capitalists shows that it was inevitable that one would have these ties is one was in an international industry.  The National Socialists would probably not be able to find anyone competent to run these enterprises after nationalizing them if they insisted they have no previous connections to international bankers, etc.</p>

<p><em>The most important fact is Von Strauss presided over companies that were ripped from the hands of international bankers like the Rothschilds and nationalized!</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This account was taken from Rudolf Hess&#39; letters by Belgian author Stan Lauryssens, (&quot;The Man Who Invented the Third Reich&quot; 1999, pp.130-135.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but I find this to be pure rubbish.  The fact Hess was into the Occult or helped him write Mein Kampf doesn&#39;t mean international occultist and bankers controlled Hitler.  There was indeed a &#39;Hitler support group&#39; but this was not sinister . . . it was a small group of people that organized and fought for a party and relied on Hitler as its chief spokesman.  Hitler was not into the Occult like Hess was and Hitler opposed international bankers (which he claimed was mostly Jewish).  Granted, anything is possible and these same bankers and occultists do have a habit of trying to control the opposition.  But it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here.  Why did it take so long for the NSDAP to rise to prominence?  The party spent years in obscurity and only slowly rose in getting people elected.  Why did the cabal need them?  They already controlled Weimar Germany and the international capitalists that funded Weimar Germany, as well as the communist party (employing the Hegelian dialectic you refer to above).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both Nazism and Communism were fake opposition concocted by Illuminati bankers. As we are dragged kicking and screaming into the next world war, let&#39;s recall that the people who issue our currency are behind every war and control both sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, International Finance Capitalism and Communism are opposites run by the cabal of bankers.  Fascism and national socialism were a third way.  </p>

<p>In fact, National Socialist Germany (and Japan during this time) <strong>freed their countries of international bankers by taking back their currency.</strong>  They used debt free currency and did not rely on the House of Rothschild and the Schiffs and the other bankers who were parasites and controlling currencies for their own limited private benefit.  </p>

<p>While you may hear mentions of <em>Operation Paperclip</em> in regards to Von Braun and NASA, I have yet to see or her any television documentary willing to discuss the Nazi scientists (and torture doctors) used in <em>Project MK ULTRA</em>, nor of their usage in refining CIA &#39;enhanced interrogation&#39; techniques (e.g. torture), a recent revelation mind you, nor would you hear any mention of <em>Project Monarch</em>, a still-classified (special access) sub-project of MK ULTRA.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it was &quot;invalid,&quot; just that I have red flags.  As a <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> mod you are surely open to the idea that sometimes truthful information can be released by a controlled source (along with a lot of disinformation chaff).  </p>

<p>But my experience with these channels regarding WWII generally, and Hitler and the Third Reich and NSDAP specifically, is it is crap (I just watched a terribly propagandist show in <a href="http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/show/3403868/treblinka-hitlers-killing-machine">Smithsonian re Treblinka</a>.  </p>

<p>As I mentioned in the other comment, the Hegelian Dialectic [1] in the present discussion ivolves international bankers supporting international finance capitalism and international Bolshevik Communism.  Fascism and National Socialism were third ways.  Now granted, it&#39;s not beyond the bankers to support all sides of a conflict (even third ways and center parties), but National Socialism was not supported by bankers.  They truly took on the bankers.  I do accept Bolshevik Communism was supported by the same international bankers that ran nominally capitalist countries like the U.S.  (see Solzhenitsyn for this).  </p>

<p>I also think the Bush involvement with &#39;Nazis&#39; is much ado about nothing.  They were involved with a very prominent German industrialist who happened to share many views with the National Socialists.  He had interests all over the world so naturally would have to turn to international capitalists to help manage things, etc.  If anything, the U.S. was able to snatch and seize this guys substantial assets by labeling him a &quot;Nazi.&quot;  So Bush and gang probably took this one on the chin (notice too that the trading with the enemy charges/claims were later dropped) so that Americans could seize the property.  </p>

<p>Regarding German doctors engaging in torture and Operation Paperclip . . . I no longer accept this story of Americans exporting evil to their country story.  One, I doubt the veracity of many of the claims of German torture and experimentation.  The claims against Mengele are mostly BS for instance.  Two, I don&#39;t doubt that German doctors and talent were shipped to America . . . but rather than being ideological twins it was probably more akin to coercing these doctors to work for them or else . . . slave labor in other words.  They probably faced execution or torture if they didn&#39;t comply.</p>

<p>As far as the whole psychological thing . . . that is way more complicated.  But if anything it was the Germans that were trying to learn from the Americans and British on how to conduct mass propaganda.  Of course Weimar Germany and German doctors were very prevalent in the evolution of this science but it&#39;s not a clear cut thing (e.g. while I once accpeted the idea that the German nature was inherently fucked up, I now see these claims as propaganda . . . see Alice Miller&#39;s work or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron#Cameron_and_the_Germans">David Ewen Cameron</a>)</p>

<p>[1] Hegelian Dialectic is a term I take issue with but would rather not get into because it&#39;s insanely complicated . . . but I accept the concept you are intending to refer to.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget Thyssen was imprisoned by Hitler and his assets were seized.  So no wonder he tried to hid many assets in the U.S.  He was basically a rich industrialist (capitalist) that was stuck between two opposing systems (western finance capitalism and national socialism) and tried to preserve his enterprises.  It ended up being too fine of a line for him to walk.  </p>

<p>On May day 1776 Johann Adam Weishaupt founded the &quot;Illuminati&quot; in the Electorate of Bavaria. He adopted the name of &quot;Brother Spartacus&quot; within the order. Although the Order was not egalitarian or democratic internally, it sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society.[17]</p>

<p>The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.[17]</p>

<p>Weishaupt was initiated into the Masonic Lodge &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, at Munich in 1777. His project of &quot;illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice&quot; was an unwelcome reform.[17] Soon however he had developed gnostic mysteries of his own,[citation needed] with the goal of &quot;perfecting human nature&quot; through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. He began working towards incorporating his system of Illuminism with that of Freemasonry.[17]</p>

<p>During the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which serves the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States — which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism — became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen&#39;s clubs (Bohemian Club) and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government. <strong>There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.</strong></p>

<p>The role they would play would mostly be that their ideas or legacy organizations were still around.  They were after all basically an offshoot of Freemasonry and engaged in Occult type activity.  Hitler was bitterly opposed to these legacies.  Hitler was a reactionary conservative in this regard and actually probably had the support of many Germans as they identified as Christian and resented these weird cults and secret organizations.  Indeed, as Wikipedia states, the Illuminati in Bavaria was opposed by the authorities and the Church.  </p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s possible they did exist during WWII and even now, who knows, because they were a secret organization.  </p>

<p>freemasonry exists, is it not logical that something exists above and beyond that &quot;brotherhood&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it&#39;s possible, but not that probable. Not to mention that freemasonry is a well known organization, unlike the illuminati.</p>

<p>During the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which serves the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States — which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism — became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen&#39;s clubs (Bohemian Club) and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government. <strong>There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.</strong></p>

<p>I never claimed the Bavarian Illuminati was fake (although I should have specified that before), I claimed that it was disbanded shortly after its founding, and that there is no evidence for an Illuminati that currently exists. </p>
