        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sick of the sentiment of hopelessness I see here on a daily basis. We are in a WAR everyday we log into reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We are in a war of information. And as of now, we are losing this war. Shills are all around us and are encircling us in our own subreddit. They are disrupting and derailing us at every turn. They down vote the truth and upvote propaganda for unsuspecting eyes to see and believe. The wolf is at the door and if we don&#39;t begin to fight back, we will be the wolf&#39;s dinner.</p>

<p>We must not give into the wolf and let it in our door. This wolf seeks to eat us and the truth that we seek to distribute to the masses. This cannot be allowed because this forum is one of the last ones left that we have. But the problem is that the wolf is not going to stop pounding in on our door until it gets in. Thats why we must transform ourselves into the bear and eat the wolf when the wolf gets in. And the way we do that is to fight every shill with the truth until shills understand that we won&#39;t stand for their malcontent anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Root out the influence that the US military, Democratic party (probably Republicans too), nuclear disaster producers, corporations (Monsanto, BP, Microsoft, Google, etc.) have on reddit.</p></li>
<li><p>Start a new reddit.  This will happen in time, and is already happening.  Reddit was created with false accounts and depends on fake accounts to preserve it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, I think it&#39;s not so bad co-existing with the shills.  It&#39;s the way real life works.  I get shit on my shoes when I walk on the sidewalk sometimes, too.</p>

<p>The deciding issue to me is how level the discussion is.  If the mods support the shills, it&#39;s not worth your time to participate... just move on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the same as creating a bot that shows what a shill could be/is. You&#39;d need the same skills as being able to make a bot on your own subreddit to stop shills as to make a filter system on a &quot;new reddit&quot;. Everyone would think making the bot itself is the hard thing but the subjects and words it must filter that shills may say is the hardest part.</p>

<p>The thing also is that you might mean a new site where certain subreddits can just discuss in peace because if you try to make a &quot;new reddit&quot; that&#39;d be to big of a margin since publicity is hard to earn as well as a reputation for the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Although recently I fear that this sub has turned into more of an information source for the Enemy than a source of reliable information for its users. Judging by how few upvotes some of the best content gets here, I think i can spread more information to more people on the streetcorner than I can in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Westbourne advised US lobbyists of the need to “pick off” their critics with “sniper-scope accuracy”—to “shut them up,” as he explained to an audience of distinguished guests at a conference in 2012. <strong>Westbourne engages in aggressive rebuttal campaigns, which involves creating a feeling among opponents that everything they say will be picked apart.</strong> This is an “exhausting but crucial” part of successful lobbying, says Bethell.</p>

<p>The more we discuss them, the more power we give them over us. Trolls and enemies are to be expected when people seek out the truth. This shouldn&#39;t be surprising or unexpected. We just have to remain focused on what we are doing, and ignore the trolls.

<p>We are on the same side, if you will believe it. Calling everyone a shill is not productive, and complaining about shills even though our sub is doing everything we can isn&#39;t productive.

<li>a year or two in. begin a mass <em>repentance</em> and make your shill account post that its tired of being a shill, its tired of lieing, its had enough. dont post any crap about whats REALLY going on. just a <em>fuck this shit. i cant do this to people any more</em> EN MASS. this will destroy the shills confidence..but its going to be a long long buildup to it.</li>
