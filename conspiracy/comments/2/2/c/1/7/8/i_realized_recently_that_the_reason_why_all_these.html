        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever wonder why young people don&#39;t feel angry or upset, but rather apathetic with a &quot;that&#39;s just the way the world is&quot; attitude whenever they see a news story of a corrupt politician or policeman getting away with murder so often? It&#39;s because they&#39;ve literally been born into that world and cannot imagine it to be any different, so they accept it because for them, that is how it&#39;s always been. </p>

<p>It&#39;s different for those that were born in a time where so many atrocities didn&#39;t happen so often, because there was more of a public outcry when they did - especially pre-9/11. </p>

<p>Basically, those behind the New World Order agenda are extremely patient in achieving their goal by breaking the minds and spirits of multiple generations of people. I predict a completely numb and docile society of consumers in the next two or three generations at most, who will believe absolutely anything the MSM and the Government tells them without question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The changes are happening very quickly actually.  Apathy might come in the form of food and beverage additives and whatever is in the water supply including psycho-pharmaceutical drugs.  People are weakened physically and emotionally because of environmental pollutions, toxins and stress, and long hours of work make them too tired to fight.  A probable factor is use of subliminal and not so subliminal messages via TV, advertizing and internet, etc. by those who want to defeat and control citizens of the world.  The messages can be intimidating and convince people they&#39;re helpless.  The new shit they come up with like the threat of drones spying on and killing citizens and police doing pretty much whatever they want unchecked is making people docile.</p>

<p>But Then It Was Too Late (1955)</p>

<p>&quot;What no one seemed to notice ... What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people could understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.</p>

<p>&quot;This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.</p>

<p>&quot;One had no time to think. There was so much going on.’&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it -- unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop.  Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‘regretted,’ that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‘little measures’ that no ‘patriotic German’ could resent must some day lead to, <strong>you no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day the cornfield is over his head</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is going to happen. They were played with the most simplistic tactics that a politician could make - lies and vague arguments about change and hope. Most of them voted because he was also the first black president. If people don&#39;t understand the difference between a good leader and a charismatic politician who makes ridiculous promises, then there is no real hope. </p>

<p>We got used, and that doesn&#39;t imply we have the power of political change on our own. I only see more apathy and hopelessness in the future because people don&#39;t even understand the point of working together nor do they really realize the problems. This generation is now admitting that our government is horrible, but then by the time the next generation comes up, they would have forgotten everything and have all the patriotism and faith in the government that we don&#39;t. </p>
