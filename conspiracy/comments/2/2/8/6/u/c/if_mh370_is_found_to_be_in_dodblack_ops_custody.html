<p>Basically has to do with Trans-Pacific Partnership (US controlling trade in Asia Region), Straight of Malacca, China&#39;s most direct shipping route, excuse for US warships to move into region to help search the area for the plane (guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd,  A Navy P-3 anti-submarine warfare plane, a second destroyer, USS Pinckney, The P-3 will continue to search the Strait of Malacca and will soon be joined and or replaced by a P-8).</p>

<p>Would seem weird for all the warships to move into the region but there&#39;s a missing plane so its alright, they are <em>helping</em>...</p>

<p>...Malaysia government is getting the blame</p>

<p>Another forum I visit had some unusually high number of new posters show up to try discrediting the IBM engineer story which made me suspicious of maybe there&#39;s more to this story if so many newbies miraculously show up to a semi popular forum all trying to discrediting it, saying its a hoax or generally just poking fun at the theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the same guy you replied to, but here&#39;s my 2 cents. I would love to believe it was real but I just can&#39;t, for 2 simple reasons:</p>

<p>1) Why and how would he post it to 4chan? I don&#39;t think that a dictated post by Siri would have made it to 4chan, as there&#39;s a captcha and a convoluted posting system. Wouldn&#39;t he have just told Siri to Facebook it or tweet it? His family and friends would have been watching those like hawks and any hint that he might be alive would have been detected far before they got removed.</p>

<p>2) Why would he have worded it like that? If he was really trapped and had gone to the trouble of hiding his phone up his ass, wouldn&#39;t the first message have said something like &#39;kidnapped send help&#39; and then maybe another saying &#39;they took the plane I hid my phone held in the dark SOS&#39; rather than the convoluted thing he sent?</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t realize it was posted on <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/27834494/#27834944">4chan political</a> till late lastnight.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted on 4chan before, not that difficult, don&#39;t need a username or password but you are correct that it should have been as easy to post on facebook as most phones, ipads, computers have username and pass saved to login.</p>

<p>if I were in a drugged state i could see myself visiting 4chan lol and  speaking oddly but great points you brought up and I definitely lean more towards hoax by 4chan troll now</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/diego-garcia-military-base-islanders-forcibly-deported/15840">Some interesting history of Diego Garcia</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;In order to convert the sleepy, Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia into a dominating military base, the U.S. forcibly transported its 2,000 Chagossian inhabitants into exile and gassed their dogs.</em></p>

<p><em>By banning journalists from the area, the U.S. Navy was able to perpetrate this with virtually no press coverage, says David Vine, an assistant professor of anthropology at American University and author of “Island of Shame: the Secret History of the U.S. Military on Diego Garcia(Princeton University Press).”</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this flight disappearing benefited a few people, firstly the IBM engineers who held multi billion dollar patents were killed off and it also gave the US incentive to move its Navy into a strategic position near China. So at least that covers the &quot;Cui Bono?&quot; aspect.

<p><strong>mainstream ppl already know 9/11 was an inside job:</strong></p>

<p>In August of 2004, a Zogby poll revealed that <strong>half of New Yorkers believe U.S. leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9/11 attacks and “consciously failed” to act.</strong> 66 percent at the time called for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York’s Attorney General. That poll was ignored by mainstream media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is &quot;if&quot; they find it on the bottom of the ocean will you then admit you were wrong in all your speculations?</p>

<p>Or will the theory shift to make the facts fit the theory? 
&quot;Yeah they found it, right where the US dumped it.&quot;</p>

<p>I say &quot;if&quot; because they may never find that plane, it&#39;s lost in the ocean and it would be hard to find on the surface not to mention miles under the sea. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>thats a pretty vague question, its not at all specific. 
im not going to admit that im wrong if they find a water bottle that the Airline may have used, if it is conclusive evidence, yes, i will admit im wrong. unlike you &quot;people&quot;, i do admit that im wrong. in fact, i like to be proved wrong. 
im not going to disregard any plane evidence, by far the most vital piece of evidence is the &#39;Black Box&quot;. lets see what data that contains and then we can chat if you like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the black box.. and I agree about the water bottle.</p>

<p>The box is essential to find out the truth of what happened (although it may reveal less than I&#39;d like.. I am surprised in today&#39;s world how limited black box and voice recorder technology is.. 2 hr limit on voice.. i assume overwrite after 2hrs..) and while I commend you on your attitude of open to evidence.</p>

<p>Sadly there are others that will just make up some new shit like the person that started all these rumors. Just because I have a wild thought and post it on a &quot;news website&quot; with some outrageous claims does not make it news or true.</p>

<p>However, your theory; Malaysia isn&#39;t a closed off country, people can come and go as they please. Many of the passengers were also Chinese or other foreigners. I&#39;d also be very surprised if a country like Malaysia could fool the regional powers of China and Austrailia.</p>

<p>Your theory makes more sense now, although I would still like to think that the security services would be smart enough to come up with something other than blowing up a jet plane.

<p>maybe it was sudden move by the defectors and they didnt have time to react in in such a way. it mightve been a panic move by the services to divert the flight to an airbase to secure the &#39;leak&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Telephone: The commercial/private phone system is operated by Cable &amp; Wireless, the 
local British phone company. Phone cards must be purchased to call off the island. 
Phone cards (FonePlus) come in increments of $10, $20, $50, and $100 and may be 
purchased at Cable &amp; Wireless (Stateside phone cards will not work). All payments are 
in cash only. If you are active duty, you will be issued a FonePlus card within days of 
your arrival. MWR adds $20 to each active duty FonePlus card at the beginning of each 
month. You can also use the $20 towards your internet bill if you opt not to take the 
phone card each month. Phone calls range from 55 to 88 cents a minute depending on 
time of day. Your friends and family can also call you. 
 Internet: If you have a computer, bring it along. Another way to keep in touch with the 
folks back home is e-mail or skype. Private Internet access is available through Cable &amp; 
Wireless. All payments are to be made in cash. You can purchase a DSL modem on 
island if you do not have one (many detaching staff sell theirs at a significantly reduced 
price). FonePlus cards may also be used in several wireless hotspots around the island to 
connect wirelessly to the internet with your personal laptop. There are also Internet Café 
computers free of charge at several locations for personal use.</p>
