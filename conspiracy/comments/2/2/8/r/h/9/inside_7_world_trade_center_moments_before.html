    <div class="md"><p>Here I thought I saw almost every video from 9/11. Thanks for posting this. I used to go to school down there. Building 7 actually fell and destroyed a building I had class in. Luckily not that term. I always found it dumb that the city built the OEM control room in building 7 on the 23rd floor. I mean if anything were to ever happen, it was happening right there and guess what it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walking through those buildings for the first time 18 years ago.  Hearing how scary the town that never sleeps is.  Nothing of the sort.  The towers gave a great feeling of accomplishment.  One that was destroyed, the sense as well as the iconic towers.  Destroyed by elements within out own government.  All key players being heavily associated with ONE nation. An unlawful nation, at that.  One that exert unnatural control over us, even more so today.  After they executed their evil plan in the world&#39;s capitol.  They must be stood to defend against the charges.  Tyranny and treason.  A very healthy consequence stands at their proof of guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a great respect for firefighters - true heroes that understand and fully accept that their job requires them to put their lives on the line each and every day. They know the risks are high, yet they willingly shoulder these duties with dignity and honor, running headlong into dangerous and unpredictable circumstances without hesitation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pity that these qualities are not shared by most law enforcement officers, who regularly display malicious cowardice when confronted with much lesser &quot;threats&quot;.</p>

<p>If cops had the honor and attitudes of firefighters, our society would improve dramatically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly men of honor, no doubt.  Those responsible MUST be held accountable.  The mass of life lost.  Utterly sickening.  The financial scams.  It&#39;s unreasonable we&#39;ve come this far and no one has been unquestionably proven guilty.  The most elite crime fighters in the world, and something of this magnitude goes cold.  I don&#39;t believe their lies.  I didn&#39;t when they first uttered them.  The video evidence that morning had already swayed my opinion that was a heavily engineered event.  One not possibly planned by turbans in desert caves.  To outwit the strongest nation in the world in unison, four times.  Without failure or coplication.  Its always been fiction, still those who have the blood on their hands, must be brought to bear the weight of this treason against their fellow citizens.  Innocent citizens.  </p>

<p>Lucky Larry, that filthy liar who claimed they &quot;pulled&quot; Building 7 on his command.  And that the attacks were functionally separate.   The NYT is finally speaking out on Lucky Larry&#39;s unbelievable story.  He played a large role in this.  An Israeli developer.</p>

<p>That is a lie, I clearly linked it to the specific timeframe that I was referring to and I will post it here again:</p>

<p>The link you posted leads to absolutely no place where it says that the video in this thread is from the french brothers.</p>

<p>You continue downvoting me and you keep lying about this video not being about WTC7. You should correct your false accusations and cease this nonsense at once. This is my last reply.</p>
