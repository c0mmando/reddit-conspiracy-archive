    <div class="md"><p>The top comment on the current stickied post about shills is by a mod for the fake truth site 911blogger.  So it&#39;s worse than you know.  Just like in the movies, the bad guy turns out to be the one leading the charge to find the bad guy.  </p>

<p>Edit:   <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a> has been a mod for years at 911blogger, which was exposed in the <a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">November 2010 issue of the Rock Creek Free Press as a disinfo site.  The link goes to a PDF of the hard copy of the paper; the article titled &quot;Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working for the Other Side?&quot; is on the front page, below the fold, in the middle</a>.</p>

<h2>Below is an excerpt from that article:</h2>

<p>A little more than a month after Zwicker’s endorsement of CIT was rejected, the situation repeated itself, when retired NASA aeronautical engineer Dwain Deets recorded a video endorsement of CIT on August 30, 2010 and submitted it to 911blogger. Once again, 911blogger refused, without explanation, to post the endorsement of a highly qualified professional.</p>

<p>Prior to 911blogger rejecting these video endorsements from Zwicker and Deets, nearly all users at 911blogger who were vocal in their support of CIT had been banned. An informal poll easily came up with 25 former users of 911blogger who had been banned without explanation—about half of whom are CIT supporters.</p>

<p>Three of the most well-informed, articulate and prolific CIT supporters were banned simultaneously on May 24, 2010, while in the midst of a heated online debate with 911blogger moderator Erik Larson (aka Loose Nuke). Truth activist Stefan S. of London, England explains it:</p>

<p>“The exact moment that Adam Syed, Adam Ruff and I were banned, we were in mid-debate with Erik Larson. Nothing remotely offensive or rule breaking was being said by any one of us, let alone all three of us at the exact same time.</p>

<p>“What was happening was that Larson had been backed into a corner over a blog entry of his, which was a listing of what he claimed were witnesses to the plane flying south of the Citgo station prior to it striking the Pentagon.</p>

<p>“Not a single one of those witnesses even mentioned Citgo, it was just a collection of laughably tenuous arguments for why ambiguous witness statements must be supportive of the official story. The list was submitted to an intensive analysis and it was shown conclusively that none of the witnesses supported the official flight path, that the list included several witnesses who stated that the plane flew to the north of Citgo, and most strikingly, several who explicitly stated that they were not even in the vicinity at the time of the attack.</p>

<p>“The discussion was drifting into increasingly embarrassing territory for Larson when — presto — all three of us were banned and Larson, in a completely childish fashion, proceeded to have the “last word” in full knowledge that he had just stopped the people he was addressing from being able to respond.</p>

<p>“Larson’s articles are disinformation; the information he puts out there is deliberately false with a motive to undermine genuine research. 911blogger is no longer a 9/11 truth site, that much is clear.” </p>

<p>He&#39;s not spreading a sense of hopelessness he&#39;s spreading a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>They are right, nothing will be done. Because people only discuss about things on reddit and then forget about it. </p>
