       Shills usually make attempts to post in random sub reddits to cover their tracks. Many of them repost old material in an attempt to gain a karmic reputation and look more legit, like this shill:

       Derail is an accurate word. Probably a significant portion of the crazier r/conspiracy posts and their comments are the the works of a network of sock puppets. The goal of course is to derail legitimate discussion.

       Or the sockpuppets are actually the opposite of government shills, shilling to upset people about spying.

       I would be in favor of this to a point... but then it's much like the crime fighter becoming a criminal in the name of fighting crime... slippery slope. In current context, still wouldn't have a problem with this morally, I think. lol

       Incredibly.  With how much they've spent on this, you would expect that they would at least give this their all.  Shit, I know I would personally if I were in their shoes after selling my soul and deciding that every other human can Fuck off.  This has just been sad and pathetic, telecasting their every move.

       The top comment on the current stickied post about shills is by a mod for the fake truth site 911blogger.  So it's worse than you know.  Just like in the movies, the bad guy turns out to be the one leading the charge to find the bad guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="/u/Orangutan">
        /u/Orangutan
       </a>
       has been a mod for years at 911blogger, which was exposed in the
       <a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">
        November 2010 issue of the Rock Creek Free Press as a disinfo site.  The link goes to a PDF of the hard copy of the paper; the article titled "Is Leading 9/11 Truth Site Working for the Other Side?" is on the front page, below the fold, in the middle
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <h2>
       Below is an excerpt from that article:
      </h2>
      <p>
       A little more than a month after Zwicker’s endorsement of CIT was rejected, the situation repeated itself, when retired NASA aeronautical engineer Dwain Deets recorded a video endorsement of CIT on August 30, 2010 and submitted it to 911blogger. Once again, 911blogger refused, without explanation, to post the endorsement of a highly qualified professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to 911blogger rejecting these video endorsements from Zwicker and Deets, nearly all users at 911blogger who were vocal in their support of CIT had been banned. An informal poll easily came up with 25 former users of 911blogger who had been banned without explanation—about half of whom are CIT supporters.

       Three of the most well-informed, articulate and prolific CIT supporters were banned simultaneously on May 24, 2010, while in the midst of a heated online debate with 911blogger moderator Erik Larson (aka Loose Nuke). Truth activist Stefan S. of London, England explains it:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The exact moment that Adam Syed, Adam Ruff and I were banned, we were in mid-debate with Erik Larson. Nothing remotely offensive or rule breaking was being said by any one of us, let alone all three of us at the exact same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What was happening was that Larson had been backed into a corner over a blog entry of his, which was a listing of what he claimed were witnesses to the plane flying south of the Citgo station prior to it striking the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Not a single one of those witnesses even mentioned Citgo, it was just a collection of laughably tenuous arguments for why ambiguous witness statements must be supportive of the official story. The list was submitted to an intensive analysis and it was shown conclusively that none of the witnesses supported the official flight path, that the list included several witnesses who stated that the plane flew to the north of Citgo, and most strikingly, several who explicitly stated that they were not even in the vicinity at the time of the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The discussion was drifting into increasingly embarrassing territory for Larson when — presto — all three of us were banned and Larson, in a completely childish fashion, proceeded to have the “last word” in full knowledge that he had just stopped the people he was addressing from being able to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Larson’s articles are disinformation; the information he puts out there is deliberately false with a motive to undermine genuine research. 911blogger is no longer a 9/11 truth site, that much is clear.”

       At first I wondered if it was just an overly cynical Redditor and we were being too harsh. After looking through the user's history, s/he is just literally repeating "nothing will be done by anyone" over and over. Copy and paste. Verbatim.

       That would mean I'm shilling as well. I'm nihilistic and sometimes fatalistic about all this. Nothing will get done because nobody wants to do anything. So we just roll over and get buttfucked some more. It is what it is.

       He's not a shill spreading hopelessness, he's spreading reality. As shit gets worse and worse, the most people are willing to do is bitch about it in reddit. Am I wrong? No, not in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disagree? Prove me wrong then. Get off your ass, step away from the computer, and do something. Because as history has clearly shown, nobody else will.

       I tend to avoid this sub not because I disagree with it, but because there's no point to it. We just sit around watching as injustice after injustice transpires. But do we do anything about it? Hell no. No, that would take effort, better to whine about it on the internet.

       Uh...I have a trunk full of bull horns and protest signs. Our last anti-Monsanto rally here in Dallas had THOUSANDS of people of all ages attending. People are waking up and we ARE doing something. Join us if you honestly care about humanity and quit watching television, because you're never gonna get any real hope from that poisonous box.

       Do you really think finding one shill of hopelessness will make a difference?  What about two?  Ten?  One-hundred?  I wish it mattered, but there are tens of thousands of these.  It's almost as ineffective as voting for a third party.

       iirc it was the story about the Jordanian judge shot at an Israeli checkpoint, it wasnt taken as apathy but more of a wake up call as he intended for it to be. He might be a little crazy just for being able to spam that much but I dont think he's a shill.
