It pains me to say that the place I&#39;ve known so well and for so long has died. Between the ever-present paid-off mods to the posts about nothing that get upvoted into outer-space. The bullshit back and forth between subs. I&#39;m done with it. Sent a letter to the mods:<a href="http://imgur.com/fyawUfp">http://imgur.com/fyawUfp</a> I hope you do the same. I don&#39;t care if you do it or not, but this place has turned worse than Facebook. At least Facebook tells you you&#39;re looking at an ad, and not just a car company masquerading as real people... &lt;&lt;&lt; Fuck this shit, y&#39;all have fun thinking that this is a free flow of ideas, I&#39;m out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it just has. Most of the posts are about politics and politic related topics. </p>

<p>I would like to see more posts on every topic. Occult, hidden knowledge stuf like frequencies and hidden archeology and history. Alternative views of accounted for situations. People&#39;s own ideas on what ever topic they think about. Our place in the universe. While I realize this isn&#39;t strictly conspiracy as it&#39;s not 2 or more people  planning on something in private. But it is still on that conspiracy theme as someone wants that information hidden. Stuff like nasa acounts and other whistle blowers. Pictures of subliminal messeges and things people notice that is subliminal or apart of a hidden plot or agenda </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are the sort of topics that most interested me when I first began studying conspiracies. One thing I actually like about r/conspiracy is the political content. It&#39;s real. Maybe not every accusation is accurate, but politics is real and effects the lives of everybody on this planet. As for the occult and arcane, it&#39;s intriguing and possibly has its place, but it isn&#39;t practical, it isn&#39;t active, and it isn&#39;t applicable with only bits and pieces of the knowledge. So I personally feel the political content has to do with our desperation as a community, while we watch our world and our favorite subreddit go to hell in a handbasket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s been an increase in political conspiracy related information, because there&#39;s been a big batch of confirmation about some of them. It will die down sooner or later, unless we go to war (which is very unlikely IMHO).</p>

<p>There is not much left to happen in the world of politics and geopolitics without there being a revolution or a war or something. More likely is that everyone will just forget about it and go on with their lives.</p>
