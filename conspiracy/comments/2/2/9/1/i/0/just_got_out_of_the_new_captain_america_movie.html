       Seemed like it was very anti-police state. I was surprised that such a "big" movie talked so badly about the police state and even made a few points about not giving up freedom and liberty for security.

       In the Marvel comics world, there was an a series of issues called "Civil War" in which Captain America and a slew of other heroes fight against the government and a law passed that requires all superhuman's to register under their real names with the federal government, all because of a rogue group of heroes who killed a large amount of people in a small town.  This isn't necessarily the story used in the new movie, but "Civil War" kind of set the tone for how Captain America is viewed and written nowadays.  Not so much as a do-goody American warrior, but a person who stands up for what is right no matter the situation.

       Haven't seen it, but not that surprised in that it sounds like they are holding true to the comic books. Marvel comics rarely presented the government in a positive light.

       All the marvel movies and the avengers TV show are a product of a small private studio owned by marvel.

       Yeah, if you sub the words Hydra (Nazi group that is secretly gaining control of the world) with NWO , it kinda seems very relatable. If your paying attention, they kind of elude to false flag attacks at one point.

       Cap once even quit the name and official sanction in response to political corruption. Captain America is a strict Constitutionalist.

       Thanks for those here first with comments, I have had an incorrect idea about relating too much movie/life mixing into yet a third very personal experience, then realize it fits, the world is now delivered to us in an exquisitely managed method/system, there is no need for a pretense of reality or facts.

       Read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Pay particular attention to the parts about using the masses to overthrow their own governments.  Also think about this in the context of movies like V for Vendetta and Fight Club.  Now, I have no idea if the protocols are real or not, but one really has to ask themselves why there were movies coming out of Hollywood which seemed to fit in perfectly with what the Protocols are describing.  It should also be pointed out that the executive producer, Arnon Milchan, has recently admitted to being in intelligence operative.

       Um, if you think that everything represented as historically proven fact on wikipedia is actually fact then you have no business posting on r/conspiracy.  The forgery claim is more asserted than proven.

       Absolute garbage, not worth my time.  Shifty remakes of then and now shifty movies
  Prequils and sequels in excess.  Horrible writing.  Horrible character development.  Uninteresting story lines.  They are apparently not spending their money on talent.  Cocaine and homosexual prostitutes/slaves, it would seem.

       Maybe you only watch the expendables and fast and furious movies if you actually look for say 5 no 3 seconds you can find dozens of movies that are well written with great characters and interesting stories.

       Because they are a business. Just because something isn't a new franchise doesn't mean it doesn't have value. Is the godfather 2 worthless because it is a sequel? Or the star wars film or a whole host of films that are great despite being sequels.

       As capitalists, why then are per theater ticket sales through the floor?  Why is turnout lower than it has been in a very long time?  Why are more and more families simply waiting until the movies make it to DVD 3 months later after a box office flop.  Paying .99 vs. $100 for a family night at the theater.  To watch pure garbage, wasting 3 hours in the process..  I'm quite clearly not the only one who has this negative view of Hollywood.  I had hoped you were going to name movie names that went against the grain and were actually decent.   Or is that too much to ask?

       This certainly isn't about the quality of Hollywood productions.  Some people enjoy movies. We're not all professional film critics like yourself. The point is the intended rhetoric. It is surprising that a Zionist based industry would portray such an anti-totalitarian message. It IS only one movie, but the comment about utilizing expensive police state toys is interesting...

       For fantasy, sure.  I know I won't be watching it though.  Perhaps if it's on TV, but even then it's still unlikely.  I've watched the quality of movies degarade over my lifetime, and I'm not going to watch shitty movies because they are the only game in town.  I will vote exclusively with my wallet, which is heavily hurting Hollywood as of late.  By not rewarding shitty movie making with any of my hard earned money.  I'll pass every single time.  Far preferring to spend my free time on much nore productive and creative outlets (all while wasting some of that time here).
