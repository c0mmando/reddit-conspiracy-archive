<p>Rule 10: </p>

<p>This rule has been (wrongly) defended for far too long under very false pretenses, and it is highly detrimental to our collective desire to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The rule was written by 9000sins at a time when <strong>he</strong> was under attack, and was written to defend <strong>him</strong>, and him alone. All of the tweaks and modifications and edits will never change the fact that it was an ironfisted, totalitarian rule, implemented by someone who was intoxicated by their own power.</p>

<p>And, ever since then, we&#39;ve seen repeats of that kind of use. (I do admit that lately, after public outcry, it has been applied in defense of users, rather than solely in defense of the mods.)</p>

<p>There&#39;s only one rule that should ever pertain to the moderators of this site and it is a long standing unwritten rule: If you can&#39;t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Seriously. Can you imagine if reddit banned people for criticizing reddit or its admins? Ad Hominem attacks are against the reddiquette, but not against the <em>rules</em>. (See the links at the bottom.)</p>

<p>Rule 10, as written, is wrong for this subreddit. It&#39;s a huge brand across the forehead of our community which says &quot;stupid and hypocritical&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a privilege not a right.  Reddit could ban criticism anytime they want and you couldn&#39;t do anything about it.  The mods could make a rule banning all criticism of mods and ban people on the first offense.  You could do nothing about it.  Don&#39;t get it twisted, you have no rights here.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an implied phrase (stated in the final   sentence of my post): &quot;without being hypocritical&quot;.</p>

<p>I reference my previous point. It&#39;s a wrong rule for this community for the reasons stated in my post; the fact that you, personally, will attempt to see to it that it is only applied in reasonable and fair ways, not withstanding. The concept of the rule is wrong. It&#39;s underlying principle is wrong for a subreddit which screams of its right to hound those they disagree with in various media.</p>

<p>If your goal (which is implied in <em>your</em> defense of this rule) is that of &quot;enforced minimal civility&quot; of some kind, then that needs to be the discussed among the community. A grass roots effort to bury incivility would be more meaningful.</p>

<p>I think this demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of what Rule 10, and the grey area that comes with it, is designed to do.</p>

<p>The rule is not designed to prevent discussion, it&#39;s designed and applied to prevent vacuous attacks from degrading discussion. This has been discussed by the community time and time again, and consensus has always been that allowing mods an enforcement mechanism against vapid attacks is within the spirit of free flowing information. </p>

<p>It worries me that, with how long you&#39;ve been around, you  are seemingly suggesting  that posters who come here only to attack and degrade discussion should be given free reign to vacuously attack at will.</p>

<p>This is where you and I are at a loggerhead.</p>

<p>The rule, as it was originally implemented, was intended to justify the bannings (a LOT of them) that 9000sins was doing to people who disagreed with, or were attacking, him ... him, personally.</p>

<p>The history of its application (until only recently - the last 2-3 months) remained within that purpose (argue with a mod and you might get banned).</p>

<p>All of the revisions to this rule have been to try to make it &quot;not be bad&quot; (you now call it a grey area). So we now have a black rule that is trying to be whitewashed and is turning out grey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I did not make this assertion. In fact, I made the exact <em>opposite</em> in the closing statement of my previous comment.</p>

<p>Yes, it really was a black rule, and yes, the best you will ever get by whitewashing it is &quot;grey&quot;. It will never be &quot;right&quot;, &quot;righteous&quot;, or &quot;good&quot; . Never. Not ever. It is wrong for this sub. Everyone knows this is truth, but the mods keep clinging to it like it some how helps those who don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>This rule does not help this subreddit&#39;s community. It only hurts its reputation. It will always be this way because it was bad to begin with and no amount of &quot;but wait, what we really meant was&quot; or &quot;no, that didn&#39;t sound good, let&#39;s try it this way&quot; will ever change the fact that it&#39;s a WRONG RULE FOR THIS SUBREDDIT.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m going to be very blunt about this, because you&#39;ve now crossed the border into appeal to authority as your defense.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t be here forever. If this rule is not removed, it <em>will</em> be here forever. Please get over this &quot;but <em>I</em> won&#39;t be and evil mod&quot; - extremely annoying and absolutely irrelevant - defense of this evil rule.</p>

<p>It&#39;s wrong. You keep agreeing with me that it&#39;s wrong, and then saying &quot;but I promise we won&#39;t use it wrongly&quot;. So what? It&#39;s a wrong rule. Everyone agrees on that. Even you. The rule, itself, is WRONG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what is funny about this sub is that you still use reddit. Yeah you claim it is over run with &quot;shills&quot; and vote brigades. Yet you still use it. After all your bitching and whining about censorship you still post on here. </p>

<p>I dont get it why. Do you honestly think you can seriously make a difference on something as large as reddit. The front page of reddit is tonight or tommrow mornings news. </p>

<p>Reddit has influence. A lot of influence.  Down play it as much as you wish but simple fact is reddit is a major media hub for many people. </p>

<p>Now as for admin bushing users yeah they do that. Some are worse then others. There are also some great admins that explain the decision they make. Personally I dont see why reddit even has a customer relations position when they wont even talk to us after a shadow ban. </p>

<p>Now admin being controlling in posts and whatever else is nuts. They dont have the time look how large reddit is. How can less then 30 people deal with manipulation in a system that large. Yeah yeah computers and programing. No cant be otherwise why even let it post and recive votes.</p>

<p>No people need to focus on mods they are the ones doing this. And are where the shit happens. </p>

<p>Point is if you want to complain reddit is a controlled environment then go use something else. Also explain what a shill is. Cause I have seen the term used for everything to describe someone another person didnt like to calling a mod and then another user from some sub.</p>

<p>The reason we&#39;re here and the reason we complain ... you answered two paragraphs later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit has influence. A lot of influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this following part may clear up some of your inability to comprehend or appreciate what is being discussed in many instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also explain what a shill is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A shill is someone who (often, in exchange for money; but usually for some ulterior motive in general) promotes a special interest. And, like the definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot; for this subreddit (see the sidebar), the community of reddit (not just <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) is opposed to shilling for unlawful or [potentially] harmful activities. They are, quite frequently, evidenced by their focus of activity (e.g., pro-nuclear, pro-petroleum, pro-war, whatever). And, like I responded to this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22a6jf/i_believe_there_is_a_consortium_of_benevolent/cgktpdd?context=3">other post</a>, it&#39;s only the &quot;bad guys&quot; the community focuses on with accusations of &quot;shilling&quot;. They usually don&#39;t object to someone who frequently &quot;shills&quot; for animal rights (in those instances they&#39;re acclaimed activists).</p>

<p>My post, the original post above, is about principle and hypocrisy. A significantly more substantial issue than &quot;STFU and go away&quot; can come close to addressing.</p>

<p>EDIT: Added link.</p>

<p>I wanted people the realize that reddit does have influance but not this sub. This sub does nothing lately. Have yet to see it make anything to front page. Least since I have got a new account. </p>

<p>If you want the reason I made a new account I fucked up and poked a certian admin. I have to agree I got what I deserved. I was offered to unban that name but i declined cause I realize I screwed up and accept the consequences. </p>

<p>I used to contribute here often. Now I just lurk here and comment once in a while but I look thru the main page at least once a day. Only reason I have said anything now is that everyone even mods are bitching about the &quot;problem&quot; of vote manipulation. </p>

<p>I will say what I mean here ........ do something or stop bitching. </p>

<p>Thanks for explaining what a shill is. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t need an excuse, to be honest. They&#39;re the mods. I think people on all sides of this issue are way too emotionally involved in &quot;online life&quot; - yes, all sides of this reek of basement-dwelling-neckbeardism. <strong>all sides</strong></p>

<p>The fact that anyone ever gets into a situation that has escalated to the level of flame warring (that&#39;s basically what it boils down to) is evidence enough for me that they probably participated in creating the problem. There are a few random exceptions (e.g., when a peace-maker is foolish enough to rush in where angels fear to tread and becomes the victim of unwarranted attacks by those already slinging fire-balls at each other).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just &quot;the moderators&quot;. It&#39;s also the users who want to pick fights with mods. I&#39;m not here to pick a fight with anyone and I&#39;m doing my sincere best to avoid any such implications.</p>

<p>reddit is PWNed by Conde Nast. They put a lock-hold on the board of directors when they established reddit, inc. as a pseudo-independent entity. reddit is a subsidiary of Conde Nast. Yes, it is &quot;technically&quot; an independent legal entity, but the controls -- the supporting capital and the board of directors -- are still well within the realm of Conde Nast as an over-arching company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For you, my annoying adversary in an attempted derailment exercise (I&#39;d call you a troll, but that&#39;s against rule 10, which you&#39;re clueless about), the founding board consisted of:</p>

<p>Alexis (kn0thing) Ohanian [...] will serve on that board, along with Bob Sauerberg (President) and Joe Simon (Chief Technology Officer) from Condé Nast, and Andrew Siegel (Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development) from Advance. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/independence.html">reddit&#39;s official blog</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>One redditor, </p></li>
<li><p>Two Conde Naste employees (one being president of Conde Nast), and </p></li>
<li><p>One person from Advance Publications (the parent of Conde Nast).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s the original board, stacked <em>against</em> the favor of an independent reddit. Any new members added to this board have been approved by the 1(reddit):3(PWNers) ratio of voting. All new admins and employees have been screened by these people, or by people they approved to do so, etc. etc.</p>

<p>tl;dr: reddit is PWNed.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, no I cannot recite names. And, at this moment in time, under the topic posted above (reddit&#39;s rule 10), I refuse to allow you to derail me with this goose-chase. I&#39;ll come back to this discussion later, when it isn&#39;t counter-productive to the point I&#39;m emphasizing in my post, above.</p>

<p>This subreddit has a Rule 10. Read the sidebar. Your ignorance of this community is now patently evident. And, because of that, I retract my offer to revisit this derailment discussion. Go away now, m&#39;kay?</p>

<p>The concept of the rule is wrong. It&#39;s underlying principle is wrong for a subreddit which screams of its right to hound those they disagree with in various media.</p>

<p>I think this demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of what Rule 10, and the grey area that comes with it, is designed to do.</p>

<p>The rule is not designed to prevent discussion, it&#39;s designed and applied to prevent vacuous attacks from degrading discussion. This has been discussed by the community time and time again, and consensus has always been that allowing mods an enforcement mechanism against vapid attacks is within the spirit of free flowing information. </p>

<p>It worries me that, with how long you&#39;ve been around, you  are seemingly suggesting  that posters who come here only to attack and degrade discussion should be given free reign to vacuously attack at will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Would you have understood the logic of the English grammar structure better if I had said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can&#39;t prohibit editorial commentary critical of ourselves while asserting our right to criticize reddit, on reddit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s also an implied phrase (stated in the final   sentence of my post): &quot;without being hypocritical&quot;.</p>

<p>These are grammatical constructs.</p>

<p>Dismantling my sentence (taking one portion of a larger grammatical construction) and saying &quot;that&#39;s false&quot; is the act of an ignoramus.</p>

<p>Is English your native language? If it&#39;s not, it may explain why you don&#39;t understand the way it is used.</p>
