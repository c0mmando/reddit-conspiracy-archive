       I realize this probably isn't the typical conspiracy, but hear me out;
      </p>
      <p>
       I am poor folk.  Likely not the sort of person who can afford a car, and really, I can't.  I don't drive my car but only to take my son to doctor's appointments and occasionally to take my SO to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in what is called a "high risk state" which apparently is a justification to charge me $300+/mo for car insurance.  For a car accident I may or
       <em>
        may not
       </em>
       ever have.  I am expected to pay more insurance than I pay for rent.  How is this not a scam?  Sure we're told, "well you may be an excellent driver, but it's the other cars on the road you have to worry about".  I live in a very small town.  I hardly drive my car.  I don't think other drivers are an issue.  I'm almost 30 and have never been in an accident and have survived living in CA (I live in the east now).  Car insurance is a scam, but at the risk of not having a car at all, what choice do I have?

       Car insurance, smart phones, internet, electricity, health insurance, rent, gas, the number of expenses it takes to "live" has grown out of control. I'm sure it's cheaper and more beneficial to live a pre-industrial life. Progress sucks.

       Well I think especially in terms of what we "need" vs. what society thinks we "need".  I mean, I don't own a cell (as I've mentioned) and I don't pay for internet, my neighbors are kind enough to let me piggy back.  I don't know if I agree that progress sucks, but the idea that I have to pay for other's bad driving seems... unreasonable.

       Used to raise grain in Kansas in 1870 eeking out survival from one day to next and products ordered from outside of community were at the purchaser's risk. Definitely preferred that to having organized system of agriculture with oversight on quality control and traceability.

       I used to pay $1700/year until I called them up complaining about the rate and pointing out my perfect driving record. They dropped the rate to $500/year right after a credit check and put me in some 'preferred'  plan. If you've had 3 years continuous coverage and decent credit, no accidents or tickets, you are due some heavy discounts that the insurance co doesn't want you to know about.

       If you live in a small town, you're probably subsidizing drivers who live in very high-risk areas.  If they made people in high-crime areas pay for the real cost of their insurance, nobody could afford it.

       It sucks, but it's sort of a systemic problem.  Same thing happened with health insurance in 2009-2010.  Voters / humans wanted change, but elected officials refuse to cut off the corporate money vacuum.

       In Russia we aren't required to have car insurance. If your car is stolen, or demolished all costs to fix or replace would fall on you. Nobody seems to want an insurance company involved.

       Not sure what the penalty is in your state, but in GA, the fine for driving without insurance is at least $300, but no more than $1,000. With that considered, perhaps you could play the odds given your driving record,  save the $300/mo in an interest earning (albeit not much) savings account, and maintain liquidity for emergencies, while building a fund to cover damages/repair should you be in an accident. Chances are, the insurance company will fight like hell to not pay out if needed anyways, so after a while of not touching that money, you could afford to either pay damages, or hire an attourney to escape liability just as the insurance company would. Probably not the safest of ideas, but at least no one is profiting from your money, and you stand a decent chance of not being financially ruined barring you killing someone while driving. None of this eliminates that possibilty though, so there's that.

       Esurance or one of the other discount carriers won't offer you a better rate?  $300 is quite steep.  Even in a high risk area, I'm now at a little less than a bill per month for two vehicles.

       I tried to go through Esurance first, they're affiliated with Allstate who quoted me $297/mo, Esurance was about $5 cheaper.  The insurance company I ended up choosing was some local place.  I was going to get on with statefarm but they wouldn't even quote me because my SO (who I live with) has a suspended license for not paying a speeding ticket in another state.
       <br/>
       The whole idea of paying for something preemptively is just ridiculous, especially since I'm being grossly overpriced in the first place.  We're struggling to keep our heads above water and I think this month will have to cut insurance.  The cops in my town are also a little ... shady so I expect that my car will be impounded within the next 3 months.

       Maybe they are considering you high risk due to your SO. I know my parents were paying more when I was living with them specifically because the insurance company assumed I may drive one of their cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       That changed when my parents went to the insurance company in person and signed some document stating that under no circumstance would I be driving their cars.

       This was probably 16 years ago so things may have changed.

       So I tried telling Statefarm that right, and they still refused me, I told them we weren't married and he never drives my car.. .still no good.  I mean, I know my SO is the reason they wouldn't quote me, but with the local place I ended up going to, I didn't even mention that he lived with me, I said I was a single mother.

       Are you just doing the basic minimum for insurance?
      </p>
      <p>
       I pay like $448 for 6 months of insurance. But I can agree its a scam, as even if I do hit something, the insurance I have only really covers the car (or whatever gets hit) in getting repaired. My car repairs would come out of my pocket (luckily I am capable of doing most myself).

       Bare basic as-cheap-as-I can-get insurance.  I honestly can't make sense of it.  My car is older but I keep it maintained to the best of my financial ability.

       Are you on liability only? Also what type of car? I have an IS300 and even in incredibly low risk places my car is absurdly expensive to insure. I wouldnt exactly deem it a sports car (but I guess its a sports sedan) but insurance companies treat it like I'm out playing Fast N' Furious every day....

       I think I'm only on liability.  I mean I got the cheapest I could get to make my car legal.  I drive a Saturn L200 2002.  It's older but I keep it maintained.  I mean my car is a 4 door, 4 cylinder car that can barely do 30 up hill.  It kills me that I have to break the law but I really have to drop my insurance... the shit part is that I know I'm not going to get into a car accident, what's going to happen is my plates will be run eventually and THAT'S the reason I'll be without a car.

       You have shown your a good driver and I'm not doubting that. But I do see a need for insurance, my car is the most expensive thing I own (mazda 3 nothing fancy) but if somebody were to rear end me and total it, most people don't have 12k on hand to replace my car, If I lost my car I'd lose my ability to go to school and provide my family a better life. Insurance is required,  don't get me wrong most insurance companies are crooks but unless everybody was much more financially secure with 100k on hand for wrecks(for more expensive cars) there's not a better option.

       Well, you bet wrong buddy.  I mean, I guess it's a logical assumption, but I've never had a traffic violation in my life, I've never wrecked a vehicle, and I took driver's education when I was 18.  I even waited until I was 18 before getting my license despite being able to get it at 16 (where I grew up).  I'm 27 now, so I've been driving for quite some time.  I'm just frustrated and I feel like I'm being robbed.

       How though? I mean how could something be on my record and where do I go to check?  I really thought the price I'm paying was a gross exaggeration of what I
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be paying.  As I mentioned in previous comments, I did ASK why it was high but got a bullshit answer.

       Can you elaborate on "high risk state"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurance stops being a "scam" the minute you rear end someone with twin babies in their car.

       I asked the same question.  I didn't receive a clear answer beyond "well, Kentucky is just one of those states" me - what makes it "one of those states?" Rep. "car accidents".
Well I've never been in a car accident and I don't own a cell phone.  I don't smoke.  I took drivers ED, I am in no way a "high risk".

       It seems weird that KY is higher risk than CA!  I'm in CA (granted the more rural northern half) and the only time I paid even close to that was when I owned a sports car (and even then I didn't pay that much).  Insurance can be handy when you need it, as someone who has totaled 3 vehicles over the course of their driving career, I can say it has been quite handy.  But many of these companies are just raking their customers over a bed of coals in recent years!  I feel for you!
