        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I realize this probably isn&#39;t the typical conspiracy, but hear me out;</p>

<p>I am poor folk.  Likely not the sort of person who can afford a car, and really, I can&#39;t.  I don&#39;t drive my car but only to take my son to doctor&#39;s appointments and occasionally to take my SO to work.</p>

<p>I live in what is called a &quot;high risk state&quot; which apparently is a justification to charge me $300+/mo for car insurance.  For a car accident I may or <em>may not</em> ever have.  I am expected to pay more insurance than I pay for rent.  How is this not a scam?  Sure we&#39;re told, &quot;well you may be an excellent driver, but it&#39;s the other cars on the road you have to worry about&quot;.  I live in a very small town.  I hardly drive my car.  I don&#39;t think other drivers are an issue.  I&#39;m almost 30 and have never been in an accident and have survived living in CA (I live in the east now).  Car insurance is a scam, but at the risk of not having a car at all, what choice do I have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what the penalty is in your state, but in GA, the fine for driving without insurance is at least $300, but no more than $1,000. With that considered, perhaps you could play the odds given your driving record,  save the $300/mo in an interest earning (albeit not much) savings account, and maintain liquidity for emergencies, while building a fund to cover damages/repair should you be in an accident. Chances are, the insurance company will fight like hell to not pay out if needed anyways, so after a while of not touching that money, you could afford to either pay damages, or hire an attourney to escape liability just as the insurance company would. Probably not the safest of ideas, but at least no one is profiting from your money, and you stand a decent chance of not being financially ruined barring you killing someone while driving. None of this eliminates that possibilty though, so there&#39;s that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to go through Esurance first, they&#39;re affiliated with Allstate who quoted me $297/mo, Esurance was about $5 cheaper.  The insurance company I ended up choosing was some local place.  I was going to get on with statefarm but they wouldn&#39;t even quote me because my SO (who I live with) has a suspended license for not paying a speeding ticket in another state.<br/>
The whole idea of paying for something preemptively is just ridiculous, especially since I&#39;m being grossly overpriced in the first place.  We&#39;re struggling to keep our heads above water and I think this month will have to cut insurance.  The cops in my town are also a little ... shady so I expect that my car will be impounded within the next 3 months.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they are considering you high risk due to your SO. I know my parents were paying more when I was living with them specifically because the insurance company assumed I may drive one of their cars.</p>

<p>That changed when my parents went to the insurance company in person and signed some document stating that under no circumstance would I be driving their cars.</p>

<p>This was probably 16 years ago so things may have changed.</p>

<p>I pay like $448 for 6 months of insurance. But I can agree its a scam, as even if I do hit something, the insurance I have only really covers the car (or whatever gets hit) in getting repaired. My car repairs would come out of my pocket (luckily I am capable of doing most myself). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have shown your a good driver and I&#39;m not doubting that. But I do see a need for insurance, my car is the most expensive thing I own (mazda 3 nothing fancy) but if somebody were to rear end me and total it, most people don&#39;t have 12k on hand to replace my car, If I lost my car I&#39;d lose my ability to go to school and provide my family a better life. Insurance is required,  don&#39;t get me wrong most insurance companies are crooks but unless everybody was much more financially secure with 100k on hand for wrecks(for more expensive cars) there&#39;s not a better option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems weird that KY is higher risk than CA!  I&#39;m in CA (granted the more rural northern half) and the only time I paid even close to that was when I owned a sports car (and even then I didn&#39;t pay that much).  Insurance can be handy when you need it, as someone who has totaled 3 vehicles over the course of their driving career, I can say it has been quite handy.  But many of these companies are just raking their customers over a bed of coals in recent years!  I feel for you!</p>
