<p>It&#39;s beyond common sense and a fact that most sophisticated crimes are in fact conspiracies.</p>

<p>They start with the premise that we are all about Aliens, and Elvis sightings, or other things which fall into the purview of not only unlikely, but pretty much impossible... From there its easy to label all of us who are actively engaging our brains instead of lapping up the official government/media narratives as idiots or delusional.</p>

<p>Being called a conspiracy theorist is like saying &quot;Stop! There shall be no more inquiry in that direction.&quot; We are not inane or mentally deficient...in fact we are emblematic of true intellectual freedom.</p>

<p>And as it relates to your paranoia, I have no doubt they attempt to exacerbate any justifiable paranoia you may have.</p>

<p>They are either small-minded men, or people who have a vested interest in concealing the truth. To that end, they will attempt to  keep the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; a pejorative one..</p>

<p>My issue with it is confirmation bias. People who surround themselves with &quot;getting to the bottom of things&quot; don&#39;t stop at the bottom. They draw connections on thin ice in order to fit a story that they want to see. It&#39;s not always the case, but one look at the comments section in this subreddit tells volumes. I don&#39;t have anything against the truth. What I have a problem with is people creating a new truth based on little to no evidence and screaming and shouting about how their truth is the real truth.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are things that don&#39;t ever get answered completely. Sometimes there are errors in an otherwise factual account. Sometimes it&#39;s innocent. Sometimes there really is a conspiracy afoot. But trying to attribute every single public shooting, explosion, missing plane, and dead child to the work of a government not only obscures the truth but also makes people less likely to fairly consider your stance. You have to remember that you&#39;re dealing with human beings, and that you&#39;re one as well. You are not infallible, I am not infallible, no one is infallible. Strive every day to be as objective as possible and maybe not everything will seem so evil.</p>

<p>Just my two cents -- from someone who subs to both conspiracy and conspiratard.</p>

<p>PS: I don&#39;t think of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as a pejorative term... it&#39;s just what I&#39;ve grown up hearing and what everyone says. It&#39;s kind of like calling someone who lives on an island an &quot;islander&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct about confirmation bias, with little to no evidence. It does go on here no doubt, quite a lot. Plenty of stuff here has little to no substance in reality (in my view). It&#39;s generally about fitting or joining facts to confirm your world view.</p>

<p>But that goes on A HECK of a lot more in conspiratard. Mainly because they start off from the position that all conspiracies are a nonsense, and anyone interested in them is a tard.</p>

<p>Hardly a non objective position to start from, and pretty much a guaranty that confirmation bias is just down the road...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree as to confirmation bias. It is a problem for anyone who is seeking to uncover the truth behind a mystery. I think the brain naturally (and often subconsciously) favors, to some degree, one answer over another (perhaps to trigger reward, and keep motivation high). Historians, sociologists, etc. no doubt must need to stay vigilant to  prevent this too, but I think peer review in these areas is what helps the most to keep confirmation bias low.</p>

<p>Which is the obvious merit in this sub: we discuss and disagree and challenge others on specific points or theories...all this I believe <em>helps</em> lower confirmation bias. </p>

<p>But my disappointment of those on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is that they choose to deride us instead of debate us. If they debated us, it would sharpen the discussion and likely <em>eliminate</em> confirmation bias.  By simply ridiculing us within their own  echo chamber sub, they are of no value to the <em>truth</em>. </p>

<p>Well...except for the truth that their ridicule of us is mostly a salve for the discomfort of their own cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>Care to point to one thread on here where lizard people have been taken seriously? </p>

<p>Also, even David Icke does not believe in &quot;lizard people&quot;, it was a ruse he used to speak about Jewish people without being called out on it. When enough people didn&#39;t catch on he made a &quot;documentary&quot; with a friend where the friend &quot;exposes&quot; him. This way he could freely say things that he otherwise might get into real trouble for in Europe. It&#39;s all weird no matter how you look at it, but I have never seen wide support for any interpretation of the &quot;lizard people&quot; here. </p>

<p>Yes, &quot;Lizard People&quot;.</p>

<p>Shifty, sneaky little bastards that &quot;shed their skins&quot; and pretend to be something that the aren&#39;t in order to support their nefarious agenda.</p>

<p>As an example, I present the Zionist Conspiratard <strong>HERO</strong> <a href="/u/Bipolarbear0">/u/Bipolarbear0</a>, who openly admitted to &quot;shape-shifting - contaminating this sub with his vile stench and filth with the express purpose of defaming the sub and its users.</p>

<p>&quot;Lizard People&quot;. If that&#39;s what you call the firebrands and agent provocateurs that launch raids against this sub - PRETENDING to be what they are not, then I must say that I am a BELIEVER in &quot;Lizard People&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, why don&#39;t you squirm back into your skin, and slither back into <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> - where you can feel MUCH more comfortable among your &quot;own kind&quot;.</p>

<p>Your comment is the type of assumption and irrational  defensive mechanism that make people unwilling to listen to&quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; You&#39;re so revved up to defend yourself against anyone you deem the enemy, you&#39;re unwilling to listen to their alternate point of view.

<p>I know what he was talking about - and it certainly appeared that he was trying to launch the classic r/conspiratard tactic of implying that anyone who entertains ANY &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; believes ALL such theories: If anyone questions the events of 9-11 or the assassination of JFK, they ALSO believe that Elvis was was abducted by aliens and is performing in a casino on the planet Las Venus.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a psychological smear tactic designed to preemptively discredit anyone who questions the &quot;official version&quot; of anything. Now maybe I misread HIS motives, but the tactic is constantly employed by the TardyBoys, and IMO, he deserved to be verbally bitch-slapped with sarcasm. </p>

<p>And yes, the TardyBoy <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">/u/BipolarBear0</a>, moderator of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <em>openly admitted</em> to invading this sub under a pseudonym and to posting racist trash to defame and to undermine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What &quot;point of view&quot;? That the members of this sub are some sort of &quot;religion&quot; that all think with a hive-mind and subscribe to a set of doctrine, dogma and &quot;articles of faith&quot;?</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the implication, <a href="/u/snstrmstch">/u/snstrmstch</a>? What was he trying to say? What are YOU trying to say? That anyone who posts in this sub necessarily BELIEVES in all topics proffered in this sub?</p>

<p>So what do you suggest? That such posts should be banned? That only <strong>approved conspiracy theories</strong> should be allowed here?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you make a list of which topics should be allowed and disallowed, okay?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I just thought I&#39;d share an example of some of the more...colorful...messages we regularly get in the modmail.</p>

<p>The way I see it, people who spend their free time trying to mock or ridicule others don&#39;t sound like happy or content people to me. There isn&#39;t much I can do for them though, other than let them keep punishing themselves until they decide they don&#39;t enjoy it any more. The best I could say to them is, you don&#39;t have to be afraid.</p>

Doing away with rule 10 im afraid will open the floodgates to more people that just want to discredit legitimate conversation. but i dont know really. :)</p>

At least this sub provides a venue for open discussion of issues that get practically banned in more &quot;mainstream&quot; subs, no one is saying you have to agree with every post.  I actually think it&#39;s relatively free from organized co-option myself, perhaps because the rampant paranoia has kept users on the lookout.

<p>It&#39;s not an uncommon occurrence, especially if you follow new a lot. Most of it gets downvoted, some of it gets to the front page anyway. Especially during other more important runs of issues worth discussing. When a major event happens that people come to conspiracy to get &quot;alternative&quot; views about, plenty of shitbrained posts show up in new that start out with a good grip of upvotes.</p>

<p>No, only some people with downvote you and call you a shill. The thing to remember is the best tactic to disrupt any group is not to directly oppose them, it is to pretend to be one of them and then either act crazy or just sow dissent. We know the government uses this tactic from the congressional files of the investigation of COINTELPRO. Of course others are free to use this tactic as well.</p>

<p>Then of course you have to normal variation of opinions and personalities you get with any large group. Unfortunately we also get more than our fair share of paranoid personalities as the subject matter draws them. With enough experience though you learn to ignore the extremes and winnow out whatever useful information you were interested in finding. It would be really nice to be able to have decent conversations on the subject matter though without all of the interference.</p>

<p>This nails it. It is exactly how things are co-opted. I am not saying that this is what its taking place on this sub...(i don&#39;t know what gets upvoted or downvoted here enough to conclude this). </p>

<p>But these methods are used. And it is the fact that these slightly more sophisticated tactics sound more unlikely (or just like more &quot;conspiracies&quot;!) that lends to their success. </p>

<p>And when you try and claim these tactics as having been used by others and as the reason for, say,  your exculpation, or why you should be believed (or whatever), you are playing into their hands since the average person doesn&#39;t realize the level of effort (both now and historically) that goes into discrediting people. It&#39;s how you start wars, how you prevent uprisings, how you start coups....</p>

<p>Also, even David Icke does not believe in &quot;lizard people&quot;, it was a ruse he used to speak about Jewish people without being called out on it. When enough people didn&#39;t catch on he made a &quot;documentary&quot; with a friend where the friend &quot;exposes&quot; him. This way he could freely say things that he otherwise might get into real trouble for in Europe. It&#39;s all weird no matter how you look at it, but I have never seen wide support for any interpretation of the &quot;lizard people&quot; here. </p>

<p>This nails it. It is exactly how things are co-opted. I am not saying that this is what its taking place on this sub...(i don&#39;t know what gets upvoted or downvoted here enough to conclude this). </p>

<p>But these methods are used. And it is the fact that these slightly more sophisticated tactics sound more unlikely (or just like more &quot;conspiracies&quot;!) that lends to their success. </p>

<p>And when you try and claim these tactics as having been used by others and as the reason for, say,  your exculpation, or why you should be believed (or whatever), you are playing into their hands since the average person doesn&#39;t realize the level of effort (both now and historically) that goes into discrediting people. It&#39;s how you start wars, how you prevent uprisings, how you start coups....</p>
