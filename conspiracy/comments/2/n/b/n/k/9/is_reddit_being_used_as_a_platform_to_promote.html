        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two current examples are the Ferguson situation, and also Net Neutrality. Any comment made against the police is heavily downvoted and ridiculed, in every thread. The same goes for anyone speaking out about the evils of a Government-controlled Internet. Any opinion that doesn&#39;t tow those lines is met with a disproportionate number of downvotes, and maybe a few condescending comments attacking your mental health that are no longer than one sentence long. Most play the &quot;tin-foil hat&quot; card right out of the gate. </p>

<p>Is everyone really convinced? Or is Reddit really that gamed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed all over reddit this is pretty much the same story. The entire site seems so heavily gamed I can only come to think of it as mind control: the illusion of consensus to change people&#39;s perceptions. It seems every avenue of technology and media has been cut off, subverted, or taken over in like manner. Or maybe I&#39;m just crazy, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, me too. If more Americans realized how easy it is outside of the country for them, they would leave too. Being born speaking English makes you a huge asset for nearly every country in the world, all you have to be is smart enough and a decent enough human-being for people to want to hire you.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that the reason <em>most</em> Americans never leave the US (like move out for an extended period) is because we are brainwashed since birth to believe all of these ridiculous things about our country and also about the rest of the world.</p>

<p>So it is perfect circle. Don&#39;t leave the country because you are misinformed. Staying in makes you more prone to continue believing the bullshit. So you stay and subliminally reinforce the idea to the people around you. So they stay. </p>

<p>But I got the fuck out. Been out a few years now. Shit is coming to the US, bad, bad, shit. We all think our country is invincible and every war or conflict will always be &quot;over there&quot;. How long until that bubble bursts? And when it does, it is going to be catastrophic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, anywhere.</p>

<p>I would suggest spending some money on a ticket and then showing up in a hostel and asking for work. If you speak English, they will let you work there and live rent free, a lot of times food is also included.</p>

<p>From there, you explore the city, go out of your way to meet people, other expats and locals, and then you sort out a room or your own flat.</p>

<p>Obviously getting a real job is the hardest part, but if you are willing to find one, you will. There are other complications obviously but the point is that if you want it, you can make it happen.</p>

<p>It is hard but not even 1/10 as hard as you think it is before you do it. And the rest of the world is very open to foreigners, as almost every country shares borders. So unlike the US, you will find great public transportation, money exchanges, hostels, under-the-table work, and just an all around good environment for a foreigner who just drops into town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this reddit is not the reddit of old.  there is an obvious movement to legitimize through constriction of original thought. we used to call this the hive mind. recently i read that sarcasm has to be indicated using the /s as to not offend the stupid. unfortunately there are those who do have a voice but they have never known the real internet so they are intimidated by mods or the possibility of being blocked or banned and as a result stay silent or worse they second guess their thoughts. now as to why? commerce. your moms, dads, gandmas, will not shop on the interwebs if they are afraid it is full of evil haqers so commerce has moved in and tried to cleanup the webs.  advertising sponsors lost control of TV content in the 60s and they learned their lessons. this time around they will buy the medium and tell us what we want to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills... everywhere. Seriously, there are corrupt mods and admin and a good chunk of the Reddit user population are paid PR shills for either the government or various corporations -- Monsanto is a big one, of course, but I&#39;d bet every major corporation has them. (I ran into Pioneer shills on another forum when criticizing their abominable CDJ Nexus firmware updates and customer service.)</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t recommend leaving. Doing so abandons a large number of eyeballs to a bubble of propaganda. You have to shine the light of truth. Sounds corny, but it&#39;s really important you do this. Which implies you have to go out and get truth yourself; easier said than done.</p>

<p>The good thing about this information war is that it&#39;s forcing the &quot;awake&quot; to become much better informed, to fight these agents of greed. It&#39;s like a workout for your awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m convinced on both those issues.</p>

<p>So maybe I&#39;ve been brainwashed. Or I think that the Ferguson situation is partly out of control because of the protesters. As long as they remain peaceful, everything will be peaceful. This doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t think it is below the government to plant violent extremists among the peaceful protesters.</p>

<p>And I believe in net neutrality. Do I wish we would have it without the government being involved? Of course. However, if the companies are going to try to create an unequal Internet, I think the government that funded the whole thing from R&amp;D to infrastructure grants should have a say in that. </p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>Why do you think major institutions <em>hire</em> down-vote brigades to astroturf social media sites?  Can&#39;t afford to let the riffraff think for themselves. (It doesn&#39;t take much - most of the current alumni of our &quot;educational&quot; system couldn&#39;t collate <em>facts</em> and form a coherent, logical argument for love or money.)</p>

<p>COPS - Do people do really dumb shit? All the time. Is being a cop a potential life/death scenario? Absolutely. Do cops make mistakes? Sure. Are they over-militarized? Duh. Do they consider the general population as the enemy? More and more. Heat and stir until explosion occurs. </p>

<p>Internet control - Having to decide if whether corporate or government control is worse is like deciding whether to get kicked in the the right or left nut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you give people to much credit. Most everyone doesnt question whats posted if its in the title thats what the respond too. Just because people post on reddit doesnt mean they are smarter than the average person. Couple that with the fact that noone wants to really really get down to brass tacks and think about what is going on with police brutality and what the corporations are going to the us and i think you will find people are quite easily distracted. Now are people convinced or is reddit gamed? I think you will find its somewhere in the middle. I doubt it would be very hard to use popular bland watered down posts to shift opinions into the area you want.</p>

<p>It has been proven countless times and those of us who noticed the issue a long time ago and have been following it, have seen the hard evidence, over and over again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to try to convince you just because you were sleeping when things were happening. I no longer care about spending my energy to lead you to water and then arguing over whether you should drink it or not. </p>

<p>Because after I convince you, then a thousand more like you will come out of the woodwork one by one and ask for the same treatment.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor, if you <em>actually</em> give a shit about whether or not this website is being taken over, spend 10 minutes on google and find out for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having an educated opinion backed up by facts makes you more correct than having an opinion that isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I know reddit is being gamed. That&#39;s a fact. The opinion is to what <em>extent</em>. I don&#39;t need to bring you up to speed. And most people will believe it isn&#39;t being gamed because their fundamental understanding of how the world works is wrong and basic. They only have it because they are too lazy to use their brain. Thinking is like exercise, the more you do it the better you get at it. </p>
