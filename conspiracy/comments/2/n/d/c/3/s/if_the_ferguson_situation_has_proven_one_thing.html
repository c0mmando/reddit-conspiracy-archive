       Calling out "shills" may have seemed like a shot in the dark and merely throwing around empty accusations to some people in the past, but every thread about Ferguson is blatantly and ridiculously filled with one-sentence comments containing no facts, just cheering on the decision to not indict.  Any comment against the Grand Jury's decision, or voicing displeasure with police there and across the country is quickly and disproportionately brigaded with downvotes.  People are getting slammed for even mentioning the tear gas the police are firing.  It's so obvious that they are trying to make it seem like the overwhelming majority shares the same sentiment about this, because clearly (in reality) people's feelings on this is so far from that one-sided.

       Just another thing that us here in

        /r/conspiracy

       have been right about all along...Reddit is merely used to project a false sentiment and steer the masses into thinking a certain way.  It's disgusting.

       with the local legal process by the Dept. of JustUs, given the racial makeup of police and the "victim", guaranteed a response from the less analytical and more impulsive members of the community. Then .gov:

      <ol>
       <li>
        Was stricken deaf and blind to a blizzard of physical threats over the internet by the Michael Brown cheering section, and;

        Openly assisted said cheering section with

      </ol>
      <p>
       At the same time, the physical images of rioting, looting and intimidation were quickly packaged by state-run media and blasted into Whitey's living room. Whitey flipped out and burned up the phones in Congress, begging for more

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but your stance is that the gov is using their typical problem-reaction-solution strategy to further expand their power.  That's a fair assessment.

       What are we to do with citizens who continually break the laws, often violently, at any opportunity whenever their emotions run out of control?  There are significant issues with some cultures in the US.

       OK; where was I? To support citizen self-defense, easily-understood rules of engagement should be established where anyone who approaches a home or business with weapons in their hands is "fair game".

       General:
      </p>
      <p>
       A rioter facing you and yours with a molotov can be shot from the second he lights the thing. Raising a stone to throw it is the trigger for self-defense,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       after a citizen's already been hit or the business is burning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <em>
        no instance
       </em>
       shall a law-abiding citizen or property-owner be expected to absorb
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       degree of physical harm prior to engaging looters. Rocks, bottles and punches have killed numerous people. There should be no obligation to 'take' physical violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Businesses (that I won't grace with noun "Churches") found harboring felons shall be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. §  1071 (concealing a person from arrest) , plus permanent loss of tax-exempt status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government provocateurs shall immediately lose "sovereign immunity" for the rest of their lives, and will be prosecuted at the same level as "rioters".

       Sounds to me like I have a free pass to gank people and plant weapons on them during a time when police supervision is strained.

       Also sounds like a good time for the cops to do a mass raid and root out every felon in the city, while also getting citizens who may or may not have known about the people they were sheltering (like, the fuck dude) in the system.

       Doesn't really do much to protect people that work at big chain stores like Walmart and Walgreens though. Those types of big corporations would rather the store get burned down and collect the insurance money over risking human life or lawsuits. Meanwhile those stores get closed down but the people that used to work there are out of a job.

       Excuse me but that's a terribly incorrect thing to say because if there was protesting and rioting constantly we wouldn't be talking about it. Your statement sounds ignorant and quite frankly racist. Civil unrest boils over when a group is continually beaten down and marginalized. What's going on in Ferguson is the result of years of intrenched racism against a group of people who now have so little faith in a system that has repeatedly burned them that they now have absolutely zero faith in that system even it seems to be functioning properly...

       They have literally violently rioted, and looted, for a couple weeks worth of nights since the initial incodent went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anyone else doing this and I know you cannot cite any events in recent history where any other group in the US has done the same.  Name one time.  I'll wait.

       All you're doing is apologising for violent savages who take everything they have for granted and refuse to act in any civilised manner.

       Excuse me I didn't realize that a night spent looting here and another there meant "continually" (most people use continually in a different way, you know, for things that are always happening). I haven't heard about looting and burning until last night actually though, so while you go search for some evidence to back up these claims of rampant continual looting I'll leave this here for you to check out

       Your constant use of superlatives such as always and never makes you seem like one of those people who doesn't really think more than one or two questions ahead of what they are saying. You do realize that there are 520,000 African Americans in the greater St Louis area right?  Do you see 520,000 looters? Yeah I didn't think so. Maybe 1000. I feel like it's a huge stretch to assume even that many. So you let the actions of .002% of a group color (ahem) your perception of the rest? That kind of thinking makes you a moron.

       I won't excuse you.  It was about two weeks worth of nights in ferguson alone, not even including nights in other cities.  White people, in the US rarely do so. When they do, it lasts a few hours, they don't kill numerous people, and they don't destroy entire city blocks with fire.  Keep up with the news.  Or, take a gander at
       <a href="/r/greatapes">

       You have nothing to say except for meaningless pedantics.  You have never lived anywhere but your, presumably, low to middle class white neighborhood and have no real world experience.

       In fact, if I were to write up a profile about you, would you honestly answer as to what was true and what was false?

       Except for college I've spent my life living in a town that has less than 50% white people. Not that this has anything to do with our discussion, but I enjoy telling you you're wrong... And I see you don't care to actually refute my question about why it's ok to judge a whole race because of something a infinitesimal percentage of them have done. Probably because it's impossible to defend such a profoundly idiotic sentiment.

       I did, it was like watching Hannity last night. Purely focused on this incident without reference to history. It was a vanilla description of the "black crime problem". Segregation seems to be the real cause, or more simply racism. All ignorance to that fact only perpetuates the indemic discrimination which you propagate.

      <p>
       You don't know how ballistics works. Depending on the caliber, etc. and where the shot hits the victim, it can most certainly be a very quick death.  For example, one of the shots in the second volley that hit Brown in the head was estimated to have killed him near instantly at that point.

      <p>
       You don't know what you're talking about.  Most of the witnesses said after he was shot, he stopped and lurched forward in pain while putting his hands out in surrender.  Even the evidence shows that the first volley of shots were very serious wounds and the blood splatter evidence doesn't support your little trumped up theory either.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trying to create fantasies in your head to appease your own confirmation bias.  Sorry, but I'm going to look at the actual evidence instead of your fantastical, biased babble.

       You're full of shit.  If you bothered to educate yourself you'd know that most of the violent rioters aren't known by the overwhelmingly peaceful protestors who actually live in that community.  They are unknown outsiders who have come in to start trouble and most of the rest are very young teenagers going wild against the community's wishes.

       It's a relatively small town.  People know each other there and most do not know the violent element that's imported itself there.

       You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  You're incredibly ignorant and you obviously don't know anything about the witnesses.  If you'd educate yourself on this issue you'd know there was different witnesses that weren't even from the area and only worked nearby, etc.

       You're just mad that I said Oogly booobly to your sources that are making irrelevant claims. Brown dying 10 feet or 130 feet from the cruiser is a function of a 300lb man not going down immediately. If that's really what's got you so upset then I can go back and delete it to make you feel better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, you're getting on my fucking nerves. Everything I say to you is me projecting, acting like an infant, embracing cognitive dissonance, ad hominem after ad hominem and not one constructive reply to any of my original comments beyond "You're dismissing MY facts."
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of us were at the scene of the shooting. Heads are pretty big, and there was nothing in the report indicating that Brown got brained. People running away from a threat while pumping adrenaline could easily make it an extra 30 yards before they collapse. Dude got hit by 6 9mm rounds, which police and federal agents have been complaining have low stopping power since the 80's. Chest wounds, unless you get hit right in the heart, can take days to kill. They said he died of head and chest wounds, meaning he probably didn't have a definitive kill-wound. For all we know, the headwound could be a jaw or cheek shot, they didn't tell us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole debate is fucking stupid one way or the other, because no matter what the real problem isn't Michael Brown, or racism, it's police militarisation and nobody is talking about that now that they're fighting over "racists" and "jobless criminals."

       which came out today, then most of his wounds weren't disabling wounds except the last shot to the head. Sounds like, while I was wrong in my last paragraph, I was right that there is significant reason for them to be 130 feet from Wilson's cruiser.

       It's not a "function" of anything for certain.  The point is that the police lied about the distance because it didn't fit with the cop's story.

       That's been a major focus throughout the Ferguson issue and continues today.  Again, you seem very out of touch with reality.  There's been a focus on the very real racial issues and the militarized police response along with plenty of other issues including how the Grand Jury was rigged to fail with incredibly unusual measures that expert lawyers all over the USA have agreed was bizarre.

       I'm taking it with a grain of salt considering they say false things like this below within the particular article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "no explanation is offered for why Brown (who weighed around 300 pounds) had been forced by Wilson to have his right hand in a position where it was close to the gun and inside Wilson’s police car."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's false.  Plenty of people have explained that Wilson grabbed Brown to detain him and there was a struggle.  That would most certainly put anyone within close proximity of the officer's weapons, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article leaves out all kinds of damning testimony against Wilson including the fact that Wilson initially lied and said Brown reached for a gun, etc. among other inconsistencies with Wilson's statements along with the police authorities.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was right that there is significant reason for them to be 130 feet from Wilson's cruiser.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you've watched too many action movies if you think those shots to his body were superficial and, therefore, you think it's much more believable that Brown went for a healthy jog towards certain death at the officer after being shot multiple times instead of the eyewitness accounts that said that after the first volley of shots he stumbled forward only a short distance with his hands out in surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, the blood splatter evidence corroborates these witnesses as well.  The problem is the entire Grand Jury proceeding was set up to ignore and disparage those witnesses and focus on anyone and anything that supported the cop even if that meant massaging the truth and conveniently "forgetting" the previous lies on the cop's part where he changed his story.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Also, it turns out that the reason most believe that Brown charged Wilson is due to the account of a racist
       </strong>

       Yes, Grand Jury... and our next witness that's against Brown and in support for a white officer is the KKK.  Nothing to see here, just listen to these "unbiased" people and take it to heart, Grand Jury.  Yep, and justice will be served... somehow....

      </p>
      <p>
       I have followed this story daily from all angles and sources from far-right to far-left, US and global sources, and local papers owned by many different races/ethnic groups so to claim I haven't is your second trick that no one will fall for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, it is a false equivalence to compare this single case with the banksters.  They are scum of the earth and are the oneswhom truly abuse the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll grant you that the Grand Jury has far reaching powers not granted by the constitution and is, generally, a scam in that respect.  However, their failure in one case doesn't mean they are wrong in all of them.  There could always be some level of doubt, but in this case all of the evidence released prior to, and after, the GJ's decision it is very clearcut that Wilson acted in self defense.

       It's a complex, evolving event with many factors and teeming with externalities.  It's not a good idea to dumb it down and I thought you'd prefer to read the evidence yourself and make up your own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       My intent is to show you the other side of the issue you are apparently ignoring in your haste to rejoice in the "verdict" (as you call it).  My intent isn't to "prove you wrong" with a deluge of nonsensical drivel.  My intent is to educate and inform you of evidence you don't seem to be aware of.  And, frankly, if one is aware of the evidence and one still thinks this is all completely "clearcut", that person is a bit dense.

       And, the more I read your post , the more I realize you still haven't read those links.  You can take that as a compliment of sorts, if you'd like.

       I wasn't.  You missed the point.  The point
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       that whether or not people are found guilty in a court of law in this country is all too often not relevant to whether or not they are actually guilty of crimes, sociopathic behavior, etc. in reality.

       Don't grant me anything, let the evidence speak for itself.  You also missed the other point of the issues.  It's not the Grand Jury, it's how the Grand Jury was manipulated and engaged.  At least, that's what the evidence shows.

       It is.  We do not prosecute men when no crime has been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws, as they currently exist, do not mandate a trial against a man without evidence that a crime has been committed.  The prosecutors decided there was no point in a trial where there was no reasonable possibility that they could win with the evidence at their disposal.  They reasoned that they had no case.

       Defending himself? He shot an unarmed civilian. Even if he was aggressive towards the officer, according to the law they can only respond with one degree of force above what is being used against them. This is basic criminal justice. The fact the officer was not indicted on any charges at all is a reflection of an aggressive, militarized us them  mentality that is the current culture of a majority of our police force. Color is not the issue here, that is merely a distraction to divert our attention from the real issue, which is the militarization of our police force.

       Have you ever seen a case where the prosecutor does act to discredit the victim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen a case where the prosecutor leaks tapes to "discredit" the shot party, but protects the innocent police officer? Where the ONLY leaks have come from the prosecution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen a case where the "supposed innocent" party, after incredible delay tactics of the prosecution, marries one of the first responders to the scene, which coincidentially gives her spousal immunity from being questioned?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen a case where ALL the media stations say "they were deploying smoke bombs", but twitter explodes with "#justbeingteargassed"?
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are so cocksure of your point, and assuming it happened to you, would you be against standing trial for that? If all the facts are like you said, I suppose you would be very good at telling your side of the stopry, and evidence would support you, and most likely, you would be found innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in a world where a prosecutor that decides if there is reason to stand trial goes out of his way to slam the shot party at any possibility, does not seek a federal arrest warrant if the party accused of the crime changes state lines, slams the witnesses THEY brought into court ( 50 brought in if memory serves correctly, 4 considered relevant), does not seek a nullification of marriage as soon as the suspect marries one of t6he first responders, and to top it all off is the only party that is allowed to feed the jury information, in such a world, would you not even douibt one iota of his stance, and would you not like to go, I would like to see that crossexamined?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am trying not to use words like "Black people shooting enthusiast", and try to stay away from presuming guilt, but these are the exact circumstances that make me want cameras on every cop, even those inside the station, as long as they are on the clock. Because then, you have something to release about the officer in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police body cams that have no possibility to be switched off are only feared by those who have shit to hide. If the same argument is used against privacy advocates, let the police lie down in the bed they made.

       Ok, an update on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know your general prosecutor sucks when......
      </p>
      <h1>
       fergusson edition.
      </h1>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he is a police kid ( father, mother, brother, uncle, cousin), and his father has been killed responding to a call with a black suspect, and he is supposed to weight the interests of an honest hardworking police officer who acted in self defense ( quote from THE PROSECUTOR) against a black kid ( "demon", "Hulk-like", according to the SOLE SURVIVING PERSON (allso called murder suspect).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he does not immediatelly go for a conviction of criminal insanity, after he heard a police officer describe the reason why he fired a black unarmed kid with his gun as "because he looked like a demon" ( My reaction would be,. how often do you see peoiple that look like demons, do you see them while on duty, are voices in your head telling you to shoot the people that look like demons, in your oppinion, does mace work on demons? How about a baton?)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when in the entire argument of the case ( I downloaded the torrent with the files), never ONCE did the prosecutor utter in any way shapoe or form words ammounting to "michael brown was unarmed. "
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he pushes thge story of the giant demon hulk brown, without realising that willson is almost the same height.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he  goes ham on the argument "The pathologist did not find gunpowder residue on michael browns body", but at the same time conveniently forgets to mention "The pathologist did not have acess to michael browns clothing " the place where gunshot residue usually lasts the strongeest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he forgets to mention that because of diustrust in his own tream, not only did the brown family order a second autopsy, also the justice department orders a third.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he , in 2001, returned a grand jury to "no charges" against 2 officers that fired 21 gunshots in a vehicle, killing 2 black suspects, during a drug arrest.  ( Maybe that is why he is considered a safe bet to get police officers out of trouble...)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when he does not step aside for a special prosecuter, and save his city some face, but instead chooses to remain on the tail ölike a tick, despite his city burning.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know yoiur prosecutor sucks when a petition for him to resign and notify a conflict of interests gets 25,000 signatures in four days, seeking a special prosecutor for the case.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you know your prosecutor sucks when ,even after the local force’s response to the protests turned Ferguson into a war zone, he voices his protest against the case being taken out of the local forces hands and put into highways hands. We all have seen how during ONE DAY, highway managed to turn a warfield into a peacefull demonstration, something that local was either incapable or unwillingf to do.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -You know your prosecutor sucks when he himnself, the arguably most police friendly prosecutor, prides himself on having Wilson testify.... "A daring choice, because he essentially has no lawyers there....", when the other side , a shooting viuctim, could not be called in front of the grand jury. Kind of like in the case with the 21 gunshot salute. Both men told jurors that Murray’s car was coming at them and that they feared being run over. McCulloch said that “every witness who was out there testified that it made some forward motion.” But a later federal investigation showed that the car had never come at the two officers: Murray never took his car out of reverse. An exhaustive St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigation found that only three of the 13 detectives who testified had said the car moved forward: the two who unloaded their guns and a third whose testimony was, as McCulloch admitted, “obviously…completely wrong.” McCulloch never introduced independent evidence to help clarify for the grand jury whether Murray’s car moved forward.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        and my personal favorite, albeit unscientific piece of evidence: Lets say you are a police officer. You have pepper spray. Pepper spray blinds a person pretty good, especially when you are not restricted to the civillian varieties, and can buy the black ops strength version. Lets say you have a baton. Maybe it is because I have seen too many vietnam area movies, and found myself through life much closer to Abbie Hoffmann then to Nixon. But I know what a baton can do, and if the other opponent has a baton and at least some training with it, and I am unarmed, I either try to resist as little as possible and focus on protecting my vitals, or I run. If now said officer with a baton and a can of mace is so unsure of himself that he choses to shoot first, and ask questions later, THEN WHAT KIND OF A SCREWHEAD PUT THAT OBVIOUSLY INCOMPETENT MAN ON PATROL? I know police officers who pride themself in telling me that even just with their mace, they can take on  grown bodybuilders. Heck, I know people that are officer wilsons build but 175 cm tall and that can send 208 cm tall me on the floor in seconds. If your training can not equip an officer with the secure knowledge he can take out threats without relying on his gun, then what the fuck does such a piece of stackled incompetence and cowardness do on patroll duty?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And an other thing, this time very personal: I am 208 cm. I weigh around 120 kg. I am not the healthiest, and I do have a belly. 
If this is enough to paint a target on my face for every cop shorter then me or lighter then me, then two things: 
1. I bet my german "above the average" weight does not translate to anything but the average weight class in america, and should not be grounds for "fire first, ask questions later"
2. I bet me being taller then usual does not make me a personal demonlike figure that can only be shot as soon as it makes a move.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a missconception, and it indeed says, if the assailant is heavier then you and taller then you, fire first, ask questions later, we will see a pattern continue. Cops that barely passed the fitness exams, and would be lovingly titled "A big girls blouse", suddenly have an open permit to shoot everything they percieve as taller and heavier then them. I say,m even if it hurts the equality fanatics, if those cops can only assert authority over the end of a gun, ban them to desk duty for the rest pof their careers or untill they have become proficcient in no9n-gun based conflict resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or else, I BET THE NEXT VICTIM OF A POLICE KILLING WILL BE HEAVIER AND TALLER THEN THE POLICEMAN IN QUESTION

       I didnt know Wilson married one of the first responders. That takes police actions to a whole new level of skeeviness. Even if they WERE planning a wedding before Im sure their timetable was pushed ahead a bit. Ugh.

       Assessing the witness testimonies and the coroner's report is sufficient to determine the circumstances of the case.  Everything after that just added weight to it being clear cut self defense.  If this happened to me, and I had a CC permit, I would have done the same and, likewise, would not be indicted as the evidence clearly supports my innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, anyone can be corrupt at any time, and there are plenty of precedent for this in the past.  It is not the case here.  It is clear cut self defence that doesn't warrant a trial in this particular case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wholeheartedly agree with you on the police cams.  If you think the GJ corrupted the case, well, I sincerely disagree but that's what this sub is for, right?

       You're the one grasping here buddy, I'm not saying hes guilty of murder I'm saying he's a poor officer of the law. 
I'm saying he shouldn't have reversed back to those jaywalkers. 
I'm saying if he wouldn't have gotten pissy at a couple of rebelous 18 year old black dudes who wouldn't listen to him and tried to actually catch a criminal we'd have a trial instead of riots. 
I'm saying Brown could have be an aggravator too and may have acted irrational but he's dead now  so we cant hear his side of the story. 
I'm saying Wilson deserves a trial at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't that hard to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in this area, there's a lack of respect from all sides obviously but saying the kid deserved this based solely on the stories we've heard is horse shit. 
The officers story to me personally sounds like a CYOA move, and the lack of sympathy and tact dealing with the reactions of the people look like a show of force. 
So keep on with your story of poor Darren Wilson but keep in mind he was a trained professional and should know what the fuck to do in these types of situations.

       Alacrity argued that Brown wasn't twice the size of Wilson by being pedantic.  I countered that Browns position, standing, versus Wilson's, seated compacted in his car seat, justified my "twice the size" argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you come in out of nowhere and ask me if I know that cars can move.  This is only tangentially relayed to the current argument about physical size/upperhand.  It also fails to allow for the fact that Brown was already grappling with Wilson inside the parked car.  So, no, it actually couldn't move by that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you're telling your life story and other anecdotes and basically stating "well, they're both at fault".

       Putting a column shifter into drive and pressing the gas is still easier than removing your holstered weapon during a through the window wrestling match. You're just wrong there. "I grew up in this area," isn't my life story. I'm not saying they're both at fault I'm saying no one is perfect and one of them is dead, that shouldn't mean the other person wins. you are pushing an idea that darren had no option than to pull a trigger or that his actions are valid because of the size difference and we should let him free. that my friend, I believe is horse shit.

       Don't claim you read the entire evidence released either. You can't be honest about any of your claims, and that is clearly a lie.

       Weight is a factor.  Wilson was also stuck sitting down in his car where Brown was punching/attacking/tickling from above.

       Not to mention it was on the right side of his face.  Meaning Brown 'hit' him with his left arm?  I still want to know how big-ass Michael Brown was able to maneuver his massive arms, through a window, contesting with a steering wheel, oh and an armed cop.

       an officer shouldnt have to take a sever beating to justify fighting back, he was stuck in his car, his weapon was being compromised and the man was attacking him. have you ever thought of attacking a police officer while they are in there car, no, because chances are you may get shot, who wouldve thought, brown was a criminal who didnt have the common sense to not get himself killed, wilson may have been overzealous however if you put yourself in a position where an officer feels his life could possibly be in danger, and then you proceed to move toward him as he states stop or i will shoot, nobody should feel bad for you.

       your right the police officer should just drive away from the situation...
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe their job is to catch the criminal not run away from criminals, also you have no idea whether it would have even been possible for him to turn the car to drive and drive away, i dont know why you people stand on the side of the criminal that did everything in his power to get shot vs the cop who shouldnt have to deal with this situation in the first place and justifiably values his life over the aggressive and dangerous 6'5 300lb adult male. if there was a law in missouri that stated no matter what threat on the officers life he does not have the right to shoot at an individual you would see a significant rise in officers being fatally wounded on the job, they are there to serve and protect, however they also have a right overarching right to protect themselves as was the case in this situation. Officer wilson fired multiple rounds to deter the threat before fatally wounding him with 6 shots, at any point michael brown could have surrendered, and despite lie-witness accounts he did not and continued to threaten the officer with aggressive actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like honestly, if you performed the series of actions michael brown did, disopbeying a police officers order, attacking the officer in his car, reaching for the officers gun, chargin at the officcer after he told you to stop or he will shoot, would you not expect to get shot? there are many instances of police brutality and police militarization that are not justified, in this particular trial that is not the case, read the facts, read the expert testimony, read the eye witness reports, under the current law as it reads the shooting was justified, case closed, no racism, no bigotry, no prejudice, no media sensationalism just letter of the law vs the facts that are presented

       facts presented he called for backup then reversed down the street, he should have told them to freeze and waited for backup instead of driving backwards into the situation..
he "trapped" himself in the car and pulled his gun. those were his conscious decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lack of blatant facts, lack of accountability, and heated tempers are what caused the debates and riots resulting in militarization of forces but the facts remain he made poor choices and now someone is dead.
Nothing good can come of this without admitting that. Even if he isn't on trial for murder and was doing his job that's not how you deal with an aggressive jaywalking shoplifter or large black wounded cop attackers. He had no right to unload on anyone at that distance nor should he have tried to address the situation alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justifying the actions of the officer by villainizing the suspect that can't defend himself is wrong they're BOTH innocent until proven guilty.

       did you see the surveillance tape above, brown is a bully who had no regard for law or human decency? also officer wilson had no idea that the man would attack him when he used his vehicle to block the road. you can say he had no right to unload on someone that close but on the other hand brown has absolutely no right to attack a police officer and whatever outcome results it is certainly browns personal actions that led to his death regardless of whether or not wilson was justified in his use of force.

       Motive?  Why would Brown just outright kill a cop in broad daylight, in front of multiple witnesses?  Your accusation is baseless, unfounded, and lacks cohesion with logic.  It makes for nice rhetoric, but that's about it.

       Dude you sound fucking retarded. You are the one who made the idiotic statement "but bruising doesn't occur until HOURS after", blah blah, which is utterly a false statement. The cop showed no signs of swelling or bruising, get your eyes checked if you disagree.

       Ive read it, and I have all the pics.  There is a little red mark on his cheek, and a red mark on the back of his neck.  The kind of mark you get when you fall asleep on a desk or sit with your face in your hands for too long.
       <br/>
       My point here, is that your original story of the 300lb black child pummeling the cop unmercifully then charging at him raging with adrenaline is not represented in these photos.  There simply is not enough information to make a call, and any attempt to do so is going to be influenced by emotion and assumptions.  The only thing concrete in this case is that there is a lack of evidence to prove the cop acted unlawfully. Its upsetting to know that a police officer can get away with murder based on a technicality, but this is where we are right now.

       Two things.  A guy standing up over a guy sitting, confined, in a car is approximately 2x the size.  Particularly regarding advantage in a physical battle.  One also must include the difference in weight.

      <p>
       Do you have a source for that? I've never even heard of that. Most use of force guidelines I've seen allow for the use of deadly force to prevent grave bodily harm. I'm not even sure how "one degree" would be defined. On top of that, the current rules are that the officer's use of force is judged based on the situation as they perceived it in the moment, not on evidence that may come to light later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which underscores the problem: being black in America is scary, and scaring a cop is a death warrant. As far as I'm concerned, solving either of those problems would be a huge step forward.

       Ok "can't stop whitey" he never had reason to yell at the Brown for jay walking in the first place. I personally find that a silly excuse. It wasn't until after he had already talked to Brown he had an idea the young man could have been involved with the shoplifting. 
Seeing that Brown was larger than him and not alone the officer should not have tried to single handedly stop them.
He could have easily barked orders from his car and called backup before ever letting Brown get close enough to attack. Though that wasn't the case, after the shots fired in the car he could have shot brown in the leg, tazed, or bonked the dude with his baton or flashlight at some point.
Lethal force was not necessary at any point in the altercation it was a choice made by a trained individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe as a scared white male he would have been protecting himself against a big black dude, but as a trained officer he was shooting an unarmed jaywalking shoplifter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to down vote this but I really think the badge he wore should be removed and the people who gave it to him should be on trial. I may have some details off but there's a disgusting lack of accountability at best in this situation.

       this is what I'm reading and at the bottom of page 4 Officer Wilson says he told the two to use the side walk and they mouthed off. He then called for backup and put his car in reverse.
That is where I'm saying he messed up as a police officer. He put himself at risk by confronting the situation that close and alone knowing he could have stayed put until help arrived.
From that point on he is unaccountable for his actions because he's in an unfair situation. 
Without a camera or valid testimony there is not enough evidence to indict, I get that.  Just because we can paint people with stereotypes doesn't mean their actions were valid though.
      </p>
      <p>
       so again I say, I may have some details off but there's a disgusting lack of accountability at best in this situation.

       attacking an officer and grabbing at an officers weapon is a life-threatening action, if michael brown had succeeded in this attempt the officer would now be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       on top of this, the reason the police force needs to be militarized is because the force is made uyp if a few hundred men and women while major cities in the us house millions of people, if people incite riots that damage property and endanger the lives of people the police force must be equipped with the fire power necessary to meet that threat. it is blantantly obvious that people who are rioting do not care about the brown decision as much as they care about engaging in criminal action and destroying other peoples livelihoods. if there were peaceful protests without building being set on fire, guns getting shot off, and property being destroyed and looted the police would have no reason to militarize.

       if true what? that police need to have better weapons than the criminals? that people in these communities deserve to have a police force equipped to protect them, their properties and their businesses? yes the huge swat trucks might be overkill but thats how corporations make their money, overall police should have the force necessary to protect themselves and the communities they protect. what makes our country fucked is the people that think it is ok to go around and vandalize, destroy and harm communities and families in the name of justice for a criminal who was shot while attacking an officer

       The first shot went through Wilson's hand at an angle that only could have happened if he was within inches of the gun in a direction that does not suggest that he was holding his hands up or out in self defense but in an attacking movement.

       Which is just a white washing Wilson's inconsistent testimony and the conflicting eye witness testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       How'd Wilson have no injuries from two solid "full force" punches to the face?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilson testified he didn't think about whether Brown was armed, but then testifies Brown was fishing around his waistband, implying a weapon, as part of his motivation for shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one asked him to explain the hospital records reporting him as, "well-appearing, well-nourished, in no apparent distress," and, "no bleeding, no lacerations, no ecchymosis [bruises]"

       I'm unhappy because there wasn't even a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole issue is they have a corpse with bullets that entered it's back and exited the front, and the victim of the gunshots is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I shot someone through their back out their front in any circumstance, I would fully expect the case to go to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very curious what the judge and district attorney advised the jury, because I cannot fathom a circumstance where this outcome is anything other than the jury following instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a few that I saved:

       -- Bunch of info that got collected immediately showing the actual distance he was from the vehicle when shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly cannot find the article mentioning the shots fired from behind while he was running, and I really looked.. "wilson brown site:reddit.com shot back" literally returns nothing ever mentioning he was ever shot in the back between the days of sep15 to oct15, in a very specifically done google search, so either my memory is incorrect (most likely) or every mention of anything like that on reddit was removed or google isn't displaying the results.  It almost seemed odd that it was never even asked ever once as far as the search showed but I remember specifically people talking about it, which makes me think 2 events might be running together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I just opened the official one they used in court, its not any better. One of the bullets entered the scalp area of the head at a down and to the right angle? He was on his knees or prone to be hit there and have a bullet go that angle, he was 6'4" and Wilson is shorter than him. --

       Says gunshot wound, vertex of scalp, path downward and rightward as the top two gunshots to the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       My memory were that the shot to the thumb and hip were fired from behind him and there is actually a visual mockup of all the bullet trajectories that shows this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were 2 shots fired into his head that went on a down and right trajectory.  The other shots all except for the ones which struck his arms or were superficial wounds were fired downward, including 2 shots to the head.  The shots which struck his arms appear to be the ones that were fired from inside the car, and the visual I remember showing how they had to have entered one of them was fired into his arm while it was held up in front of the face in a likely defensive posture.

       Yeah let me dig it back up. It was the initial coroner's report and it was a story off one of the larger alt news blogs like vice or somewhere had linked the report, and it matched the witness statement that he had been shot in the back twice while fleeing then in the front.

       My guess is all of that was suppressed or never brought forward at all.

       What verdict are you happy with? Don't you wonder why a grand jury? If the police was innocent wouldnt a public prosecution be a more feasible way to conduct the business? Why hide behind a grand jury comprising 9 white americans and 3 african americans? Wasnt the uneven balance in the power structure a problem the whole issue brought forth?

       The thing is, the evidence isn't conclusive enough to say with that he did nothing wrong which is EXACTLY WHY he should've been indicted. A trial would theoretically sort all this out justly. That is, if it weren't so common for prosecutors to take dives on these sort of cases.

       A rebuttal to the general context that I found you and another redditor embroiled in -- namely racism.

       Please don't cop out under the guise of a "non-contextual" excuse -- I do honestly want to hear your opinions, we're both here, and we're in a thread discussing race.

       I've given you two ways to discuss these things, take them or leave them.  I've got far more comment replies directly on topic that I need to take care of first.

       So, to wrap up this little parlay, a summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) I ask you 2 simple questions
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Do you believe in a reproductive separation of the races to preserve european-descendant superiority?
       </li>
       <li>
        Question - Do you understand the logical implications to the former question, given that there is far greater intra-racial variance than inter-racial variance?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       2.) You immediately deploy a "non-contextual" reason for not answering the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) I acknowledge it's not 100% contextual, but that we're in a thread talking about race, and I want to hear you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) You immediately accuse me of "attacking your character" when clearly I'm not (this is called self-victimization, in the event you like to label your cognitive biases.)
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) I abide your demand to PM you with my original 2 questions, anddd you ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why won't you answer the questions? Is it b/c it contradicts your worldview and you lack the intellectual toolset to rebut?

       Didn't receive it. So either reddit's messaging system messed up (very unlikely), you forgot to send it (likely), or your intended communications don't match what is perceived (less likely.)

      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Posting all day to reddit - so either unemployed, or an information worker, or day off.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Decent grammar/sentence-structure
         <em>
          and
         </em>
         relentless passive aggression, so you're a woman.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Frequentor of racist sub-reddits - so probably Midwest or South, hmm which negatively impacts likelihood of being an information worker.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not cognizant of the entitled &amp; condescending tones with which she speaks to others, so maybe a combination of young + good-looking.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wouldn't answer a simple question about statistical variances, so not in STEM.

       Aww it's really inspiring to see that you've discovered how to use a thesaurus, however "enamoured" is quite incorrect in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now "amour," the latin root of your poorly chosen word, means "to love" which is a far cry from what was an easily discernible connotation in my response -- disdain (or maybe even contempt).

       Your opinion, good sir, does not qualify as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the "facts" of the case. This highly unusual and poorly handled grand jury proceeding has already raised questions about what facts were presented and how. It is also very curious how this particular prosecutor has now brought five (5) cases before a grand jury where civilians were killed by police and now, for the fifth time, he has failed to get an indictment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much more fact-finding to be had outside of the secret meetings held by the morally and professionally compromised District Attorney's secret trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, for your own mental health and public rapport, think on this before you continue with such inflammatory statements with matter-of-fact conviction.

       No it is just an excuse that an overly aggressive police uses so they can get back at everyone for bullying them in high school.
      </p>

       You can bet your ass if Joe Blow shot at someone six+ times and claimed self defense while witnesses say everything from self defense to murder; there would at very least be a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what this is about not whether the cop was innocent or guilty.  But could there have possibly, again not WAS there, but could there possibly been a crime that took place.    There were witness that claimed a crime took place, and someone lost their life.   That warrents an indictment at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically with this ruling it is now OK for cops in the US to murder.  Because even if someone witness a cop killing someone if the cop says they were a threat then there will not be a trial.  If a grand jury wont at the very least put a cop on trial for a shooting involving a cop were witness claim criminal actions took place then that doesn't bode well for the rest of us.

       Finally, someone understands self-defense. Shoot until the threat has been neutralized, whether it be running away or dying. Nobody is going to shoot you once and then ask, "Are you done being a threat?". If your life is in mortal danger you don't chance that shit. Now, the question of "Was it a reasonable use of deadly force?" shit man, I dunno. This whole thing is two cluster-fucks shy of a FUBAR sandwich.

       You get a clue.  If you cannot handle an athletic adult male in a physical altercation YOU SHOULD NOT BE A COP.   Your being a drama queen, be realistic.  When you actually look at what happened and take into account all the eyewitness accounts and physical evidence its pretty fucking clear that there was no reason for someone to be killed.  Just like there is no reason for you to be such a fucking drama queen.  Is there a reason you came back to reddit after 11 days to start shit in ferguson topics?  Do you get a kick out of being a douche on the internet?

       Ok, so the next time a man, a thug, comes at you full-force and/or tries to steal your gun, I'll just expect you to not fight back and just "handle him," kind of like Officer Wilson did, without getting killed. You have a warped sense of defense, my friend.

       I've read all the evidence, facts, and testimonies. Have you? The grand jury, made up of twelve jurors, reviewed everything and determined there was no reason to charge him. The end.  Just because you want a different outcome doesn't mean facts aren't facts.

       You have not read all the evidence, facts, and testimonies.  Otherwise you would not have said that the victim came at the cop full force and tried to steal his gun. Because that isn't what happened at all.  And just because 12 people say something is fact doesn't make it fact.  You and eleven friends could say the world is flat and that wouldn't make it a fact just like no matter how many times you say you have read all the evidence you haven't.  Your just another internet troll.  No one who isn't trolling would say that just because someone says something makes it true.

       My man, you're getting way too flustered about pointing out that self-defense is not passive. When put into a situation (from what we understand it to be) like that, you have to actively defend yourself. Point blank. Bringing up his demographics doesn't do you a bit of good either, bro. Would you 1v1 hand to hand fight Mike Tyson? How about a Marine who was your height/weight? Hands kill people. Feet kill people. Motherfucking people die from being sat on. Anywho, as i stated before: Do I think it was a reasonable use of force? I don't know. Who instigated the scuffle? Don't know. Did he rob that store? Well, that one really doesn't matter because the officer stated he wasn't responding to that call but still I DONT KNOW because the media really fucked us on this one...again.

       You shouldn't makes assumptions based on text.  Your assuming I am flustered about self defense?  Now I am flustered because some asshole on reddit is telling me how I think and how I feel.     Your english comprehension skills need a hell of a lot of work if you think I was flustered because I emphasized a word with quotations.   Can you tell I am """""""""flustered now"""""""""?  Is it a reasonable response when some know it all starts telling you how you think and how you feel.     I think so because I do not care who the fuck you are you do not get to tell me what to think and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You come on here not to contribute to the conversation but to attack me. I can only guess you are not very manly considering how you hyper analyze REDDIT POSTS so you can discern other peoples emotions (piss poor job you do by the way) and confront them about them.   Get off your high horse and read a little about what happen because it is clear as day you know nothing that is going on in ferguson or self defense.   The only thing you seem to know is how to be a pretentious snob.   So kindly fuck off and worry about yourself.

       First no he was not 300 ilbs.  Stop stretching the truth.  He was 18 years old; a males brain does not fully develop until the age of 23.  The boy had no muscle mass.  I have seen high school athletes his size who would actually look threatening.  Unless your a chocolate cake; 292 ilbs of fat ass is not a threat. you can walk backwards faster then he could walk forwards.

       "Ben Stein, a conservative pundit familiar to most of America as a pitchman for a brand of eye drops, showed up on Newsmax television, to make the point in even simpler terms: “The idea of calling this poor young man unarmed when he was 6’4”, 300 pounds, full of muscles, apparently, according to what I read in The New York Times, on marijuana. To call him unarmed is like calling Sonny Liston unarmed or Cassius Clay (sic) unarmed. He wasn’t unarmed. He was armed with his incredibly strong, scary self.”

       So I am not sure if your an Idiot or a troll but claiming that he full of muscles, armed, and more dangerous because he was high on marijuana is the most retarded thing I have come across.  Congrats.  You are seriously something special if you still think marijuana makes people violent and a beer belly is "Full of muscles" It doesn't matter though because I am done talking with someone as thick as you.

       I didn't say he was armed. If an unarmed person twice my size was charging at me I'd shoot too if I had to. If he continued charging at me I'd keep shooting. The cop should have had a taser and used it, that's an argument you can make, but that's the police department's fault for not mandating carrying tasers.

       You're right, I exaggerated. Nonetheless my argument remains, if that's how it went down, I'd have done the same. My shitty police department should have mandated I had a taser, and a body camera for that matter, on me at all times. In general cops aren't in the upper echelon of intelligence among society, as we know.

       Using a gun on an unarmed citizen is homicide.   That was way more force then needed.   Cops have mace and collapsible batons.   There is absolutely no reason he should of used his gun other then he is a killer.

       No one was charged.  Physical evidence proves that was pure fabrication.   The body was found 150ft from the cruiser which disproves the cops testimony of the victim charging from 20-30 ft.  What is more likely is that like eye witness testimony the victim ran after being shot twice turned around and shouted "I do not have a gun" and then the cop gunned him down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start spouting out shit like its gospel you should do your research.  You clearly did not look into this at all and just picked a side and jumped on their bandwagon.   As for your question Yes I have been in life or death situations and logical thinking is exactly what you do if you don't want to die or do something stupid.  This cop was swinging his dick like a big man and had played it out a million times in his head.  He started a fight so he could shoot someone and he got what he wanted.  The physical evidence and eyewitness testimony point to that
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Physical evidence puts the body 150ft from the cruiser.  In conclusion the victim could not have charged from 20-30ft when the cop gunned him down.

       So in that situatuon, you would have shot once, then asked the guy that was attacking you if he was done attacking? It's called adrenaline. When you think someone is trying to cause bodily harm to you, you shoot to kill.

       In what situation?  I wouldn't harass a civilian to the point that he cuss at me.  I wouldn't slam him with my door and reach out of my cruiser to choke him.  I wouldn't of shot him then watch as he runs away.  And after he gets a good 150ft away from me and shouts that he is unarmed, no I would not have shot him additionally.  You clearly have no clue what the fuck you are talking about and should actually read about what happen like i said in my last post.  But since you refuse to even learn the smallest bit of information about the case I must assume your an idiot or a troll.  Considering your on a throwaway account I would assume your just a troll.  In which case I am sorry you have no life and the only enjoyment you can get out of your shitty existence is trying to start shit on the internet.

       I think he was saying that he was afraid that the country had declined to the point where they would spend millions of dollars on a trial where there wasn't enough evidence to get a conviction, just to appease a mob of disenfranchised citizens.

       I think it's part of a bigger divide and conquer strategy. Media helps drive it home. Turn races against each other, cherry pick the facts to report. It became a nationwide thing.

Comments like this are attempting to set a "perceived perception" of viewpoints on this sub/rest of reddit on this issue particularly.

       Pretty much, and the public opinion seems to be "he was a shitty guy so who cares" is the majority so even though their might be a lot of signals that the story isn't quite up to a high standard of blind and fair justice, they don't care as much because he was a shitty guy and had it coming.

       Wilson's actual testimony sounds like someone I would never want carrying a weapon around people.. No idea how many shots he fired, eyes of a demon, etc.. I've been in fights as part of my job with people as big as the suspect here was and I could still tell you the number of punches thrown and I didn't have a gun to shoot them with, and they were sometimes 100 pounds bigger than me. I never saw a demon either.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is a minority community on Reddit, compared to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       does not mean that they are being paid to do so.

       A sub that has largely been in the defense of the Brown family, is now elated at a verdict that failed to convict the man who killed their son...riiiiight.   You shills are inconsistent at best and only show up on issues that are divisive.  A good way to recognize shilling is when the comments are over 200 because they need to give the perception of the majority.  Another way they do this is by vote brigading pro corporate, police, surveillance, etc. comments of a random stranger to the top.

       The verdict is correct. Michael Brown robbed a store, roughed up the clerk, walked down the middle of the street with stolen goods, ignored the cop's request to get out of the street, punched the cop and got into a struggle with the cop.

       This is one of the things that has been framed out of the conversation. Most developed countries do just fine without guns. Our police should have them, since we do have the right to them here, but should only be used as a last option. When it comes down to it, we don't know what happend with Mike Brown. We do know that there are some easy ways to avoid messes like this in the future, like non-stop police body cameras, but we dont get a constructive conversation.. Just shots of burning buildings and weird desctiptions of vandalizm as "violence".

        Darren Wilson said
       </a>
       that he was not carrying a Taser because they are bulky, and he didn't use pepper spray when he was attacked in the car because of obvious reasons. He pulled the gun originally in self defense because Brown was trying to grab it, and once out of the car he used the gun because a) Brown seemed to be trying to kill him (since he tried to grab the gun) and b) he seemed to be reaching into his waistband for a weapon.

       Listen, here in Germany we may have scool-shootings, too. But we never went the "OK, everyone must be armed to the teeth because then nobody will even dare to go amok".
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently we had a large group of Hooligans united with Nazis "demonstrating" against ISIS/Muslims. In fact it turned out to be battery and devastation. I dare not to think about every single one of those stupid mofos to be armed with (semi-)automatic rifles. It would have been a massacre.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the day few people were harmed, none were dead, glass broke and doors got slammed and we do our best (not sure about this one, though) to never let it happen again.

       Out of 162,000 cases 11 have been thrown out in the grand jury stage. While I agree that Wilson is not guilty there was enough evidence to suggest probable cause. I think the majority of anger is that the prosecutor threw the case.

       Police officers can only use one degree of force above what they are being faced with. Therefore shooting someone unarmed, even if they assaulted you, is unlawful. He only had the right to subdue using a mechanical device, like a baton or a taser.

       "The autopsy noted the absence of stippling, powder burns around a wound which indicate that a shot was fired at a relatively short range; however, Dr. Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, notes that gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing. Forensic pathologist Dr. Judy Melinek was quoted in the article as saying the hand wound was consistent with Brown reaching for the gun at the time he was shot. Melinek was also quoted as saying that the autopsy did not support witnesses who claimed that Brown was shot while fleeing the crime scene or with his hands up, noting that the direction of the gunshot wound on Brown's forearm indicated that Brown's palms could not have been facing Wilson.[140]"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Baden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. He stated that, "Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting," and that, in his capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, he would have said, "You're not supposed to shoot so many times."[14] At least two commentators have noted that the autopsy contradicts some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, including that Wilson shot Brown in the back[14] and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.[147]"
      </p>
      <p>
       "According to the leaked testimony, the incident began as Wilson was driving down Canfield Drive, having just handled a call about a sick baby, when he saw Brown and Johnson walking down the middle of the street. Wilson told them to move to the sidewalk and was met with verbal abuse from the pair in response. Wilson saw that they were carrying cigarillos, and he noticed that Johnson matched the description of a suspect in a strong-arm robbery where cigarillos had been stolen. Wilson parked his vehicle and called for assistance, then tried to get out of the vehicle, but was punched in the face by Brown through the open window. Wilson thought he had no choice but to draw his weapon, because Brown was "incredibly strong". He was unable to use pepper spray due to the close quarters, and his baton was out of reach. Brown grabbed Wilson's pistol while punching him repeatedly in the face. Wilson could feel Brown pushing the weapon back toward his body, and it was at one point pointed back at his hip. Wilson pulled back inside the vehicle and attempted to shoot Brown, but he failed the first time because Brown's finger was jammed in the hammer of the gun. The gun fired on the second attempt, resulting in a wound to Brown's hand, as well as scattering fragments of glass inside the vehicle. A second gunshot failed to hit Brown before Brown fled. Wilson's shoulder radio had been knocked off-setting during the struggle, and he decided to give chase. After he got out of the vehicle, Brown turned back toward him, then charged at him despite his commands to stop. Wilson fired at Brown, hitting him four times, including a final, fatal shot to the forehead, which brought Brown down.[64]"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not absolute evidence but you definitely have a motive for how Brown would've acted. I don't think what is on the internet now can prove the case either way, but we don't have the same evidence the grand jury did. If he grabbed the officers gun then they most likely have finger prints of that, I'm sure we'll find out at some point. If the fingerprints are there then I think that's sufficient evidence for use of deadly force.

       This is way too much common sense. I honestly could have seen the cop shooting the kid once...but multiple times seemed excessive.  I also have had worse "injuries" from shaving. I think he should at least have gone to trial for manslaughter. Cops get away with this all the time (killing pets, young adults, terrorizing people). Not even about race, I just wish a police officer would stand trial. They always get off the hook.

       In that case it would be called justifiable homicide and yes I think its sad when somebody gets shot 12 times. Why are you being hostile? You're starting this convo from a argumentative stance. I think it is you that needs to get over yourself. Rude.

       Hey folks, for fucks sake, the OP was about the one sided nature of the conversation on Reddit, not the result of the grand jury itself...Actually, the OP never said they are upset with result. They never said they thought Wilson was guilty or Brown was innocent...

       What I fail to see mentioned amidst the arguments over guilt or innocence is the fact that Officer Darren Wilson is not a judge nor a jury. Whether or not Michael Brown was a piece of shit thug or an unarmed citizen caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, he deserves a trial for the jury to decide guilt or innocence. And even if Michael Brown had been found guilty of strong arming a store clerk, I seriously doubt this would've been a case eligible for the death penalty. 
In all of the comments I read on reddit or Facebook,  the argument is always whether or not the officer is guilty or not. In this respect,  TPTB have won with their divide and conquer tactics. Guilt/innocence,  black/white. It becomes conversation based on ideology instead of moral code.  In this case,  the officer played the part of judge, jury and executioner. Therefore IMHO, this is a case of Police brutality and misconduct and should be treated as such. Whatever happened to bring them back alive? ?

       I tend to gauge the general opinion of the real people around me and in general I agree much of the time the opinion here does not line up. In this case I do see the american public being fooled. The real life sentiment genuinely is that this guy had every right to shoot a man because "he felt threatened". If every cop who felt threatened shot the offender nobody anybody would make it out alive. Drawing and shooting a person should not be a cops first instinct. He
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       not to carry his non-lethal weapons. He had options and intentionally left himself without them.

       You have a source for him choosing not to carry a non lethal?

      <p>
       secondly, Brown reached for the gun. The officer put his finger in the trigger hole. Brown was trying to force the officer to squeeze the trigger into the officers leg. You expect Wilson to grab a stun gun while he tried to wrestle control with Brown?

       He testified that he won't carry a stun gun because it's "too uncomfortable" and he "didn't think mace would work". Yes, I do believe using a stun gun should have been his gut reaction, not pulling a gun out at an
       <em>
        unarmed
       </em>
       person standing outside his window. He claims he felt so threatened due to the terrible "beating" he got and had to defend himself at any cost.  Brown isn't the one who brought the gun into the equation, Wilson unholstered it and shot Brown after his "beating". After Brown backed off and away from the car Wilson then shot him as Brown ran away, turned back around, and "charged" Wilson when he got out of the car. He had the opportunity to use non-lethal force but he didn't. If our collective police force continues to consider lethal force a valid use against unarmed people then we are headed to a far shittier place than we already are. The sad part is this is still after giving Wilson the benefit of the doubt that his story was true and he still fucked it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Wilson maintained "total control" of his gun after it was "unholstered", according to his own

       In his testimony, Officer Wilson told jurors that
       <strong>
        Mr. Brown had grabbed his gun while the two scuffled at the vehicle
       </strong>
       . Feeling threatened, Officer Wilson said, he fired the gun twice, once striking Mr. Brown in the hand and leaving blood splattered inside the vehicle. Asked why he did not use a Taser stun gun, the officer said he found them unwieldy and did not have one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you are saying is that the Cop should have just let Brown shoot him. Pretty usless police force if you allow criminals to shoot them don’t you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun is a powerful tool and yet where it is holstered on a person is the area that is most protected. you reach in that direction you are deemed a threat and understandably so.

       Wilson admitted
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       withdrew his gun, not Brown. Instead of having the opportunity to use a non-lethal stun gun on a huge guy who was too quickly approaching his vehicle he decided his only option was to pull out a gun, in close quarters to a man he felt had just "beat him" and was already overpowering him. He shot him in the hand, Brown backed off. He had yet another opportunity to use a stun gun while Brown's back was turned as he was walking away but
       <em>
        didn't

       until he claims Brown charged at his car again. Again, all of this assumes that Brown's testimony is correct and Johnson's testimony that Brown gave up is not true. Nobody will ever know.

       no Wilson was opening his door and that's when Brown bum rushed him to slam the door shut. Mace would have affected him and Brown. The shots angered Brown who Furiously swung and grazed Wilson. Wilson said that he felt if Brown got one good punch in he could have incapiticated Wilson. Brown fled on foot and Wilson pursued and did not shoot until Brown charged him like a bull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown grabbed the officer's gun while they were scuffling. That is an invitation to get shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Brown behaved like a threat, the officer did what he was trained to do and use his weapon to defend himself and the community.

       Your narrative is false and indefensible in light of the evidence. Let it go. You were lied to by the media and you let your emotions dictate your thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       things I noticed back in august:
1. people confused teenager with kid. which is why the media carefully chose that word. to rile up the masses to gain ratings. (he was a man)
2. the pictures used by the mass media were of when Brown was 13 at chuck e cheese. further deception
3. anyone that tried to explain that it was possible that Brown did try and reach for the gun, or anyone even entertaining Wilson's side were immediately deemed racists by other redditors. (similar to when people question immigration policy.)
4. Some people out there felt Wilson should have just sat there and let Brown kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read the eyewitness testimony and Wilson’s. I have looked at the autopsy report as well. The evidence corroborates with Wilson’s side of events, hence no indictment.

       I am using the official testimony from court documents, not media reports. I'm not sure how you think Brown would kill him. He was unarmed and backed off after being shot. Wilson only shot him when he walked back towards him. He had plenty of opportunity to use non-lethal weapons but he didn't because carrying a stun gun would be too uncomfortable. At the very beginning of the testimony he admitted he didn't go on the robbery call because he didn't have the proper gear but suddenly he can? He messed up. Let it go. It doesn't mean he's a racist murderer it just means he is at the very least an incompetent rookie.

       Yes it should have been part of the equation once Brown bum-rushed to slam the car door on Wilson. Brown attacked Wilson. Then Brown tried to get the gun from Wilson then he tried to get Wilson to shoot himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown ran away and the cop, fulfilling his duty as an officer of the law gave chase. It was when Brow charged at Wilson that shot again.
      </p>
      <p>
       A critical point you seem to overlook, was that Brown attacked the cop. The cop, being a cop is going to do cop like things.

       Cop like things shouldn't involve a gun as a first option. You seem to be overlooking the stun gun issue. Brown was unarmed. He didn't even hint at or act as though he had one because he didn't. He walked away. Why was he not stunned at that point? Wilson should not have waited for him to turn around and come back to make shooting him "necessary". Again, shooting should not be the first course of action.

       Officer Wilson had the option of carrying a stun gun. He chose not to have one because it was awkward. awkward tool equals awkward use which equals less effective or not effective at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       there have been deaths as a result of stun guns and of course that famous case in which a BART officer confused his tazer (which was shaped like a gun) with his real gun and shot and killed a young black man as he was handcuffed on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shooting is always the first course of action when another person is trying to incapacitate you.
      </p>
      <p>
       those two shots in his hand and arm did nothing but enrage Brown further. Imagine how useless a stun gun would have been (a 300 lb man mind you) Rodeny King was stunned and it did nothing.

       If he found it awkward then perhaps he was in need of better training. Brown was not trying to incapacitate him Wilson when he was
       <strong>
        walking
       </strong>
       <strong>
        away

       He had the option. Permission by the police department. Its much easier to wield a handgun because it is more intuitive to the human body and its contours versus other tools. No amount of training will compensate for awkward postures. You are not a cop. You are not in the police force. You have zero experience in these matters but yet you continue to state your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown rushed and slammed the door on the cop. Brow didn’t walk away, he ran. cops pursue you once you attack them,. They would fail their duties if they did not. The cop shot Brown when Brown charged at him.

       you are delusional if you think the cop should have just let a suspect run. you are delusional to think that you know how to handle situation better than a trained officer. The world isn't as fucked up as you think it is. The media just narrates it as such to get more ratings. How many people watch the riots? It made great TV!

       Cops protect me from idiots. cops protect me from ignorant masses. Cops protect me from malicious people. The power of the police prevents a lot of bull shit from going down. many people are not good at heart. Most people don't steal because they fear they will be caught. That is the truth.

       You're right, it should not be really the first reaction, but the reality is..  Many cops are now culturally scared shitless of this generation of youth an extremely scared of the black youth. They know it's often a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation.  These cops will never admit to it because many times this can and was in this case attempted to be leveraged against law rookie enforcement officers.  Officer Wilson appears at first glance to me fresh out of training and an might be an easy target to some.  Should Mr. Brown had been successful in his attack he would certainly have gain a notable reputation among his local thug peers.

       In a this struggle, mace could have splashed into the officers eyes and disabled his sight, to the advantage of his opponent.  Police are often sent into some hellish situations with great risk to themselves.  The only time I really have problems with cops and guns is when they start shooting and wound/kill random bystanders.  (which has happened and certainly could have happened in Ferguson.)

       My impression is that law enforcement need to have gun cameras and cameras on their uniforms. Much of this speculation and discussion on the manner he was shot could be resolved with recording of the event. Even if the camera were not pointed directly at the victim the audio would be evidence for the manner of the arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually do believe the shooting was justified. But this not always the case and the evidence needs to be there to protect both the victims and police.

       Cameras will never happen, for one reason: older wealthier people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops are a local or state function.  You know who votes in local or state elections?  Older, wealthier, people.  Young and poor people never do.  Who thinks cops are generally doing a good job and trustworthy?  Older, wealthier, people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is zero incentive to put cameras on cops because there is no demand from the voter.

       Edit: I suppose one symbol is a pretty bad comment. The money made by police departments and private prisons from throwing people in jail as well profit from fines, tickets, etc. would be a lot less if police had cameras and were more accountable for their actions. That was the intention from my snarky "$" comment, not that it would cost the police too much money.

       The front page is absolutely insane. Extremely racist things upvoted with 3000 upvotes. Nothing explaining either side, just "hurr durr they looting, damn black people why don't they learn some manners"
      </p>

       Completely neglecting context, or their reasoning for doing all this. Alongside there's posts about how great and attractive and cool the police are.

       Reddit seems to function much like media in that way. Used to steer the masses in whatever direction is most convenient, preferably against each other. And it usually seems to be those less willing or capable of research and understanding of facts with the loudest positions. And anyone who even says "what if" is a conspiracy theorist and immediately bashed and downvoted out of existence. Or blocked. Or banned.

        may have seemed like a shot in the dark and merely throwing around empty accusations to some people in the past, but every thread about Ferguson is blatantly and ridiculously filled with one-sentence comments containing no facts, just cheering on the decision to not indict.

       It's getting worse and worse as the day progresses with vile, racist comments getting the most upvotes in many popular places here along with incendiary posts against Brown and his family while all along giving the cop and the rest of the police a pass.  Assumptions that the prosecutor is right, the cops are right even with all their lies and highly suspicious behavior on their part.  A focus like a fucking laser on the few violent protestors while ignoring the majority that were peaceful and were under attack by the police even in areas that were sanctioned as safe protest areas.

       Bad faith for blacks, good faith for white cops and authorities is the meme of the day for Reddit.

       I'm seriously thinking Stormfront along with other racist extremists, etc. have taken over Reddit at this point via brigading.  At least, that's my hope.  Because if this racist drivel that's rising to the top like pieces of shit in a toilet bowl represents Reddit, then Reddit is truly infested with fucking morons who cannot critically think their ways out of wet paper bags and have a deep-seated loathing for blacks in America.

       you are the one that is corrupt and gamed sir, above is the evidence that was presented, given that evidence officer wilson did not qualify to be indicted on any of the charges as they currently read in the state of missouri. i am soo sick of people acting like the system is unfair. the system, is unbiased, fact based and just.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that michael brown a 6'5 300lb 18 y.o. adult, commited a robbery assaulted a clerk, resisted an officers command to get out of the street, attacked the officer in his car, tried to grab at the officers weapon, ran away, only to turn back and try to reengage the officer while the officer was telling him to stop or he will shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       are we suppose to feel bad for this guy because he was shot, would you not expect to get shot in that situation? your comment of corruption and gaming is a blatant show of ignorance about the judicial system, the process of trial by jury and is honestly disrespectful to the officers who put their life on the line every time they wear the badge. the commentary around this death should not be how police officers should improve but rather how people should listen to officers commands and not put themselves in positions where the guy with the gun feels like his life is threatened.

       is suppose to be based on challenging the truth when facts call that truth into question, this is not one of those times and in fact is exactly the opposite, this is media sensationalism that does not match the physical evidence nor eye witness accounts of the event. Put yourself in the shoes of the officer being attacked by a 6'5 300 lb man that is grabbing at your gun and tell me you would not react in the same way

       I think this is what gets to me the most. Wilson’s life is so devalued by many that he didn’t have the right to defend himself. Or he should have been injured more.

       The whole situation is very tragic.

       I am not a shill.  I have gone through the evidence and it has convinced me that in this particular case the perp was shot for a good reason.  It was sad that it came to that but the perp made up his own mind that day and he decided he was going to bully a shop keep for drug supplies and then assault a police officer (with the intent to kill) and then refuse to get arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many better cases where the cop was clearly in the wrong but this case is not one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree to the spirit of the protesters because I do believe our police force has become increasingly hostile to citizens in general but violence and rioting are not the answer.  I wish the establishment media would have better disseminated the facts of this case but instead they just played on the popular mob's emotions.

       I wonder if this post is tagged for a single digit score ceiling. When I first cast my upvote on this post
       <strong>
        (8:13am)
       </strong>
       there were 0 total votes, after I cast my vote it went up to a score of 1, but there were suddenly 3 upvotes and 2 downvotes. I think this post will end up proving the OP's point.

       I will have to keep an eye on the voting on this.

       I have spent this last month, since just before Election Day, watching the voting patterns here and collecting a LOT of evidence on how it all works. I have seen vote shaving over and over again and spent more time than what would be considered normal watching posts and voting patterns, so I am not making these claims of voting manipulation without  providing proof of what I  am saying. Look through my comment history if you need to, I have made many posts this month on reddit vote manipulation.

       As far as reddit becoming the MSM, I think that speaks for itself, and Zionist ownership of Condè Nast is public record and has been posted in this sub more than once.

       The word "MSM" is unreliable, lazy and borderline useless because everyone has their own definition of it and it's generally used to discredit something without actually having to go to the trouble of discrediting it. What I'm getting at above is the seeming inability for comments here to get five steps outside the door without blaming things on Tel Aviv. I'm no great fan of Israel recently but I find it difficult to accept that there is as much going on in the service of a Jewish homeland as this subreddit alleges, often without sources or logic. I imagine the Jewish state would have havinga  less difficult time of it were this the case.

       Because he underwent a lot of (completely warranted) criticism for constantly mentioning 9/11 even when there was no eartthly reason. The same I believe goes for some posters here mentioning a certain religion whenever possible. It distracts from whatever they were trying to say and makes eeryone look an awful lot worse.

       Ironically, the intelligent redditors, who understand compassion, justice, and that don't practice fascism, are the one's that know the Darren Wilson is innocent.
      </p>

       The people claiming police state, police brutality, "he was shot because he was black," etc., are the reactionary ones.
       <em>
        They're
       </em>
       the self-righteous ass-hats, the ones that won't admit that maybe, possibly, race didn't come into play here, and this was actually a case where someone was defending themselves against an attacker which, mind you, transcends race. If someone were attacking me, I'd defend myself. I wouldn't stop defending myself if they were black, because later on someone might say "you only felt threatened because they were black." Hell no, I'd defend myself using any tool necessary and wouldn't rule out killing someone else if it meant defending myself or any innocent party around me at the time. Race doesn't come into play in that situation -
       <em>
        survival
       </em>
       is all that matters. Fight or flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that continue to harp on the race card and police brutality are the ones pushing the racist agenda. They need to stop. There are thousands, literally thousands, of cases where police brutality
       <em>
        does actually occur
       </em>
       , and these people need to focus
       <em>
        on those cases

       No one has proven to me that Wilson is innocent. We haven't been given the chance to put him on trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police are brutal. They just don't want to acknowledge it. They want to back citizens into a corner, and justify police violence under a mask of self defense against actors of non-violent crimes (MO state, and federal law gives wide latitude to police officers to use deadly force in self-defense) instead of carrying out a basic arrest. In other words most cops will resort to aggravating a suspect to the level of violence, instead of simply apprehending the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       MO also has a law that enables police to enact deadly force, giving them a license to kill in any arrest situation: Chapter 563 of the Missouri Revised Statutes. So the law puts the judgement upon them to judge whether or not a person is guilty, before even getting to trial. No premise for innocence before proven guilt. Just kill them first, and assume they were deserving of a death penalty for breaking any law.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        on-duty police officers committed 3 percent of all homicides last year (2013)
       </li>
       <li>
        in 2012 a study found that "a black person was killed by a police officer, security guard or self-appointed vigilante every twenty-eight hours"
       </li>
       <li>
        2013 had the highest number of "justifiable homicides" by law enforcement in the past two decades was 461.
       </li>
       <li>
        Homicides committed by on-duty law enforcement make up 3 percent of the 14,196 homicides committed in the United States
       </li>
       <li>
        FBI data reports that there an average of 96 police homicides a year involving a white officer shooting a black person.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So I'm willing to bet if anyone has to be defensive in a violent manner, it's either because they've intentionally put themselves in that position and are incapable of diffusing a situation. Good cops (or people in general) don't put themselves or others in danger, regardless of the situation.

      <p>
       You can't in good consciousness make that generalization. "Good cop" is a subjective term, and you can't 100% verify that Wilson was a "bad cop" or a "good cop" without knowing him personally and/or having spoken/dealt with him at least once in your life.

       Or it could be because the general public has made a which hunt out of their character. Screaming for someone's blood will put that someone on the defensive. That's what we're seeing here.

       So...like...what was the whole thing with the grand jury indictment? It's not enough for you that a grand jury found Wilson innocent?

      <p>
       EDIT: And I like that you put up some statistics. Not many people do that. Here's the thing though: You can't say, "this thing has happened a lot, so it probably happened again." You can't automatically determine Wilson's guilt or innocent with statistics. That's what the justice system is for. If he was found guilty, then his case would be added to those statistics after the fact.

       You're right I don't know Wilson or his intentions. For that matter I don't know whether or not he is guilty. Based on what information I am given, he lives in a justice void. To me he's neither a good or bad cop. He's just a cop that killed someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a with hunt at all. He wasn't even put on trial. A grand jury deciding on whether or not to indict is not a criminal trial. We were never given the benefit of knowing what his intent was in gunning down Brown. If people are upset over this decision, then it is in their right to be. What are you going to do defend yourself against people speaking out against their perceptions of injustice?
      </p>
      <p>
       I reiterate a grand jury does not decide innocence or guilt ("A grand jury is a legal body that is empowered to conduct official proceedings to investigate potential criminal conduct and to determine whether criminal charges should be brought."). By law a grand jury cannot decide on any evidence other than testimony in the hearing. If Wilson is innocent, then why not just go to court and let the evidence speak for it. A trial doesn't necessarily mean he will face a conviction.

       That's just plain not true. You've got a jury of 12 people, and you've got evidence present. It's ridiculous to think that, provided BOTH testimony and evidence, a human being wouldn't have their decision making process influenced by both. Like, a typical human being wouldn't

       evidence

       Well you can't control what citizens do in reaction to injustice. The repercussions of a faulty legal system, and laws that allow police to escape a criminal trial, expressing to everyone in this country that police are above the law, will lead to people being aggravated with an unjust system. You can try to twist any which way, but the fact of the matter is people will do these things when pushed to the edge of injustice. I don't condone it, but it's happened, and the authorities knew it. This is a failure of the police to deal with their community. Instead of working with the community, they would rather look for a fight showing up in riot gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no witch to be hunted. If this many people are upset over something, and want blood for Wilson's actions, then there is something systemically wrong with the institution of policing in this country. People don't get angry at this scale for no reason at all. I think its a simple solution really, that if you don't want to aggravate society, then live by the laws and codes of that society, rather than reject it, and label them violent and angry. Cops need to understand that they are just as much a part of that failure as the community itself. If they were truly concerned about the letter of the law they would embrace that, and find ways to resolve this violence without using a gun, and showing up in riot gear. Cops are leaders of the community. They should start acting like it! If anyone is doing the hunting it's white cops shooting black teenagers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grand juries do not decide innocence or guilt. It is put in place to decide whether a crime was even committed. So what I said may not be fully true, but the evidence is not required to prove innocence or guilt, as that's not the mission of a grand jury.

       for a fight, they were exercising being prepared because the fight came to them - as is evidenced by the now 20+ local businesses that have been burned to the ground. The police didn't do that - the populace did. And they had no reason to. They don't get an excuse to cause that much damage because they're pissed at a faulty legal system. If they're pissed about it, they'd act to promote change instead of furthering their own stereotypes.

       This is what I don't understand. Wilson didn't do anything personal to any one of these protesters. Brown's family deserves to be pissed, because their own son got killed. But the individuals protesting in the streets weren't "pushed to the edge," because no one did anything to them. You can argue about "white cop killed a black guy, that's a problem for the whole black race!" all you want, but (1) the crime wasn't racially motivated, it was self defense and (2) no, it's a problem for the one individual that got shot and no one else.

       It's a first-past-the-post situation: If a grand jury indicts the dude, then a criminal court will determine if it was a willful crime or an ignorant crime - IE, aggravated murder, or manslaughter. If a grand jury decides NOT to indict, then it means that the dude's innocent, and no further inquiry is decided.

       This anger is a response to constant abuse. I'm sure there is a very bad relationship between police and residence of Ferguson. That's why we have cops fighting with perps in the street. If this was a case of a healthy relationship, and community oriented police department, then diffusing a situation by simply talking with people works. Apprehending a suspect is nothing more than cuffing and putting a suspect in the cruiser. So, I am sorry to say that this is more than just one person's mistreatment, it is a systemic failure of police being able to work with their community. I'm not arguing white or black here, you keep bringing it up. It could be white-on-white for all I care, the mere fact that a white cop killed a black kid is evident in the fact that that is what happened. I don't care whether or not it was racially motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grand juries do not decide innocence or guilt. Again I will reiterate, they DO NOT DECIDE INNOCENCE OR GUILT. It is a first-past-post procedure, but it only decides on whether or not a suspect should be indicted on criminal charges. At least that's how I understand it. If it was a court that decide innocence or guilt, then we would have a definable explanation why he received that decision.

       Sure, there were peaceful protesters that were there. I'll agree on that - not everyone is out looking for a fight, or a free tv, or a chance to burn down a local business. It's really sad that the peaceful protesters have to be lumped in with the violent ones. What's even more unfortunate, but due to human nature is true, is that when people picture the Brown protesters in their heads, they're going to see a shop that's been looted, or a building that's on fire. I'm going to argue that it's in these people's hands to control the general populace's image of them. They're choosing to make that image be one of violence, and no one's forcing them to do that. The media isn't twisting their arms into acting the way that will garner more ratings. They're simply providing the violance, and the media is lapping it up. It's in their own hands.

       Look, I'm not going to have this petty debate. My mind is made up. I support these protestors. I feel that a few burning cars and buildings (which insurance will replace) will never equate to the taking of a presumed innocent person's life, and the person who took that life facing a complete public trial. I feel that cops in this country get away with too much violence, especially violence we never see on TV or in the news. The police in Ferguson, and anywhere else in this country should take more responsibility for their actions. They should answer for them just like everyone else has to, when faced with it. If Wilson is not guilty, then indict him and let him go to trial to prove that he didn't intend to kill Brown. As it stands I'm not convinced that he is innocent. This sets a precedence for any cop out there that when it comes down to that moment when he has that finger on his trigger, and makes the judgement to take another person's life, that he'll look at this indictment and say "I could get away with it".

       it's wrong to harass people, wrongfully put them in jail or kill them because of the color of their skin or because they do not have a certain amount of money/clout.

       The facts are that every "witness" to the crime completely changed their story once confronted with evidence stating otherwise. So now their statements as to what happened were taken into question. Or how to be dismissed since the witness changed their story more than 3 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the dude best friend was all over national television stating he was shot from behind as he was running away? Problem with that? The evidence showed he was shot from the front and close range. Oh, then his best friend changed his story.

       I'm 300 pages into the 4000+ page report from the grand jury.

       I can honestly say, if I were a prosecutor, I wouldn't try this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like a lot of sloppy work from the testimony of the medical examiner's office in the beginning testimony. If any of the other testimonies in the paper are the same way, there's no reason that officer should have been indicted. Bringing him to trial would have been a lost cause, and he would have gotten off. Remember that he can't be charged with the same crime twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how much more violent this would have been if this went to trial and he was let go from the charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       I blame the MSM for building up people and making people think the office was guilty without actually knowing the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes an unarmed kid was killed, but the facts are there now that paint a different picture. It does anger me that this happened, but it's the media that's driving a wedge in race relations in this country. People need to wake up to that.

       if you commit a crime you should be treated as a criminal, if you attack a police officer you have the possibility of getting shot, thats not a police state that is how the world works, i understand people feel tlike cops abuse their power but in this circumstance this was not the case and we honestly shouldnt be fearful of a police state unless you are committing crimes. its the old notion of cause and effect, if noone committed violent crimes in these neighborhoods there would be no reason to have militarized police equipped to fight the violent crime. best way to solve the problem is to stop the gang culture and violence that creates these police states in the first place, not to tell officers that they no longer have the right to defend themselves

       what a ridiculous argument.  it's clear that the flooding of inner cities with drugs and the compliance of DEA was done in the name of all citizens, so it's the black people's fault too.  they didn't string these fuckers up by the neck when they should have - they fell for the same shit we all did.

       yea im not sure what the goal of dea drug smuggling is, not sure if we will ever know, but given this type of mess are free thinking humans, they still hold some accountability for their actions, unlike unconscious rubble. but yes good analogy to an extent

       The inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their mobility, and on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may be exerted by means of a secret police force which operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state.

       The really sad thing here is not the trial or the riots, but the system of welfare and negative encouragement that has allowed not only the police state to run rampant but the people rioting have been supported like the nation's pet on welfare and on propaganda. This is only going to happen more. Remember when black people had respect for their communities and each other and even their owners? That was before the welfare state. These people aren't going to appreciate what they didn't have to work for. They don't understand the value of anything. The police state isn't going to go away because they need to deal with the restlessness of the malcontents that the state has created. Welfare for the police, welfare for the criminals, tax the law-abiding middle-class and destroy a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find these riots to be a riot. They amuse me. The verdict was obvious. The reaction was obvious. The problem is obvious. The world's a stage and I see dramatic irony everywhere.

       Amen.  Look at the "eye witness" testimony the Grand Jury heard:

       "So, although you told the investigators this is what you saw even though you only heard it from someone, you don't feel you lied?"

      <p>
       "I saw Michael Brown on his knees begging for his life as the office stood over him from behind and put a bullet in his head from point blank range."
      </p>
      <p>
       "And, given that the forensic evidence tells us otherwise, there's nothing about that testimony you would like to change?"

       The system was served, not justice.  The system is a self protecting lie based on layers of conflicting bullshit, exactly like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Supreme Court defined citizenship as "A member of a body politic owing a duty of allegiance in exchange for a duty of protection; these are reciprocal obligations." (Luria vs. U.S. paragraph thirteen) This means that they owe me a duty of protection if it's to be a meaningful relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       --BUT--
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a lie, since the supreme court has ruled government has no duty to protect:

       Let's take color out of the picture. There is one race we are all humans. 14 witnesses were interviewed for the grand jury. Those 12 people decided that based on testimony that there was not enough evidence to charge officer Wilson.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Wilson's testimony he stated that he thought about using mace or baton in his car, mace would have incapacitated both parties and Brown had a friend with him. Also brown is 90lbs larger then the officer.

       We don't have all facts on what happened that day but at the end of all this we should be demanding cameras on our LEOS. It protects all parties involved stop race baiting think of the fact that our police force is getting more and more violent and it's the citizens word against theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's demand reform of all our police forces to prevent another person from dying at the hands of our public servants.

       Fucking exactly. In close quarters, you don't use mace. It's suicide. So is using a baton inside of a car. Because the baton is literally longer than the space in front of you, you can't maneuver it in the space provided. It's sad, but a gun is literally the only useful weapon in that scenario.

       Most tasers only work if the suspect is within a foot or two of the officer. It would have been impractical if the suspect was a few yards away but charging you at high speed - Brown would have reached Wilson and tackled him before he had a chance to use the taser.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's two types of tasers: One type needs to be used with direct contact, and the other actually shoots prongs a yard or two in front of it. The second type is wildly inaccurate and the first type requires a direct confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it could be argued that, if anything, Wilson could have used his taser while Brown was leaning into his police cruiser window. Instead, Wilson didn't use
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       weapon while inside his cruiser - the two shots that went off were because Brown was reaching for Wilson's gun and there was a struggle - it's reasonable to assume that a few shots are going to go off if two people are struggling to get a handle on a gun, and it doesn't imply intent on Wilson's behalf to shoot Brown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, it could be argued that using a taser would have been a really stupid idea once Wilson managed to get out of his cruiser, because of the reasons I've already stated.

       The problem is nice/innocent people who are brutalized by cops don't go out and make a media storm when something happens to them because they are nice people and they don't make a fuss.

       It's only the bad ones who do.  So whenever something like this comes up that hits at a legitimate issue it inevitably has bad facts that discredits it.

       There's this effort to make us believe that technology and corporations are bringing us together--toward some sort of ideological singularity. But that's not true, we have actual face-to-face work to do in order to advance to the next meaningful stage of humanity, but since that can't be trademarked or made into intellectual property, that isn't the reality they want us to believe.

       Additionally, most people come to reddit to feel good about whatever opinions they hold and happily steamroll over anything that challenges those opinions. That fact alone makes sites like these a horrifyingly dangerous weapon against thought and progress.

       There are quite a few in those threads repeating that the whole thing was corrupt. Some still ignoring all the evidence but only what they agree with.

       I'd bet the majority of Reddit is completely against the brute force tactics used by the police. Once you understand Reddits user base, you know which comments would never see a positive vote count, let alone gain top comment status. I've seen countless topics obviously being gamed. Reddit has literally turned into one enormous Cass Sunstein social engineering experiment.

       I've been reviewing and searching for patterns. There's no signal coherence on this one. What I've seen is that people are just generally disapproving of the Brown family and their behavior.

       The plight of Ferguson may be real but when things manifest like this, they need solidarity on the tipping point. The reality of the situation is that solidarity for this cannot emerge because these are irrational behaviors by the persons in charge of raising the victim. They strongly suggest that there is reason to suspect the 6'4 290lbs Michael Brown was violent and behaving threateningly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        -EDIT-
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify why they suggest this: both key role models defer to sincere and real violence in response to anger. This is a major red flag in interpreting psychology of a person from that environment. We aren't talking about clocking someone in the face in outrage. We're talking about hospitalizing someone with a metal pipe, acts of arson and robbery. These things are not even circumstantially acceptable reactions. They are indicative of a toxic environment in which Michael Brown was raised. The echoes of which are visible in his temperament in the video of his robbing the convenience store shortly before being shot. Michael Brown was very clearly not nervous, desperate or frightened. He was empowered and unconcerned with the fact he was very obviously being recorded committing a crime. Whether this was due to ignorance of the consequences or a lack of belief in their manifestation is debatable. What is not debatable is that this man was comfortable with violence and demonstratively aggressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       When analyzing for signal coherence you should look to see that things keep on message, repeated keywords, reinforcing a central idea. The patterns of sentence structure will be similar, even if artificial grammatical errors are introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example of clear patterning and signal coherence, please refer to the Sochi Olympics discussions. They contain strong patterns that echo from the top down with signal coherence on messaging.

       too lenient with those rioters. I think a lot of the people on reddit who were raised to be liberal and tolerant are simply getting sick of the shit blacks are doing to this country, and supporting the police in this case is just a really easy way for them to express that sentiment.

       You've got to be fucking kidding me. People should be sick of what banksters, politicians, corporate jack offs and the police are doing to this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being "sick of the shit blacks are doing to this country" is how people are being played by the powers I just mentioned. Perhaps people that are "sick of the shit blacks are doing to this country" are utterly ignorant of the Hegelian dialectic. Just a guess.

       I absolutely think more cops should be held accountable for their abuse. I even think they should be punished more severely for their crimes than civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This event is not part of that, because Wilson was just doing his job -- and setting a bunch of privately owned cars and businesses on fire doesn't really fucking hold any cops accountable, now does it?

       If the cops shot my kid down, lied about it openly and then the cop escaped justice, I'd probably say the same. Why does the public have to be more civilized than the animals that run government and their enforcers?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At several points in his testimony, Wilson made statements that a motivated prosecutor would have aggressively pursued. For example: *
        <em>
         Wilson – who at 6’4” and 210 pounds is no small man – said that when he grappled with Brown, he felt like a “five-year-old” who was trying to restrain “Hulk Hogan.” *
        </em>
        He likewise claimed that he had been struck twice by Brown with such force that he was concerned a third blow would be “fatal” – yet the medical examination displayed no evidence of corresponding trauma to his face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wilson didn’t explain how the right-handed Michael Brown could have punched the right side of his face while the officer was sitting in the driver’s side of his vehicle. Although Wilson claimed that the initial blows were inflicted while Brown was holding stolen cigarillos in his right hand, no broken cigars were ever recovered, either in the SUV or the surrounding area. The stolen cigars were not found by the medical examiner who arrived on the scene after the shooting. (Interestingly, that examiner never took photos of the deceased, because “My battery in my camera died,” nor did he take any measurements at the crime scene.)

       So you don't think Wilson should have gone to trial and been cross-examined? 12 bullets into an unarmed man with witness testimony in direct conflict to the Wilson's version of events (remember, Brown never gets to tell his side of the story) and you don't think he should have gone before a jury at a trial?

       Actually I just want a trial where we can hear from 2 sides of the argument, not one side of a grand jury where the evidence was presented in a way that puts the victim on trial and attempts to clear the shooter because the prosecutor is closely allied on a professional and personal level with the police department where the shooter happens to work. A case presented by a county prosecutor who should have recused himself.

       The Grand Jury was literally just given all the evidence, and they came up with the decision to not indict from that.

       Ive read it, and I have all the pics.  There is a little red mark on his cheek, and a red mark on the back of his neck.  The kind of mark you get when you fall asleep on a desk or sit with your face in your hands for too long.
       <br/>
       My point here, is that your original story of the 300lb black child pummeling the cop unmercifully then charging at him raging with adrenaline is not represented in these photos.  There simply is not enough information to make a call, and any attempt to do so is going to be influenced by emotion and assumptions.  The only thing concrete in this case is that there is a lack of evidence to prove the cop acted unlawfully. Its upsetting to know that a police officer can get away with murder based on a technicality, but this is where we are right now.

       Your opinion, good sir, does not qualify as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the "facts" of the case. This highly unusual and poorly handled grand jury proceeding has already raised questions about what facts were presented and how. It is also very curious how this particular prosecutor has now brought five (5) cases before a grand jury where civilians were killed by police and now, for the fifth time, he has failed to get an indictment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much more fact-finding to be had outside of the secret meetings held by the morally and professionally compromised District Attorney's secret trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, for your own mental health and public rapport, think on this before you continue with such inflammatory statements with matter-of-fact conviction.

       So, to wrap up this little parlay, a summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) I ask you 2 simple questions
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Do you believe in a reproductive separation of the races to preserve european-descendant superiority?
       </li>

        Question - Do you understand the logical implications to the former question, given that there is far greater intra-racial variance than inter-racial variance?

       2.) You immediately deploy a "non-contextual" reason for not answering the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) I acknowledge it's not 100% contextual, but that we're in a thread talking about race, and I want to hear you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) You immediately accuse me of "attacking your character" when clearly I'm not (this is called self-victimization, in the event you like to label your cognitive biases.)
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) I abide your demand to PM you with my original 2 questions, anddd you ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why won't you answer the questions? Is it b/c it contradicts your worldview and you lack the intellectual toolset to rebut?

       You shouldn't makes assumptions based on text.  Your assuming I am flustered about self defense?  Now I am flustered because some asshole on reddit is telling me how I think and how I feel.     Your english comprehension skills need a hell of a lot of work if you think I was flustered because I emphasized a word with quotations.   Can you tell I am """""""""flustered now"""""""""?  Is it a reasonable response when some know it all starts telling you how you think and how you feel.     I think so because I do not care who the fuck you are you do not get to tell me what to think and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You come on here not to contribute to the conversation but to attack me. I can only guess you are not very manly considering how you hyper analyze REDDIT POSTS so you can discern other peoples emotions (piss poor job you do by the way) and confront them about them.   Get off your high horse and read a little about what happen because it is clear as day you know nothing that is going on in ferguson or self defense.   The only thing you seem to know is how to be a pretentious snob.   So kindly fuck off and worry about yourself.

       I am using the official testimony from court documents, not media reports. I'm not sure how you think Brown would kill him. He was unarmed and backed off after being shot. Wilson only shot him when he walked back towards him. He had plenty of opportunity to use non-lethal weapons but he didn't because carrying a stun gun would be too uncomfortable. At the very beginning of the testimony he admitted he didn't go on the robbery call because he didn't have the proper gear but suddenly he can? He messed up. Let it go. It doesn't mean he's a racist murderer it just means he is at the very least an incompetent rookie.

       Cop like things shouldn't involve a gun as a first option. You seem to be overlooking the stun gun issue. Brown was unarmed. He didn't even hint at or act as though he had one because he didn't. He walked away. Why was he not stunned at that point? Wilson should not have waited for him to turn around and come back to make shooting him "necessary". Again, shooting should not be the first course of action.

       You're exposing your ignorance yet again.  The autopsy showed he was shot in the head,
       <strong>
        twice
       </strong>
       .

       Try again.  This basically makes the rest of your post kind of moot if you still refuse to get even the basics right while laughingly proclaiming I "don't know how bullets work".

       Then you are incredibly out of touch with the reality for minorities in the United States, along with the rampant racial issues in Ferguson.

       That's been a major focus throughout the Ferguson issue and continues today.  Again, you seem very out of touch with reality.  There's been a focus on the very real racial issues and the militarized police response along with plenty of other issues including how the Grand Jury was rigged to fail with incredibly unusual measures that expert lawyers all over the USA have agreed was bizarre.

       So, you do now at least admit you were wrong and he was shot in the head?  That's some progress.

       I'm taking it with a grain of salt considering they say false things like this below within the particular article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "no explanation is offered for why Brown (who weighed around 300 pounds) had been forced by Wilson to have his right hand in a position where it was close to the gun and inside Wilson’s police car."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's false.  Plenty of people have explained that Wilson grabbed Brown to detain him and there was a struggle.  That would most certainly put anyone within close proximity of the officer's weapons, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article leaves out all kinds of damning testimony against Wilson including the fact that Wilson initially lied and said Brown reached for a gun, etc. among other inconsistencies with Wilson's statements along with the police authorities.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was right that there is significant reason for them to be 130 feet from Wilson's cruiser.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you've watched too many action movies if you think those shots to his body were superficial and, therefore, you think it's much more believable that Brown went for a healthy jog towards certain death at the officer after being shot multiple times instead of the eyewitness accounts that said that after the first volley of shots he stumbled forward only a short distance with his hands out in surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, the blood splatter evidence corroborates these witnesses as well.  The problem is the entire Grand Jury proceeding was set up to ignore and disparage those witnesses and focus on anyone and anything that supported the cop even if that meant massaging the truth and conveniently "forgetting" the previous lies on the cop's part where he changed his story.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Also, it turns out that the reason most believe that Brown charged Wilson is due to the account of a racist
       </strong>

       Yes, Grand Jury... and our next witness that's against Brown and in support for a white officer is the KKK.  Nothing to see here, just listen to these "unbiased" people and take it to heart, Grand Jury.  Yep, and justice will be served... somehow....
      </p>

       And, of course,
       <strong>
        NEVER FUCKING MIND
       </strong>
       the construction workers in a video shot immediately after the incident who were already describing the event they'd just witnessed minutes before and said (and even motioned) to show that Brown had his god damn fucking hands up.

       Strangely enough, that corroborates the other witnesses except that of a lone, fucking racist that magically saw Brown "charge" like an animal instead.

      <p>
       But, yeah, believe that fucking racist who constantly refers to blacks as niggers instead.  Makes perfect, fucking sense.

       Yeah, OK, now I
