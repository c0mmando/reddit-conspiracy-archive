<p>As I don&#39;t know much about computers, would it be possible for someone to trace your reddit account and then use the location you are posting from to do a reverse search and find your email account/facebook/bank website, etc....</p>

<p>I know, I should have taken a screenshot of the FB hack, I didn&#39;t, but it happened. I had to change my password and it said my account was logged into from an unknown location and the map showed a pin in Iraq.</p>

<p>I am sure my &quot;mischief&quot; has gotten me flagged on this site. Maybe my IP was passed on to a some other department under the guise of &quot;Homeland Security&quot;.</p>

<p>I am not doing anything other than questioning the circlejerk narratives of 2 subreddits. Click on my username and you will see what I post if you are interested.</p>

<p>Same here. I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. Sometimes I wonder if people living &quot;in country&quot; actually hold back on what they&#39;re saying because they&#39;re worried about potential repercussions.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder about what things might be like 10 or 20 years from now. I can honestly imagine people ending up in court and having their past online comment history used against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally right. I think people underestimate the power of the subconscious. If you feel threatened to speak your mind because you think people are listening, then you will hold back without even being aware of it. This fundamentally changes the things that you allow yourself to think and even the <strong>way</strong> that you think, the entire process. </p>

<p>Then you get out, and you realize how caged in you were before. Now your thoughts can fly out as they please. And that changes everything about you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do remember a post a few days ago about a guy who tracked his IP to iraq (can&#39;t remember if it was FB or reddit, but I definitely remember it was tracked back to Iraq because people were mentioning maybe there is a US military base there). Maybe it&#39;s the same guy?  If I find the thread i&#39;ll post it back here.</p>
