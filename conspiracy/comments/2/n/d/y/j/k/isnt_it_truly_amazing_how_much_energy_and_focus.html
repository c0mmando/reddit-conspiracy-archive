       This specific topic I am starting is a thought-exercise, so if you do not want to entertain it for the sake of conversation, then please go somewhere else.

       Is your thought exercise merely to ponder the existence of shills astroturfing specific views on reddit (promoting some, deleting/votegaming others), a site that has a massive amount of uniques daily?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would be hard pressed to find any legitimate users here who would disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe your thought exercise is to take this to its
       <em>
        logical conclusion
       </em>
       , and state that this is indeed the purpose of reddit (now), while it was just a cute geeky link aggregator initially.

       I've noticed some interesting things. Consider
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ndqj4/recognizing_palestine_wouldnt_promote_peace_dutch/cmcqxc6?context=3">
        this
       </a>
       from r/worldnews as an example. I posted a comment that basically supported recognition of Palestine and got 11 downvotes in one hour. Not one single rebuttal or even a reply, just downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does that mean? It means Reddit has become part of the battleground. There are those who aren't just interested in having their story heard, they want to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means Reddit has become part of the battleground. No bullets, no blood... but definitely a struggle to influence or even control your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means shills hanging out in various sensitive subs. It also means vote manipulation and targeted deletion of user submissions on sensitive topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a lowly individual who is neither an admin or a mod, what can I do? I can at least be aware of what's going on and know that the content I see is being subjected to various influences.

       Here is a little experiment to do to determine if you are being hit by a group of people trying vote game or if your opinion is just in the minority on that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep making similar comments about the same issue even post some links yourself about the same issue.  Do so at different times during the day and night.  Do this for a week or so and see if you get more down votes during certain time of the day.  If that is the case then your comments are most likely getting hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed  on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       that there is huge explosion in what I would call pro-Russian comments around 1:30 pm CST to about 3:00 pm EST.  Then again around  6;00 pm CST to about 8:00 pm CST.  Also the same thing happens in the AM on Saturday and again in the PM on Sunday.  I noticed this because I have been following the Ukrainian and Russian thing for a long time now.

       Bingo. I noticed the exact same thing. Post a comment that favors Palestinian statehood (or criticizes some Israeli policy/action) and in come the downvotes. As the day goes on and it's the middle of the day in USA/Canada (and nightime in Israel) the reaction tends to change. Downvotes stop coming in and it changes over to upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing though. Most people, when they see a comment that has even 3 or 4 downvotes, tend to view the comment in a negative light. "Oh look, other people didn't like this comment and there must be a reason for that even if I can't see what it might be". This is part of a well-known tendency for individuals to conform to the group opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       On reddit, the group opinion can be
       <em>
        implied
       </em>
       by up or downvotes. There are people out there who know thi and that's why they get shill teams to search out comments they don't like and slap them with a few downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a couple of reasons why. One, people start noticing that expressing certain opinions results in downvotes. Two, the people who still express those opinions have their comments voted further down the page where they'll be less visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This results in that same groupthink effect. People see the general trend of the comments for any given article and get a false idea of what most people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mission accomplished.

       Reddit, like the mainstream media in general, is a vortex of truth and lies--but ultimately the details are inconsequential before the invisibility of the great pattern. We, the masses, are not privy to the clairvoyance of the great pattern, which is always before the eyes of our undeclared masters.

       We are witnessing large tanks of gasoline being thrown onto a highly-combustible and controversial subject.

      <p>
       Propaganda is not always used to push specific information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strongest propaganda is designed to drive people into a frenzy and bring out their flawed and aggressive animalistic nature. This is how wars start.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you bring out the animal in people, they tend to cling to nationalism, or race, or religion. Things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are witnessing race at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the propaganda starts about Russia, we are witnessing nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it kicks in about Muslims, we are witnessing religion.

       Exactly, if I were to write a manual on preventing independent thought on web forums, the first thing I would write would be: "Ask a lot of basic questions and make the user waste their energy answering. Play dumb."

       Well that shows how much you know. This tactic has been proven and is part of countless manuals on disrupting online activism.

       Countless. That seems a lot.

      <p>
       Strikes me if someone refuses to answer basic questions on the grounds that the questioner is trying to prevent independent thought, then that someone is in no danger of convincing anyone of anything.

       Since you assume that I am full of shit and "making a post because I am angry that people don't agree with me", then I can only draw the conclusion that that is something YOU would do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I am much more self-aware than that. But I guess you aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyways, what you are saying is absolutely basic. Do you really believe that a large slice of the biggest web forum in history is not being targeted and attacked? One specifically called
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that really your argument? "Hey guise, there is nothing to see here, just a quarter-million people having discussions about controversial subjects. I am sure we are completely alone."
      </p>
      <p>
       And since YOU have come to this grade-school conclusion, I guess it is not difficult to understand why you would base the rest of your opinions on that ridiculous premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hurr, this guy is here and he actually believes the completely anonymous voting scores are being manipulated. He
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       believes that!!! Why would anyone come onto the internet and just lie to us like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I guess in the mind of someone who thinks like that, it makes perfect sense to write "Anyone who disagrees with him".
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a question? Why are you even here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are YOU in this subreddit if you have no desire to look past the most basic explanation. Actually, it is even worse than that. You are actually making comments that take away from the conversation and aggressively try to ridicule the person asking the questions.

       I didn't make a thread about it. I'm not projecting shit, honey.

       You get a life. I wrote 2 sentences in 2 posts and you followed up with an essay assuming a whole slew of bullshit and stuff you made up in your head. You seem mentally unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I post in here frequently and browse this subreddit. You're a joke with that "don't come here if you don't believe every single conspiracy I can imagine herp derp" people are allowed to disagree and think different things, you (someone from this subreddit) should understand that. Get out of here with your delusional anti intellectual rants.

       An essay huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       You call a hand-full of paragraphs an
       <em>
        essay
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what you would call an
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       book? Would reading a
       <em>
        whole

       book be like climbing Mt. Everest for you?
