       -he posted this to FB Oct 23rd... 
"I just finished the audio for the new video. Took longer than I expected because new evidence and footage landed in my lap in the middle of the process. Had to restructure a bit to fit it in. Also the topic is so serious and controversial that I cannot afford to rush anything. It's going to make a lot of people very angry, so I have to make sure that the case is water tight. Fact checking everything multiple times from multiple angles, debunking their responses in advance."

       I hate to be that guy but why is this being upvoted? Are you aware of a single journalist who has disappeared? I'm not. (Hastings didn't disappear before we go down that road)
      </p>

       I'm not sure how this is going to start happening "en masse" when it's apparently not happening in isolated cases yet.

       Obama hasn't been good to journalists and I'd not be exactly surprised to see this start happening (actually I might be surprised, it's a pretty bold move to disappear a journalist) , but I'm not aware of a single journalist who has disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say it's about to start happening en masse is...hyperbolic? To say the least.

       I'd be incredibly surprised if journalists started to disappear en masse in a country that has some of the strongest free speech protections I can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed, the Obama administration is coming down heavier on whistleblowers and leakers than I think is warranted, and this will of course affect the journalists who are leaked to etc, but this is all
       <em>

       I was actually meaning to post pretty much this exact thread yesterday (well, for several days now it's been on my mind)...glad others have noticed. Yeah, his FB page is inactive, scgnews.com the same. I get that he puts a shitload of time into his presentations and that's why I like him. I prefer his work over the youtubers that try to cram in a daily dose of fearporn about everything. But he's always at least made cursory updates to his fb page.

       Considering he has 200,000 + followers who are posting every few hours asking "where are you?"  it seems strange he would go completely silent.  I would think he would feel some obligation to let people know he's ok.

       Both Michael Hastings and Andrew Breitbart died shortly after revealing they were going to release "game-changing" information.

      <p>
       Don't tell the world you are about to release incriminating information that is going to destroy powerful individuals - bad things are likely to happen to you - just publish! You will be much safer once the information is in the public domain.

       I've watched a few SCG videos. Pretty good considering what else is out there. I don't feel like he has exposed anything not already obvious to people who stay on top of the standard doomer circuits, but I like the presentation. To answer your question, I haven't regularly looked at SCG so I have no idea.

       Rarely is it the inventor of an idea that gets credit for it. And often is it the best marketer that does.

       If SCG is reaching the most people with the message, he might as well have been the creator of it.

       I agree his videos are good but he hasn't exposed anything new.  The difference with this one is that he really hyped up the importance of the new video.  You'd think with 200,000+ followers on FB there would be some sort of info out there. But nothing.  Nada.

       I just looked at the full video list for the channel. At one month, I don't see much reason to freak yet. If we get to like 2 months and he hasn't posted something then I would really start to wonder.

        The new video is finally done. It will go live on Youtube this Saturday (November 29th) at 11AM EST. I took a long time on this one for a number of reasons which I intend to outline in a later post, but the primary reason was that due to the nature of the topic (and number people it is going to anger and or frighten) I had to make absolutely sure that it was solid, both factually, and psychologically. As such this video went through more versions than any other I've made so far. I kept watching it and fact checking it, rewriting it, and rerecording it over and over trying to make it perfect. It's over 30 minutes long, so this was very time consuming. Anyway I could have kept editing it more, but there are people who are dying right now.

       I was actually meaning to post pretty much this exact thread yesterday (well, for several days now it's been on my mind)...glad others have noticed. Yeah, his FB page is inactive, scgnews.com the same. I get that he puts a shitload of time into his presentations and that's why I like him. I prefer his work over the youtubers that try to cram in a daily dose of fearporn about everything. But he's always at least made cursory updates to his fb page.

       Obama hasn't been good to journalists and I'd not be exactly surprised to see this start happening (actually I might be surprised, it's a pretty bold move to disappear a journalist) , but I'm not aware of a single journalist who has disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say it's about to start happening en masse is...hyperbolic? To say the least.

       Both Michael Hastings and Andrew Breitbart died shortly after revealing they were going to release "game-changing" information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't tell the world you are about to release incriminating information that is going to destroy powerful individuals - bad things are likely to happen to you - just publish! You will be much safer once the information is in the public domain.
