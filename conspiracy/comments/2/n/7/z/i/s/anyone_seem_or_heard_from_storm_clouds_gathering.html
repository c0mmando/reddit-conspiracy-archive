&quot;I just finished the audio for the new video. Took longer than I expected because new evidence and footage landed in my lap in the middle of the process. Had to restructure a bit to fit it in. Also the topic is so serious and controversial that I cannot afford to rush anything. It&#39;s going to make a lot of people very angry, so I have to make sure that the case is water tight. Fact checking everything multiple times from multiple angles, debunking their responses in advance.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be incredibly surprised if journalists started to disappear en masse in a country that has some of the strongest free speech protections I can think of.</p>

<p>Agreed, the Obama administration is coming down heavier on whistleblowers and leakers than I think is warranted, and this will of course affect the journalists who are leaked to etc, but this is all <em>public</em>. </p>

<p><a href="/u/LetsHackReality">/u/LetsHackReality</a> is making a blanket statement of probablility that to my mind is ludicrous to the point of satire, invoking Pinochet-like levels of repression out of thin air. </p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;s completely correct and has connected the dots correctly, speaking of things that would surprise me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new video is finally done. It will go live on Youtube this Saturday (November 29th) at 11AM EST. I took a long time on this one for a number of reasons which I intend to outline in a later post, but the primary reason was that due to the nature of the topic (and number people it is going to anger and or frighten) I had to make absolutely sure that it was solid, both factually, and psychologically. As such this video went through more versions than any other I&#39;ve made so far. I kept watching it and fact checking it, rewriting it, and rerecording it over and over trying to make it perfect. It&#39;s over 30 minutes long, so this was very time consuming. Anyway I could have kept editing it more, but there are people who are dying right now.</p>
