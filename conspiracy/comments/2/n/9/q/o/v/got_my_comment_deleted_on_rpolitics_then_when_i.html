        Here is the original comment I made.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I then explained that I wasn't attacking a user or calling any specific person a retard, I was giving a hypothetical scenario like the saying "People who don't vote in elections are retards", something I have seen thousands of times in r/politics without any repercussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just checked the original thread and EVERY comment I made was deleted except one, so the entire "debate" with the mod apparently "never happened".
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, and I am now banned from the entire sub. If you want to see the comments I made to defend myself, just click on my username.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made this account a couple days ago as an experiment and since then, I have been harassed and attacked on this site by mods in r/politics and r/worldnews for saying things that go against the circlejerk narrative that those subs represent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In r/worldnews, my comments were just getting deleted without explanation. And they always do it so that you do not even know it is happening unless you sign out and see the thread.

       If anything you should just take this as a life lesson, and believe me, it's a valid one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cursing added nothing to your post, which was otherwise succinct and correct, and sounds like it was inspired by the chomsky quote i see floating around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take this the wrong way, but by using "retard" and "fuck", you made it so the average reader can disregard it as Alex Jonesy noise, instead of the intelligent admonishment that it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes to chip away you have to concede some little things, not cursing or using uncivil language which takes away from your argument, is not that big of a deal.

       This is a lesson to us all. Thanks for posting. It seems in subs like r/news anyone telling the truth, as you did, has to be incredibly careful. Always polite, never sensational or jokey, always measured and always have evidence to back up our claims. The mods are keen to find any excuse to ban. It sucks and it shows Reddit is dying.

       It's still not justifiable to remove a comment, and then ban commenting rights, because of "incivility."

       You shouldn't ignore, or censor, one based on their tone. Don't get me wrong either, civility is something one should always try and use.

       It was not far off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a video dealing with blizzard entertainment and how they do things with their giant MMO world of warcraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which do very similar things, business and politics are not very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the similarities deal with blizzard offering limited time promotions or releasing their expansions to their game during competing MMO launches, which is similar to the media pumping out fear in a time for voting for people that have horrible ratings.

       I'm not sure if this is supposed to be sarcasm, but you didn't label it as being such...so I'll assume it isn't and call you an idiot. In "their" subreddit? It isn't their subreddit. They're tasked with enforcing the rules of the subreddit. It absolutely is censorship to remove a post that you don't agree with under false pretenses. Reddit is supposed to be an open, equal forum. Not a place where we see only what the management approves of. I'd watch Fox News if I was looking for shitty, biased stories.

       The mods of the individual subreddits have complete authority to remove things from their subreddits, and to even ban people. You are always free to make your own subreddit and enforce your own rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how reddit has always worked. It's not censorship because they are allowing you to post on their private servers and all. This website isn't a public good. If you choose to use this website you have to abide by their rules, and they are free to remove things you wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if you don't like the way a subreddit is run, then start your own.

       A sub can make whatever rules they want, this sub even has a rule against accusing rule violations (#2) as well as the ridiculous rule #9 - Just read that one for a moment... If you do not abide by a subs rules - Whatever they may be, don't act shocked when you get banned.

       i personally put the word "retard" in the same category as "faggot"
      </p>
      <p>
       to me, retard means unintelligent idiot, faggot means unintelligent blase' asshole. i mean no offence to down syndrome people or gay/lesbian/bisexual people. i never associate those words with anything derogatory toward them in any way, its just my poor choice of word association.

       The fact ANY comments are removed just shows how insane this site is. There really needs to be a version of Reddit without the censorship and moronic mods.

       Its funny how you think enforcing the rules of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is inherently '
       <em>
        pro-Israel
       </em>
       '... Especially since we remove tons of inappropriate submissions that one could construed as  '
       <em>
        Israel-friendly
       </em>
       ' or '
       <em>
        anti-Hamas
       </em>
       '... just check
       <a href="/r/undeleteworldnews">
        /r/undeleteworldnews
       </a>
       . Meanwhile, there have been hundreds of submissions just in the last year that have been approved that could be construed as '
       <em>
        anti-Israel
       </em>
       '... for example,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jii9p/jerusalem_light_rail_line_crippled_by_rock/clcholb">
        here is a list of 50
       </a>
       of them posted over the last year that have over 700 net karma. So, if that is not sufficient evidence for you that we aren't exerting any sort of bias of moderation, then I'm not sure what evidence even
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be sufficient for you... especially since you have never once provided any rigorous evidence for your accusations in the form of a pattern of removed submissions that were not violating the rules of the sub. So, if you have evidence, please provided it for examination... otherwise, cool it with your continual baseless accusations against my character.

       Firstly, Trusty, you never messaged the mods for an explanation for your being banned. I checked the modmail, there was nothing there from you, and I remember being surprised about you not doing so, because I expected you would. Furthermore, you should know full well that you ban had nothing to do with mentioning the Talmud or Pam Gellar... you can talk about them all you want, you won't get banned. You were banned for repeated shill accusations, racism and homophobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, simply because you claim that you and others have recognized a 'pattern' of pro-Israeli moderation is really not proof of anything... because we get accused of having a "pro-this" or "pro-that" style-moderation constantly, with people accusing us of being '
       <em>
        paid-agents
       </em>
       ' or '
       <em>
        shills
       </em>
       ', if you will, for all sorts of organizations, whether it be Israel, Hamas, NATO, Russia, Ukraine, the NSA, the CIA, etc... I could go on, but you get the idea. So, unless you have a concrete pattern of evidence to support your accusations (that is not influenced by any sort of selection-bais), it is hard to take those sorts of accusations too seriously, being that we hear so many different types from so many different users. As for the accusation that the only domain sources that were getting thru to the frontpage are 'pro-Israeli', that is also not true... if you click on the links below, they will take you to lists of tons of Worldnews frontpage submissions from some very NOT pro-Israeli sources:

       ...I think that is a good list just as a quick example that we have TONS of submissions on the frontpage from decidedly non-Israeli sources. I hope showing you all of those hundreds of frontpage submissions illustrates to you how we are in no way keeping ANY sources from the frontpage of the sub. We allow all sources as long as they are factual, have non-editorialized headlines and do not break the rules of the sub.

       Next, as far as
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2gkf7g/israel_will_earn_billions_of_euros_by_making_sure/">
        THIS
       </a>
       submission you were wondering about... it was removed as 'editorialized' because the headline you gave your submission:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Israel will earn billions of euros by making sure that all the steel, concrete and other materials for Gaza are sourced in Israel and benefit Israeli companies.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...was merely an accusation made by an anonymous EU source... as it says in the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "
        <em>
         ...an EU source has revealed that Israel will earn billions of euros by making sure that all the steel, concrete and other materials and other aid are sourced in Israel and benefit Israeli companies.
        </em>
        "
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...you cannot take an accusation or claim made in an article and frame it in a headline as if it is a verified fact... that is editorialization. If you had just added to the headline "An EU source claims*", the submission would have been fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kt2db/dontago_and_possibly_other_mods_showing_clear/">
        THIS
       </a>
       was not a message you sent to me... it was a smear piece you wrote about me that was only brought to my attention well after you had written it. You baselessly accused me of being some sort of Israel shill, you mocked my personal opinions, making me out to be some sort of evil censor, you said I was unfit to moderate the sub... why would I respond to such unfounded personal attacks? I have never been anything but straightforward and helpful with you... just as I am now. I hope by explaining things to you in a calm straightforward manner, I can mend relations and build bridges between your group and our sub. If you ever have questions for me regarding anything, I can answer them for you, however, when you go take to making accusatory threads indicting my character, I take no part in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this cleared things up for you. Let me know if you have more questions.

       Hey Trusty. Firstly, I looked ALL thru modmail, and after we levied the ban on you, you sent NO modmail message back to us inquiring. That is verified... modmail cannot be deleted or removed, so if you sent us something, it would be there, but its not. However, if you mean isntead that you sent private messages to specific mods of the sub asking why you were banned, it is very likely they would not have gotten back to you. It is improper to PM a mod a question relating to a sub they moderate. In order to ensure full transparency so ALL mods can see all mail relating to the sub, any questions should always be directed to modmail... never PMs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you can call bullshit on your making shill accusations, homophobic comments and racist statements all you want, but you definitely made them. If you send a modmail to worldnews, I can give you a list of them all there. It would be a bit inappropriate for me to air your dirty laundry here. Also, using the excuse that you see other people making racist statements is NO excuse to make them yourself. We get tens of thousands of comments a day, so it takes lots of time and effort for us to sort thru everything and remove all of the racist and bigoted comments as they are made. Some days we don't get a lot, depending on the frontpage posts, but some days when there are incendiary posts, we can get hundreds of racists comments an hour. But rest assured, they are all removed as we get to them and the users are held responsible for them. All users are held responsible for their comments. We brought on 10 new mods the other month whose job it was to specifically work on helping clean up comments, so rest assured, we work VERY hard to eliminating it... but even as we get more mods, it still takes time; it is a gigantic task. Also, please don't insult my intelligence and claim we don't take anti-Muslim comments seriously. Look at
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2n2is9/kenya_bus_attack_28_nonmuslims_killed_after_being/">
        THIS
       </a>
       thread... we had to literally remove hundreds of anti-Muslim comments from there, so don't think for a second we don't take it seriously, we take it VERY seriously.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Just because a few posts that barely get any upvotes were not removed does not mean there is no selective removal by the mods.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...I literally just showed you hundreds of frontpage posts from non-Israeli-sympathetic sources with thousands of upvotes, but instead you choose to disregard that and belittle it as insignificant? I am just not sure what is enough for you. Literally NOTHING I show you is good enough, in your eyes. I have gone out of my way to be reasonable and upfront with you, but when you continually dismiss fair and reasonable evidence, I start to think that you aren't actually interested in evidence, but only interested in continuing to think what you already think. If no evidence is good enough for you then I won't waste my time providing it to you anymore. TELL ME what evidence you'd like to see, and I can do my best to provide it... Meanwhile, you provide ZERO evidence of anything. It is absurd how imbalanced and skewed this is, with me proving you with SO much evidence illustrating that we are hiding nothing and suppressing nothing, while all you can do is point to one or two posts (which I easily explain to you as being inappropriate)... you know, there is only so far my patience and understanding go before your unreasonable obstinence gets to be too much to handle. If we aren't operating on a field of mutual respect and understanding, then maybe this conversation is a waste of our times.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The real question is what percentage of the articles removed by the mods are anti-Israel, compared to pro-Israel sources.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...that is a GREAT question and I have no idea what the answer is, but, that is because no one has compiled the data for it yet... mostly because it would take a HUGE amount of time and effort in order to do so. All the data exists, just check out
       <a href="/r/undeleteWorldNews">
        /r/undeleteWorldNews
       </a>
       . It should be all there, mostly. However, it would be very difficult, since we get 1000s of submissions a month, you would have to check each and every submission, look at the removal flair, and categorize it and enter it all into an excel table to chart the data and trends. I have thought about doing it myself (to show people like you, for instance), but it would take so much time and effort, which I just don't have the space for right now. Modding the sub takes up so much of my time as it is. But you are more than welcome to squeeze the data and figure it out for yourself. It would actually be interesting to see it. Just as a tip in case you decide to do it, what you would have to do is first figure out how many total Israeli/Palestinian submissions there have been, sort them into 3 categories, 'pro-Israeli', 'neutral' and 'pro-Palestinian'. Once you figure out how many of each category were submitted in total (which would require hours of reading and sorting), figure out how many were removed in each category. However, make sure you remember to not include ones that were removed because they were already covered by other articles. We have to do a lot of those removals for when we get flooded with repeat submissions on the same story. Also, you would have to sort them as well by the removal reason, that is, if you really want to focus on the perceived bias you believe to be there. Removals for standard unambiguous rules such as 'no photo/videos', '404 not found', 'no satire' or 'not in English', etc, you would have to not include, since they are always removed, regardless of content. You'd have to focus on removals such as 'opinion/analysis', 'local news' and others you feel most fully expose the bias of the sub. I wish there was an easier way to do it, but really, there isn't. Also, I don't really like
       <a href="/r/undeleteWorldNews">
        /r/undeleteWorldNews
       </a>
       that much, since they often list articles there that were not actually removed, so it isn't the most reliable source of data. Because of that, you may wanna try and use
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       as a resource as well. Anyway, if you try it, good luck. I'd be interested to see the results.

      <p>
       I hope this explanation of things was helpful. Like I said, I am willing to explain things to you if you are reasonable and understanding. If not, then I cannot help you. I see you complain and bitch about the sub all the time, so I am giving you an opportunity to chat about your concerns. However, so far you are wasting it by being an obstinate brick wall, unwilling to see anything from the sub's point of view, while you are are being completely dismissive of all the evidence I show you. If that is gonna be your attitude, then let's just end this now. However, if you wanna have a REAL conversation, then we can. Just don't waste both of times.

       No opinions are allowed on worldnews unless it is the opinion of a lying politician, or the opinion of a Corporatist or it is the opinion of a Neocon or it is the opinion of a corrupt lobbyist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any non biased reporting of the news gets censored as "opinion/analysis". E.G. this guy said this, but he is lying because of X, Y and Z or he is getting paid to lie on TV by Corporations A, B and C.
      </p>
      <p>
       No articles are allowed that go through the evidence of why a particular Neocon is lying about Foreign Policy (from either party).
      </p>
      <p>
       No articles are allowed that go through the evidence of why a particular politician is lying about the economy, or the Federal budget or Corporate Welfare, or the monetary system.
      </p>
      <p>
       No articles are allowed as to why the current political system is endemically corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       These articles are classified as "analysis" and censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero articles are allowed that explain the truth of any significant issue whatsoever. Except for social policies and social policies do not affect Goldman Sachs or Halliburton or Booz Allen Hamilton or the Carlyle Group's profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Articles and opinion pieces about marijuana legalization are generally allowed, but that is the only significant subject that I can think of where truthful articles are allowed. 99% of the articles on World News, are lies (by omission, by bias or blatant outright palpable lies), trivial distractions or just plain crap that say nothing whatsoever about what is actually going on in the world.

       Firstly, I am not sure where most of your accusations are coming from, and I find most of them are perplexing, but I be willing to look at any evidence you can provide that supports them, and explain things the best I can. The sub accepts news from any sources, as long as the submission does not violate the rules of the sub, and as long as it is in the '
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_style">
        news style/straight news
       </a>
       ' article format. Any submissions that insert the opinion, conclusion, analysis, conjecture, etc, of the writer is not appropriate for the sub. Similarly, any submission headline that includes those same things, either inserted by the OP/writer, are also not appropriate for the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, like I said above, analysis articles are not appropriate for the sub because they do not follow the straight news/news style article format, so they are not permitted. If you want to submit analysis articles, you may wanna check out
       <a href="/r/worldpolitics">

       It was more a question of why you personally want to help spread the lies of corrupt lying politicians, Neocons and corrupt lobbyists and why you personally want to spend time suppressing articles explaining how and why they are lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am well aware of the "rules" on worldnews and never bother with it for that reason - it's full of articles full of blatant and very obvious lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is also for that reason that I have frequented worldpolitics for a while - because that has a very high ratio of informative and truthful articles on topics of significance (they would be classified as "opinion pieces or analysis on worldnews because they often call out lying politicians).
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously don't do a lot of research yourself - it only takes 20 seconds to look at a user's posting history - I had a very quick look at yours. You obviously didn't bother taking 20 seconds to look at mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you don't do any research yourself is one of a number of possible reasons as to why you moderate a board that publishes almost nothing but lies and very large lies at that.

       Like I said, the sub accepts news from any source, as long as it is in the news style format and follows the rules of the sub. The sub is not a place for opinion or analysis, it is for straight news. If you want opinion and analysis, there are other subs for that. I am sorry you don't like that fact, but don't be angry at the sub because it isn't breaking its own rules. That would be like being angry at
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       because they don't accept video submissions. Is that censorship? Of course not, they are just enforcing the rules. If you wanna post videos, go to
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       ... if you wanna post analysis/opinion pieces on world events, you go to
       <a href="/r/worldpolitics">
        /r/worldpolitics

       ... why would you try to post that to

        spread the lies of corrupt lying politicians, Neocons and corrupt lobbyists

       " and is "
       <em>
        suppressing articles explaining how and why they are lying
       </em>
       ", I would be more than happy to look at any evidence you have to support those accusations. I will do my best to explain whatever evidence you think you have... if I can't... we'll then I guess you caught me red handed.

      <p>
       The following is an extremely mild example of an evidenced based article that was censored on worldnews. Articles such as this are censored on worldnews because it would be an embarrassment to politicians (and crony Corporations) if the truth about TPP was more widely known

       You still haven't answered my question.

       Why are you personally spending time helping to spread lies that are against the interests of well over 99% of the people on Reddit?

       The reason that above link was removed is because it is an opinion/analysis article... and like I said, those are not permitted in the sub. So, if someone posts them, they are removed. It has nothing to do with supporting or spreading any agenda... it is simply against the rules to post such articles. I am not sure how much more clearly I can state that. Also, being that I can assure you that no one in the sub is:

      <p>
       ...and being that you have not provided any evidence that is even happening, I really have no way to answer that question.... because its not a question, its an accusation. If you wanna accuse me of something, ok, but at least provide evidence, otherwise, I cannot take you seriously.

       All the evidence you will ever need is posted to worldpolitics every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before worldpolitics has a high proportion of truthful articles. It has almost none of the articles posted to worldnews because the articles posted to worldnews are full of lies (often via some robot reporter parroting what a lying politician or Corporate lobbyist has said).
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you really still trying to plead ignorance and maintaining that you do not realize that a very high proportion of the articles posted up on worldnews are full of lies? I find that pretty difficult to believe.

       You're an idiot. Where did he direct an "attack" towards a specific person? He didn't, therefore he attacked no one personally. I just personally attacked you, but if I said, "this type of mindset is idiotic."I wouldn't be personally attacking you. That would be considered a blanket statement.        Secondly, the word "retard" can be defined as "to delay or hold back in terms of progress, development, or accomplishment." It couldn't be defined as derogatory or hateful speech unless you were directing it towards someone with a mental handicap. Hope this clarifies some of your erroneous statements.

       You're still calling another person a retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is so complex about that?  Using the argument "well it's a hypothetical situation" is a cop-out, and a piss-poor one at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as saying "People who post in

       are retarded" and "
       <a href="/u/putin_hates_cats">

       is a retard".  Both are still insulting, both still call people retards.  Just because one is a blanket statement doesn't lessen it's effect.

       Its funny how you think enforcing the rules of
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is inherently '
       <em>
        pro-Israel
       </em>
       '... Especially since we remove tons of inappropriate submissions that one could construed as  '
       <em>
        Israel-friendly
       </em>
       ' or '
       <em>
        anti-Hamas
       </em>
       '... just check
       <a href="/r/undeleteworldnews">
        /r/undeleteworldnews
       </a>
       . Meanwhile, there have been hundreds of submissions just in the last year that have been approved that could be construed as '
       <em>
        anti-Israel
       </em>
       '... for example,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jii9p/jerusalem_light_rail_line_crippled_by_rock/clcholb">
        here is a list of 50
       </a>
       of them posted over the last year that have over 700 net karma. So, if that is not sufficient evidence for you that we aren't exerting any sort of bias of moderation, then I'm not sure what evidence even
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be sufficient for you... especially since you have never once provided any rigorous evidence for your accusations in the form of a pattern of removed submissions that were not violating the rules of the sub. So, if you have evidence, please provided it for examination... otherwise, cool it with your continual baseless accusations against my character.

       It doesn't sound like there is anything else I can add to this conversation. I think it has ceased to be productive at this point. Sorry I couldn't help you more. Have a nice nite.
