       So this doesn't have to do with a
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       conspiracy, but a
       <strong>
        potential
       </strong>
       short term solution to the ones that relate to the U.S. government.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, what good is knowing about a conspiracy if you don't focus on potential solutions?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking for the negatives (in your opinion) of voting for the libertarian party exclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or course I can ask my question to,
       <a href="/r/libertarian">
        /r/libertarian
       </a>
       , but I don’t know if they’d be as likely to give me real negatives.

       Because a large part of the libertarian movement has been or will be(if it gains much more ground) co-opted by big business, ostensibly pushing for personal freedom and small govt while actually lobbying for even more of the bad kinds of deregulation and tax evasion. At this point I'm probably most likely to vote socialist if I were going to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, I don't think any -ism however benevolent it sounds on paper is going to be very good in practice considering the depths of corruption in this country.

       Libertarianism is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as its principal objective. I see real Libertarians as less of a party/group/club and more of just a philosophy. The Kochs can throw money at them, but won't change their philosophical convictions.

       While Libertarians are divided on economic issues, none of those divisions have anything to do with corporate liberty. That is just a myth.

       Libertarians are for freedom.  That means you can't step in with your government boot and say "you've earned enough now citizen, the rest you will share with me."

       Will it?  Only if the government steps in, sez I.  Nobody gets that big without government protection.  Nobody can have their property infringed upon to, say, a bp oil spill level without the government proclaiming bp a protected species and limiting the damaged.

       There are no solutions, only theories, as anyone who opposes the present system in any meaningful way lack the power or monetary backing to affect change.
       <br/>
       As for supporting the libertarian platform, more appropriately called the Tea Party, means largely supporting neoliberalism, which I'm opposed to. Supporting representatives who are almost wholly incapable of even a modicum of rationality, see Palin or most anything Ryan has proposed.
       <br/>
       Also, there is the problem that the entire "movement" was funded, backed, and created by the Koch kingmakers masquerading as a grassroots movement. It was a lie from the very beginning.
       <br/>
       And I'm not in agreement with ayn rand or what libertarians consider "philosophy" for the most part.
       <br/>
       "Non-aggression" seems like an ideal solution at face value, but that's largely not how human relations are modeled.
       <br/>
       Largely, I'm not an ideologue, and I lean more towards the pragmatic, but any kind of movement that relies so rigidly to an ideology that their solution to anything and everything boils down to the exact same dogma every time, in my opinion, that's not a political party, that's a cult. Which, to be fair, most political parties model to some extent.

       I believe you're referring to the mainstream media portrayal of the tea party. Yes, that faction took over the message, but earlier in it's existence it was a grassroots upwelling of populist candidates running for office. We largely don't support Palin. Just thought I'd throw that out there for you.

       I don't watch the media. That's what I've gathered by actually reading position statements and paying attention to who voted for what. The difference between words and actions.

       Yeah, anyone can use that moniker, and truthfully I believe it dilutes the message when you have self admitted neocons using that term to describe themselves. Well, at least we're popular..  =)

       every time I see a voting thread in conspiracy I'm amazed that people who visit this sub can't understand that it doesn't matter. The machines are rigged to set votes for whoever is next set to win, your votes couldn't matter less. Save yourself the time and effort of doing something completely pointless and spend some time with your family instead. Your vote doesn't matter, you can vote libertarian, republican, demoncrat it's not worth shit.

       My vote is an anti-vote.  I vote for libertarian or third party or mickey mouse for everything.  Why? Because your vote doesn't matter.  Literally, it doesn't fucking matter.  For president, they don't even bother making it look good.  The College votes for president.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the others, its all a scam.  You don't matter, they know, and now many of us know it.  When the one who spends the most wins 99% of the time, thats a good indicator that your reps are already purchased regardless of who wins.

       All the other posters use tired excuses (removing government "regulation" of things like EPA and what not, claiming suddenly we'll all live in polluted waters and air, because we certainly don't already /s).
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, anon's here will tell us how corrupted the R's or the D's are, but then refuse to try another 3rd party for the same fears. Why bother participating then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the negatives are the same reasons rehashed for any voting party:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         politics
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         in bed with corporations

       </li>
       <li>

         corrupted
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         wasted effort
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think most politicians in general are corrupted or become corrupted by the system. I vote L because it's one of the only parties that hasn't had a go and has a pretty decent idea of how the government should be in the relationship of people vs. state.

       I do not vote Libertarian for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         At present that would help Republicans.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is a valid point in paying taxes:
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Taxes pay for the infrastructure that helps our country succeed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Regulations are not created out of thin air, but in response to abuses. A blanket dislike of regulations disregards their origins.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The wealthy do not need the assistance of the entire society to keep their positions--but the poor and powerless do.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         By itself, the capitalist system encourages costs to be
         <em>
          externalized
         </em>
         , meaning shoved off for some other taxpayers to pay for.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I appreciate and like many of the social-freedom aspects of the Libertarian philosophy but view the economic aspects as naive and short sighted.

       Bernie Sanders wanted single payer so no person in America ever went bankrupt again from a healthcare crisis.  He compromised only to get 14 million more people covered with insurance in essence directly saving lives as opposed to bitching that nothing was getting done.  I'm sure you are fine with the system of corruption we have in place with the for profit healthcare system though.  You are in the minority.

       The only negatives I ever hear about libertarians is people thinking they are for Socialism (which is historically, always by force) or just generally not knowing what Libertarianism really is.

       Or those who believe you can't vote for third party because it will split the votes and hand it to the Dem or Rep that you don't like.

       I believe you're referring to the mainstream media portrayal of the tea party. Yes, that faction took over the message, but earlier in it's existence it was a grassroots upwelling of populist candidates running for office. We largely don't support Palin.
