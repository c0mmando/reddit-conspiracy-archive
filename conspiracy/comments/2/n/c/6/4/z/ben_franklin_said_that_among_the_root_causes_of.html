    <div class="md"><p>I think this played into it too </p>

<p>In 1760 George III surrendered the right to govern in person, and as a result the monarch&#39;s entitlement to the revenue of the Crown Estate, which was transferred to HM Treasury. The agreement relieved the monarch of all responsibility for:</p>

<p>-the cost of the civil government
-the national debt accrued by previous monarchs, and
-his own personal debt.</p>

<p>In return, he received an annual grant known as the Civil List. By tradition, each subsequent monarch has agreed to this formality as part of the ritual of his or her accession. However, from 1 April 2012, under the terms of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 (SSG), the Civil List was abolished, and in the future each monarch will receive from the Treasury a grant indexed to a percentage of the Crown Estate&#39;s annual net revenue (currently set at 15%). This is intended to provide a long-term solution, and remove the politically sensitive issue of Parliament having to debate the Civil List allowance every 10 years. - wiki </p>

<p>In one swift move all debts were gone!  I think the colonists wanted some of that action too.</p>

<p>And for the support of this Declaration (trust), with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
