    <div class="md"><p>Acting as domestic terrorists, burning property,looting,firing weapons in crowds of people and generally inciting violence are much higher up on the list of bullshit that they are involved in. I strongly believe, as a citizen who has witnessed firsthand what these types do to societies, that these criminals need to be dispatched. Whether it is peacefully being thrown into prison, or gunned down like the animals they are. The sooner that these terrorists are removed from the streets, the safer everyone will be. I don&#39;t care that they&#39;re black, I care that they feel it is ok to thrash a city, burning down and stealing from hard-working citizens. Violence should be met with violence. It&#39;s just ironic that the terrorists are crying about racial inequality while they are stealing from black-owned businesses. This is nothing more than a group of non-contributing burdens on society who are endangering the welfare of this glorious nation. Domestic terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neh, I want them dispatched, by the law. Violence is met with violence. Innocent people shouldn&#39;t be harmed by these terrorists. We don&#39;t think twice about killing an arab for terrorist acts,yet these domestic terrorists are doing the same thing; using fear and destruction to get their way. They need to be stopped. Hopefully this entails them being contained and tried in a court, however, if it&#39;s one of their lives versus a police officers&#39; or soldiers&#39;, that&#39;s an easy choice. I don&#39;t watch MSM and believe most of television is drivel. Most of this is directly because the media empowered these lunatics. Regardless of who is perpetuating this war on our streets, it needs to be squashed. The aggressors and vandals need to be held to the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah. That&#39;s pretty impressive of you to extract such a deep understanding of me based upon some text posts on an internet forum. You should be very proud of yourself. After your mother is done picking up her food stamps, tell her that the internet is proud of you. Your remarkable triumph to success as a retail employee at Costco clearly identifies you as a successful person. Obviously, people who make $12.50 an hour, are hateful towards Mormons, and sympathize with a hate group known as the black panthers are the authority on sociology,psychology and empathy. I&#39;m sure that the color of your skin has nothing to do with your delusions that the violent criminal known as Michael Brown was a victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching that stream</p>

<p>as much as I dislike the police state and seeing people get tear gassed, I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s somewhat poetic that a guy trying to make the residents of Ferguson look victimized for doing no wrong has his iphone stolen while streaming by one of the people whose side he&#39;s taking</p>

<p>shit was hilarious, and it wasn&#39;t a cop who stole it</p>

<p>No cop can run like that. Unless some special order was given to some special fitness cop to <em>hey go rob this cat&#39;s phone he&#39;s uploading too much stuff lol</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last thing that happened on that feed is who ever stole the phone came to some house nearby and was greated by some female voice.  I didn&#39;t clearly make it out, but I think she asked where this guy got the phone.  He responded back with something to the effect that he lifted if from some random n***r.  (used for context).  The feed cuts off when the guy&#39;s finger covers the camera lens for a split second most likely pressing the power button to turn off the phone.  Likely it was just a opportunistic thug who saw the opportunity to snatch a costly phone.  It is also possible, although less likely, his feed terminated on purpose, but unlikely as they (the government) could just disable his feed through software means and blame it on the phone just breaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching the stream for several hours up until his phone was stolen and never heard him say that</p>

<p>He recorded people throwing tear gas BACK at the cops, but only said things like &quot;wow&quot; or &quot;omg&quot;</p>

<p>Find a video of him saying that stuff and I&#39;ll believe it</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I agree with the grand jury decision, but don&#39;t make shit up</p>
