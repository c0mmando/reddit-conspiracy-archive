Cops kill people and get away with it all the time, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are agents in the crowd to instigate violence and lead a frenzy. I bring up the Ferguson coverage because it&#39;s the most relevant right now, but I&#39;ve noticed it in other programs as well. Is it possible that by prompting this primarily black community to engage in riots and covering it nationally is part of a plan to fuel racism and the oppression of minorities? Normally I think covering it would be an issue, but the fact that it interrupted normal programming with live coverage to make sure the maximum number of viewers see it made me skeptical. Especially considering the demographics of certain stations like cnn and cbs being a majority white audience. Thoughts?</p>

They need this BS racist events to happen, because is not the county would come together and kick all of congress and the heads of the government out of power. </p>

<p>There still is racism, but not as much as there was during the 50&#39;s and earlier. They need to keep the embers smoldering and burning so the country won&#39;t unite and realize that the color of our skin doesn&#39;t matter, were all humans, and that if the population rose up as a whole, black white Latino Hispanic Asian Arabic African Pacific Islander etc. and said were done with the corruption in DC and want a free, true republic, they would be fucked.</p>

<p>So they have keep these social engineered events going to separate the populace, instead of us all uniting and becoming the free state it&#39;s supposed to be</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a concerted effort but a self-perpetuating trap. Young black youth want to feel righteous in fighting their parents and grandparents struggle, but systemic racism has been curbed significantly. The trouble is that their means of action severely harm and may in fact reverse their cause. From Watts to the L.A. Riot to this most recent riot, the protesters may have started with  justified grievance, but once a few businesses in the community are looted and set ablaze, the average news audience washes their hands of these petty criminals. </p>

<p>No conspiracy, just misguided anger and replays of frenzied larceny on the news. The media lives for this kind of episode, we enjoy watching the chaos, but there isn&#39;t a conspiracy at play, just human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of people who believe the same thing you do; that the media do it for the ratings only. I think the reason for this is ignorance of the proof that the media fabricates news for political goals. We have plenty of examples. I&#39;ll give you one specifically about racism. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fvBQDHqdCck">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fvBQDHqdCck</a></p>

<p>Basically, msnbc deliberately cropped a black guy so that you couldn&#39;t see his skin color, and then insinuated that he was a racist white person carrying guns. The media plays both sides of this so that blacks and whites are constantly angry at each other. I&#39;ll leave it up to you to decide why the media would do such a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My answer would be that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>MSNBC is a network targeting a liberal audience.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of propaganda is not to corrupt but to reaffirm prior beliefs (Tea Party = Rednecks/White Supremacists = Gun Nuts)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this footage before. It&#39;s absolutely grotesque to recognize the manipulation at work, but at the end of the day, the network knows its audience, knows what it wants and wishes to deliver that content to as large a group as they can. Unfortunately, people don&#39;t respond as nicely to MSNBC as they do to Fox, and this is shown in their dwindling market share.</p>

<p>Other good examples could have been:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CBS reporter Daniel Schorr claiming that since Barry Goldwater went to Germany in 1964, he went to claim Nazi support. </p></li>
<li><p>Beslen &#39;92 falsified Bosnian concentration camp by the Daily Mirror</p></li>
<li><p>The unedited v. the edit of the Rodney King police beating video. </p></li>
<li><p>MSNBC&#39;s Toure&#39;s insistence that the Zimmerman said &#39;fucking coon&#39; not &#39;fucking cold&#39; or NBC&#39;s phone edit that insinuates Zimmerman was essentially hunting blacks. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s loads of distortion even in consumer safety spots. <a href="http://walterolson.com/articles/crashtests.html">ABC even rigged a bomb to a Ford Pinto in order for them to demonstrate &#39;journalistic ethics&#39;</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, be skeptical and consider those that write narratives as nothing more than con artists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The President shouldn&#39;t involve himself in local cases. Before Trayvon, it was Henry Louis Gates. Each time, a small event snowballs into a media circus. I&#39;ll say that he was a little more reserved this go around, but he still tried to make the police into a bunch of racists while imploring the rule of law. Go figure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media creates the snowballing, they don&#39;t wait for a circus, they set up the tents and invite people to come. But there is something to learn from the cases they decide to cover nationally and stay with through the entire case. Every year hundreds of young black kids are murdered, but the 6 corporations that own the MSM are waiting for that perfect case where a young black male is killed by a white cop, with the culmination of the cop being let go in some perceived form of injustice in which the entire system seems to be against the black community. It mioght seem unfortunate to the powers that be that the 2 cases they have gone ahead with, Trayvon and Brown, have appeared to be less than optimal; both have innocent kids who aren&#39;t really kids and aren&#39;t really innocent. </p>

<p>But isn&#39;t that actually part of the plan? I think the media chose to run with these 2 cases simply <strong>because</strong> they knew each of the black males were in fact not without guilt, that each of their two accused killers would be let off, and it is the failure to indict them that is the end goal leading toward civil unrest, enhanced militarization, escalation of racial tension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m most interested is how these stories, which aren&#39;t really all that exotic, grow from local story to national. I&#39;ve read that the LA riots became the 24-7 news event prototype, the only rational use for all hour coverage, but since everything doesn&#39;t demand that sort of coverage news had to be fabricated. Neil Postman&#39;s &#39;Amusing Ourselves to Death&#39; pushes that narrative pretty heavily and the opposite of &#39;scarcity creates value&#39; seems to be demonstrated in the gross information provided on a daily basis, but still. Why these certain stories? And why has no journalist decided to cover the short timeframe between minor community tragedy to a crusade against the racist system and all its inhabitants?</p>

<p>I mean, in a conspiratorial world, is there some sort of <a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111117625/3244792-wheelofcontroversy.png">wheel</a> that network heads spin to rile up different, distinct cultures for the goal of more relevance? Or is it the same dog bite man, if it bleeds it leads, sort of exploitable entertainment that gives its audience the sense of being informed that has always plagued journalism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fomenting a race war, that&#39;s the main conspiracy at work here. Oh there are always others at play, police militarization being one of the, but the main goal here is to plant seeds for a race war in USA. This is why the media works so hard to put Trayvon and Brown in the best light of being innocent young boys taken out in cold murder by white cops. They want young blacks in USA to hate cops with all their hearts, so finally when they actually have a good case and story that black communities will finally explode. There is another race way between latinos and whites brewing in Southern California and Arizona, but it is not as hot as the black vs white conflict. </p>

<p>USA must be as fractured as possible for when future, real crisis occur such as a Great Depression or a World War. Blacks and whites and Latinos cannot be allowed to trust each other or work together, America must be in a state in which it will tear itself apart from within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what&#39;s happening in Ferguson justifies expanding a militarized police force everywhere else(&quot;just look at what happened in Ferguson&quot;) and sets precedents for the use of emergency powers acts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really very simple, no one is so dumb as to think &quot;fuck da police on dat one nigga didnt do nuffin&quot;(except the ignorant poor black people of Ferguson), everyone else(white middle class people) thinks &quot;holy shit, this is how they react after one black guy is shot for trying to assault a police officer after robbing a convenience store? jesus christ thank god for the police we need more of them&quot;.</p>

<p>All of this is one big scam, a ploy to incite and further violence and outrage in the common people in Ferguson, while terrifying the rest of the common people in the country, using the poor uneducated black people to do it. All of this is for and serving a larger nation-wide agenda. Shit like this doesn&#39;t just happen, sorry, and the people running the media coverage aren&#39;t just retarded or anti-cop extremists trying to create a news story, there is more going on than that here. Stupid people who aren&#39;t involved in governing think &quot;fuckin media tryna make money&quot;, smart people who are involved in governing think &quot;yes now we can justify extending spending for our police forces and get them military gear and training for when the economic shit hits the fan or for when people realize how badly they are being fucked by the government, awesome&quot;.</p>

<p>Racism is just a cog in a larger wheel of an agenda that doesn&#39;t give a single shit about what race you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone needs a campaign to keep racism alive. </p>

<p>Racism (and a bunch of other &#39;isms&#39;) are pretty base instincts really. And there&#39;s still a shit ton of racial tension in the US, especially between blacks and whites, but also with many other groups too.</p>

<p>The underlying issues are much more complex than just the colour of people&#39;s skin, but it&#39;s virtually impossible for anyone to seriously address those issues without things sliding into mass hyperbole and generalisation which then tends to seriously derail discussion.</p>

<p>What happened in Ferguson wasn&#39;t necessarily a race thing, but because of the tensions within the community it couldn&#39;t help but become one. And it&#39;s consequently acted as a focal point for those same issues - of abuses by police and institutional racism within law enforcement - all over the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The country is being destabilized, either intentionally or unintentionally as a result of heavy-handed top-down control that has run amok. This is following a pattern that many other countries have gone through, where destabilization is brought about, then there&#39;s a civil war and eventually martial law. Read more in this thread I posted today here: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ncdvp/list_of_countries_overthrown_by_the_cia_is/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ncdvp/list_of_countries_overthrown_by_the_cia_is/</a></p>

<p>This is why it is extremely important that we rise above racism and sexism, so that the strategy of &quot;divide and conquer&quot; cannot work to tear us apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a <em>smear</em>, TPTB are just <em>flexing</em> to see or show just how far they can &quot;go&quot;, taking away peoples right to vote, etc., privacy laws, GMO foods; it&#39;s all part of their plan to &#39;wear&#39; us down,</p>

<p>i agree that &#39;they&#39; were hoping to use violence after the verdict, you have to realize that most young people have no history/knowledge of the civil rights movement, so how would they know how to deal with this?  </p>

<p>i get how frustrated/angry they feel, but i think the people of Ferguson have been so &#39;beat down&#39; by the system that they just didn&#39;t fight back, idk if it was because they didn&#39;t know what to do or felt that there was o recourse, racism hasn&#39;t gone away,</p>

<p>but nobody wants to go backwards, i have to remind myself that <em>we are</em> in the 21st century! doesn&#39;t feel like it though.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read about the case, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the officers testimony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posed my original question because you&#39;re asking a pejorative question on a unique subreddit. You&#39;ve obviously come with your own intentions and/or opinions surrounding the event. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not citing anything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotal citations:</p>

<p>1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cops kill people and get away with it all the time, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are agents in the crowd to instigate violence and lead a frenzy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>2</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... but I&#39;ve noticed it in other programs as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3 (this one is more of an implication)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the fact that it interrupted normal programming with live coverage to make sure the maximum number of viewers see it made me skeptical. Especially considering the demographics of certain stations like cnn and cbs being a majority white audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure cops kill people. Soldiers kills people. People kill people. That doesn&#39;t mean that racism is a hidden agenda. (point #1)</p>

<p>Again, where, specifically, do you cite that you&#39;ve seen instances of pro-racism in other programs? (point #2)</p>

<p>The 9/11 bombings were shown as an interruption. The Assassination of JFK was shown as an interruption. Do you see the pattern here? This is a highly charged and important event to the American public. Blacks, whites, Asians, Mexicans. Why do you feel that there&#39;s an undertone of racism? Because it was shown as an interruption to normal broadcasting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t stop them from poisoning the well, that only helps them do it more effectively, unless the bot&#39;s auto-reply repeatedly explains that to people.</p>

<p>edit: in fact if you do this I can guarantee you they will create more sockpuppets and then target subs with those &#39;users&#39; of said subs, so that it appears certain areas are populated by the racists.  You can imagine which subs would become the targets.</p>
