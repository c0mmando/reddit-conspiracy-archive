       Join us on December 4th for an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       AMA with Russ Baker of
       <a href="http://whowhatwhy.com/">
        WhoWhatWhy.com
       </a>
       .  Baker has written for top publications around the world, including The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Nation, Esquire, Vanity Fair, The Washington Post, Salon, The Village Voice, The (UK) Sunday Times, and Der Spiegel (Germany).  He has also served as a contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review. Baker received a 2005 Deadline Club award for his exclusive reporting on George W. Bush’s military record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russ explores topics that others in the media consider too sensitive.  WhoWhatWhy’s work often focuses on the “Deep State” – those institutions, networks and individuals that constantly shape the course of the nation and the world, but which are often not discussed.  He explains complex subjects in simple, easy-to-understand terms, while providing extraordinary new clarity and historical perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the course of more than two decades in journalism, Baker has broken scores of major stories. Topics included: documenting massive inconsistencies in the official account of the Boston Marathon Bombing, in the poorly explained one-car crash that killed national security journalist Michael Hastings, the back story to Western interventions in Libya, Syria and Ukraine; early reporting on inaccuracies in the articles of The New York Times’s Judith Miller that built support for the invasion of Iraq; revelations by George Bush’s biographer that as far back as 1999 then-presidential candidate Bush already spoke of wanting to invade Iraq; the real reason Bush was grounded during his National Guard days – as recounted by the widow of the pilot who replaced him; several investigations of allegations by former members concerning the practices of Scientology; corruption in the leadership of the nation’s largest police union; a well-connected humanitarian relief organization operating as a cover for unauthorized US covert intervention abroad; detailed evidence that a powerful congressional critic of Bill Clinton and Al Gore for financial irregularities and personal improprieties had his own track record of far more serious transgressions; the murky international interests that fueled both George W. Bush’s and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns; the efficacy of various proposed solutions to the failed war on drugs; the poor-quality televised news program for teens (with lots of advertising) that has quietly seeped into many of America’s public schools, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Book:
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Secrets-Americas-Invisible-Government/dp/1608190064">
        Family of Secrets: The Bush Dynasty, America's Invisible Government, and the Hidden History of the Last Fifty Years
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Russ’s mission is to cut through the falsehoods and manipulation that make democracy impossible, and arm us with the tools we need to take charge of our lives and our world.

       "...There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part!

       I have seen nothing that states Richard Gage refused to do an AMA here BECAUSE he was impersonated.

       I still think the ultimate form of verification is a link on their official site to the AMA though, or a note letting people know when and where it iwll be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I geuss twitter works the same way though as long as the account is verified.

       Yeah that would probably be nice, I can just see some people not wanting to put a notice on their site. Like if it's the type of announcement they'd only put on Twitter, not on their main site. As long as the verification is accomplished, I think that's what's important.

       I've been in contact with Russ Baker through his site for years.  He verified that this twitter account and Reddit AMA details are accurate through email.
      </p>
      <p>
       How this type of due diligence wasn't done for the Richard Gage AMA is inexcusable and hard to believe in my opinion.  This
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/en/contact.html">

       The offical IAMA subreddit lays out some pretty basic lessons they have learned in the past:

      <p>
       The funny part though, and I know you'll understand me when I say this to you, is that you helped fake Richard Gage answer over 20% of the questions in his fake AMA (without ever calling fake Richard out).
      </p>
      <p>
       You of all people couldn't tell fake Richard wasn't answering the questions like real Richard Gage? Red flags were going up everywhere!
      </p>
      <p>
       In retrospect I find that harder to believe than the fact that axolotl_peyotl sold us a non-verified AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something stinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What constitutes an offense where a mod should be banned? What could possibly top a fake AMA with Richard god damn Gage as a bannable offense? Maybe getting confirmation from actual Richard Gage that he will not come to this sub for an AMA?

        Just so you don't think I'm here to stir shit all the time, I had an idea about AMA's in the future.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called the buddy system. One mod can't promote and hold an AMA on their "hunch" from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Verification of the AMA candidate must be between two mods, at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple fix for a nefarious mod's actions.

       I really like that idea of the two mod verification buddy system.  In fact AssuredlyAThrowAway and myself both worked on getting this upcoming Russ Baker one going and both verified it.  I admit I trusted the mods at the time during the Gage AMA and that was a mistake.  Mistakes will be made in the future, but hopefully we can prevent any nefarious ones from being repeated.

       <strong>
        you, Orangutan, of all the people in this vast universe,
       </strong>
       should have smelled the rat from the get-go. You dwarf me in your knowledge of 911, yet somehow only nam007, I, and maybe one more individual were saying "what the actual fuck" during the AMA.

      <p>
       Not that I followed though with anything, as I was banned shortly thereafter.

      <p>
       You were more like fake Richard's crutch/beard.

      <p>
       You answering roughly 20% of the questions that fake Richard ignored/dodged.

       Something stinks. I'm not sure what though. I just know there's another mod here that set this thing up and god dammit. It's like there's a plot to fuck with 911 truth within REDDIT.COM.

       At that point I was trying to spread as much information as I could to the potential audience rather than get into wondering why Richard wasn't as eloquent as I'd hoped he'd be in text.  Luckily the lesson has been learned, this next AMA has been verified, and the AMA's in the future will hopefully be better off because of it.  Thanks.

       This should be required reading before his AMA.  If you have not taken the time to read this article, which is a kind of condensed telling of portions of his book, then you should.

       Not everyone has gone through hours of research on topics that would be covered in this AMA. New subcribers might have not researched any of the topics that Mr. Baker covers, so it makes sense to present the information to a new audience. If the verification requirements are met, things will be just fine.

       I'd get Chris Matthews here if I could and if you can't think of relevant questions to ask him this might not be the AMA for you.  Sounds like you could formulate a question for him regarding that now that I think of it though.

       Here's a few 
questions for Mr. Baker:
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you got any
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       for us old skool conspiracy buffs who are already too familiar with the twisted history of the Bush clan? In other words, anything that would stick to a statutory skillet, and not just in my our collective guts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, here's a few questions relative to the 'proof needed" to conduct quality AMAs:
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this 'proof' come with any guarantee? Further, if it proved pseudo, what would you do next?

       Lol, it would be a pretty sad world if every person who published a book that was adversarial to the CIA was immediately killed. Also if they did so, they would call a lot of attention to the killed authors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm confused, do you think that anyone who hasn't been killed by the CIA isn't legit? So, the only real conspiracy theorists are Webb and Casolaro? This is facetious, btw, and you're an idiot.

       Yep, you're confused alright if you believe that anyone who questions your authority is an idiot, and think that your word alone is sufficient proof to back any of your claims. I gave you a chance to state your case as to Mr. Baker's credibility, but apparentlly you're only interested in undermining your own. Otherwise, if you don't believe that the CIA has lots of journalists (left, right and center) on their payroll, nor realize that they're in the business of manufacturing fake missives for mass consumption, then
       <em>
        yeah

       , the cause of your confusion is gullibility. Not to worry, though. You've come to the right place. We can help you with that here.

       LOL, you're still an idiot. I'm well aware of the CIA's hold on the media. I just think that you're an idiot cause you think that any journalist not controlled by the CIA should be dead. Seriously, you must not know a lot about this world if you think that. Come back when you've done some more reading in the conspiracy literature.

       No, I simply wondered at his ability to survive the ugly Texas truth and dirty CIA tricks. Now you've blown 2 chances to back up your boast that his credentials are impeccable.

       It's absolutely maddening to see those comments stand. I don't care that the AMA was 'removed,' as it can still be viewed by a link. If you or another mod would kindly clean up the other 'mod's' 'mistake,' it would be greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that the mod in question would actually be held accountable for their own actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accountability is not a feeling. It's an action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accountability holds a strong meaning to those who never experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was held accountable for the failure to verify?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was held accountable for upholding fake Richard Gage's asinine remarks?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one. There's a fox in the henhouse.

       Does not matter about my old about. Its about allowing a AMA guest to feel comforable to discuss and not get misguided by users that try to make a guest look bad or crazy. Its about respect and what they came to do.

       You're right and I'm by no means saying that AMA guests should be attacked - I'll do my best to ensure that Mr. Baker feels comfortable and is free from trolls.  Having said that, this is the internet, and this is a conspiracy forum.  Anonymous trolls and shills are part of the game and anyone who's been involved in this "scene" for longer than a few months is well aware of this by now.  We have to have thick skin and not let idiotic comments get to us, and that goes for our AMA guests as well (in my opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think limiting the AMA to guest invites only would severely restrict the number of questions asked and the overall dialogue in the thread and I think that this would do a lot more harm to the AMA format than a few juvenile trolls could.  How would we make the determination anyway?  Some of the trolls have older accounts than legit users - where does one draw the line?

       This is true but limiting the access would make for a better AMA. The option option is to post users questions to the AMA guest as the Mods can filter / monitor the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't want to see the guest get pissed off and leave like the last one did. That was sad to see! There needs to be moderation when the guest come on. Leaving it wide open allows strange people to hijack the AMA.

       I have no doubt about you or your intentions based on what you've said here and previous comments of yours I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would say though is that having something like this in place will automatically limit not just the number but the
       <em>
        depth
       </em>
       of the questions that are asked.  What I mean is that people will deliberately self-censor their questions or "tone them down" so as not to offend the guest or get their comments deleted.  This will happen even for legit users who have good questions.  Who would ask the tough questions with a rule like this in place?  Very few people, we would get nothing but soft balls - or at least significantly soft
       <em>
        er
       </em>
       balls in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't like the idea of 5 people (maybe a few more) deciding the content that 250,000+ subscribers are exposed to.  That isn't what this sub is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution, in my opinion, is for we mods to just be vigilant during the AMA and remove posts that are abusive and/or are reported to us and also to possibly let the users know to be respectful of the guest and that we will delete comments that aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But asking a tough question, or asking for identity verification (within reason of course), is not disrespectful or abusive by default.

       I think its a tough balance when it comes to doing the AMA especially when it comes to conspiracies knowing well that this sub is being closely watched.

       </a>
       ? I though it was well done and moderated in this fashion. I also think doing a video or audio AMA has a bit more power over a text only AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all about keeping this sub strong and worthwhile for the people that visit it. I think the sub needs to take things to the next level with small audio podcast or video podcasts. The sub has some amazing insightful Mods.

       Yeah that would probably be nice, I can just see some people not wanting to put a notice on their site. Like if it's the type of announcement they'd only put on Twitter, not on their main site. As long as the verification is accomplished, I think that's what's important.

questions for Mr. Baker:
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you got any
       <strong>
        news
       </strong>
       for us old skool conspiracy buffs who are already too familiar with the twisted history of the Bush clan? In other words, anything that would stick to a statutory skillet, and not just in my our collective guts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, here's a few questions relative to the 'proof needed" to conduct quality AMAs:
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this 'proof' come with any guarantee? Further, if it proved pseudo, what would you do next?
