       The moon landings were not faked. Neil Tyson, an astrophysicists, talks with Joe Rogan on some of the common "proof" conspiracy theorists use to make their point. Link here:

      </p>
      <p>
       I've never heard of any proof that is convincing or that is supported by anyone who works in astrophysics or any related fields. The people who tend to believe these "theories" tend to think everything is either faked or controlled.

       all Neil says is that is it were fake someone would have said something. There were to many people and moving parts involved to fake it. Which is complete BS.. if the people involved knew their kids would be killed, they would keep their mouths closed. Neil couldnt answer JR's points

       "An expert says so" doesn't convince me.  Joe was asking dumb questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there isn't proof that something on the moon didn't happen!  Even if it was incontrovertibly demonstrated that an iconic Apollo picture was not genuine, that wouldn't come close to constituting proof that the entire event was bogus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have proof to back my skepticism of the Apollo landings, but I also haven't seen sufficient proof to convince me that men walked on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is on those claiming to have landed on he moon.  To assume we have landed on the Moon unless you see proof otherwise doesn't make sense to me.

       There are videos, witnesses, pictures, and moon rocks, which prove that we [humans] walked on the moon. How is that not evidence?

       I am sure you'll say EVERYONE is lying and EVERYTHING is faked. Well now the burden of proof is on YOU to justify your claim.

       I guess they have to keep the lie going in 2009, so they indoctrinate a whole new generation of scientists into lie about the moon landing by having the Lunar Orbiter take fake pictures of the Apollo landing sites.

       I'm not claiming EVERYTHING is fake.  The only part that I think is faked is the landings.  They definitely sent the astronauts into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see lots of videos of fictional events, so those don't prove it for me.  The witnesses and pictures also don't really satisfy me.  Official releases of photo collections of the Apollo missions in space are seemingly impossible to find, and not a single one of the men who walked on the moon has proven a reliable witness to me.  Joe Rogan had an episode where he was talking with a Canadian astronaut, and the guy was speaking for over an hour conveying his experience.  Not a single one of the American moon walkers has given any interviews like this.  It's just this video of Buzz Aldrin getting angry and punching a guy for getting in his face about living a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding rocks, the Soviets had probes which collected moon rocks and safely brought them back to earth prior to the moon landings.  There are lots of meteorites and other things on earth which could easily pass as being lunar in origin.  So the claim of rocks retrieved from the moon by men is not enough to convince the skeptic in me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked out your link, and I don't see how it proves anything.  Most of the objects they are labeling are either not visible, or are just tiny specs.  Truthfully, even if the images were clear, I'd be skeptical of the origin of the images.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously believed in the moon landings for the longest time, but the campaign to make the moon landings forbidden zones in order to preserve lunar history just makes no sense to me.

       Its getting hard to debate this rationally as you're working backwards. Instead of looking at the evidence and generating a conclusion, you have a conclusions and picking and choosing what evidence you "believe" in order to support your predetermined conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point with the new images from the Orbiter is that they would have to indoctrinate a whole new generation of NASA workers into the lie. It just doesn't make any rationale sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believed in the landings and then all of a sudden two congressman create a bill and you're view changes. That doesn't seem to make any sense. First off, the bill is ridiculous in its nature... politicians are always struggling for a purpose and creating nonsensical bills in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't seem like we will get anywhere as any evidence will just be dismissed as not good enough. The conspiracy theory culture is an interesting one.

       He shows his true colors as an honest scientist? There isn't anything wrong with GMO's. There is much more danger in random mutations from just allowing plants to breed by themselves. We don't know what they could do. Controlled genetic modification is a far more precise and safe practice. We actually know what the gene will end up doing.

       Kudzu, Giant African land snail, cane toad, dutch elm disease, etc. Invasive species are ones that get introduced into an ecosystem which isn't prepared to control their population. This is a problem which has parallels to genetic modification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of that, we create new viruses in labs that are modified genetically to be better killers. Is that safe? Of course not. So to say that genetic modification is safe, period, is absolute nonsense. You have to talk specifics or it's best to keep one's mouth shut. The anti-gmo crowd are the only ones making any sense on the issue.

       No they aren't. They group them all into one. Im advocating the opposite. You can't make blanket statements. No one would make blanket statements about a tool but people do when they talk about gmos. The tool itself is safe and doesn't introduce anything dangerous by itself.

       Sadly I'm not wearing maroon today. You are making the mistake of construing the technique to be dangerous and unsafe with a specific use of it. Is a piece of paper or pen unsafe? Is it dangerous if I shove it down your throat? See there is an important distinction you are missing.

       Cursing and complaining really doesn't do much for your argument. Its the actions of someone who doesn't really know what they are talking about and when confronted, immediately gets defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're making claims. You can't just make claims without providing some kind of supporting evidence. I read through your comment history and that appears to be your MO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regurgitating "facts" that you see on this subreddit or "alternate" news without researching it yourself doesn't do any good - for you or people who read your posts. You're doing a disservice by not truly investigating anything, but on the other hand forming such a definitive opinion because it fits into your overall narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I leave you alone, until I see another claim without some substantial factual backing. Cheers mate.

       I thought they used less than traditional farming, because many of the crops are resistant to some bugs and diseases. If thats the case, wouldnt they be better than traditional crops?

       It's not the GMO that's harmful, but the tons of RoundUp that's sprayed on those crops. The thing they're GMO'd to be immune against. However, the people who eat that food are not immune.

       In it, Chris Matthews overhears a woman shout that Obama is a communist.  He asks her to explain how.  She keeps parroting "just study it out, and you'll see.  Just study it out."  That's the "just study it out gambit" -- if someone challenges your claim, just kick back and demand that they do their own research, and imply that if they did so they'd see how right you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's rather what you're doing here.  "Look at the animal studies.  As well as the nutritional values."  Which animal studies?  All of them?  Where is there a study saying that the nutritional value of GMO food is lower than non-GMO?

       Not your problem to educate me, though; I should just study it out.

       The study you cited uses, as its source material, an anonymous e-mail sent to Moms Across America from someone named "Vince" who purportedly works in some capacity at a non-GMO seed producer (in what capacity we're not told).
      </p>
      <p>
       A few things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Moms Across America is not a source that I consider reliable.
       </li>
       <li>
        Moms Across America itself relies upon a guy named "Vince," who may not even exist.
       </li>
       <li>
        Assuming that he does exist and that he does work for a non-GMO corn producer, he has a material bias to discredit a competing product (in the same way that GMO corn producers have a material bias to be in favor of their own product).
       </li>
       <li>
        We don't know anything about Vince aside from that he claims to work at a non-GMO agricultural producer in some capacity (he may be their head of R&amp;D or he may be a dude that drives a combine harvester -- we just don't know).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This doesn't strike me as a very strong article.  I mean I believe that there are articles somewhere on the internet that support your position -- there are articles on the internet that support just about ANY position on any issue.  I'd be interested in knowing if you can point to anything peer-reviewed.

       There we go.  A 10 page shill reply.  The only pro gmo sources you can provide were sponsored by Monsanto.  I sure wonder why that is.  You speak of credibility as though you possess it.  GMO is poison.  Pure and simple.

       Just as with big asbestos, you'll parrot theory lies claiming the industry is safe, without any proof.  So easy to spot and disarm.

       My reply was nowhere near ten pages, and you know that; it was pretty succinct.  And you didn't address any of my criticisms to your horse shit lazily-researched "source."  You know that, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be very easy to argue when you just assume that every source available that runs contrary to your view is shill propaganda.  It does away with the nasty inconvenience of having to intellectually engage with dissenting views.  I read what you cited (I suspect you didn't).  It was laughable, and I told you why.  Your response was to declare yourself right, "pure and simple," and to preemptively hand-wave away any source I can cite as propaganda.  How am I supposed to have a discussion with you?

       I've seen far too many pro GMO shills write up page after page of lies.  While there are many Monsonto sponsored studies on human consumption of GMO foods, there is NOT ONE SINGLE INDEPENDENT, VERIFIED STUDY ON THE SAFETY OF GMO.  This speaks volumes.  I know how you behave.  I know the lies you spew.

       Yep that's pretty much what NDT says. And it presumes there's no difference a slow, natural evolutionary genetic change and the radical genetic mutation enable by laboratory manipulation. I can forgive you for overlooking this, for making this obviously flawed argument, but I can't forgive DGT. He's a smart guy. And he's a shill.

       So now I have to question everything he's ever said, which is quite a bummer. He seemed like a good guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: On the other hand, since he's clearly pushing an agenda rather than searching for truth, what things that he has said are impossible.. might actually be possible? That is the interesting question to me. One door closes, another one opens.

       That's not something he over looked. That's exactly why he says what he says. I (and him) can't fathom why you think random change is somehow safer than guided and directed change. That just goes against common sense.

       I'm not at all convinced of that. In fact I think they are for the most part scum bags controlled by corporate interests. What I am convinced of is the science. I myself know the science, it's fairly simple stuff to pick up and learn.

       Depending on the science, I agree. (MSME here.) But if you can't trust the messenger, you can't even trust that they're reporting the experimental results accurately. Or if results that contradict their desired outcome are simply unreported, how would you know?

       It's not something you can hand wave away. Trust is fundamental to the scientific process.

       No scientists do not do that, that is contrary to science itself. All dissenting studies are looked at very carefully and taken more seriously the more ground breaking they are. And once again the science is simply and can be learned. If you took the time to learn it you would see there is no danger.

       The science is already out there. Jesus christ I don't have to reinvent the wheel. I can't believe you are so dense. Inserting a gene into an organisms genome is far safer than breeding two plants and just hoping their wasn't some hidden mutation that produces some cancer causing protein. The likely hood of this happening is so low anyways but it is even less likely in a controlled environment such as a lab that to worry about it is foolish but even then because scientists are cautious they test and test and test. Why is that so hard for you to understand? How can you possibly suggest the old less precise method of selective breeding is better than the more precise route of genetic modification? What exactly are you worried about huh? Please tell what possible criticism you could have of the technique?

       You can't claim every once of science we know is all fabricated. Why don't you admit you are just too paranoid to look at something critically? You have no criticisms and can't find anything wrong with it. And even if I did go about reinventing the wheel you would claim i had been controlled by corporate interests. Just admit it, you hold an illogical position and nothing will change your mind because you are an idealogue and immune to evidence. Rediscovering dna wouldn't change your mind in the slightest.

       Exactly what I thought. You got a heavy case of cognitive dissonance but don't worry it can be overcome. Bias is natural but it's important to look at the facts and get over it so humanity can move forward. I'm aware genetic engineering is a scary word but just because it is scary it doesn't mean it is bad.

       Do you know how long people have been eating GMO's? Do you know, what the death toll is from GMO's? 0. There's no evidence that ANYTHING they do to the food is harmful, which is why It's not killed anyone. You need to understand the reasons why it's done, and that in the grand scheme of things, it's not really important. Should there be more oversight? More studies done? Yes. But with the systemic problems we have right now that can't even deal properly with immigration, let alone care about GMO Food. I'm 27 years old. I'm very sure I've eaten GMO food, along with organic food all my life. I have not ONE medical condition, or even a health scare. So I guess I, and tons of others like me are an anomaly? Nope, cause I actually pay attention to what I eat, work out, am straight edge, and do things, like get a flu shot every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we have a government that actually cares about it's people, and it's freedoms and rights, then maybe GMO's will be watched closer, but they pose almost no public health risk.

       Because science. Science is the true truth serum. Like Neil said, this has been happening for ages, when new sciences pop up. It's like Witchcraft to the villagers of old, until it's adopted as truth, as it should be. Look at Galileo. They hung him, and persecuted him for saying the earth orbited the sun, until he was proven right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because people, right now, to scare others into joining their school of thought, can skew the numbers any way they want, there's always a middle ground, and that's almost always where the real answer lies, and is proven to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they genetically modify food to last longer, have more taste, make more portions or grow bigger shouldn't be the issue (Think about the implications on feeding the hungry/poor). Should be the conditions of the animals that are butchered for us to eat that is the issue. I'm a meat eater. Not ashamed of it, but I know the animals aren't treated right, which I why I don't buy my meats from a store. I buy them locally, from a farm that butchers their own meat from their own animals. I buy everything else at the chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't always believe everything. However, with science, atleast that is trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean I approve of what they do, but I understand it, and understand that it's not as bad as made out to be, but still something to watch out for. In time it will be perfected, and then any potential harms it COULD cause, will fall by the wayside. We just need people we can trust to make it happen. Has nothing to do with the government, and it depends in the issue, whether I trust them or not. I go on facts. If they have the REAL facts, then yes, I do trust them. If they don't, like 9/11, then I don't.

       Science is truth, but science can be corrupted, especially where there is financial incentive to do so. And scientists can be corrupted. Without trust, you cannot ascertain the validity of any spokesperson, let alone any reports, let alone tests, let alone initial or operating conditions of those tests.

       It would be different if there was documented evidence of the harmfulness of GMOs, but it's lacking. That is not to say there isn't some harmful GMOs there just isn't any supporting evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a couple problems:
1. Why would you ignore everything someone says because you think they are incorrect on one point. Seems quite dramatic since no one is perfect. 
2. Wouldn't deliberate manipulations in a lab result in safer more accurate results then random ones occurring in nature?
3. Calling someone a swindler because you don't disagree with their position on a topic doesn't seem productive.

       Your comment is full of fallacies.  Niel de gas Tyson is a brainwashed narrow-minded fool. Reddit loves him that's proof enough for that conclusion. Reddit army soldiers pride themselves on scientific accuracy, and jerk themselves off to their own self proclaimed intellectualism. but they are so wrong and no where near understanding how the universe really functions.

       Hahahaha seriously, how is this the top voted comment?  It's a link to a Wikipedia article cataloging the space missions in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo program was obviously real.  They 100% launched rockets with men on them.  What is not so certain is what those men did in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone inclined to question the official government story, especially when it is related to war and spy matters, I have not seen the evidence necessary to convince me that the Apollo missions were legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conduct of NASA and other organizations in the years after the moon landing give me further reason to doubt the moon landings.  A few such actions which seem to reflect that the moon landings didn't take place (from another comment I made in this thread)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Despite all the technological development, no government or other organization has even seriously attempted to repeat what the US did 7 times almost 50 years ago.
        </li>
        <li>
         The US skipped a few steps before sending men round trip to the moon.  We never even had an unmanned craft go there and back prior to sending men.
        </li>
        <li>
         There has been a serious PR campaign in the recent years advocating that no one go near any of the moon landing sites to preserve lunar history.
        </li>
        <li>
         Technology developed specifically for the Apollo missions was scrapped by NASA after the mission.  They stopped development and use of the Rocket, Lander, and Rover, despite how wildly successful these project had been.

         Preserving the sites does not mean not letting anyone see them. Here's an animation made up of photos of apollo 11 lander taken on different passes by LRO in 2009

         Plenty of of technological development from the apollo program has been used: advancements in electronics and materials and more. And today's rocket engineers stand on the shoulders of the Saturn guys

       Whether the missions were real and succeeded doesn't change the fact that linking to a wiki list of space missions isn't proof of the landings.

       Edgar Mitchell says on his death bed the truth about the moon will come out. It will be nice to show you doubters I've been correct all along and will even ask my Dad ?s of you want. He and MANY OTHER Rocketdyne engineers knew their job was to get the Saturn into orbit and to fake a capsule splashdown... though others faked the water footage. Dads team just faked the LEM and command module.

       So you're a Holocaust denier with a grandfather who was totally in Auschwitz and can confirm that it was basically a summer camp, an antisemite who is totally Jewish, and a moon landing denier whose father totally worked on the project and can confirm that it was fake.

       Please people, stop trotting this out unless you are a "fringe" conspiracy theorist who secretly believes the Russians sent men to the moon.

      <p>
       The lunar laser retro-reflectors are real, but they are not proof that man walked on the moon, because the Russians placed their own retro-reflectors on the moon during their UNMANNED Lunokhod missions.

       Both the US as well as crimean astrophysical scientists did this many years prior to the beginning of the space race.  You post well debunked lies as cheap justifications for the clearly staged Apollo (and very likely Gemini missions as well).  Take your NASA apologist lies elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reference for those not in the know:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The MIT &amp; the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory both succeeded in bouncing lasers off the moon and back to earth - without retro-reflectors - long before Apollo 11.
"Four years ago, a ruby laser considerably smaller than those now available shot a series of pulses at the moon, 240,000 miles away. The beams illuminated a spot less than two miles in diameter and were reflected back to earth with enough strength to be measured by ultrasensitive electronic equipment" - 'The Laser's Bright Magic', Thomas Meloy. NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dec 1966
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And for the bafoons claiming Helium-3 proves the hoaxed Apollo landings, you may want to brush up further on basic science.  The Apollo missions allegedly drilled and sampled many dozens of sites and all kinds of various strata on the Moon, claiming the rock there was practically homogeneous.  This stood as gospel until the ESA impact, which proved they couldn't be further from the truth.  The idiots also found Earth water in ever claimed lunar sample.  Hmmm...I wonder why Von Braun was busy on an arctic expedition to collect meteorites just prior to the faked landings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To learn more, read up here.  Jarrah White has absolutely destroyed the Apollo hoax.  Every detail.  Every "proof" the apologists still spout is solidly debunked in his great body of work - MoonFaker.

       The Russian unmanned/robotic Luna missions (16/20/24) all brought back moon rock samples. Since they managed this without putting a man on the moon, this undermines your argument (quite literally).

       All? No, not according to the source you gave.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the source you gave, the first Russian sample return mission (Luna 16) was the year after the Apollo 11 landing.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They published the Apollo 11 Helium-3 to Helium-4 ratio analysis not long after the mission. My point is they could not have used any info published by the Russians to know the the ratios. You see there are those who think the published Apollo 11 data was faked at the time. But maybe not you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also my point is that, with the Russians so active at the time in trying to get a sample, they would have noticed the Americans doing the same thing. The Americans would not have been able to hide the radio signals for remote control of a robot.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I might not have to tell you this, but for the benefit of anyone bellow a certain age: the USSR and US were great enemies in what is known at the Cold War. And they were competing in a "Space Race". The Russians would have given anything to be able to cry foul at US faking anything. And they probably even had spies in NASA

       Do not bother trying to educate users like
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh
       </a>
       with actual evidence.  There is a very specific group of users on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       who's goal is to misinform, distract and waste the time of people who have the capacity think critically and analyse available evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my firm belief that there is a small subset of users on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       like
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh
       </a>
       who have the ultimate goal of making people here look both ignorant and incapable of being able to think for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This becomes more clear once you look at the posting history of these types of users, they merely exist to counter
       <strong>
        every single point
       </strong>
       of the orthodoxy with tired conjecture lacking evidence.  Once evidence is posted to the contrary, they simply disappear from the threads in order to move on to other topics and victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very clear in many of
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh
       </a>
       's posts about comet ISON, where there was zero evidence of what they were talking about, but
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh
       </a>
       chose only to contradict the scientific community with absolutely
       <strong>
        baseless

       assumptions.

       Once these types of users have their narrative dismantled, they just move on to whichever next topic is trending in the MSM and take the opposite viewpoint regardless of evidence or common sense.  It is very likely that the same thing will happen in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they do this?  The answers are simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       The support they garner perpetuates the stereotype that conspiracy theorists aren't critical thinkers, but rather simplistic contrarians.  They need to flood these forums with this viewpoint in order to discount any serious posts that manage to make it through their filter, thereby making any actual conspiracy seem illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many users like
       <a href="/u/Sabremesh">
        /u/Sabremesh

       on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , just look for anybody who
       <strong>
        immediately
       </strong>
       takes an opinion opposite of evidence on nearly every single issue.

       Mythbusters is unreliable. They also had an episode about thermite related to 9/11, but instead of engineering it for a controlled burn they just threw a pile of thermite on a car and then said it was a busted myth.

       Have you seen the rover tracks on the moon with a telescope?
      </p>
      <p>
       This claim is made every time the moon landing conspiracy is brought up.  It doesn't convince me at all to hear that "we landed on the moon, you can see what the astronauts left behind with a telescope."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't fucking see that shit with a telescope.  I can see giant ridges and craters through a telescope, but I can't see objects the size of a car.  Even if I had the most high-powered telescope and managed to point my scope at a landing site, it would only be in view for an instant due to the earth's rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do such obviously false claims become so popularly repeated?  I mean holy shit, if this is possible, has someone can someone snap a picture the next time they focus in on those moon footprints through their telescope please.

       The best way to see hardware left there is with photos taken from a probe in orbit of the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done by the LRO craft in 2012 for the apollo 11 site. Here is an animation made up of photos taken of the lander during different passes of LRO

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In fact, the astronauts' overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth's magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.

        Radiation was not an operational problem during the Apollo Program. Doses received by the crewmen of Apollo missions 7 through 17 were small because no major solar-particle events occurred during those missions. One small event was detected by a radiation sensor outside the Apollo 12 spacecraft, but no increase in radiation dose to the crewmen inside the spacecraft was detected.

       What evidence would they need to present to prove it to you?

       I don't think you need to learn astrophysics? Just need to use some common sense. Like for example: the Soviets were monitoring it closely, they had probes in orbit, and would have jumped at an opportunity to cry foul (USSR and US were in a "space race")

       I don't believe that we put men on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most compelling introductory argument I have watched regarding it being a hoax, can be found here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">
        A funny thing happened on the way to the moon
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching the video of the capsule taking off from the surface of the moon also seems fake.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOdzhQS_MMw">
        poor 1960's special effects
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the historical context of the mission, I can see the necessity for a hoax.  The motive would be that you had millions of men that had come back from fighting in WWII who were only in their 40's and still of fighting age.  This was a group of men who were familiar with destroying governments.  This was also the tax base that the US government relied upon to remain in power and fund NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this government had to convince this same war-weary tax base that they needed to hire a group of
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nazi-scientists-space-program-2014-2">
        Nazi scientists
       </a>
       to develop missile technology for the next war which would be nuclear.  That's a hard sell to the public 17 years after WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       This work could not be conducted in secret, so what feel good cover story could be used?   Hmm...  let's tell them that we are going to the moon!  What an exciting thing to talk about!!  We won't have to discuss that these missiles are being developed for WW III or are going to be used for nuclear missiles.  We can tell every school child that we are doing something fun, patriotic and for scientific purposes.   Don't pay attention to the Nazis on our tax-roll children, we are going to take dune buggies to the moon and drive them around!
      </p>
      <p>
       I leave room to admit that maybe I am wrong about this, but it seems very implausible to me that we had the technology to go to the moon, land, and come back in the mid 1960's.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more probable that NASA was a military research and development program that was sold to the US public as a peacetime scientific project.

       First manned moon landing was 1969 - apollo 11. There was a big long build up to it during most of the 60's, starting with JFK saying: "before the decade is out...". The apollo 1 mission was 1967. Apollo 8 is the first manned mission - just in orbt. And apollo 10 is known as the "dress rehearsal" for the landing, in which they orbited the moon, got into the lander module, and went into low ordit, but did not land.

       You know what, I think the Manhattan Project (first nuclear bomb) in the early 1940s was a far more impressive feet of engineering; it was over a shorter time frame
       <strong>
        and it was in the 40's
       </strong>
       . Not that i'm in favor of nuclear weapons.

       It's the Apollo 11 lander. Taken by the LRO probe when mapping the Moon. Each photo was taken during a different pass of the LRO. With each pass the LRO was in a slightly different orbit. Hence the impression of motion.

       It seems to have been put together by some Italian guy on his own initiative, using photos already published by NASA. Here's his website explaining how he made it:

       Maybe somebody could explain how the zero gravity video was faked? How were the astronauts filmed jumping in zero gravity? At the time, there was no way to fake slow motion on video. Please explain.

       I used to believe it was fake or the argument to support the fake was good and had some obvious points. Im prepared to accept we landed on the moon and people have been on it. Most of the shit afterwards was doctored for an audience. For me the main points i wanted answering are
      </p>
      <p>
       Van hallen belts - now ive seen the pages and pages of shit on this but im just no into all this and i dare say less than 1% of anyone who uses reddit for entertainment understands it either. So ill never know just how strong/weak this shit is but i know its done noone any favours here on earth even after small doses . . .and thats just for reading reddit . . .lol, i do mean radiation
      </p>
      <p>
       blast craters, dust and all that shit. man i make more of a mess with coke and mentos, seems all too clean to me, no mistakes were made. not only that the rovers seemed to make more of a mess with the dust . . .this was a fucking rocket . . .its got to be hot as fuck and blasty as fuck, man have yo ever turned on a hair dryer near a shelf with dust or anything light . . like all my files for work . . . yeah ragex30 and u cant be arsed to sort it all out
      </p>
      <p>
       some of the videos of them moving especially the one where it looks like hes being lifted . . .need explanation for this as ive seen no debunk yet
      </p>
      <p>
       400000 employees not knowing. Bit difficult this but i do believe if you arent told anything and do what you are told to do, ive gone through most of my working career only to hear people around me later when they leave or i leave the shit what was going on and i didnt know, so yeah, will fool 80% i suppose if all u care about is your own actual life and the time you spend it . . (says while on a conspiracy subreddit . . . )
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology. Man. I just cant have it for one minute that this shit worked mostly flawlessly, yes some of it blew up and people died but . . hmm, its too much for me all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brilliant photos . . .fuck all of the lighting and all that shit, they are too perfect, one dude even said there was too much dust on everything what came back, my old polaroids and cameras with film got fucked just going to the beach (showing my age here) in ENGLAND . .  .naww im not having this either, they are human, cumbersome suits. again this is too much. one of the best videos is when the dude snags himself and fucks all the equip up . . .now this is real life baby . . more of this shit please. on that vid alone i call TRUTH behind the whole thing as how can you see or really know what the fucks going on . . he didnt, on earth ud have stopped long before you fucked the whole thing up . . .even in a space suit . . . trust me, ive been on loads of stag do's, space suits . . .liberating!
      </p>
      <p>
       and finally my main one i just need an answer for is WHY cant we just get a new photo right now of all the shit, i can get a pretty good view of thew moon on a £30 telescope, of course there is no detail really but you can see the craters . . .now then, have you seen that shit nasa have . . . . i would expect they could tell the time off someones watch here on earth from one of the satellites . . or have i just watched way too much 24. come on. picture of all the shit HD right now plz, release this, all put to rest!

       I'm not Playaguy but I feel I can clarify this very well as that is my position on this entire landing hoax scenario: It really was a bit of both:
      </p>
      <p>
       Start by acknowledging the flat out manic attitude between USSR and USA at the time. Constantly trying to one-up the other by any means possible. These guys were not playing very nice with each others. yes? Protecting their secrets from their enemy is a big deal to these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the reality of the Apollo program. Very ambitious and riding on the ragged edge of all sorts of science fields. The stakes are high.
      </p>
      <p>
       The astronauts were adamant that the simulators were to be setup absolutely and completely in a realistic manner. Every. single. little. silly. minute. fucking tiny details had to be EXACTLY like the real spacecraft would be. The point being, if the sim does not provide (as close as possible) 100% fidelity to the real thing, any training in it would be moot and amount to little more than over-qualified childs playing pretend-spaceships. The establish the simulators as
       <em>
        virtually undistinguishable
       </em>
       from the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TV/radio broadcasters were NOT ALLOWED access to the live feed of the spacecraft. They had to show whatever it is NASA is relaying to them. That didn't stop the russians, tho. Of course it didn't. You best believe they had their entire SIGINT apparatus intently focused on sucking up every little bit of informations they could out of that ship. Following on this, knowing the russians didn't even try to call out USA on this "hoax" speaks loudly enough. Remember the manic attitudes of theirs? That alone, to me, is proof enough. There really was a spacecraft on it's way to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is where the fun starts. I deem it likely that a team was running the mission in parallel using the sims/studios in Arizona/whatever. The replay allowed control over what is shown and isn't on TV while providing a "screen" against accidentally broadcasting top secret stuff on LIVE TV for the russians to rummage over. It's just plain good commun sense, really. Imagine something gone wrong up there. Anything at all! The virtue of having a team running the mission in parallel in their ULTRA realistic sims facilitate troubleshooting and solution finding that much more. It's no luxury. Just plain good old USA common sense. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       The relay also doubles as a guarantee against the prospect of showing the death of American heroes on LIVE television, should a disaster occur. You would do well to understand that, back then, morality codes of conducts were quite different. A woman merely exposing the skin of her ANCKLE could've been enough to provoke the apocalypse!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, there it is. Apollo 11 happened. Point blank. Some key parts the mission were, probably, broadcasted from the simulator as per the reasons I mentioned. Some keen eyes spotted the fakery and started to analyse every little details ever, often to a fault, in the hope of making sense of things. The landing hoax angle DOES have a root in reality, somehow, yet it is, ultimately, false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ima go right ahead and I assume this clears things up a good deal.

       I don't really deal with the moon landing conspiracy because I feel like it's irrelevant and a possible red herring.  Anyways, I have seen a rebuttle that shows that NASA doesn't have the technology currently to make it to the moon, and the suites they would need would be to heavy.  This was a comment on r/conspiracy with links supporting all of their claims, maybe someone else may know what I'm referring to.

       A few points. The International Space Station is in near earth orbit, a mere 300km above the Earth's surface. This is a tiny fraction of the distance - just 0.08% - of the distance from our planet to the moon (384,000km). Hardly comparable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition the ISS is so close to Earth, it is protected from solar radiation by the Earth's electromagnetic shield, whereas a moon mission would have to travel through the radiation of the Van Allen Belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, sending unmanned missions to the Moon, Mars, comets etc are not the same as sending humans. The Russians have sent numerous unmanned craft to the Moon, Mars etc and have never taken the risk of sending a human being more than 1,000km from the surface of the Earth. Any idea why?

       And that's why his radiation detectors when entering the same radiation belts the alleged Apollo astronauts entered, even while lead coated, maxed out and all broke.  Sensors capable of handling the rads from fatal atomic blasts, yet couldn't even begin to stand the belts he discovered.  Not to mention, the ONLY men to have EVER passed through the belts were magically all on Apollo.  Not a single person has since.  Sounds perfectly believable to me.

       That's interesting. If you are correct about that then that would certainly be evidence the mission was faked. Where did you come across that info? I'd like to check it out further.

       The point about ISS was that we have people in space, and those people need to be able to perform maintenance on it (spacesuits). The probe landing on the comet shows that we can accurately launch and adjust to land on an object VERY far away. (precision). The moon landing being a hoax/conspiracy is a wild accusation that stemmed from disbelief and ignorance.

       I'm all for space travel and I don't see any reason anyone would fake it other than the cold war bs that was going on.  But still I think we can do it with the tech we have now for sure.  As long as they hire the right people to program the computers and not outsource for the cheapest morons out there... we may have a chance.

       I don't believe that the Apollo missions took men to the moon.  I've tried arguing this here before, but
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seems to overwhelmingly believe otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without going very deep, a few things which have shaped my opinion include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Despite all the technological development, no government or other organization has even seriously attempted to repeat what the US did 7 times almost 50 years ago.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The US skipped a few steps before sending men round trip to the moon.  We never even had an unmanned craft go there and back prior to sending men.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There has been a serious PR campaign in the recent years advocating that no one go near any of the moon landing sites to preserve lunar history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Technology developed specifically for the Apollo missions was scrapped by NASA after the mission.  They stopped development and use of the Rocket, Lander, and Rover, despite how wildly successful these project had been.

       You are incorrect. There were unmanned missions to the moon before apollo 11. And also manned missions: apollo 8 and 10 were trial runs

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Preserving the sites does not mean not letting anyone see them. Here's and animation made up of photos of apollo 11 lander taken on different passes by LRO in 2012
       <a href="http://jumpjack.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/anim5b.gif">

       And no doubt there will be better and close ones taken in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of of technological development from the apollo program has been used: advancements in electronics and materials and more.

       The moon landing footage was certainly faked. But we had been to the moon long prior to that footage. The moon landing  was staged to serve as a limited hangout so that the public wouldn't guess at the real level of development in technology.
you simply cant travel in space with the technology that was shown.
once you understand how the "hidden" side of science works then certain physical restraints are no longer present.
We have traveled to mars and all the other planets, and beyond our solar system, probably at this point.

       We're supposed to believe that they would live film and broadcast such a mission to millions of Americans? So many variables and uknowns.
it all went too perfectly to be believable in anyway.

       You're forgetting that this was in the late 60's... This was a huge event for the world. They would definitely make it as 'live' as possible. There's the delay, plus the extra delay they add on to cut the feed if something bad happens in realtime.

       Exactly. A HUGE event. If something would have gone wrong we'd be embarrassed as a nation. The only way they are live broadcasting anything is if they know it is going off without a hitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option A: the feed is real, actually shot on the moon, but on a previous trip, with plenty of cuts between shots, making a highlight reel to call live tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option B: the government had been to the moon enough times to confidently feel they could recreate the surface in a studio.  They shot the perfect event to be broadcast across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option C: the feed is real. Happening live. Unfolding before the world's eyes. Anythig could happen. Anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option D: the whole thing was made up. The US was worried someone else would beat them, so they thought they'd just fucking lie to everyone and see if they could get away with it. They thought, "who's so hot right now?" - " Stanley Kubrick" - "let's get him to fake a moon landing movie because he makes other good movies"

       First of all, there are mirrors/other objects left behind that you can see with a telescope RIGHT NOW that prove it.

      <p>
       Secondly, given how our "government" loves to spend untold hundreds of billions on black budget off the books kinds of things, I would assume we landed on the moon sometime in the last 40 years. Not a difficult assumption to make when you have the motive and an unlimited budget....

       I am afraid this is flat out wrong. No telescope is powerful enough to identify man-made objects on the moon from Earth. Prove me wrong with a link to some images?

       Secondly, the Russian

        unmanned
       </strong>
       Lunokhod missions left retro-reflectors on the moon. These still work RIGHT NOW, so to argue that this is "proof" that men walked on the moon is again, wrong.

       So you are only making a wild assumption. And isn't it possible to put mirrors on the moon the same way that unmanned rovers are landed on celestial bodies? It doesn't require a human to set it on the moon by hand.

       The "moon landings" were so obviously shot on a sound stage it's not even funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       There didn't even need to be a HUGE number of people involved in the conspiracy...they sent those Saturn V SOMEWHERE all right--it just wasn't past the Van Allen belts. Take a look at the "LEM"--if you really...really...think that could make it to the moon while somehow supporting a throttled 10,000lb engine, TONS of non-hypergolic fuel, climate-control equipment, science experiments, food, water, and a MILLION other things...then you are on psychedelic drugs. That thing wouldn't hold up for a town parade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge you to read "Wagging the Moondoggie" by Dave McGowan--its free on his site...and WHY all of the tomfoolery if it were "only" a moon mission??
      </p>
      <p>
       It costs A LOT less money to pretend to fly to the moon than to ACTUALLY fly there--money which then could go to funding black CIA ops in the US and Vietnam--which is where it went.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR--NO MAN has ever been on the moon nor will be until the Van Allen belts' challenge can be beat...and that is that. Sorry moon-story circlejerkers--I'm an old guy and America WAS once that great...but even then the tech to do a moon mission didn't exist and STILL doesn't.

       Doesn't look like it to me. What looks fake about it?

       Actually, based on 1969 technology it would have been easier to do it for real than fake it. It would be extremely difficult to fake it even today. It's not just footage and photos that had to be faked.

       <li>
        <p>
         It is not possible to simulate one 6th gravity movements of astronauts using either harnesses nor slow motion. No one have managed to reproduce the same effect seen in the footage. If it's fake then they did it perfectly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the soviets did not notice fakery in radio comms despite them monitoring closely - they had probes around moon (they were in a space race with the US and would have cried foul).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moon rock samples. Detailed scientific analysis was publish not long after. The results hold up to scrutiny today.

       Oh come on. You can do better than that. I thought you would hit me with something trickier. I'm quite familiar with that story of the dutch museum moon rock turning out to be petrified wood.

       I KNOW that in the 60s all we had was lead. My dad was a Rocketdyne engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing, my dad and a cadre of about 50 engineers thought this was COMPLETE B.S. and they were at Canaveral all day every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad also tells me that the fact that SEVEN HUNDRED CARTONS of mag tape, recordings, telemetry, blueprints... basically every scrap of proof man went to the moon... it is now ALL conveniently lost. No backups were made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even NASA said it two years ago... the 400 mile mark will remain beyond man's grasp until they can figure out the radiation shielding. It was a slip up but a quite telling one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know if you were around in the 60s but there was no internet, nobody knew about space except the astronomers and physicists, we threw down to the Russians and they KICKED OUR ASSES.

       Except when it can time to that moon program then that shit worked 10/10 times!

        Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.

       If it is self-evident then it should be very easy for you to explain it. So please do.

       To me it is self evident they went to the Moon. And I will explain it:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is not possible to simulate one 6th gravity movements of astronauts using either harnesses nor slow motion. No one have managed to reproduce the same effect seen in the footage. If it's fake then they did it perfectly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the soviets did not notice fakery in radio comms despite them monitoring closely - they had probes around moon (they were in a space race with the US and would have cried foul).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moon rock samples. Detailed scientific analysis was publish not long after. The results hold up to scrutiny today.

       Yeah I said this before deleting my comment then I looked up how far that comet was...
       <a href="http://euobserver.com/news/126499">
        500 million KM away

       I just didn't delete quick enough to

       I'm all for space travel and I don't see any reason anyone would fake it other than the cold war bs that was going on.  But still I think we can do it with the tech we have now for sure.  As long as they hire the right people to program the computers and not outsource for the cheapest morons out there... we may have a chance.

       I have no strawmen. I have one single argument that I have not changed. It hasn't change. You are projecting. Please come up with one criticism. All you can do is ask me to reinvent the wheel but that is not at all reasonable or a criticism.

       Exactly what I thought. You got a heavy case of cognitive dissonance but don't worry it can be overcome. Bias is natural but it's important to look at the facts and get over it so humanity can move forward. I'm aware genetic engineering is a scary word but just because it is scary it doesn't mean it is bad.
