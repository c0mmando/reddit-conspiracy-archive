        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have no proof but this is just an idea.</p>

<p>So roundabouts are more efficient than the typical stoplight. Cars can keep moving and sit still for less time. They also typically don&#39;t have to come to a complete stop. Because of this in town fuel economy goes up.</p>

<p>Well these are all good reasons for roundabouts to exist except for one group of people... Oil companies. See I have a feeling that oil companies are lobbying against roundabouts and are pushing the less efficient stop lights. This means commuters have to spend more time sitting still burning fuel and getting no where. It&#39;s just a tiny amount of fuel spent at each stop light but take that times the total number of cars at each stop light and how many stop lights there are and that is a lot of fuel burned getting no where.</p>

<p>Plus the cars still have to burn the fuel to get where they were going. Add all this together and it means it is in the oil companies advantage for roundabouts to not exist.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Questions? I have no proof that this is the case but it sort of makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the real conspiracy is how the oil manufacturers destroyed the american public trandeportation system so that we would all have to buy cars. But then again, there&#39;s a fascinating history to how americans we trained with the invention of the automobile to stop treating roads as public space to congregate.  At what point was the &quot;sidewalk&quot; invented, or the stoplight?  I know that there&#39;s a town in Sweden or around there that converted to roundabouts completely but also took out all the stop signs and lights. The idea was that drivers would have to look at each other rather than at signs, and as a result not only have accidents gone down but the whole town has grown closer through their directly interactions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would tend to agree, although I grew up in Massachusetts and they have a bunch of round abouts.  There is even a large one in Concord, MA on route 2, and most of those roads were made due to horse trails.  Just saying, it doesn&#39;t explain the lack of round abouts on the west coast... Although they have recently been installing them in the Richmond District of San Fransisco, mainly in the AVE&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible, but the work started much much earlier in the culture of Americans, big cars, big roads, cheap oil... It could be that after all this it&#39;s just not the mindset of the people as a whole. In the early days of cars you were crazy if you insisted on letting them inside cities, fast forward today you are crazy if you argue that they should not come inside cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hated Austin Texas when I drove their. But the worst town I&#39;ve been to has been Hays KS. It doesn&#39;t make any sense and it shouldn&#39;t even be that hard to get around because it&#39;s not that big of a town. It&#39;s like they never upgraded their road ways from the early 1900&#39;s and when the town grew they just randomly added streets on. The naming makes no sense, the direction the streets go makes no sense, and the speed limits make no sense.</p>

<p>They have a residential street with the speed limit of 45 yet their main street has a 30 mph speed limit. Don&#39;t even get me started about their stop light system and turn lanes.</p>

<p>Actually now that I think about it I just hate all Kansas road ways. I used to have to do deliveries in northern Kansas all the time and even though I was there almost daily I still couldn&#39;t figure out how the hell they arranged their roads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonono. Two things defeat US roundabouts. First, our transport trucks reach 75&#39; long. The fifties are very common and just can&#39;t take the turns. It&#39;s simply easier to blast straight through, destroying the center landscaping. Efforts to make this impossible have resulted in expensive high-centered big rigs. Second, roundabouts are, not to put a fine point on it, unamerican. They are introduced to a culture that stopping is the response to unfamiliar or uncertainty. Granny pulls up to this weird garden in the road... And stops. So much for efficiency and fuel savings.</p>
