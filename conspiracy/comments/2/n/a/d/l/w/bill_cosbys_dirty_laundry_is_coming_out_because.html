       Media is owned by six companies and they are primarily Jewish own/run. They did not want Bill to have this much power. So, they brought out all his dirty laundry. None of the accusations would hold up in court and the accusers know this.

       Then you're not a good sleuth. So, tell you what...I'll lead this horse to water. Find out how many media outlets he shopped his new show to. All of them didn't get pitched. Name the one he didn't pitch and then i'll know your a good sleuth and will give you item two to search. There are three items in total that lead to this conclusion.

       If the information is out there you should have no problem providing it.   Its not the responsibility of the reader to verify claims you make.   Without providing a source(s)
Its all just BS and this thread is useless.

       You make a fairly bold claim and when other people tell you they cant find any information on it you get defensive.

       I have no idea how the posting system works. I know that companies and gov't pay people to upvote/downvote things that interest them. There are a lot of journalist who scope this site for stories but they want you to do their work for them. SO, when u make them work for it, they downvote the hell out of you.  THis is a hot story right now and I think journalists are mad at me for not giving them detailed information. It's out there they just have to look for it. I'm in a compromised position and can give it to them so they punish me.

       i thought about that, but there's supposed to be evidence that he had an 'assistant' pay (at least) 8 young women with money orders, (who were supposedly from a modeling agency, the owner was aware),
      </p>
      <p>
       "And, last but not least, former longtime NBC facilities manager Frank Scotti came forward and told the New York Daily News that he personally delivered thousands of dollars on Cosby’s behalf to women, some of whom were being paid $2,000 a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scotti claims that Cosby was having sex with the women he was allegedly paying off. “Why else would he be sending money?” Scotti told the Daily News. “He was sending these women $2,000 a month. What else could I think?” According to the article, Scotti provided the paper with four money orders allegedly detailing payouts to women—including one bearing Angela Leslie’s name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scotti, who is now 90 and living in Lakewood, New Jersey, also claimed that a Manhattan modeling agency would provide Cosby with young women in his dressing room, some of whom were as young as 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       “He had everybody fooled,” Scotti said. “Nobody suspected.”

       so this brings up other questions, who was molested and who took money to keep quiet about it, it's all very sordid, i believe this happens all the time in the 'industry', just a sad story for all involved.

       What I find interesting is that apparently Bill Cosby is history's greatest "get em drunk and rape em" artist, having apparently done it some twenty plus times and never having any of these women go to the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd imagine these women slept with Cosby, regretted it when he didn't call them back or give them lavish gifts and now found a way to get back at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how NOT ONE of his "victims" went to the police.

       Come on; read an article or two. Several women did go to the police. Also, just for a moment, be realistic. How many people are going to believe you (back in the 60s--90s, when he was very popular) if you tell them that Bill Cosby drugged and raped you.

       I've said a lot of the same to others regarding this. Truth is none of us really know what happened because it's so "he said/she said" but I've commented on how I think it's pretty damn strange that out of his two dozen or so "victims" not a single one of them said anything (
       <em>
        and some of these accusations are from decades ago
       </em>
       ) until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I mention that I get shit about it like I'm some kind of rapist sympathizer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell maybe the guy is a rapist but these accusations are pretty suspect in my opinion. I'd have to go back and double-check but one of the ladies said he offered her three mysterious blue pills as a decongestant when she was complaining about allergies or something. Don't you think if you had allergies you'd have a pretty good idea of what most decongestants look like and why would take three all at once? You have allergies you should know how many to take and what they look like? And why are you taking strange pills from someone you don't really know that well whether he is a celebrity or not? If anyone offered me 3 rando pills I'd be like "um... no I'm good".

       That said, it still came out decades after the alleged rapes, and the accusations are suspect based on that.  I'm not sure what to think on this, just correcting a minor point.   I think your overall point is a good one.

       I don't think he's innocent BUT I think "Hollywood" has a "casting couch" system and these women got bitter that the outcome wasn't to their liking. So, a POWERFUL person rounded them up offered them cash to bring these stories forward.

       Good point because I do not know who's behind it exactly. For those who know Bill Cosby, he's a real asshole BUT a smart businessman. Media is all about controlling the message and those in the know understand that the message is controlled by a very minute few.
