       Here's
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man">
        the wiki page.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I may buy it and read the book, but beforehand I wanted to make sure it wasn't some bullshitter trying to cash in on people's gullibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; Thank you for your input people. I will be buying this book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unrelated; By the way, figured I'd give a little input about
       <em>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhv01/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver20/">
         Reddit being destroyed
        </a>
       </em>
       since there's that submission at the top of the front page. Thought I'd give my two cents since I've got some visibility I can exploit on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Reddit was absofuckinlutely censored and became controlled strictly. I've been here since the fall of Digg, and I can tell you this website's admins and most popular subreddits are some real bad jokes. They've been selling us readers bullshit for a few years now, slowly but surely. They'll censor anybody they please, and they'll take whatever commenting/posting rights away that they want; as long as it's to their benefit, and it pleases those behind closed doors. I've witnessed this for a long time now, so I know it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when Reddit claimed it wanted to get on a path to profitability. Well great job, you did it. You also killed free speech in the process. Cunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that guy's submission above is right; but it's not like most here didn't already know this stuff. Sorry to hijack my own thread, but I felt like it. Still will be buying that book. Watch out for the thought police friends.

       The basis is sound and the majority of the book is accurate in terms of the history that it talks about, as far as I've looked into them. However, Perkins does seem to hype and exaggerate his own position a couple of times that I remember, and due to his more recent publications, and his new found spirituality, some may consider him a charlatan that printed a book catering to the progressive base and appeal to what most progressives complain about.
       <br/>
       That is not to say the book isn't any good, I enjoyed it and Perkins does bring valid insight from his work, just remember the biases involved.
       <br/>
       The overall phenomena is true, remember United Fruit, Costa Rica and Honduras? That's were we get the term "banana republic" from.

       Exactly this. Author places himself right in the center of many global shift events and his constant pangs over what he was achieving and helping accomplish sound like after the fact justifications. Still, a very enlightening read that anyone can see has the overall method of USA interventionist politics down pat.

       I have read the book and found it fascinating. I tried to debunk it but found that his point of view could be reasonably substantiated and was very possibly a realistic and fairly reasonable world view, although there is much that can be debated I think it's important to realize that a large segment of the population probably sees the world from a similar point of view. Somewhat regrettably, some of his more recent work leans toward, if I recall, shamanism, making it easier for skeptics to scoff at Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, which I personally think is a shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a bit of a skeptic I would say that it's completely worth the read, EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE, specifically because it will help you to understand the world view of many many people. it may help you to bridge the gap between opposing views,

       I highly recomend the book The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. It discusses alot of the things Perkins talks about first hand in Confessions, but is alot more researched and objective. Its a big one though.

       The Shock Doctrine is one of the better books I have read in the last few years. I read it shortly after it came out toward the end of Bush's occupation of The White House. I have been a fan of Naomi Klein ever since.

       I really enjoyed it. Perkins was at the forefront of some truly historic events (creation of the US/Saudi alliance &amp; Iranian revolution amongst others) so there's plenty of interesting stuff in there. A lot of it might seem far fetched but I don't doubt Perkins' credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a few reviews on Amazon that bemoaned the book because Perkins spends a lot of time talking about his struggle with the morality of what he was doing. Given the title of the book, though, I'm not quite sure what they were expecting as it's essentially a memoir. If you keep that in mind then I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

       It was a good read. I don't know how much of Perkins' recollections can be considered 100% truthful, but the fact of the matter is that the IMF, World Bank et al. make loans to developing countries that create inter-generational poverty and this is likely done by design.

       It's awesome. But in that book, he uses alot of "industry jargon" and it's kinda heady.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would start with his follow-up book, "The Secret History of the American Empire: The Truth About Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and How to Change the World"

       I scanned Perkins book, and understood what he had been hired to do...and then found the ultimate confirmation from Karen Hudes, fmr atty for the World Bank (for 20 years.)  fired for whistleblowing on exactly what Perkins was writing about.  chk her wb site and fb postings, usually in pdf...hard to read she is a precise attorney.

       Look up "Pachamama Alliance".  Full on Global Consciousness PsyOp.  "Tikkun Olam" (Hebrew-Qabalah). "The Force". Typical Do-good Western elite "partnering" with indigenous groups for "sustainability"  and all that jazz that is so hip these days, especially in SanFrancisco (current seat of Illuminati social conscience).

       Don't let other peoples opinion determine what is and isnt bullshit before you read it for yourself. If the dust jacket sparks your interest at all, you should read it for yourself and decide for yourself if it is bullshit or not.

       In the interviews and stuff I've seen with Perkins, he seems like a legit guy who knows what he's talking about. But the one thing I don't understand is that he said he worked for the NSA, even though the NSA doesn't do that type of covert ops stuff. NSA does all the crypto stuff thats come to light in recent years. If he said CIA it would make more sense since they've been caught doing that kind of garbage numerous times, but yeah.

       The NSA does alot of things, they are Signals Intelligence. And alot of Intelligence work has to do with economics, hence Perkins involvement in economic firms during his off the books work for them. Multiple government agencies are alot more redundant between each other on the thins they do than people think. Theres an entire branch of the DHS being funded with tens of millions of dollars to deal with biological threats, and alot of the personell hired are people that are unnessecary. They could have just set up a small office to collaborate with the CDC.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to remember that when alot of these branches of the government were created they were created in a world where each military branch had previously had its own intelligence sector. They were very untrusting of each other, replicated alot of work other branches were doing to keep the results and conclusions in house, and for alot of the cold war viewed each other as having been potentially infiltrated by the communists. Alot of actions taken illegally in the 50s 60s and 70s were parts of behind the scenes struggles between the DOD, CIA, NSA, and FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the CIA helped set up the National Students Association, the FBI thought it was a communist plot to start exposing our college students to communistsic propaganda and ways of thinking. In my opinion it was a way to establish a position to begin grooming politlcal leaders they can control. I highly suggest you download the Church Committee Reports and at least pick through the sections on the history of the CIA and others branches. It really establishes context for alot of things.

       He didn't work for the NSA. He worked at MAIN, then did some consultancy (from memory, I think he was a professional witness who attested to the benefits of foreign aid), then I think he founded a non-profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his father-in-law (or someone like that) worked for the NSA and played a major part in Perkins accepting an EHM role with MAIN.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding of the book is that the CIA are the "jackals" that Perkins refers to on a few occasions. They are the ones who are called in if the EHM process fails (and if the CIA fails then it's military action, as was the case with Panama).

       Edit: grammar.

       i live in croatia (east european post communist country passing a transition since 90ties) which is now a raped country, economicaly. while reading the book i was shocked to read exactly the same pattern he's talking about with corrupt politics, corupted parties, money flow, targeting coruptive governments and leading them into "strategic projects", projects that the nation doesnt have the money for, but the plan is to let the money gone with the wind by the corrupt government and the rest is a nation on a leash (or a chain), etc. the pattern was applied to south american countries at a given time (passing from dictatorships into democracies) and he's not relating to east europe in any way but everyone here could recognize the same pattern. thrilling book especially for people in thirld world countries.

       It's good, it shows you how the evil empire really functions. "Remember what happened to that other politician who didn't do what our corporations wanted or didn't play ball? You can either be in power and enrich yourself and your whole family or lose everything" is the way people like John Perkins put it to presidents and politicians of other countries.

       It's the modern version of Smedley Butler's
       <em>
        War Is A Racket
       </em>
       .  It's exactly analogous, except that Perkins is not a Marine Corps major general.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first book is told as a narrative story without substantiation although it illustrates the framework of how the international mechanisms function.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second book is more of a good starting point for initiates, IMO.  Both books are important and valuable.  So is
       <em>
        The Shock Doctrine
       </em>
       as a good companion piece to the Perkins books.
