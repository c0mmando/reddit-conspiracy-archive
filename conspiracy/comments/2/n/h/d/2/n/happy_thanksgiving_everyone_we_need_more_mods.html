<p>To nominate someone, reply to this thread with something like...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I nominate <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a>, I feel like they would be a good mod.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the person you wish to nominate has already been nominated, there is no need to make a new post nominating them, simply up vote the already existing nomination and feel free to reply to that nomination with any information or words of encouragement you would like to add.</p>

<p>The two most up voted nominations will become the new mods with one small exception.  Nominations must also have at least one existing mod vouch for them, this is to avoid any fuckery that may be afoot from certain groups that like to organize voting.</p>

<p>If a person has already been nominated and someone else makes a new post nominating the same person a second time, we will be deleting the lowest voted instance of that person&#39;s nomination to avoid any confusion.</p>

<p>New mods need to understand that we do not moderate content, we only moderate behavior as outlined by the rules.  </p>

<p>If you are nominated and have ZERO interest in being a mod, let us know and we will delete your nomination.</p>

<p>Feel free to throw your own name in the hat as well, something like...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would be interested in being a mod here because I have some free time and I believe in what this community stands for.  Etc etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be a great asset if someone willing to assist with the coordination of AMAs was to become a new mod.</p>

<p><strong>We really really need some people from the UK/European time zones to step up.  We have poor mod coverage for the peak hours of those time zones.</strong></p>

<p>I was going to nominate her before I ever went into the comment section  anyway, and then saw when I saw Flytape using less than subliminal propaganda methods, he must have read about somewhere, to influence the voting I had my prejudice validated for me just like I am sure he planned. I&#39;m a Kool-Aid drinker by nature, so I just blindly pushed the <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a> button and fell in line with the circle-jerk subreddit groupthink.</p>

<p>Being a mod at conspiracy entails checking the &quot;mod queue&quot; which is kind of like an inbox where posts and comments have been reported, caught by a spam filter or otherwise needs approval/dismissal.</p>

<p>There is also mod mail where community members message /conspiracy and all the mods can see those mail conversations.</p>

<p>Lastly there is our rules and enforcement thereof and we also sometimes exchange recipes for beef butt and peanut butter cookies.</p>

<p>He <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/">single-handedly discovered Davidreiss&#39;s autofilter list that had been setup in /r/technology</a>; and facilitated turning that sub into a bastion of free flowing content, as opposed to the censored&#39;s wasteland it was under David and friend&#39;s stewardship.</p>

<p>The amount of users within the meta who enjoy defaming Creq&#39;s character is a testament to his  prowess for opposing the aims of certain factions within reddit inc, and it is my opinion that he would make for a good moderator on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I vote <strong><em>against</em></strong> gayunicom6969, if they have been nominated or have expressed an interest in being a Mod here. </p>

<p>Why? because they support the nomination of AE911Truth who does NOT I repeat does NOT represent and is not affiliated with that organization, or Richard Gage, yet was the same one who set up that recent farce of an AMA with what has been determined to be a Richard Gage sock puppet with Richard himself indicating that he&#39;s never done an AMA on reddit. </p>

<p>This can be verified by contacting Richard Gage via his organization, which I suggest the mods here do forthwith.</p>

<p>Best regards, </p>

<p>NAM007</p>

<p>P.S. No I don&#39;t want to be a mod, don&#39;t have the skillset or the time.  </p>

Some troll is jumping on some perceived doubt about Richards AMA and sucked you in.  </p>

<p>Do you not find it remotely suspicious that PilotsforTruth - a banned troll account - made this claim, with no evidence except a copypasta of a supposed email (yeah right...thats about as convincing as NISTs reports!)...  </p>

<p>and then <em>&#39;coincidentally&#39;</em> welder621 shows up having NEVER posted before... with a less than a month old account claiming exactly the same thing, at exactly the same time.  </p>

<p>A few users demanded proof. None was given. At all.</p>

<p>E: My link was intended to show <em>a</em> &#39;Richard Gage&#39; answering a question in the exact same way disinformation experts frame the debate. Not sure why your retort below distorts my link. Look at the response from &#39;Richard Gage&#39; on WTC7:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NIST have said that they wont share their data for safety reasons. This is frustrating.
However: what we at AE911truth can do is develop our own models. As we dont have the tools or resources that NIST do, it will take more time.
But developing our own models is possible without dependency on NISTs fraudulent data.
When we compare our more accurate model to their&#39;s we will force them to the table, so to speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would appreciate your contribution as a mod. Pretty sure you wouldn&#39;t have dropped the ball on such an important event. I&#39;m pretty sure if you are who you say, that would be a huge red flag of an answer by &#39;Richard.&#39;</p>

<p>But then again, you have no proof that Richard did in fact show up for that AMA. So if your first and most important impression is to say &#39;<strong>trust me,</strong>&#39; then maybe you aren&#39;t the right person for the job.</p>

<p>I mean, <em>you</em> did just come back today, of all days, to throw your hat in the ring. How do we know you&#39;re <a href="/u/gayunicorn6969">/u/gayunicorn6969</a>? Get my drift?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s incredibly important and not well served by the large amounts of spam that clogs the new queue. Look at one of the top posts yesterday, an age-old piece of rubbish about Putin and 9/11. Add that to the rampant bigotry and general hyper-sensitivity to criticism and/or questioning and you&#39;ve got a sub with a bad reputation. Some of it deserved, some of it not.</p>

<p><a href="/r/WorldNews">/r/WorldNews</a> isn&#39;t as bad as it is painted here. <a href="/r/con">/r/con</a> posters go there looking for pre-existing concerns to be validated and surprise surprise they find what they are looking for. Yeah WorldNews is bad, but it&#39;s not exactly a subdivision of the Big Bad MSM. Use of which as a term is sort of silly.</p>

<p><a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> is exactly what you would expect from a large politics forum, lots of shouting and mutualargument stroking. And so easy to ignore. Pretending that what happens in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is important leads this sub down rabbit holes that aren&#39;t there.</p>

<p>Uhm. OK. Or perhaps <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t Fortress Logic and instead is a forum with the problems of any large forum that shares some ideological space with racist spamlords and overly-credulous paranoids.</p>

<p>OK. I&#39;m in roughly the same time zone, maybe one hour ahead of London.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the recent developments regarding the hoaxed Richard Gage AMA, and the discovery of compromised reddit accounts, be very careful and cautious as to who gets to be a mod. </p>

<p>If you have one compromised mod, others could climb aboard with their help and assistance. </p>

<p>Question: Some people were apparently banned for asking or demanding that &quot;Richard_Gage&quot; be authenticated from that farce of an AMA. </p>

<p>Which mods did that banning? </p>

<p>As to this thread, are any suspects volunteering or being affirmed by suspects? </p>

<p>Take a close look at this, for example</p>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kol78/james_corbett_host_of_the_corbett_report_creator/clndesi">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kol78/james_corbett_host_of_the_corbett_report_creator/clndesi</a></p>

<p>Now is that particular mod supporting or putting his vote behind any of the volunteers or those who&#39;s names have been recommended? If so, take a good and careful look at who&#39;s who. </p>

<p>Just a suggestion. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks--glad you liked r/TSBD--its pretty much set up as a reference tool. </p>

<p>I would definitely look forward to trying to get some authors, activists and/or documentary film makers for AMAs...r/conspiracy has grown from 75K to over 260K in the year and a half since I joined reddit. I think an achievable goal should be to have at least 2 AMAs every month by January. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question.</p>

<p>I thought this sub was against censorship? Moderation of discussion is tantamount to censorship.
Ive seen some bans handed out to people for asking legitimate questions to &quot;commonly held beliefs&quot;, like the 9/11 truth movement, which many in this sub would subscribe to.
This is something that concerns me in this sub.
Occasionally there are some posts here, like yesterday, where it highlights how many people actually hold the wealth in the world.
THAT is a conspiracy, of which there is evidence. 
However a certain portion of this sub use this place as a platform to disseminate racial hatred, cultural hatred and all other sorts of unsubstantiated bile.</p>

<p>What I really ask is, will this sub continue to be moderated by people who will keep debate on track, whether civil or not; or will it be a return to censorship of anything butvthe current subreddit groupthink?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keeping it civil <strong>is</strong> keeping it on track.  We have a set of rules which each serve a specific purpose.  This is a conspiracy sub, so there is a certain amount of contrarianism to &quot;the official story&quot; or what have you.  For some reason people take it upon themselves to get pissed off that people are straying from that mainstream story line.  If those people come here and behave in a civil way then they are welcome, if they can&#39;t participate here, where they know they will be in the minority opinion, without calling people names (rule 10) or linking to a hive of like minded individuals so they win by numbers (rule 9) then they simply aren&#39;t welcome here.</p>

<p>Its unfortunate that a lot of people feel like they have to crush every little bubble of thought that doesn&#39;t line up with their own but if we didn&#39;t have these rules then that is what we would be left with.  A bunch of people who don&#39;t believe in conspiracy or have any interest in talking about conspiracies squatting in here and making fun of anyone who dares to make a post that isn&#39;t also mocking conspiracy theories/theorists.</p>

<p>I hope this answers your questions, perhaps I misunderstood them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problems I have are:</p>

<p>Rule 1 is never adhered to. EVER. Especially if it&#39;s anything negative about Jews.</p>

<p>Rule 10 absolves all questioning of the sub in any critical way. 
An open discussion has to allow it&#39;s very existence to be called into question.</p>

<p>In the past I&#39;ve seen people banned for asking exactly what I&#39;ve just asked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for making this sub a better place, however I know I am not alone in sharing these concerns with the moderation of these rules (and to a lesser extent, rule 8).</p>

<p>Edit: and misinformed memes always get upvoted highly, top comment debunks and post isn&#39;t deleted. I believe these should as they then become misinformation by either blind upvotes or possibly bots (not unique to this sub, r/xboxone is extremely hard to get ANY post above zero because ps fanboys created downvote bots, unbelievably childish, but people do these things.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule 10 does not forbade questioning of the subreddit.  Rule 10 forbades attacking the sub, the users, the mods.</p>

<p>You&#39;re more than welcome to make a post questioning a rule, you&#39;re actually doing that right now.  The key is doing it in a way that is civil and makes your intent clear that you aren&#39;t just trying derail the entire subreddit.</p>

<p>Rule 1 forbades the use of racial slurs.  We ban people for that all the time.  We will not however censor a subject because someone is offended by it.  Its unfortunate that people are racist, including world leaders and influential people.  So racial issues need to be discussed and when they are, someone is bound to be offended.</p>

<p>Who was banned for asking this?  I would love to investigate that issue.  A lot of people make bold claims about why they were banned while leaving out the details about why they were actually banned.  Since we don&#39;t publicly announce bans that information had to have come from one of three sources; personal experiences, the banned person&#39;s claims, or a mod&#39;s claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What some people see as attacking the sub, some others see it as challenging the subreddit &quot;official&quot; position.
Who is to decide what is what?
Also with regards to brigading (it does happen, here and elsewhere) what if sometimes &quot;obvious shills&quot;, isn&#39;t at all obvious shills, but the majority viewpoint on the topic?</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t recall any of these incidents without going through billions of posts, however I can assure you I have seen it done, however in recent times it has got better.</p>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t mind me playing devils advocate here, but I kind of have a love for doing it!
I&#39;m an atheist studying theology, if I can&#39;t take in all sides of an argument, then I don&#39;t believe I can truly be able to understand it, for all its strengths or weaknesses.</p>

<p>I hope whoever is chosen is the right choice that will moderate without discrimination, allowing an open, if sometimes heated (hey we&#39;re debating ENTIRE worldviews, gonna get nasty sometimes) discussion to unfold.</p>

<p>An end to the calling of the word shill for starters would be nice as no matter who says it, it is always an attack on the bearer of the opposite opinion, detracting from the opinion itself.</p>

<p>The word shill is used too liberally in this sub.</p>

There shouldn&#39;t be a need for that sub.
I am slowly beginning to see a definitive rhetoric stem from this sub, which is why I asked.
Are these new moderators purely there to continue censorship of all but the official &quot;party&quot; line, or are they there to keep things civil and encourage all points to be taken?
I&#39;d like to believe it&#39;s the latter but on past history, I don&#39;t think that it is the case.</p>

<p>The lengths to which <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> went to provide false verification has also forced us to raise our standards for what will be considered acceptable proof for AMA&#39;s in the future; which only complicates further the process of setting up these interviews for the community.</p>

<p>This was not a short con; the user had been impersonating the organization for <em>months</em> and this is something we are taking quite seriously; which is to say, this reaches beyond normal reddit meta drama and directly impacts the reputation of an actual person.   </p>

<p>This is disappointing to know, but your position is understandable. I hope it does not interfere to severely with the scheduling of AMA&#39;s here in the future.</p>

<p>Have you made any progress in contacting Mr. Gage about the ordeal?</p>

<p>&quot;Molybdenum/Reddit,</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out the source of that series of posts on your website a month ago. I read through the entire thread that you linked to below. There is clearly an imposter at work: &quot;Richard_Gage&quot;. I never posted anything on Reddit. </p>

<p>Unfortunately there were some people hurt in this deception – pilots for 9/11 truth, David Ray Griffin, and perhaps others.</p>

<p>Please make sure this guy is banned and that a notice is put up stating &quot;Richard Gage, AIA from Architects &amp;Engineers for 9/11 truth has never posted on Reddit. The posts are clearly by an imposter who was intentionally deceptive and through the questions and answers led many people unfortunately to be deceived. We apologize for this situation and will endeavor to keep deceptions like this from happening again.&quot;</p>

<p>If you would like to talk to me about this please email me your phone number and I will call.</p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Yes, there was a conspiracy against r/conspiracy regarding the Richard Gage AMA. </p>

<p>I found it interesting as well that he was acting as a type of gatekeeper in regards to the data and evidence presented by Pilots for 9/11 Truth, but that&#39;s besides the point. </p>

<p>This user had the very same language pattern as the Richard_Gage persona who did the AMA, and both accounts were set up at the same time. I&#39;m all but certain that it was the same individual, about 99.999% certain. </p>

<p>Thank you, on behalf of us all. </p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Gage would be willing to do an AMA on reddit here at r/conspiracy? That would be nice. And perhaps he might consider making it a panel with others like David Chandler, to answer as many questions as possible and really give it to the &quot;debunkers&quot;. </p>

<p>Rob Balsamo of Pilots for 9/11 Truth deserves the credit for outing this troll and proving that the AMA was a hoax. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll work on that.</p>

<p>We need to sort out some things on the backend with regards to having the admins look further into the user who was behind the malicious impersonation of Mr. Gage. At this point we feel the AMA was less about trolling this subreddit (<a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> had tried to organize an ama on <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> months ago) and more aimed at defaming the reputation of Mr. Gage; a matter which is considered quite serious. </p>

<p>This was no traditional troll, and it is appearing more and more that the entirety of the six months of existence behind the impersonator&#39;s account was aimed at defaming Mr. Gage. </p>
