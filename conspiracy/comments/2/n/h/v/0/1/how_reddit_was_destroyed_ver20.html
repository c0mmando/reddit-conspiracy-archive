        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) <strong>The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.</strong> </p>

<p>This took away the only tool for communicating <em>with</em> reddit <em>about</em> reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</p>

<p>2) <strong>The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</strong></p>

<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.</strong>  </p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>

<p>4) <strong>The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.</strong> </p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that <em>never</em> posted again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html">Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit&#39;s most addicted city!</a></p>

<p>I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! &quot;Didn&#39;t you read the memo Billy. US military bases are <em>never</em> to be included in our yearly stats!!!&quot;</p>

<p>5) <strong>Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.</strong> </p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>6) <strong>Speaking of voting, they changed that too.</strong></p>

<p>We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if <em>anyone</em> agreed with you.</p>

<p>7) *<em>Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random <sup>â€¿^</sup> *</em></p>

<p>No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub, fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.</p>

<p>8) <strong>You are posting too much, please wait...</strong></p>

<p>It now doesn&#39;t matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren&#39;t doing &quot;well&quot;, then you get benched.</p>

<p>9) <strong><a href="http://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-reddit-front-page-is-not-a-meritocracy/">Reddit is not a meritocracy</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Your votes do not matter. The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a &quot;head-start&quot; and as we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don&#39;t like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pvksy/what_conspiracy_turned_you_into_a_conspiracy/cd6kofo">amazing comment</a> that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1q35an/just_for_archives_purposes/">They actually gave that user the boot.</a> How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!</p>

<p>10) <strong>The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.</strong></p>

<p>Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6fsl/on_the_takeover_of_rundelete_and_the_subsequent/">Nope.</a></p>

<p>11) <strong>All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place.</strong> </p>

<p>R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">Two-Minutes Hate</a> from George Orwell&#39;s 1984:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party&#39;s enemies and express their hatred for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.</p>

<p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p>

<p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. </p>

<p>And they know it. You should too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s  pretty telling of itself. Got a history or a key incident? I gotta tell you, I&#39;m one of the reddit oldtimers, having actually been here longer than even this account would suggest, and I&#39;m so fed up with the games that I pretty much limit comments and contributions to lame consumerism and counterconsumerism, which is ironic considering my username. Reddit is outgrowing it&#39;s usefulness. If it gets to the point where the only easy posts are consumeristic in nature, and not wide open to political dissent in all it&#39;s forms then reddit will cease to be of much value for most of the people for most of the  <del>buying season</del>  year.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong-- I can understand the need to prevent &quot;vote brigades.&quot;</p>

<p>But do we need to be so careful that I might get banned for following a link from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, and then participating in the latter via commentary or voting? Especially considering <strong>I am already subscribed</strong> to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>!?!?</p>

<p>How is it fair that I don&#39;t have the right to participate in a thread <em>in a sub I&#39;m subscribed to</em>, merely because I arrived there via another subreddit?</p>

<p>Does that not sound a tiny bit harsh and insane to anyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, although the infrastructure of reddit is more important than you give it credit for. In the beginning, the infrastructure was very solid because it allowed people on reddit to basically have things like a &quot;suggestion box&quot; that was always getting onto the front page (r/reddit.com), an outlet for mocking reddit if it started acting a fool (r/circlejerk), a transparent system of voting, and many other important things to keep this place in check.</p>

<p>A few years ago it was noticeable. By last year it was like &quot;Hello!!!

    <div class="md"><p>Yesterday the frontpage was loaded with so much racist garbage it was infuriating. I get the same feelings as you. It&#39;s funny though how some of the racist posts that were front page with 4500 upvotes now only have something like 3000 upvotes 24 hours later, which pretty much proves that vote gaming brought them to the front page and that redditors generally don&#39;t actually support that content.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. That was one of the first subs to get controlled. I remember one day about a year ago when police misconduct videos got really popular (because of that one video of the policeman shooting that guys dog that jumped out the car window) and then people started posting police misconduct videos to <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> like crazy. Literally 18 of the top 20 posts in <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> was a police misconduct video, and they were hitting the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> too. People were <em>pissed</em>. Then, suddenly, they were all deleted, and then there were all these &quot;look how nice and cool the police are&quot; type of videos that were in their place. Threads with 5k+ comments were just deleted. And the reposts to take their place were also deleted. That was the day I knew that reddit was seriously infiltrated, when the people aren&#39;t allowed to have their say about problems with the police system. I was pretty shocked at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is absolutely nuts the level of racism I see here now. Just know that 80% of it is astroturfed bullshit. Which is sickening in a different way, but I honestly don&#39;t think the people of reddit are nearly as racist as the front page sometimes implies. Those top racist posts have <em>less</em> upvotes now than they did when they were on the front page, which is pretty unusual and proves that there&#39;s a lot of astroturfing going on that is against public opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was overpopulated with grammar nazis who accused each other of being overly pedantic. The general iq of reddit was much, much higher though and more helpful friendly users. There was once a free exchange of information (seemingly) where a lot of non USA residents learned that the people of the USA were mostly unaware of the antics of USA foreign policy and it was an eye opener for the USA citizens to learn why everyone else hates Americans. The circle jerking was still there but minimal compared to now where it&#39;s only a circle jerk with no real communication, just low level middle school mentality. When the diggtards showed up it was the beginning of the end. Once the appearance of conspiretard the writing was on the wall. I still stop in to look around and shake my head in disgust but there really is not much left of what was. I usually find it amusing when users of whatever message board melt down and announce they&#39;re leaving but when it started here, in this sub, it was not entertaining when I knew the user was correct about the direction this site was heading. </p>

<li>Having several different answers for when Reddit &quot;went bad&quot; is probably a good sign that it&#39;s not as bad as it could be. (Counterexample: everyone says Digg went bad with the 4.0 update.)</li>
<li>I personally think that the biggest problem with reddit is how impossible it is to criticize those in power, and to mobilize change that isn&#39;t admin-approved. Admins want SOPA stopped or gay rights legalized? You get a blog post. But no admins are advocating for more oversight on moderators.</li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking down #2, the problems are</p>

<ul>
<li>No catch-all, nor is there a meta-Reddit subreddit (for discussion about Reddit). There is no default subreddit that is uncensored (except for spam) like <a href="/r/Reddit.com">/r/Reddit.com</a> was. The closest thing is videos and pics. In theory, you could explain your point of view in a video / pic, and it wouldn&#39;t be against the rules of those subs. I haven&#39;t yet tried this.</li>
<li>Moderator actions are secret 99% of the time. Nobody knows if a post is deleted or why. Sometimes mods are openly hostile to the users (confronted with how they aren&#39;t making any sense, they just laugh it off). I wanted to make a splinter-sub off of <a href="/r/outside">/r/outside</a>, because I feel the moderation / theme of the subreddit is too lax. But my post was spam-filtered and the moderator refuses to respond to my PM. One person is in charge of deciding what 120,000+ people see.</li>

<p>You are just <strong><em>really bad</em></strong> at this. Ranting about &quot;shills&quot; and making lists (especially ones that include people like me) is the height of counter-productivity. You discredit yourself and this whole sub with your paranoid misinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is part nature and part nurture. I was exposed to the very same educational system of brainwashing, yet I am very logical and have a natural desire to find the truth, and therefore given the necessary time it was inevitable that I would come to an understanding of the key issues. Most people do not possess the same natural ability for logic, analysis, and syncretism and even if educated properly on <em>how to think</em> would probably have a hard time doing anything but regurgitating what they are told to think or, if left to their own devices, would either not bother to spend the time to find the truth or would simply be unable to put the pieces together to form a picture.</p>

<p>Knowledge is not meant for the masses. They do not respect facts, they do not have the capacity to find the truth. This is why it is ridiculous to have the masses vote. Instead, a benevolent elite should rule. Maybe that is simply not possible, maybe evil always wins. In that case we are doomed to be led always by an evil, selfish &quot;elite&quot;.</p>

<p>Hitler, or at least whichever Jew ghost-wrote for him, had a lot to say on this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But by &#39;reading&#39; I may possibly mean something entirely different from the great average of our so-called &#39;intelligentsia&#39;.</p>

<p>I know people who endlessly &#39;read&#39; a lot, book after book, letter for letter, yet I would not call them &#39;well read.&#39; Of course, they possess a wide &#39;knowledge,&#39; but their intellect does not know how to distribute and register the material gathered. They lack the ability to distinguish in a book that which is of value and that which is of no value to them; to keep the one in mind forever, and to overlook, if possible, the other, instead of carrying it with them as so much unnecessary ballast. Reading, furthermore, is not a purpose in itself, but a means to an end. It should serve, first of all, to fill in the frame which is formed by the talents and abilities of the individual; thus reading has to furnish the tools and the building material which the individual needs for his profession, no matter whether it serves only the primitive purpose of making a living or whether it presents a higher vocation; secondly, reading has to give a general picture of the world. In both cases it is necessary that the content of what has been read is registered in the mind, not according to the sequence in the book, or according to the sequence in which the books are read, but that, like the small pieces of a mosaic, it is put into the place where it belongs, thus helping to complete the general picture of the world in the mind of the reader. Otherwise, the result will be a terrible muddle of things learned, and this is not only of little value, but it also makes its unfortunate possessor presumptuous and vain. For now he thinks in all sincerity that he is &#39;educated&#39;; he thinks he knows life and has knowledge; whereas in reality, with each new contribution to this &#39;education,&#39; he is more and more estranged from the world, till frequently he ends in a sanatorium, or as a &#39;politician&#39; in parliament.</p>

<p>When studying a book, a magazine, or a pamphlet, those who master this art of reading will immediately pick out that which in their opinion is suitable for them because it serves their purposes or is generally worth knowing and therefore to be remembered forever. As soon as the knowledge so gained finds its due place in the one or the other existing picture of this or that thing which imagination has created, it will act as a corrective or as a supplement, thus enhancing its truth or its clarity. When life suddenly presents some question to be examined or answered, then this manner of reading will immediately take the already existing picture as a standard, and from it it will take all the single contributions to this question which have been collected during past decades, and submit them to the intellect for examination and reconsideration till the question is clarified or answered. </p>

<p>It is only in this fashion that reading is of use and has meaning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there has to be moderation, it&#39;s just that moderators tend to be corrupt and have an agenda, one that usually isn&#39;t in line with truth. You&#39;d need an admin team that&#39;s willing to remove moderators who abuse their power aggressively and ensure that new moderators are put in their place who will behave properly. But then you need admins who don&#39;t have an agenda other than truth, either, and Reddit of course has admins who have a very specific agenda, which is basically the same agenda the moderators of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> have, a mainstream propaganda agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Reddit is the biggest and most active web forum in the history of the internet. It is arguably the top 5 most popular website in the entire Western world and top 3 in North America.</p>

<p>I know this sounds corny, but it <em>is</em> the front page of the internet. God knows I wish it wasn&#39;t, but it is. </p>

<p>Reddit is like a weapon of mass destruction that shoots web traffic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it depends on how you define fiat currency. But Gold still only has as much value as we give to it. Times change and the value that a society places on a commodity changes. Gold doesn&#39;t have any intrinsic value. If you define fit currency as whatever the government declares to be worth a certain amount though, then whatever they declare by fiat, is the only fiat currency. It&#39;s kinda wordy but it all depends on how you define fiat currency</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit may have been created with the intention of one day taking it over for a different agenda. But the fact remains, in the beginning, it was a real community and that community (as a whole) was actually very intelligent and created a certain &quot;culture&quot; that rewarded independent thought and thinking outside the box (as long as you could back it up with logic and legit sources).</p>

<p>I mean, it had its problems, but on the whole there were checks and balances in place because the community created them. As soon as all of those checks and balances started getting corrupted and altered, it went downhill very fast.</p>

<p>I mean, it is impossible to compare the downward spiral of a shill-infested, coordinated attack to an organic downward spiral that is a natural event of popularity and human nature. But the fact remains, a lot of very &quot;convenient&quot; events were taking place during this downward spiral. And it is very hard not to notice them and reevaluate whether or not the fall was organic.</p>

<p>I am a 32 year old adult who was on reddit for a long, long time. I was keeping a VERY close eye on the site from the beginning. And for those of us who were lucky enough to be staring at the right place and paying attention to the right things, it is hard not to draw a sinister conclusion. </p>

<p>This is what drove me to login here instead of lurk. This is just <em>an idea</em>, and a way for intelligent people to communicate ideas, discuss the validity of sources, and learn things.</p>

<p>This can happen anywhere and be hosted everywhere. Whenever the <em>last straw is</em>, all we have to do is migrate or create our own content aggregator while holding up this one rule, and the truth will be not far down the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit&#39;s default subs are toxic hiveminds. Core communities will always move elsewhere. 4chan, whatever your hurr durr opinion is, has been infiltrated by SJWs; and the core community has migrated to 8chan or other places to escape personal- or popularity-slanted moderation.</p>

<p>The only reason I&#39;m on Reddit is because of Android app support, the high number of posters, and theoretically unlimited subreddits with unlimited (though undemocratic) mods. If I still had private PC access, I wouldn&#39;t be here; Reddit on PC is ugly as hell, even from a functional standpoint. It&#39;s pathetic how bad the interface is for presenting large amounts of content. Usernames with traceable history (namefagging) and karma ruin the volume, though. Lack of anonymity reduces focus on content quality, and levels out comments because people concern themselves with protecting and growing their karma. Reddit&#39;s post format is a nice compromise between Futaba and BBS, I&#39;ll say. The voting system isn&#39;t necessarily bad, but it promotes selfishness and flattens discussion. Maybe they should hide karma and usernames.</p>

<p>It may sound good to let everyone choose what the best content is, but that doesn&#39;t work out. Whoever posts early, in a thread that will become popularly visited, is more likely to hit the top for a stupid joke that everyone jerks off to. Serious and knowledgeable replies are likely to to sink into obscurity, or be buried in downvotes. Once a post reaches 0, the replicants will pile on to push it down.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t here when Reddit started, because I was on other sites that had no assumptions about moderation except removing illegal content like CP. Therefore, nobody had to worry about being banned or negatively impacted because their post was disagreeable to someone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Reddit cries about brigading of the imaginary internet points they created. Unfortunately, actual site issues like CP hosting have been expanded to include (and encourage) mob actions against people who hurt others&#39; feelings with text. Visit SRS or TiA to see how stifled talk is, today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is literally the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Fox caters to their crowd.</p>

<p>CNN caters to theirs.</p>

<p>Reddit caters to the young crowd.  Reddit is the MSM arm that feeds information to the young, tech savvy, college educated crowd.  Why do you think the &quot;You shouldn&#39;t even bother voting&quot; attitude is so popular on reddit?  The apparent goals of the MSM are in direct opposition of the reddit crowd, and they know this.  They don&#39;t want you voting, and they use your &#39;superior&#39; news source to reinforce that idea.</p>

<p>Nobody is surprised when TV news stations censor things, why would you be surprised when an internet news site censors things?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go make our own reddit with blackjack and hookers. </p>

<p>No, but really, surely there has to be some people on here that have the knowledge to compete with this and bring it back to the core of what it once was <em>and keep it there</em>. If I had enough knowledge or help to make it happen, I would. Truthfully, back then, there was shit that got the votes and made it to the top, and though i disagreed sometimes, that&#39;s what made it great. And it was great seeing people come together to make a change (not that it doesn&#39;t still sometimes happen now, but you&#39;re right... It&#39;s selective).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is upsetting to see happen but subs like this are still alive allowing people to share and discuss what is really happening on a global scale. </p>

<p>Its also nice to get to know some of the users and mods as well without getting banned as in the other more controlled subs like:</p>

<p><a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> </p>

<p>What pisses me off about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is the secret deletion algorithm that they have setup for sites they &quot;say&quot; are rehosted content when in fact they are not. When you post the so called rehosted content you won&#39;t even get a notice about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind you; <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> only recieved that attention because members of the circlejerk militia from Something Awful setup subs like &quot;<a href="/r/preteengirls">/r/preteengirls</a>&quot;, filled them with hard candy, and then emailed Anderson Cooper deriding &quot;reddit&#39;s JB problem&quot;, and eventually turning him on to <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a>.</p>

<p>Mind you, I think the reddit admins played a hand in that situation (and I think SA&#39;s reward was hands off treatment for SRS); as the reddit admins needed a way to deal with their &quot;free speech problem&quot; while also silencing a power moderator (VA) who knew all too well what was starting to happen on some of the major subs. </p>

<p>For example, VA watched <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">this thread about exposing what Chris Brown really did to his girlfriend</a> turn into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">this barren wasteland</a>, and then made <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">these comments</a> (strongly hinting at ongoing payola) as to why he was resigning as a mod of <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>. </p>

<p>The way in which the admins handled the spreading of VA&#39;s personal info (via something called the &quot;predditors tumblr&quot;), by allowing doxx to stay linked for nearly 18 hours sitewide, caused an uproar amoung the moderator which lead to gawker being nearly site wide banned by all major subs, against the wishes of the admins. <a href="http://privatepaste.com/297ce986c8">You can have fun reading the backroom conversation about that incident between mods and admins here</a>. </p>

<p>That incident also coincided with another power user, PIMA, being strong armed off the site as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here 5 years (three lurking) and OP <em>hit the nail on the head</em> regarding the downfall of Reddit.</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t have imagined that the Neuhaus family would have actually let Reddit go on as it were, right??</p>

<p>This really goes back to who controls the pursestrings of Conde Nast (or &quot;Nasty Condom&quot; as we called them when I worked for a competitor).</p>

<p>Follow the money: Reddit&gt;Conde Nast&gt;Neuhaus Family&gt;Israeli citizens and dual-citizens.</p>

<p>WHY do you think there appeared all of these &quot;feel good&quot; military stories?? Hmm...could it be that ISRAEL STARTS NEARLY EVERY SIGNIFICANT WAR IN THE WORLD yet they NEVER, ever die from their actions?? Does this seem fair? SOMEBODY is getting a HELL of a bargain in both military hardware and <em>soldiers&#39; lives</em> and it is NOT the US. The ONLY time that American Jews have died in recent wars AS SOLDIERS was when the draft still existed.</p>

<p>Mention this and you are an &quot;anti-Semite&quot; (which now means &quot;hated by the Jews&quot; instead of &quot;hates Jews&quot;). Indeed, the truth itself is &quot;anti-Semitic!&quot;</p>

<p>Reddit has not been run by &quot;cool coders&quot; for some time. Reddit is just YET ANOTHER &quot;hasbara outlet&quot; for its owners and controllers.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Try posting a true post critical of the Nazi-like, apartheid terror state of Israel and see how fast you are downvoted/banned.</p>

<p>Reddit fucking SUCKS. I&#39;m just waiting for someone with better code (I recently saw a MUCH BETTER &quot;Reddit lookalike&quot; and its source code...PLEASE let me know the name if you remember.)</p>

<p>I will do WHATEVER IT TAKES to drive traffic to this site as I am in a VERY good position through work to do so. </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s time is done. It&#39;s nothing but a joint US/Israeli disinformation op. </p>

<p>The &quot;website version&quot; of Agent Alex Jones, if you would.</p>

<p>TL;DR--Reddit sucks and is Jewish/Israeli controlled propaganda. Anyone know of a viable replacement?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say anything. It&#39;s 100% a social, commercial playground. Most areas.</p>

<p>The only thing that lives here are the trolls, and the marketers.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I loved trolls. You know, way back when, when it was an art. Now karma has totally fucking destroyed that. You need to be -10000 to be a decent troll, but reddit kaps you at -100.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even be controversial, or thought provoking. Never mind good old fashion trolling.</p>

<p>Now everyone is fishing, hardcore commerical trolling. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I love it all.</p>

<p>But dammit. Quit banning me in subs which are supposed to be informational. All I do is post links to authoritative scientific papers, and whammo... I&#39;m fucking out of there in two heart beats.</p>

<p>In other words, half the place is run by college kids being overthrown by cartels, and the other half are social justice warriors.</p>

<p>6) Speaking of voting, they changed that too.
We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if anyone agreed with you.</p>

<p>Fucking THIS.</p>

<p>This seriously needs to change. A voting system that allows people to see your vote ranking is needed. One that specifically requires at least 80% of votes below 5 downvote to hide your post.</p>

<p>This would stop shills and allow people to figure out what information is correct.</p>

Which the former is also taking on massive shills (which are more easily distinguishable due to the smaller community size). Or the Latter 4chan. (which I just don&#39;t use due to its reputation for stings, and hackers). </p>

<p>So I get pissed about reddit, and keep my opinions to myself. 
I suppose they win :(</p>

<p>I would also add when so many subreddits insidted on exact titles or quotes beucase it stopped redditors from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media just turned reddit into mainstream media.  It was the redditor individual insights that were sk instructional since so many redditors were so much smarter than most of the reporters work they were covering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed.

Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if anyone agreed with you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I remember that. I am pretty sure it was banned because it was &quot;making light&quot; of a subject (Russia) that the agenda of this site was focused on only making &quot;evil&quot;.</p>

<p>Because it started out as some joke for a school election. And then people on this site started using it to make other jokes. But this was around the time all of the &quot;OMG the Russian&#39;s hate gays and they are going to round them up during the Olympics and kill them all&quot; started.</p>

<p>Wanna know something interesting. The Russian propaganda started on this site before the Olympics. And I remember thinking that was pretty weird because, of course a certain anti-Russia sentiment is normal on a western site, but it started getting <em>really</em> over-the-top <em>all of a sudden</em>. Like one day someone turned on a switch.</p>

<p>And then it continued. And I thought &quot;Ok, maybe when the Olympics ends, it will go back to normal&quot;. But it didn&#39;t. It was like it was ramping up for something. And then <strong>BOOM</strong> the Ukraine crisis. Then MH17. Etc...</p>

<p>Looking back, its a pretty big coincidence that reddit started getting lubed up for an event that nobody could have even known was going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given all the downvotes I&#39;ve received, here are a few counterpoints as to why your post is a case of confirmation bias rather than a conspiracy to stifle alternative viewpoints on Reddit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This took away the only tool for communicating <em>with</em> reddit <em>about</em> reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideasfortheadmins ? Also don&#39;t they have a blog and shit like that? I don&#39;t understand why you wouldn&#39;t subscribe or unsubscribe to different subreddits based on what you find valuable or interesting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you have hundreds of millions of page views you simply can&#39;t leave popular venues ungoverned. Celebrities or product whores have more of a vested interest in gaining visibility.

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that <em>never</em> posted again.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t hail corporate an ironic subreddit dedicated to overly fawning reviews or presentations of things? I  guess I could me misunderstanding it. Also, America is a very pro military country...more users = more pro military posts. </p>

<p>Also, the response about Eglin as the armed services it hub causing it to be the most addicted city makes a lot of sense...</p>

<p>When I first started posting and got downvotes for my conservative views on r politics, I got this message. Once I had a few popular posts and it was clear I wasn&#39;t just a troll account, I haven&#39;t received this message since. Without this feature trolls could spam honest users without restraint. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m tired and bored of this but I&#39;m sure everything I skipped over in your post is just proof that you&#39;re right. </p>

<p>What has happened with Reddit can be said about so many things. Whenever something becomes powerful their are those that will create a cabal and take over this powerful something. It could be the bankers getting together in secret to create the federal reserve, it can be the silicon valley companies working with the government to share our data,  and it can be a tool to break down the ability for people to communicate without abiding by the talking points from the top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to report some censorship today: I tried to post something earlier to <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a>, stating that mass-surveillance by the NSA/CIA/FBI/etc was a violation of intellectual property privilege, in a sense that you could be building the next tesla engine, talking about it thru email or storing dox on google drive...and surprise, before you get the funding to start the company, the department of energy has your design.  Of course you can&#39;t really compete with the dept of the illuminati</p>

<p>Well, someone did <em>not</em> like this.  I logged out of my throwaway TylerTurducken account only to find my post remained but the content was [removed].  I pm&#39;d the mods, and when I went to relog, my password no longer worked.</p>

<p>So I tried to repost, with TylerTurducken2  (should have been tylerturderkin, but whatevs)... and went thru the exact same thing with a longer/ more complex password.  Clearly, NSAbot was fuxing with me.</p>

<p>So I tried again!! And it was remove again.  I tried to pm the admins, but the captcha that i put in correctly failed, twice!  Clearly this was a man in the middle attack wherein the NSA&#39;s apprehend and make fake webpage program was goofing up.  </p>

<p>I did this through a VPN, using 2 different browser, and connecting to different VPN servers every few requests, with a user agent set to IE or something retarded like that, so they think I&#39;m grams or a government worker with an old &#39;puter.   Guess it didn&#39;t work.  I suspect as of tonight, the Internet--and freedom of speech--is over for me, they&#39;ve achieved total everywhereness and I&#39;m tired from trying to foil them just so I can have some liberty of expression here.</p>

<p>I may just take my ball and go home.</p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>blacklists exist because those websites are either incredibly biased or they were caught manipulating votes. Regardless it&#39;s up to the subreddit&#39;s moderators to decide which is which, same as how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s moderators don&#39;t actually let the votes decide, and ban people rather willy-nilly if they decide they don&#39;t like what they&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>If you can convince your subreddit that you&#39;re banning for the good of the forum or for the good of the subscribers then you&#39;re golden. I&#39;d be interested to see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s banlist screenshotted for everyone to see, and have the mods still maintain the &quot;the rest of reddit is corrupt let the votes decide&quot; sort of rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with much of what you&#39;re saying, I think you&#39;re giving far too much credit to a small group of people.  The problem with this is that it relegates to the concept of personal accountability elsewhere and doesn&#39;t hold individuals accountable for their actions.  Many of the symptoms you are discussing are also because of (but not limited to) the systematic propagation of ignorance throughout society in order to have a simpler path towards a stranglehold on public opinion.</p>

<p>The powers that be exist only because of a largely distracted populace that props them up, let&#39;s not forget that.  While the upvote/downvote system is both flawed and likely manipulated, it can give us at least a hint of what the general reaction to certain things is, which is, in many cases, frightening.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this has infiltrated this sub as well, but in a different manner.  We now have a group of users here devoted to posing as critical thinkers yet are quick to jump to any contradictory point without any evidence or credibility.  They are somehow quickly upvoted only because they are taking a contradictory point and are quick to disappear from the threads where they are called out.  It&#39;s frightening to see how much popularity you can gain, even here, simply by stating the opposite of popular belief, without any evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>Ignorance exists on all sides, it&#39;s our job to continue to analyse and critically think for ourselves without blindly following the heterodoxy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>woah woah woah.. about the ron paul bashing..</p>

<p><a href="http://realfactbias.blogspot.com/2012/02/no-dollar-did-not-really-lose-95-of-its.html">ron paul&#39;s MAIN talking point about the federal reserve reducing the purchasing power of the dollar by 98% since 1913 is pretty misleading</a>.</p>

<p>oh god you people are going to absolutely wish satan upon me for having linked that. *facepalm</p>

<p>look: you can find a lot of truth in ron paul, but you better at least figure out what your own point is with enough clarity to not explain it in an incredibly misleading fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=F7r7l1VG-Tw">it isn&#39;t a requirement for an economy to be anti-keynesian in order to solve important economic problems such as world poverty</a>. not by a longshot.</p>

<p>there are multiple kinds of solutions to fixing the world&#39;s financial problems, but making factually incorrect statements and proposing utopian ideals with non-existent transitions is counter-productive. you&#39;re not gonna fix everything by having the collective establishment make a big announcement: &quot;oh we&#39;re now a gold economy and the government makes all the currency w/o debt, yay&quot;. it&#39;s like trying to explain to a zeitgeist venus project believer that we&#39;re gonna switch to the &#39;resource based economy&#39; when we convince the establishment to be on board. these transitions, assuming they even <em>could</em> exist, would at the very least need many many phases. if your transitions are off, everything becomes chaotic and the whole economy burns to ashes in a sea of hysteria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, and leftist also.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how someone honest with themselves and truly on a search for truth can come to any other conclusion but that limited government and conservative (real conservative, fairly traditional values that actually are proven to work) values are the only rational way of doing things. I don&#39;t have all the answers but after years of research this is quite apparent. I used to be a moderate liberal. I believed in global warming. I voted for Obama. I was ignorant. I learned, I did not tie myself down to any view, I always looked for alternative views, both sides of the argument, it was the only way to find the truth. I changed my views. Why are so few unable to do the same?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had long, long conversations with leftists on Reddit and they can never demonstrate that leftism (and statism) is actually a good thing, only that they HOPE it will somehow someday be a good thing even though it is <em>already</em> demonstrably horrific - yet their answer is always MOAR LEFTISM. They hate what is natural, apparently. I think a lot of them are just fuck-ups who don&#39;t fit in with a normal, functional society and prefer a dysfunctional, ass-backwards, good-and-evil-inverted modern world because such a world accepts them simply because fuck-ups are preferred in such a system, a system in which dysfunction is the ideal. Traditionalism becomes bad, degeneracy becomes the new normal. Thus because they have so much tied up in the leftist lie that they are unwilling to let go of their delusional fantasies and face the stark reality; they are cowards.</p>

<p>It is scary to realize that everything you&#39;ve been taught from birth is a lie. It nearly broke me. But it is the only way to find the truth....</p>

<p>Republicans, neocons aren&#39;t much better, of course, and suffer from similar delusions, they&#39;ve just been told different lies.</p>

<p>All of them are tied to a belief system, a &quot;religion&quot;, one which they have faith in and are unwilling to let go of.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how they can be aware of grand conspiracies and still believe that the educational system which brainwashed them with leftism from childhood was doing them a favor. Haven&#39;t they learned anything at all? It&#39;s so obvious. The &quot;elite&quot; did not force feed us leftism for our benefit, sheesh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem is the powers that be have not left us with a good word or phrase to describe what they have done. Progressivism, modernity, statism, none of these words really captures the essence of what is wrong with the modern world and its &quot;progress,&quot; none completely encompasses the problem, and you&#39;re right that describing the problem as &quot;leftism&quot; supports the left/right lie. I lean toward progressivism or liberalism as they describe what has changed in the world since the time of the French Revolution, but of course this all goes back even farther than that to creation of Judeocentric religions and beyond, and many of the so-called &quot;conservative&quot; values pushed by said religions are damaging as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dollarism, I like that. Still, none of them really encompass the big picture and are actually familiar to people so they will no what you are talking about. Which is of course by design - if you can&#39;t name something, you can&#39;t talk about it. Modernity isn&#39;t accurate because it fails to include some of the issues like banking and religion which have been around for a long, long time, and &quot;modern&quot;, like &quot;progressive&quot;, is a word that has positive connotations, and there are some good things about modernity, and many people choose only to see the good things that actually, I believe, are not at all the result of the political changes we&#39;ve seen. It makes it easy to paint anyone who exposes modernity as a Luddite.</p>

<p>You are correct, if the user in question is using, say, the kiwiirc client, the admins would be able to tell.

    <div class="md"><p>1) <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a> was always a circlejerk where people would just dump content more suitable for other subreddits. It was basically a combination of <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and <a href="/r/self">/r/self</a>. </p>

<p>2) That is a problem, I agree. </p>

<p>3) See above.</p>

<p>4) People who say things you disagree with are NOT shills. I&#39;ve only seen about 3 or 4 legit shills that have been called out here. The rest are either people with opinions you disagree with, or people you witch hunt and send death threats to over half-truths and misinformation (the Facebook shill incident a few months ago for instance). </p>

<p>Additionally, the appearance of an Air Force base in Florida as the &quot;most addicted city&quot; is NOT proof of a military conspiracy to game reddit. For one, all the psyop and propaganda divisions of the military aren&#39;t even based out of Eglin. </p>

<p>Eglin is, however, the location where a vast majority of the US military&#39;s IP address ranges are registered to. These IPs are used all over the world, and are routed through Eglin. The reason Eglin ranks so highly is because the target demographic of reddit also coincides with military demographics, so you&#39;ve got millions of active duty servicemembers accessing reddit while deployed on military computers with IP addresses and VPNs hosted at Eglin used to route global military traffic. </p>

<p>5) &gt;What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>Letting the people vote on content was always a terrible idea, as it allows echo-chamber circlejerking to drown out legit discussion. </p>

<p>6) The upvote/downvote count was NEVER accurate because of the vote fuzzing. What RES displayed was never a real count of actual upvotes or downvotes, and the admins removed it because it caused so much confusion and people would yell at each other over inaccurate numbers. </p>

<p>7) Expanding demographics. </p>

<p>8) This is also a problem, but even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> uses a system like this. It&#39;s to keep out spam. If a system like that wasn&#39;t in place ya&#39;ll would be complaining about spam instead. </p>

<p>9) I&#39;ve seen <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts on the front page before. </p>

<p>10) 99% of the posts on undelete were removed for violating subreddit rules, not as a part of some evil conspiracy to censor reddit. In the end <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> became a place to harass default subreddit moderators for daring to enforce their subreddit rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I addressed that here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact remains, in the beginning, it was a real community and that community (as a whole) was actually very intelligent and created a certain &quot;culture&quot; that rewarded independent thought and thinking outside the box (as long as you could back it up with logic and legit sources).</p>

<p>I mean, it had its problems, but on the whole there were checks and balances in place because the community created them. As soon as all of those checks and balances started getting corrupted and altered, it went downhill very fast.</p>

<p>I mean, it is impossible to compare the downward spiral of a shill-infested, coordinated attack to an organic downward spiral that is a natural event of popularity and human nature. But the fact remains, a lot of very &quot;convenient&quot; events were taking place during this downward spiral. And it is very hard not to notice them and reevaluate whether or not the fall was organic.</p>

<p>I am a 32 year old adult who was on reddit for a long, long time. I was keeping a VERY close eye on the site from the beginning. And for those of us who were lucky enough to be staring at the right place and paying attention to the right things, it is hard not to draw a sinister conclusion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the post you are calling &quot;great&quot; is anything but. It is a cop-out post that seems to be looking at a very complex issue from the shallowest possible point of view.</p>

<p>It is a response that lacks many things, but first and foremost, it lacks imagination. It is completely devoid of it actually.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the point. If I wanted the cookie-cutter, takes 5-seconds to think of, excuses that Joe Public throws around to keep his brain turned off, then I wouldn&#39;t be making my post in this specific subreddit.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these kinds of answers seem to only distract people from using their brains and from entertaining the the idea, both for argument&#39;s sake, and also as an exercise in thought.</p>

<p>Lastly, this same user did the exact same thing in yesterday&#39;s front-page conspiracy post. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ndc3s/if_the_ferguson_situation_has_proven_one_thing/cmclgxq">He threw out an excuse that anyone could think of in 5 seconds</a> and successfully caused a snowball effect that destroyed any actual discussion about the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Reddit is the biggest and most active web forum in the history of the internet. It is arguably the top 5 most popular website in the entire Western world and top 3 in North America.</p>

<p>I know this sounds corny, but it <em>is</em> the front page of the internet. God knows I wish it wasn&#39;t, but it is. </p>

<p>Reddit is like a weapon of mass destruction that shoots web traffic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, and leftist also.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how someone honest with themselves and truly on a search for truth can come to any other conclusion but that limited government and conservative (real conservative, fairly traditional values that actually are proven to work) values are the only rational way of doing things. I don&#39;t have all the answers but after years of research this is quite apparent. I used to be a moderate liberal. I believed in global warming. I voted for Obama. I was ignorant. I learned, I did not tie myself down to any view, I always looked for alternative views, both sides of the argument, it was the only way to find the truth. I changed my views. Why are so few unable to do the same?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had long, long conversations with leftists on Reddit and they can never demonstrate that leftism (and statism) is actually a good thing, only that they HOPE it will somehow someday be a good thing even though it is <em>already</em> demonstrably horrific - yet their answer is always MOAR LEFTISM. They hate what is natural, apparently. I think a lot of them are just fuck-ups who don&#39;t fit in with a normal, functional society and prefer a dysfunctional, ass-backwards, good-and-evil-inverted modern world because such a world accepts them simply because fuck-ups are preferred in such a system, a system in which dysfunction is the ideal. Traditionalism becomes bad, degeneracy becomes the new normal. Thus because they have so much tied up in the leftist lie that they are unwilling to let go of their delusional fantasies and face the stark reality; they are cowards.</p>

<p>It is scary to realize that everything you&#39;ve been taught from birth is a lie. It nearly broke me. But it is the only way to find the truth....</p>

<p>Republicans, neocons aren&#39;t much better, of course, and suffer from similar delusions, they&#39;ve just been told different lies.</p>

<p>All of them are tied to a belief system, a &quot;religion&quot;, one which they have faith in and are unwilling to let go of.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how they can be aware of grand conspiracies and still believe that the educational system which brainwashed them with leftism from childhood was doing them a favor. Haven&#39;t they learned anything at all? It&#39;s so obvious. The &quot;elite&quot; did not force feed us leftism for our benefit, sheesh.</p>
