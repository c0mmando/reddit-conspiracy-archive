<p>If someone was posting comments in such an egregious manner I am a bit surprised to hear they were not dealt with.</p>

<p>That said, we very much value the free flow of information; and if users wish to defend cops they are more than welcome to do so. Also, users are welcome to frequent whichever subs they please so long as they are not crossposting links to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with the intent of inviting briagdes to attack the sub. </p>

<p>posting &gt;100 racist shitposts in one day is A-OKAY then?</p>

<p>Well, no; I would consider that behavior spamming...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allowing shitposting spammers a free pass to spam the subreddit with garbage and brigade threads does not promote free and open discussion. Just the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, of course; but it&#39;s a delicate balance between inculcating the ethos of free flowing information and preventing deplorable racist spam.</p>

<p>We try to moderate behavior on this subreddit, as opposed to content (for the most part); so in that regard spamming/brigading/etc are all grounds for banishment; but simply voicing an opinion is not.   </p>

<p>Richard Gage grew up in the TV generation, that&#39;s something he can handle.</p>

<p>A reddit AMA, in a conspiracy forum of all places, is light years away from a cspan interview, and this is also why it took a half an hour or so for him to get it right.</p>

<p>Not only did he figure it out, but he went from not knowing how to start a thread on his computer, to continuing to participate and answer questions on his phone over the next several days.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather just put Richard&#39;s Cspan interview as the top stickied post for 6 months, because the domination won&#39;t get any better than that. </p>

They might see or even connect at best to the nearest site but absolutely no way sustain a call, which led me to doing further research on the topic in the first place.</p>
