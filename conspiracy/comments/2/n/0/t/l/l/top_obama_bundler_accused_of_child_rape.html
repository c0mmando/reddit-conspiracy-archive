       Because the accused is a man with connections to the very highest echelons of the American left establishment. He also gave them gobs and gobs of cash. He also influenced their agenda. He also fucks kids and gives them drugs. He also enjoys very quiet media coverage and complicitous nonchalance from the people who vote for the people he pays.   He drugs kids and fucks them and is baked into the leftist socio-political agenda, at the very tippest of the tippy top.

       He has no direct connection to Obama, the article even says that. It just says "some connections to the white house". The white House employs a lot of people. And you are also wrong on "gobs is cash" he was a donator to the Obama campaign of 2012 with half a million dollars but there is nothing in the article that states he regularly donating as much money to the government least of all to Obama himself to influence policies. You are reaching. This is why people don't take r/conspiracy seriously.

       So again, what does he have to do with Obama that it warrants his name in the headline? And he I'd a child molestor, how was Obama supposed to know he was such a thing? And to generalize "leftists" is a bit harsh, because I think Terry Bean is inconsequential to most, which is probably why his indiscretions went unnoticed for so long.

       Dont twist my words to push your agenda. That "boy" went on to become Beans actual boyfriend years ftaer it happened and he was the one who came forward years after the fact. I said Bean is inconsequential which he is. He has no real power he donates to some Dems and? He is now on charges and everything. What else?

       I'm sure he loved his victim very much and it's also Ok that the relationship became serious after a while too, that makes kid fucking cool. All pedos should be granted the same rights, to see if their victims grow up to love them and choose to consent to a serious relationship at a later time.
      </p>

       This is the company the president (and hillary and dick durbin and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Barney Frank among others "some dems") keeps and panders to. He also happens to give him rides on his fancy jet. He's a run of the mill hedonist &amp; narcissist.
      </p>
      <p>
       No power but they called him a kingmaker because he controlled the money. You must think using the word
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       prior to power means something.

       How many years has it been since 2013 in lala land? This old fuck and his young buck boyfriend shared this kids asshole and whatever else rich, well-connected (to say the least) gay guys do when they're fucking children.

       But I digress, Obama is the real victim here. I hope he can find some closure after these allegations have passed.

       You're right he doesn't deserve these outlandish associations. It's basically a crime to insinuate that he takes money from pedophiles who then enjoy no scrutiny in the left-friendly press, probably because he has friends in high places.

       Sorry Obama, you didn't deserve to have someone you take gobs of money from get busted for fucking children. Sorry about that.

       So you have no source for "everyone knows Bean likes little boys"? It is funny as soon as someone ask around here for proof or any sources, everyone gets defensive or in your case think it is a joking matter.

       Hang it up. Obama's reputation was already wrecked before this. People defending Obama sound like Bush defenders circa 2006.

       Obama hangs out with child molesters. It's a fact.
