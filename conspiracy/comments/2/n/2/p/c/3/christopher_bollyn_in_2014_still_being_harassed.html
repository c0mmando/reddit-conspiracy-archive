       They only attack you when you are on to something. Christopher Bollyn gets attacked by the FBI and the police after he writes about the thermite discovered in the dust. When Steve Jones discovered thermetic material in WTC dust, a campaign against him began, eventually leading to his forced retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Gage becomes the main face of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth, and immediately he is attacked by various shills like Gordon Duff, James Fetzer, and Judith Woods – all people claiming to be “truthers” while ignoring the evidence and coming up with crazy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Susan Lindauer spent a year in military prison, only escaping a forced drugging by a last minute judicial decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellen Mariani and her lawyer were declared “anti-semitic” by a Jewish judge whose son was working for the same company they were suing – a clear conflict of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was nothing to the evidence uncovered by Jones, Harrit, Gage, and Bollyn, why the attacks? Why the police harassment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice too how many people were given money – the newspaper in Shanksville, the PA coroner.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was nothing there, they would just ignore it. But all the evidence shows that Towers 1, 2 and 7 were destroyed in a controlled demolition and that Israeli hands were all over the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who had access to the buildings? Larry Silverstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tell me, Christopher Bollyn is just some journalist writing articles for the public. He just calls people on the phone, talks to them, and writes down what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and local police attacking him and his family just when Steven Jones discovers thermite in the WTC dust and Bollyn publishes about it? The question answers itself. If there was nothing there, there would be no reason to attack him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Steven Jones get threatened by someone with security clearances just after he wrote his paper about thermite in the dust? If it was just some bizarre conspiracy theory, why did he need to be threatened? If he didn’t discover anything of importance, why was he offered money – the proverbial silver or lead – either take a payoff, or face possible physical harm?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is nothing there – why all this drama, folks? Why the censorship? You would think that crazy “conspiracy theories” would just be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they don’t ignore us – quite the contrary, they have spent massive resources attacking us, for 13 years now.

       The dust was not even examined by NIST, and they didn't even consider the most likely cause of collapse in their investigation.  That's not science.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dust contains residue from highly engineeered thermitic material, along with iron spheres that indicate molten steel.   it's a slam dunk case.  the instruments and observations don't lie.    anyone can repeat the experiment and get the same results.

       Look, I don't buy the official story either, but this picture is worthless in terms of an argument for controlled demolition.  We have no idea when this was taken, and therefore could have POSSIBLY have been during the cleanup to cut larger beams into smaller ones for transport.

       Okay so, when you say stuff like "it was Israel", "It was the Jews", etc, honestly you're hurting the cause. Even if that's true (which personally I haven't seen any evidence for. The best theory I have seen is Collateral Damage by EP Heidner, available here:
       <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/911/Collateral-Damage-911-black_eagle_fund_trust.pdf">
        http://www.wanttoknow.info/911/Collateral-Damage-911-black_eagle_fund_trust.pdf
       </a>
       ), the public already has an aversion to anything that might be considered anti semetic. So if you claim to seek the truth about 9-11, and then mention Israel or the Jews, people are going to dismiss everything you say as BS. Even saying something like "It was Israel" is absurdly general. WHO? The whole country? The whole government? Come on. Be specific.

       Seriously. Any time I see compelling information about alternative 9/11 theories that are followed up with "Jews" I cringe. It puts an unnecessary spin on the issue.

       What are you going to do with thermite? I doubt you could even get close enough to a tank to set it off.

       Thermite is pretty much useless.

       I'm unsure if the guy ever walked earth. I'm sort of in the camp, the very small camp that thinks the bible may be nothing more than a book of knowledge that speaks to several classes of people all at the same thing. Sort of an encoding of secret knowledge type of thing. Filled with spells and special regeants and stuff.

       Now think about this. Jesus was brought frankincense and myrrh, from three wise men, or magi, or magicians. He went and performed miracles healing the sick, like magic, a miraculous magician. So, there is magic to be found inside the bible.

       It even goes into ancient Greek. The father of History is said to be a "liar". In reality, he's probably encoded secrets which one certain classes of scholars are allowed to access freely of their own efforts.

        HERODOTUS AND THE FLYING SERPENTS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In the history of Diodorus of Sicily, we find a description of dark red poisonous serpents amongst the frankincense trees (Diodorus Siculus Library of History Book III.46-47). Herodotus, who is called "the father of history," also describes these creatures:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "The frankincense they procure by means of the bum styrax, which the Greeks obtain from the Phœnicians; this they burn, and thereby obtain the spice. For the trees which bear the frankincense are guarded by winged serpents, small in size, and of varied colours, whereof vast numbers hang about every tree. They are of the same kind as the serpents that invade Egypt; and there is nothing but the smoke of the styrax (ed.Storax)which will drive them from the trees." (Herodotus Histories Book III.107, trans. George Rawlinson, 1858-1860; found here in the 1997 Everyman's Library/Knopf edition on p.176)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But Herodotus has also been called "the father of lies" because some of his history is fantastic and scholars have found inconsistencies of dating etc. His description of the flying serpents is an unforgettable narrative and indeed the details do not sound credible, but, amazingly, the story is based on fact. Carpet vipers (echis) infest the mountains of Dhofar into the present time. These snakes coil up and strike high, almost as though they were flying. They are also said to leap onto victims from samur trees. The bite is quite toxic and there is no known antidote.
