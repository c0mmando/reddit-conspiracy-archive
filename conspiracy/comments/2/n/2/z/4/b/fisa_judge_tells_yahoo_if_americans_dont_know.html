<p>&quot;Oral arguments presented by Yahoo’s counsel (Mark Zwillinger) and the US Solicitor General Gregory Garre” reveal a frightening new govt. argument.</p>

<p>Garre then goes on to explain why the govt. feels it should have warrantless access to US persons&#39; communications, routed through and stored at US servers. He refers to satellite communications -- something in use when FISA was enacted in 1978. </p>

<p>Garre says that even though these communications may have been captured by domestic satellite receivers, it&#39;s the point of origin that matters. Outside the US? No warrant needed, even for US persons. Likewise for emails stored on Yahoo servers.</p>

<p>. . .But all of this pales in light of the words of Judge Morris S. Arnold.  If they sound familiar, they are. This was the argument made, and roundly ridiculed, by Congressman Mike Rodgers, chair of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>

<p>Vladeck: But who would be complaining? </p>

<p>Rogers: Somebody who’s privacy was violated.  You can’t have your privacy violated if you don’t know your privacy is violated.&quot;</p>

<p>How do some of these people get to be judges? There is SO much wrong with this it&#39;s hard to know where to begin. One could only imagine this sentiment becoming a legal precedent. It effectively erases the 4th Amendment for starters. Thank You PATRIOT Act and &quot;sneak and peak&quot;searches. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just having trouble seeing who exactly is being hurt here, other than people who, understandably perhaps, like to feel comfortable in knowing that we have a rigid 4th Amendment protection of individuals and don&#39;t want to even contemplate that people are having their privacy unknowingly intruded upon.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me just say that I&#39;m all for de-centralization. I do not like the Federal Reserve Bank and I do not like fractional reserve banking. It&#39;s a horrible system and I want nothing to do with it. I only use their money at the moment because it&#39;s extremely hard not to. I want to get off the USD as fast as is possible.</p>

<p>Moving on -</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that bitcoin will be the one to make it. I like that people are even talking about it. I think that a variety of local or de-centralized currencies is the way to go. This way you have a choice. Should one go sour or become entrenched with corrupt people you may simply halt usage of the corrupt currency. Bitcoin is sort of a leading edge in thought. I like that and I applaud from a distance.</p>

<p>The real game is on the ground. It&#39;s a mind game. People still think that the self-appointed rulers and their proxies in government are legitimate; and, by extension, their money. Once people no longer view the self-appointed rulers and their proxies in government as being legitimate the flood gates open. People can then make their own decisions without fear of violence.</p>

<p>Long distance commerce will not be a problem if there are multiple currency options. You&#39;ll have a few currencies and one of them will be accepted. I honestly don&#39;t see it as a problem.</p>
