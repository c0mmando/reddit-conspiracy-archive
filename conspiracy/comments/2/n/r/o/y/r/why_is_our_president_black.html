       Why is the president black?
      </p>
      <p>
       -Do you believe Obama was just the first proper candidate to be a black president?
-Or that Obama was chosen by the government because the people were ready for a black president?
-I believe that Obama was elected president to delay democracy a little longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it is coincidental that ever since Obama was elected president, the African-Americans all of a sudden stopped complaining about the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that, politicians and other world elite knew democracy was entering its final chapters. Soon the people would start a revolution and every democratic authority would lose all their power, in order to prevent that from happening - or to postpone it from happening - the governmental executives thought of introducing the first black president showing that our world is in fact connecting more and that democracy is still equivalent.

       What do you think?

       The president is black because the Democratic Party saw the opportunity to get the most left wing, party line toeing person they could find into the White House and that person happened to be black. They could have ran Coco the signing ape and won

       There will be an economic crash soon that will rival the Great Depression.  At this moment, about 20% of American's are dependent on the government for assistance.  With the crash, these people will be left on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of these people aren't unable to work, they simply refuse to work.  Their parents were raised by parents who received this assistance, so they conditioned those kids to think they deserve this money (out of shame), and this tradition of entitlement was passed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once these benefits are cut, all these people "who can't work" will suddenly find the ability to loot and commit arson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all of these people are black, but the majority of the concentrated areas of them are (the areas that are most dangerous).  Why do you think we've been militarizing police, building Fema camps, bringing in immigrants?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because when the shit hits the fan, they are going to simply round up all the people they consider parasites and replace them with immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being the majority of these people happen to be black, having a black president negates racism.

       That being said, I think it is bad that the government does things like this. I don't call myself a conspiracy theorist (just made a new word up "conspiracy tourist") but I do believe that our generation is ready for revolution of some sort, probably one like Russel Brand emphasizes on. The government or whoever seems to be in charge is acting like we (the inhibitants of the world) are ignorant and make us believe things to cover-up their own acts, now what's your opinion on that?

       I don't know about that. It seems people dependent on government are a very important part of many oppressive forms of control.  Also many of the immigrants will be new dependents. Which points more to a Cloward-Pivin type strategy.

       It's not really a wage issues as much as it's a cost of living issue.

       For example; if someone were to open a Dunken Donuts in downtown Chicago, they should pay their workers to be able to live in downtown Chicago.

       Actually a couple different reasons...1. make blacks more active voters in the future. 2. he can do anything he wants, break any law he wants, and if you call him out on it, YOU are a racist. 3. when he leaves office and this country is in a mess, the republicans will look back and say "you wanted a black president". 4. completing the NWO goal of bringing the US down to the level of other countries, as it will be easier to create a true ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT.

       White people elected Obama because they believed what he was saying (he was lying constantly) and because they hoped he would unify the country and turn back the evils created during the Bush Administration (he didn't; Obama increased the evils of Bush and added many new ones of his own). Basically, white people got fooled by Obama's lies.

       Black people were going to vote for anything with black skin. We all know this. A black corpse could have run for president, and blacks would have voted for it. It didn't matter what Obama was saying where black votes are concerned.

       It's not really a wage issues as much as it's a cost of living issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; if someone were to open a Dunken Donuts in downtown Chicago, they should pay their workers to be able to live in downtown Chicago.
