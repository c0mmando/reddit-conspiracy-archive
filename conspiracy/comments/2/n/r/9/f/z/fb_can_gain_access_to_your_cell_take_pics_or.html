       "Facebook can gain direct access to a person’s mobile and take pictures or make videos at
       <em>
        any time without explicit consent
       </em>
       , MPs warn as they call on social media companies to simplify their terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MP said that they should simplify the conditions of using their services, which are designed for US courts, because they are so impenetrable that “no reasonable person” can be expected to understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MPs on the Science and Technology select committee called for the Government to draw up new guidelines for websites and apps explaining clearly how they use personal data, warning that laws will be needed if companies fail to comply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The committee highlighted terms for Facebook Messenger's mobile app, used by more than 200,000 million people a month, that means it can gain direct access to a mobile or tablet, including to take pictures or make videos, at any time without explicit confirmation from the owner.
MPs also pointed to criticism of the company earlier this year after it carried out a psychological experiment that recorded users’ moods as news feeds on the social network were manipulated."

       If you REALLY want to delete your profile, unfriend all your contacts one by one.   Delete any LIKES on comments or anything else you may have clicked on Photos. Blogs. One by one.
Everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just know, It takes ALOT of time... Ive done it.

       (even though everything you have ever done is probably archived on the servers anyway; FB, CIA, NSA, FBI or otherwise.

       FB accounts don't delete. Not ever. Every thing you change, post or delete is logged. The only thing you can do is shut the account down from public view.

       True. Best thing to do is to go the digital pollution route. Unfriend people you care about. Add people you don't know, like everything, share random crap, upload 300 photos that have nothing to do with you and change out all your info on the about page.

       I like the idea of intentionally filling your fecesbook account with disinfo and random bullshit.  Just fill the nsa and cia records with total trivialiaity. Like taking selfies for the 100th time, sharing your political opinions as if you actually thought that anyone gave a shit what you think,  and showing off how generally awesome you are with your meaningless life updates that no one gives a shit about.

       Here's what I wonder about things like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these special powers the NSA supposedly possesses can be used for any overt operation, because if they did, someone would report "application x snitched on me and now I'm in trouble with the FBI." There would be a big backlash against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been wondering recently about the ability of law enforcement to decrypt data. Truecrypt was supposedly infiltrated recently, and on a mac the advice is to use an encrypted dmg. That worries me, because I think "apple must have put a backdoor on their encryption algorithm in order to allow the government to decrypt this data."
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems reasonable, but the thing is that even if they do have that ability, they could never use it in any ordinary policing. E.g., let's say they use it to crack down on some child porn ring. It would be reported that despite the group's use of encryption tools, law enforcement was able to gain access to their data."
      </p>
      <p>
       If people heard that, the privacy community would go apeshit, Apple would be in big trouble for promoting a compromised product, it would be a very serious, scandalous matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were the NSA, I would prefer that there was no backdoor in the encryption. It's better that people think they're safe. The fact is that there are definitely backdoors in the current popular operating systems that allow covertish access. That access can be used to install a keylogger or other monitoring software, and that's a much easier way of gaining access to someone's encrypted data than managing backdoors in the encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this article tells us that the facebook app can be used to operate your camera and mic remotely. This really can't be used for law enforcement purposes. The only real use is to spy on girls or something, or perhaps corporate spying. I doubt such a feature could be used for catching "terrorists," either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hacking tools they've got are pretty heavy-handed, and it's obvious to an experience person when they are being hacked. They cause strange behaviour, crashes and very obvious network anomalies. The risk of discovery is huge, and I would assume they only do it when it's worth it (it at least requires the full-time attention of one employee) and the matter is of some importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I was hacked by some in all likelihood government entity for (I assume) my activities in negotiating to sell anti-hacking technology to Iranian banks. They didn't mess around. They wanted me to know I had no hope of defeating them and after months of constant harassment, the business had to be shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these hacking abilities will ever be used in ordinary law enforcement circumstances simply because if it were ever publicly documented, the world would react by closing the hole. This will always and only be for covert shit.

       good point - so if not for law enforcement, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       the public may not ever be aware of the reason (and some people believe we
       <em>
        don't need
       </em>
       to know) but i'm sure it's 'documented', as long as the public doesn't know, then it's ok

       "Oral arguments presented by Yahoo’s counsel (Mark Zwillinger) and the US Solicitor General Gregory Garre” reveal a frightening new govt. argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Garre then goes on to explain why the govt. feels it should have warrantless access to US persons' communications, routed through and stored at US servers. He refers to satellite communications -- something in use when FISA was enacted in 1978.
      </p>
      <p>
       . . .But all of this pales in light of the words of Judge Morris S. Arnold. If they sound familiar, they are. This was the argument made, and roundly ridiculed, by Congressman Mike Rodgers, chair of the House Intelligence Committee.

       If you REALLY want to delete your profile, unfriend all your contacts one by one.   Delete any LIKES on comments or anything else you may have clicked on Photos. Blogs. One by one.
Everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just know, It takes ALOT of time... Ive done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       (even though everything you have ever done is probably archived on the servers anyway; FB, CIA, NSA, FBI or otherwise.

       True. Best thing to do is to go the digital pollution route. Unfriend people you care about. Add people you don't know, like everything, share random crap, upload 300 photos that have nothing to do with you and change out all your info on the about page.
