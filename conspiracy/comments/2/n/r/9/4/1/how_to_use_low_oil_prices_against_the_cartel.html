<p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>

<p>The question on everyone&#39;s mind. First, I&#39;d say no one can tell
you WHAT to do. Second, I think a general, rough, decentralized, leaderless, &quot;plan&quot; everyone can follow their own way with their skills, but that moves us in the same direction, is a good place to look for a &quot;solution&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The elevator pitch</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>   If dollars are power, why do we spend them so freely?</li>
<li>   Disengage the thieves&#39; economy on all non-essential functions.</li>
<li>   Deploy capital today on solutions for tomorrow that require no dollar inputs.</li>
<li>   Spend free-time with loved ones while pursuing quality of life improving goals.</li>

<p><strong>OIL and eCONomy</strong></p>

<p>Today I want to add that falling oil prices can be used to our advantage.
First, we need to understand (some of) the ways oil affects the global 
economy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Low oil prices squeeze the Russian economy.</li>
<li>Low oil prices kill USA shale. (Bondholders)</li>
<li>Low oil prices lead to MORE pumping. (Saudis)</li>
<li>Low oil prices stimulate consumers. (Us)</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t care about #1 and #2, though still important and positively viewed through the lens of boycott. #3 and #4 is where We the People can apply pressure.</p>

<p>If consumers do not BUY into the &quot;cheap oil = go spending&quot; and the producers keep up production, prices will plummet. Lots of supply and no demand. Reserves will be filled and production will have to be stopped for lack of storage. This is the WORST thing for a producer, having more product than buyers.</p>

<p>Now, if the producers are trying to pump every bit they can to keep their
economies going and We the People effectively stop purchasing oil/gas, how would that affect those that are counting on our spending?</p>

<p>By not buying gas, I mean in excess of need. Keep buying gas to get to your job and the market, but no need to go &#39;cruising&#39;, &#39;run down my tank to fill up at these great prices&#39;, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive non-participation</strong></p>

<p>In martial arts, or war, you turn your enemies strengths against them. Our enemy&#39;s strength is their control over production. Consumer spending is the primary factor driving this strength. If we don&#39;t buy their crap, they go broke.</p>

<p>If GoDaddy stopped supporting SOPA when we boycotted them, what would the oil (and by proxy banking) cartels do if we boycotted them?</p>

<p><strong>A historical note</strong></p>

<p>During WW1 the USA (and other nations) artificially priced wheat. After WW1 these price floors were removed, but not in the USA. This led bankers from Chicago and NYC to come to the Midwest and buy farms. These jokers were called &quot;suitcase farmers&quot;. They made lots of money selling the artificially high wheat. Eventually the USA dropped the artificial price support and the prices plummeted (from ~$2.50 to ~$0.50 over 10 years, culminating in the great depression).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ohwy.com/history%20pictures/maps/wheat-graph.gif">wheat price chart</a></p>

<p>As the price fell, the suitcase farmers and the real farmers alike plowed up more and more land (pumping more oil) to make up the profits. As unluck would have it, drought struck and the Dustbowl happened. There is more to it than this (interest rates and lending), but the point is: producers will increase supply in the face of falling prices.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong></p>

<p>GENERAL BOYCOTT on anything that does not improve the quality of your life and reduce your reliance on dollars.</p>

<p>Cheap oil/gas is a trick to get us to spend, don&#39;t fall for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your TLDR is great.</p>

<p>By focusing on buying high-quality products built to last, and spending time (instead of being convinced through bullshit marketing), you can reward companies that produce superior products, and will have more cash in the long run to pay off debts by not mindlessly spending when ever the TV tells you to.</p>

<p>Such a dramatic impact, it really is undescribable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I enjoyed your comments about utilizing waste products from one project as inputs for another.</p>

<p>These last few months I have finally gotten positive responses from &quot;normal people&quot; on the idea of boycott. For years they all brushed it off as insane. My Dad was telling me about how several of his workers were bringing up stuff about monopolies and endless war - ones that were &quot;asleep&quot; a year ago. Good signs!</p>
