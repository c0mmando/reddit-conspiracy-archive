    <div class="md"><p>Well, find a link or something. </p>

<p>The reason i do not believe that the NSA funded the &quot;No Planes Theory&quot; is that i have known a main protagonists (possibly the first) of this theory and nobody was funding him, <em>nobody</em>. He had to &quot;borrow&quot; beer, not to mention rent.</p>

<p>As for the theory itself, i do not agree with the final conclusion. The value of the discussion is that the TV footage is demonstrably altered. And i have a beef with people that watch TV and think it is real. </p>

<p>What i say to the NPT argument is... </p>

<p>Granted the live TV footage is fake, therefor it must be thrown out as evidence of anything except a media coverup. A lack of unaltered airplane footage does not prove an absence of airplanes. </p>

<p>(i prefer to say aircraft anyway)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did found one, but very oblique. But my main problem is that I remember this being on main stream news as a small part of a bigger scandal around 2007-2009 or so regarding some kind of audit of the NSA. Now it look like that got scrubbed off. I have to try looking for a better link.</p>

<p>As for the theory itself, pure BS. I work for more than a decade as a tv show compositor. I worked with the same kind of software that would have been available at the time. I can tell you that altering stuff on the fly and get the look realistic was not available. </p>

<p>I believe that this theory is still being pushed by peoples who want to discredit any type of questioning into 9-11 by making us look like idiots.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense the NSA would only shoot themselves in the foot. I actually believe from the thousands of pieces of evidence (and the fact the several eye witnesses have died/disappeared) that no planes actually hit the WTC just like WTC7. Ask yourselves who took the footage of the first plane that hit. So far no one has come forward. Go down the rabbit hole!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that video <strong>doesn&#39;t show a plane</strong> hitting  the towers, it just shows <em>something hitting the towers</em>.</p>

<p>Link: </p>

<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=miA8Td4oNcY">http://youtube.com/watch?v=miA8Td4oNcY</a></p>

<p>Did you see what that was? I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also - if you pause this at ~1:21 you see at the height of the &quot;impact&quot; the part of the building directly to the right to the edge of that side is completely fine. Then the camera loses focus and bounces around, and when it gains focus again (pause at ~1:31) there is a comically shaded/shopped part of the building.</p>

<p>Want to try again?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t make this notion. And no, you didn&#39;t <em>counter</em> any claim, because the Naudet video doesn&#39;t show a plane hitting the WTC.</p>

<p>You did not achieve this, but I am perfectly satisfied to agree to disagree. Doesn&#39;t really bother me either way if you believe in the Official Version™. My only hope that those on the fence or are at least curious will see this conversation and look into it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gerard Holmgren has done such an excellent job that I&#39;m posting another excerpt:</p>

<p>Now lets look at the other choice - using real jets.</p>

<p>This immediately splits into two sub-choices 1) Pilot them with suicide pilots 2) Remote control them.</p>

<p>The problem with the first choice is obvious and I think most people on this list have already accepted the absurdity and the monstrous difficulties of such a scenario, so I won&#39;t go into them here.</p>

<p>Remote control.</p>

<p>Before addressing the problems with that, the scenario splits into more -sub-choices.</p>

<p>1) Hijack a real flight with real passengers aboard. 2) Launch a plane from somewhere else and pass it off as a real flight.</p>

<p>Basically, the choices here split into the option of crashing a plane with passengers aboard or with no passengers aboard. Both possibilities create potentially insurmountable problems in the cover up - and a reduced likelihood of the crash being successfully targeted to begin with.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the latter problem. While it&#39;s certainly feasible to remote control a large jet into the towers, it&#39;s a high precision targeting job for an aircraft with very limited maneuverability. There&#39;s a significant risk that the plane won&#39;t hit its target properly. That it will hit some other building, just clip its wing on the tower and crash into the streets or cause a cascade of damage on other non targeted buildings, miss altogether and finish up in the Hudson, still reasonably intact - all kinds of risks.</p>

<p>Whatever the calculated likelyhood of a successfully targeted crash, it would have to be significantly lower than that of a missile or blobs- thing, which is specifically engineered for such precision strikes.</p>

<p>Even the smallest increase in risk of the target not being hit properly would be completely unacceptable, given the easily manageable nature of any problems associated with the alternative scenario.</p>

<p>And missing the target is only the beginning of the problem. What about the aftermath ? Once it misses the target, there&#39;s a significant risk that the aircraft may crash in such a manner that it&#39;s reasonably intact. Rescue workers and emergency services who are completely innocent of the scam, and ordinary people wanting to help out are going to reach the wreckage before any perpsters, given that where it crashed couldn&#39;t be foreseen.</p>

<p>And what are they going to find ? Two choices. A plane with no -one in it. How are the perps going to explain that, huh ? Or a plane with passengers. This raises even more problems. Using a plane with passengers creates two more sub-choices.</p>

<p>1) Hope that all the passengers get killed in the crash, so there&#39;s no survivors to talk or hope that the perps can get to them first and knock them off before they do talk.</p>

<p>2) Kill them before the crash with a timed release of gas into the aircon system. Which of course leaves more forensic evidence to cover up, when the bodies are examined. Imagine the massive operation needed to get enough perps swarming over the wreckage quickly enough to control what the media,innocent rescue workers or survivors would start blabbing before the spin sets in. Far worse than anything a few witnesses could say in the 18 minutes between the two tower strikes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found one link from 2007 regarding a Greg Jenkins who was pushing to DEW theory for 9-11 and had previous research financed by the NSA.  </p>

<p><a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/transcript/Jenkins_transcript.html">http://drjudywood.com/articles/transcript/Jenkins_transcript.html</a></p>

<p>This is not what I remember from the msm. But I&#39;ll talk later to a coworker from back in those days and see what he remember.</p>

<p>&quot;Greg Jenkins edited out the early part of this interview, showing that his camera crew were carefully repositioning the lighting and cameras. So, why did they reposition the cameras and lighting to film Greg Jenkins fairly straight-on, at a distance, with direct lighting, but chose to film Dr. Wood from the side, close up, with lighting from the side that put shadows across her face? Why do you think they did this?</p>

<p>This event does nothing to undermine the scientific merit of Dr. Wood&#39;s work. To the contrary. Who would want to invest so much time, energy, expense, and manpower into producing such a video? How does Greg Jenkins manage to explain the fact that some of his research is funded by the NSA? Yes, I mean THAT NSA; the one that has a vested interest in making sure the truth of 9/11 stays buried. I can not think of a higher, more direct indicator that Dr. Judy Wood is on the right track in assessing what caused WTC1,2 to be pulverized in less than 10 seconds than to be setup in an ambush video-manipulation by an NSA informant. Imagine that. Why would Judy Wood be the most important person to attack …and to attempt to persuade every 911 &quot;truther&quot; to attack? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the evidence:
Greg Jenkins&#39; PhD thesis may have been supported by the NSA as per the following links:
Annual Report: and here and here (archived here and here). </p>

<p>where the following acknowledgment can be found:
&quot;This work was supported in part by NSF grant DMR-9705129 and by funding from the NSA.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you satisfied that Greg Jenkins has severed his links with the NSA; or, does that matter to you one way or another?&quot;</p>

<p>Ah yes, but who will do the claiming? Think about it. All the hijackers die (unless you consult with the BBC reports saying some of the hijackers were still alive.</p>

<p>Oops - those silly Brits couldn&#39;t get a script right. They&#39;ve been much better with the ISIS drama though, I will admit that. But we needed a 20th hijacker, so we could go through <em>due process</em> like good Americans, and the Two Minites Hate with Bin Laden on the nightly news just wasn&#39;t gonna cut it.</p>

<p>Never mind his extended stay in our <del>gulag</del> <del>military prison in Cuba</del> Guantanamo... Or that most documents about him need to be sealed due to National Security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Edit on 12/9/14:  really weird that my other excerpt from Holmgren&#39;s essay is at +5, while this excerpt from the same essay is at -9.  14 pt difference between two excerpts from the same essay?</strong></p>

<p>Never heard of it and I highly doubt it.  Namely because all the evidence indicates that there were no planes.  </p>

<p>This essay by the late, great truther Gerard Holmgren should be read by every truther who still believes there were planes.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.911closeup.com/index.shtml">http://www.911closeup.com/index.shtml</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an excerpt:</p>

<p>Put yourself in the position of the perps. You have to think through what could go wrong in each possible scenario and then decide which scenario poses the smallest risk.</p>

<p>You want to sell a story about hijacked planes.</p>

<p>At the first level of decision making, you have two choices.</p>

<p>1) Actually use planes.</p>

<p>2) Use missiles or whatever the blobs 11 thing is, and convince people that they were planes.</p>

<p>Lets first look at the second scenario. You have the media on your side to tell the story. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>1) Witnesses might see that they were not planes and report it.</p>

<p>Well this has actually happened, but it seems that nobody takes any notice. The myth of &quot;thousands of witnesses&quot; to a big plane strike keeps getting trotted out on the basis of a circular assumption. &quot;Because big jets were there, then people must have seen them - because people saw them, that proves they were there.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly the perps thought about how to minimize the problem of contrary witness reports, and came up with a simple but effective plan.</p>

<p>This problem is easy to minimize. The first strike happens, and because the object is small and fast and unexpected, no-one is too sure what it is, or whether they saw it correctly. A few witness reports go to air reporting missiles or small planes or no craft at all, but there is only an 18 minute window for this to occur before the whole world sees a big jet live on TV - using commercially available real time animation technology. This distracts the media from interviewing many witnesses to the second strike, because everyone is fixated on the video replay. Those few witnesses who might get a moment with the media, then lack confidence in what they saw, because once again, the object was small, fast and unexpected. Seeing the TV replay - which was instantly available - would make most people think that they just didn&#39;t see it properly. The few who remain unshakable in their belief that it was not a large plane are easily shouted down and drowned out by the endless replays. In addition the airlines release a statement saying that they&#39;ve lost two big jets and any witness dissent is <em>instantly</em> - the moment the second strike happens - marginalized almost to the point of oblivion.</p>

<p>This is not speculation. Read through the transcripts of broadcasts as they unfolded between about 8.47 and 9.30 and you will see that this is <em>exactly</em> what happened. From the moment the second strike occurred, anyone who tried to say that it was not a large jet immediately had a TV replay shoved in their face.</p>

<p>What little witness evidence was gathered in the brief time available between the two strikes was not enough to do any real damage, and everything after that was corrupted by everybody having TV replays of the second jet shoved in their face as soon as they opened their mouths.</p>

<p>In that brief period between the two strikes, there was only one witness who said a large jet - and that just happened to be the vice prez of CNN, which of course is a major player in the scam - just as pivotal as the govt.</p>

<p>So we can see that the problem of contrary witnesses, while a minor inconvenience is easily overcome with some good planning.</p>

<p>Again, this is not speculation. The successful execution of this plan has been tested ion the real world - and it works. The scenario I have outlined exactly fits with the documented record of the events.</p>

<p>Once the sheeple factor sets in, everyone is chanting &quot;what about the people who saw it ? &quot; without ever bothering to check what those people actually did report. And if they do check, the numbers of reports are not high enough to inflict major damage on the official story. What little there is overwhelmingly supports something other than a big jet, but there wasn&#39;t enough time to gather enough numbers for this to be a significant evidence factor. And as for the ordinary person on the street - most of them would be easily convinced that they just didn&#39;t see it properly. Some might have lingering doubts or suspicions, but would be quickly silenced by ridicule and denial from the overwhelming pressure of the TV footage, and the whole world trying to convince them that they just didn&#39;t see it properly. Most would eventually come to believe that themselves.</p>

<p>So - that problem is easily dealt with. No cover story solves everything, and doubtless there are still some mutterings of doubt and suspicion amongst some people who were there, but it isn&#39;t enough to cause a serious problem.</p>

<p>Now to the other problem. </p>

<p>Those who believe 19 dudes with box cutters successfully penetrated the most guarded airspace in the world and were an amazing 75% (poor Shanksville) on their targets, despite being led by a former CIA asset in a cave in Afghanistan, are fucking ridiculous. Moving on.</p>

<p>I guess you would argue that the mechanism by which JFK was shot is irrelevant, since he was obviously shot, right? This comment is both false and offensive. Those buildings came down in a coordinated fashion, onto their own footprints, complete with pyroclastic clouds that melted nearby vehicles. That doesn&#39;t happen due to structural failure. The &quot;planes&quot; were used as an excuse.. Nothing more. </p>

<p>Have you seen footage of the hijackers waiting in the terminals? Waiting to board the plane? Maybe receipts for cabs they took to the airport? Anything besides an apparently inferno-resistant passport (if you can believe that) 5 days later:</p>

<p>I agree with this, but it is but a small component of what matters and why it is still such a charged issue. America was attacked that day, but it <del>was</del> wasn&#39;t Muslims with box-cutters, it was the Military-Industrial-Complex with television sets (among other things).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, &quot;America&quot; Wasn&#39;t attacked that day. America is a continent. A particular country was attacked that day (one that insists on stealing our fucking name), so the USA was attacked that day. </p>

<p>Second, yes, of course it was yet another staging of the military-industrial complex, or as Carlin would&#39;ve put it, The Owners of your country. My point is that it&#39;s very hard to prove whether it was a plane, or CGI, or a missile, or planes filled with confetti based on 14 year old grainy video. And even if you did manage to get absolute proof based on that video, people would ignore it and dismiss you as a conspiratard, mostly because they&#39;ve been trained by the man behind the curtain to dismiss anything not on fox news as a conspiracy. And, ultimately, what matters is that the attack, plane or otherwise, couldn&#39;t have been carried out without the support from at least some factions of the US government, and without previous knowledge from the US government, and that the way it was politically used afterwards points very clearly to the people that where clearly responsible for it. But the majority of the public still don&#39;t believe the Lusitania was a false flag attack, or that the US government had previous knowledge about Pearl Harbor and allowed it to happen, so good luck convincing anyone that there was more to 9/11 than CNN told them. Personally, I believe that political analysis is more than enough to prove that the US government and intelligence agencies where somewhat involved in the attack, and you have a much higher chances of success convincing people with this analysis than with stills from grainy 14 year old low quality footage. Arguing about physics, CGI, or avionics is a fucking distraction from the obviousness of the situation. </p>

<p>I was fucking happy the day this happened, because I initially believed it (because I was a stupid 16 year old kid who wanted to see the Empire fall). 14 years later, I see all the people the US military have killed around the world using this event as a shitty excuse, and how it has changed the political layout, and how I can&#39;t take a fucking coke can into a plane anymore, and I&#39;m not so happy about it anymore. </p>

<p>This is a misunderstanding of what a hijack is. It&#39;s not as if the pilots managed to squawk 7500 in time and notify anyone they were hijacked, the first clue was when the planes turned off course and went quiet on the radios. Which happens often enough. Rare but not that rare. Reacting to something like that takes time.</p>

<p>So by the time the hijackers acted, the airspace had already been &quot;penetrated&quot;, to use your terminology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t really think it&#39;s nitpicking. It&#39;s fundamental to how the whole thing worked - surprise. </p>

<p>Which is why airport security is a little pointless. The audacity of 9/11 was in novelty, it&#39;s very hard to defend against what you can&#39;t expect.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because there was nothing to evade - the presumption is off-base.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t standing air patrols in 99% of Western airspace, and there weren&#39;t then. You have to scramble fighters which takes time, meanwhile the aircraft is moving on at 400knots.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as if there were fighters already armed and at altitude <em>just in case</em>. That&#39;s not how air forces work in peacetime. USAF budget is big but it&#39;s not that big.</p>

<p>Look at Flight 11. Estimated cockpit breach at 8:14, Atta accidentally broadcasts on radio at 8:26, twenty minutes later it hits. </p>

<p>Twenty minutes is a very short space of time to get whatever fighters you can up there. Eight minutes of radio silence is unusual and an immediate priority but again nothing to think &quot;hijack!&quot; about. </p>

<p>Now, of course, it is.</p>

<p>Kinda, but I&#39;m not a pilot and wasn&#39;t a frequent flyer back then. I do think it&#39;s absurd that dudes who could barely fly a fucking Cessna managed to fly Boeing 767s far beyond their VMOs at sea level into buildings that subsequently collapsed at free fall speed into their own footprints.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s just shitty planning, considering there were warnings of terrorist acts involving commercial jet liners and of all places, the Pentagon, according to the 1999 report entitled &quot;THE SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF TERRORISM:
WHO BECOMES A TERRORIST AND WHY?&quot; Here&#39;s a fun quote <strong>[emphasis mine]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Al-Qaida’s <strong>expected retaliation</strong> for the U.S. cruise missile attack against al-
Qaida’s training facilities in Afghanistan on August 20, 1998, could take several
forms of terrorist attack in the nation’s capital. Al-Qaida could detonate a
Chechen-type building-buster bomb at a federal building. <strong>Suicide bomber(s)
belonging to al-Qaida’s Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed
with high explosives (C-4 and semtex) into the Pentagon.</strong></p>

<p>They should have fixed that.. After it happened previously (it&#39;s in the report above. More fuel for your Incompetence Theory I guess.</p>
