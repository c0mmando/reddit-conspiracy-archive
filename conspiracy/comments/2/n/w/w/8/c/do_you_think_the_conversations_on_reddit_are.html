       Ever notice what happens to comments that voice an incorrect opinion? It's like a football game and you're the guy with the ball. Everybody piles on top and the play stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a comment that goes against the groupthink and prepare for downvotes... even outright hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is where I'm going to go into deep conspiracy territory. I actually wonder if this isn't the result of mass behavioral conditioning. For some reason, some of us are still able to ask questions... to doubt the official narrative and think for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 80 or 90% have been conditioned. But we, as reddit members, are still part of their peer group. When they go online and see comments that contradict the programming it actually causes them some form of mental pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are unable to suddenly start thinking for themselves or rearrange their worldview to make sense of things. Instead, they lash out with angry comments and downvotes.

       I like to do this: I troll with some facts, and then round it out with some conspiracy ideas  (No Agenda show, anyone?) Attitudes are almost always the same -- outright derision. There's no room for growth, or at the very least, discussion of said ideas. Just "no, you're wrong" in so many ways.

       Have you ever tried to explain to an Obamabot that Obamacare doesn't fix the problem of health insurance because health insurance is the problem? It only eliminates the barrier to entry (which still cost decent money!) I once suggested that Obama could be more effective with executive actions when it came to changing the shape of health insurance, and I was ridiculed on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       guess how many people want to hug obama on his executive action for immigration?

       The human shills are definitely on the increase. Thankfully, they're quite easy to spot. They will generally:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Frequent subs that require very little specialist knowledge (music, movies, TV, etc.);
       </li>
       <li>
        Accuse anyone who doesn't have a mainstream opinion of an event (9/11, Sandy Hook, etc.) of being ghoulish;
       </li>
       <li>
        Talk to you like they've got a PHD in critical thought and suggest that you're either stupid or a lunatic (or both) for not agreeing with their views;
       </li>
       <li>
        Try and intimidate you with ridiculously bloated and condescending prose, generally in the way an adult would talk down to a petulant child.
       </li>
      </ul>

       Why would someone who disagrees with conspiracies be posting in r/conspiracy, though? Surely this is the one sub they

       I don't see why a person has to believe in conspiracies in order to participate here. Often times people are motivated to correct or argue with people when they see someone spreading information that they believe is untrue. Take this conversation for example. I browse this subreddit mainly looking for views that may challenge my own. I saw your comment and chosen to express skepticism of your methods. Considering this is a community of supposed skeptics, im surprised
 dissenting opinions are so discouraged.

       There are very few people in the world who can make a funny Down's syndrome gag and my guess is that you are not one of those people. You'd get booed off the playground for that one. Shameful display.

       There are some. They seem to mostly spew irrelevant insults that can be generically applied, like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        OMFG did you really just type that?? What a moron lol...
       </li>
       <li>
        Somebody is off their meds.
       </li>
       <li>
        that is the dumbest thing I've read all day
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think the shills are still mostly human, but we've gotta be getting close to where a common bot can pass a Turing test. When it's trivial to corrupt Internet conversation, en masse, I don't know where that leaves us.

       Absolutely. There was a wonderful screen cap someone posted here a while ago that had 3 different reddit users posting across a couple different threads. The comments these users posted were exact copies of each other from one thread to the next, but the user names were switched around between the threads. If that isn't proof of botting, I don't know what is.

       It's not always botting.

       There is a never ending supply of people who get their panties in a twist for one reason or another, usually when they've been proven wrong or are over-emotional young adults.

       This can manifest in many ways: stalking and downvoting all pf a user's comment history, copying and pasting irrelevant attacks based on a user's history, or even manipulating votes (like
       <a href="/u/unidan">
        /u/unidan
       </a>
       got caught doing) by using multiple accounts to influence public perspective.
      </p>

       I could be wrong, but most of the trolls fall into the category above, ie the petulant deceptive child mindset rather than automated bots.

      <p>
       But yeah, there are at least
       <em>
        some

       bots doing similar things, just not on the same scale.  I hope.

       The thing I am referencing was like:
      </p>
      <p>
       in thread X user A posted comment 1, user B posted comment 2 replying to comment 1 and user C posted comment 3 in response to comment 2, but in thread Y user B posted comment 1, user C comment 2 and user A comment 3. Letter for letter. The "conversation" was exactly the same between threads except the user names were switched around.

       I do agree that people downvote from impotent rage but the post I am thinking about was absolutely bots.

       I wouldn’t doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this isn’t happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Articles questioning authority (Pentagon, CIA) seem to be stricken from the record. I feel this is dangerous--imagine if the MSM had allowed more voices of dissent in the run up to the Iraq invasion in 2003.

       Couldn't a non-shill display similar behaviour? Essentially all you described was someone who disagrees with conspiracies and may be condescending/emotional. Also, I'm not really sure how the unrelated subreddits people comment in have anything to do with them being a shill or not?
