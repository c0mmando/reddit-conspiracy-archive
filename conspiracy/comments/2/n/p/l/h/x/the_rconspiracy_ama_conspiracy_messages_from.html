       Recently it was revealed that the so called 'Richard_Gage' and 'AE911Truth' accounts were fakes. I suspected the account was fake, he seemed very different and not as nice as when he has been interviewed before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the messages they sent me would be interesting for you lot to see, just to show how much effort someone would put into creating a fake AmA. A little context first. I posted on
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       I believe, requesting an AmA with Richard Gage. They messaged me saying they would be happy to do it and I refereed them to the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods. I assumed it was all verified, I was told by mods that it was in fact verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some images of the events:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the messages it seems like the account was purposefully trying to get the AmA on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       so that it wouldn't have to go through the
       <a href="/r/IAmA">
        /r/IAmA
       </a>
       review process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its obvious now that these accounts were in fact fake, even going to the smallest of details such as creating an AE911truth account and posting a few key articles from AE911Truth.org to give the impression of it being a social media account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we really need to look into who verified this, what information/contacts were exchanges and how this happened.

       This is obviously a setback for this sub, but it was a carefully planned and well executed deception to promote disinformation about 9/11 and to discredit those seeking the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a silver lining, it provides us with hard evidence (to show the doubters) that there are individuals who are prepared to go to extreme lengths to stop the truth about 9/11 becoming known.

       Considering that Richard Gage is a public activist whose main job is to give interviews to the media, it would have taken nothing more than an email to his public account to verify/disprove the identity of the account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, not a single moderator emailed the actual Richard Gage to verify?

       Do we still have access to the original, fake, AMA? I can't seem to find it. I was pretty unimpressed with "Richard's" answers, now I know why. He said some goofy stuff, like "Dropping a book on your head doesn't cause it to collapse, therefore the pancake theory is fake" or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else wondering if our friends at con'tard are behind this?

       [edit] 1. I found the AMA. 2. He said drop a bowling ball on your head.

       yeah, I remember that. I was suspicious immediately when someone asked why the weight of the building above the plane crash wouldn't crush the floors underneath it and his response was (paraphrasing) "imagine dropping a bowling ball from a foot above your head, it wouldn't cause your body to collapse." Of course it would. I lolled.
I met this guy before and he was not that stupid.

       That was a huge red flag for me, too! It just didn't make sense, even as a way to simplify technical issues for a non- expert audience. Also, although I can't remember specific examples, I remember feeling like a lot of his answers were very short and almost condescending, like he was just brushing aside the points that the users were raising. That just seemed off to me -- why agree to come answer questions if you don't want to engage with the users?

       We are waiting to make a formal comment until the admins finish looking into the accounts in question, and rest assured, OP with a one month old account, if you had anything to do with with attempted defaming of Mr. Gage the admins will be in touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, this situation has forced us to implement a more strict series of AMA verifications, which will only increase the time required to set up these Ama's.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are very dissapointed that a user spent months organizing a false presence for ae911truth on reddit, only to use that history in a conspiracy to defame the image of Mr. Gage.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that said, because impersonating a celebrity with the intent of maliciously defaming their character is quite a serious situation we will await more information on the backend before making a full statement.

       While that post strikes me as being facebook bullshit (apart from having a basis in truth, they're hardly ever there) the sudden inrush of Brits who've never posted in conspiracy before rushing to defend the parliamentarians and refute the thread is one of the most suspicious things I've seen here in quite a while. Also, if Putin had any evidence whatsoever of the
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       9/11 terrorists I'm pretty sure we'd have it already, unless they're letting it out quietly through established channels.

       There are a quarter of a million subscribers. The post is total BS. Stands to reason that something obviously wrong and about their own country (as opposed to the remaining 95% of US/Israel-centric posts here) would inspire a few people to correct what is a
       <em>
        heavily
       </em>
       upvoted piece of junk.

       We're getting off the point a bit I'm afraid. 
If you're going to accuse NWOwon of spreading "dissent", and accuse me of somehow
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       "dissent", a working definition isn't too much to ask for. For the third time.

       So threatening the OP in the first line of your response is the professional manner in which you respond? The tone of your statement is telling of the overall ineptitude here. Why not begin with some humility? You did, in fact, host a completely misleading, implicitly defamatory AMA. This begs further questions into the nature of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one thought to send Gage an email to verify the AMA; instead going off of an easily falsified online presence?

       Threats should be the last thing you levy against the OP for pointing this out.

       I can see where you're coming from, but the OP was involved in leading us to the account impersonating the ae911truth organization, so we're a bit suspicious at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The member of our mod team who set up the AMA was certainly duped by the user in question purporting to represent ae911truth, and we have had to change our ama verification procedures as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are quite distressed that this has occurred on the subreddit, but we are more concerned about the targeting of Mr. Gage's reputation and we will be investigating to the fullest extent possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was not  a one off troll, the user who engaged in this impersonation went through months of planning with the intent of having his work culminate in the libelous and defamatory slandering of Mr. Gage; that is no small matter, and we wish to put together the full picture of what happened before making a full statement.

        NIST have said that they wont share their data for safety reasons. This is frustrating. However: what we at AE911truth can do is develop our own models. As we dont have the tools or resources that NIST do, it will take more time.

        When we compare our more accurate model to their's we will force them to the table, so to speak.

        It seem to me he's speaking hypothetically. "When" we compare, "we will" force them, etc. He's saying that once their model is released, they can compare the models.
Maybe I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I see nothing wrong with his statement.

        AMA's on
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        are a new thing, and we're working out the kinks. The last couple AMAs could've gone more smoothly, but looking back at each thread, I feel they ultimately were very successful.
Each participant spent several days interacting and commenting in the thread, not just the scheduled couple of hours, something that I'm sure is very rare for the regular AMA sub.
We'll do our best to prevent this in the future. Corbett has already announced his participation in one of his recent podcasts, and I'm sure he'll give further confirmation.
I'm also confident that Corbett will navigate his way through reddit much more easily that Richard Gage (who ended up figuring it out just fine).
We have another exciting scheduled AMA soon with someone who might have similar problems as Richard, but we'll do our best to prevent any more issues.

       mods was definitely a mistake but you're carrying your attacks on them (and us) way too far. At least have a little patience so they can work things out. They've already admitted their error and have modified their verification process.

       before I was banned from

       I was banned the same day of Richard's AMA. Look at the time stamp and realize
       <em>
        some redditors

       aren't settling for a non verified AMA. Why did you assume a non-verified AMA was real?

       I'm not the best redditor or contributor, but I'd appreciate it if candidate for moderator not jump to conclusions. It shows poor leadership and perception skill sets.

       The discussion is focused around the idea of sockpuppet accounts being used to misdirect or influence opinion.  By saying "that makes perfect sense s/" you are implying that you think it makes no sense.  This could lead outside observers to conclude you don't understand the previous discussion or that you are trying to make the idea sound ludicrous -  for what reason?

       That I have no answers for. I do however think that the mod voting should be null and voided until this issue gets properly addressed and solved. This is the first mod vote since I've been around set to contest mode. That makes me a bit suspicious in more ways than one.

       IDN if thanksgiving weekend will affect this sub much. Seems like if people have time off they will be checking in more here. But if we have a serious issue with foxes in the henhouse, we shouldn't be inviting more foxes in. We should be securing the basic foundations are strong. Contest mode for voting a mod or mods here in itself is censorship. Unless the mods have an agenda themselves. Not to say they are rigging the votes, but perhaps the timing of voting paired with the invisibility of votes for candidates is an "experiment"  to catch a fox or two. All speculation on my part. I'm not a mod here so I don't know the reasoning. Edit spelling

       The reasoning was to disuade brigading and keep things as anonymous as possible. It's my understanding that when the vote is done, the votes will be made public. I'll make sure of it.

       Yeah I can see it from many perspectives on why it's done in contest mode. Thanks for answering the query. I do hope you guys post the votes to be made public info. That seems only reasonable given this subs definition and purpose.

       It's my understanding we were waiting for further information from the admins. Plus, the current sticky for mod recruitment was meant to go until today and that took precedence.

       Thanks for the response. Any thoughts on
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       chiming in on the subject? I've heard it before the reasoning to that users inactivity here but that mod is high up in both related subs. Since I have you conversing here I'll ask the question I just posted on the mod voting thread. Will we be voting to replace the mods
       <a href="/u/quantumcipher">
        /u/quantumcipher
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">
        /u/Three_Letter_Agency
       </a>
       who seemed to disappear from reddit and this sub? quantumcipher hasn't has any account activity in three months and TLA is quite inactive on reddit as well. Or will these new mods just be added in addition to the inactive ones?

       Doubtful, though you're welcome to reach out.
      </p>
      <p>
       illuminatedwax almost never does anything in this sub. A few months ago they showed up and approved/deleted 2 or 3 comments (nothing special, very typical stuff that we could see in the mod log).
      </p>
      <p>
       We reached out in the mod mail, said um, hey, and got zero response. It was a little weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       quantumcipher, from what I understand, is taking a long (perhaps permament) break from reddit in general. When they were on the mod team, quantum was doing a
       <em>
        ton
       </em>
       of work and kind of burnt out. This isn't exactly a fun and stress-free place to be a moderator. quantum is welcome back anytime,.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLA is a writer (you should read his recent book!) and posted last 19 days ago. I'm sure he's working on something fantastic and also has a well-deserved place on the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently discussing whether or not to remove inactive mods like 9000sins and quantum, but the new mods will most definitely be
       <em>
        in addition
       </em>
       to the current team. The sub is growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I mention it, I'm surprised you weren't nominated, I would've voted for you for sure.

       Thanks again for the reply. And a detailed one at that. The last mod vote I nominated quantumcipher and was quite sad to see that user sort of fade out. I'm interested in TLA's new book indeed. I can't imagine the stress you all deal with here. And I sincerely hope you all get to the bottom of this issue. And are able in this format (reddit) to solve it. Making a post on the subject will open a lot of people's eyes to just how deep some things can go. I hope the mods here reached out to Richard Gage in some way. It'd be a shame to have him left with a salty taste in his mouth about

       Also, illuminatedwax is almost never active here and they haven't been for years. It's unfortunate, because they can pretty much make or break the sub.

       can the head/top mod quietly delete comments and do whatever without any accountability also? Or do other mods here aware of everything other mods may do? Does the top mod have full transparency of activities in a sub to the lower mods? I am just asking because I don't know how mod stuff works.

       Interesting post from such a new account OP. The newness of your account, and the obvious fact you used to be (or currently are) someone else on reddit but won't say who you used to be (or currently are in your main account), while so self-righteously calling out those who run this subreddit really bothers me.
