    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of those things that sounds good on its surface -- and I think it <em>could</em> be a good thing, if done right. You know, the liberal dream: all creeds and cultures living together as one. And I hate, hate, hate national borders.. the whole idea of carving up the planet makes my skin crawl. And multiple currencies are a colossal pain in the ass, as anybody who&#39;s traveled can tell you. Not to mention multiple languages. Wouldn&#39;t it be so much better to have everyone all on the same page??</p>

<p>But you have to examine the motivations and methods of the people pushing for it. Mass murder, rape, torture, theft, starvation.. all forms of suffering are just political tools to them. They erect massive propaganda bubbles to keep the public thinking they&#39;re somehow in control. They monitor everyone; any threats to their power are eliminated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like a dictatorship: If you have the right leader in power, it can be a fantastic, efficient form of government. If you have the wrong guy, you&#39;re screwed. The folks pushing for a one world government have proven that they&#39;re not good people.</p>

<p>My liberal heart loves the idea of a one world government DONE RIGHT. But the risks of centralizing that much power are just too great. I&#39;m thinking decentralization is the way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it comes down to &quot;what could be&quot;.</p>

<p>If the world were based on a decent government say like Denmark or Canada it would be actually pretty good. But then again, it could wind up like North Korea. And there would be no place to hide and nowhere would be safe. For every France model there is also a Pakistani model waiting to come about... how to ensure peoples freedoms and rights?</p>

<p>Politics and political power would only be for the absolute filthy rich, who else could afford to be a world leader? Its bad enough that the rich are entrenched in today&#39;s politics, imagine a future where only the .0001 % have the cash to enter politics.</p>

<p>I think that maybe someday we might be able to have world peace, world rights and a chance at legitimate world government but i am thinking my view is very Utopic at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Kant&#39;s vision of true cosmopolitanism laid out in <em>Theory and Practice</em> could be achieved that would be somewhat acceptable; but the current manifestation of the global order is nothing more than a conduit for profit whoring at the expense of liberal values. </p>

<p>Further entrenching that order via an actual global governance would spell the end of the liberal renaissance. As it is, the liberal paradigm is already drawing to a close, as it&#39;s values are engulfed by a conflagration of factitious disposition on the part of moined interests; slowly sucking the oxygen from the life blood of democratic republics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy is good, right? It allows the common person to participate in his own system of government. That&#39;s been universally recognized as a positive thing throughout history.</p>

<p>Democracy only works well in a nation that is cohesive and united under one language, one culture, one set of moral and ethical beliefs, and one religion (never underestimate the importance of religion in our lives).</p>

<p>When a nation becomes divided against itself, with many different clashing cultures, many languages, many religions, different sets of moral beliefs, democracy breaks down. Democracy starts to be gamed by the more powerful and more manipulative factions in the society, for their benefit and against the benefit of the other groups.</p>

<p>We see this breakdown in democracy in the United States today, under the impact of multiculturalism, which is destroying America. We saw the same thing historically in ancient Rome.</p>

<p>A world government, by its inherent nature, is a multicultural society of many clashing languages, religions, cultures, and moral systems. By it&#39;s very nature a world government can never be democratic. If we move toward a world government, we sacrifice the democratic process. There is no escaping this effect.</p>
