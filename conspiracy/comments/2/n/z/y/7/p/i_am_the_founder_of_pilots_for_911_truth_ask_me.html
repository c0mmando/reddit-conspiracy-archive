<p>If you need more confirmation, I can do the same on our FB group and twitter account.</p>

<p>Edit2 - I made this post below after this thread had 142 comments and 58 points - </p>

<p>To the mods,</p>

<p>I have been dealing with trolls and shills for the better part of 8 years.... since I founded P4T in 2006. This is how I was able to spot it so quickly with &quot;Richard_Gage&quot;, and prompted me to email Richard himself. Those here who offer nothing but insults in order to provoke an emotional response is textbook trolling and/or tactics of truth suppression. I will, from this moment forward... ignore anyone who personally attacks our organization and me. Please get your sub under control... or you won&#39;t have many who want to do an AMA in this sub... and it will just be another reddit romper room.</p>

I find it odd that you are continuously adding little happy faces ;) here and there and &quot;lol&#39;s&quot; too.

You seem to be diverting everyone to your website and movies instead of truly engaging with the users here. My only question at this point is if you will make a video on youtube as you offered to do in the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess any things possible right? I&#39;m not even trying to derail him from legitimately answering genuine questions. Simply asking for something he offered to do for additional verification. I was excited for this AMA but as they say expectations can often lead to disappointments. He is stating that perhaps tomorrow he will do a youtube video. He did provide the FB verification. I don&#39;t use FB, but that&#39;s not the point. At least he did that as asked by another user. I was just hoping to find some sliver of info or potential inspirational that might lead me down newer avenues of exploration on the subject. EDIT- rereading my comment I realize that using the word &quot;even&quot; in my statement was a mistake on my part. I won&#39;t delete it but I should have rephrased that better. That one word can misconstrue my entire comment. </p>

<p>I offered that for confirmation. If you would like to communicate on a more personal level, feel free to email me with your phone number and I will call.. You can record the whole conversation, not to mention you will have my personal cell phone number.</p>

<p>The only users who have asked for further verification are you and maybe one other, who have refused to contact me through our website.</p>

<p>Sorry my friend... but I am not your dancing bear.</p>

<p>I am already a bit overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the questions here, now you want me to make videos?</p>

<p>It is possible I may make a video so I don&#39;t have to refresh.. refresh... type and type... probably tomorrow when i check back here...</p>

<p>But if it is verification you seek, you are in the minority... as anyone reading through my history will see who I am.. .not to mention the fact you can contact me... right now... through our website... and have an answer in less than 5 mins.</p>

<p>But no... you want me to be your dancing bear.... why is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply. I&#39;m not going to continue this charade of bantering for the fact that you should be answering users questions. And you seem to be overwhelmed already with very few quality questions being asked. I am not asking you to be a &quot; dancing bear&quot;. Interesting analogy.

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand the spontaneity aspect. But with 15 mods, this thread is currently in excess of what&#39;s expectable. I did see two mods somewhat active here but not as long as you have been. Maybe the mods should have arranged for this to happen in a different time frame than on the spot to insure someone could be actively here? Seems reasonable on many levels to me. This entire past few weeks have me looking like a crazy person bucking the system here. And I have been honestly. Like I said before, something&#39;s gotta shift here for the better.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the inactive mod aspect has been a question of mine for awhile and especially since the new mod voting on a holiday weekend after a user post about the fake Gage AMA all done in contest mode. If that made sense. Then recently seeing an inactive mod I questioned seemed to take an interest in this sub again. IDN. I&#39;m only speculating at this point. You also stated that the mod(s) approved this stickied AMA after receiving verification. So again my questions remain the same. Thanks for the reply though. I do agree it would have been beneficial for Rob to have prearranged this in some way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read through this entire AMA quite a few times like I have. You will notice me questioning why <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a> wasn&#39;t here last night but actively participating in the other thread about the upcoming AMA simultaneously. I find that odd as orangutan is a mod of 911truth and it seemed would have had a lot of good questions to ask in addition to assisting in this AMA. SoveriegnMan stated that he messaged orangutan to ask for assistance here and didn&#39;t receive a reply. This entire AMA is feeling to me like a social experiment of sorts. In more ways than one. I too am not quite sure what to make of it all. And you being a new mod were placed in a very questionable situation. Almost a damned if you do and damned if you don&#39;t scenario. You may be asked &quot;why didn&#39;t you _____&quot; (fill in the blank with your choice- remove comments, ask users or Rob to tone it down, give a warning, ban users, etc.) and if you did then you may be asked &quot; Why did you do that?&quot; I feel for you, it&#39;s a sticky situation. </p>

<p>I agree with you here.  I had the same feeling during Gage&#39;s and during the announcement thread that Karen Hudes appeared in before storming off in a hissy fit: just that something is... <em>off</em>.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to delete comments or restrict questions too much in the thread just because I found myself agreeing with the people expressing skepticism and wanted to hear better answers to the questions asked.  I also don&#39;t believe in censorship anyway outside of deleting obviously inflammatory or trollish comments witout any substance to them which I actually didn&#39;t see too many of in the AMA thread.</p>

<p>I will say that these last two AMA&#39;s have me seriously questioning the organizations behind the &quot;official 9/11 Truth Movement&quot; - perhaps that was the point all along?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly not sure about any of it or this sub. I wanted to bring up a few things last night but didn&#39;t want to come off as attempting to derail the actual AMA. This user who is doing the AMA has a questionable account and history. He recently did an AMA in 911 truth and attempted to do one here about a week ago. His account was banned for spamming,reinstated etc etc. when he attempted the last AMA here there was no verification. And little participation. It seems to me if he was genuinely interested in doing an official AMA he would have taken the time and due diligence to set it up properly with mods here. The sticky was removed from this post also. Do you know anything about that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah we originally had the Russ Baker announcement stickied last night when Rob&#39;s AMA was brought to our attention in the mod mail.  Since it was new and ongoing, we decided to sticky <em>it</em> since we figured he would only be answering questions for a few hours.  Once it became clear late last night and into today that the AMA was questionable and largely a failure, the other announcement thread was re-instated.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that about his account as I don&#39;t really ever visit the 911 sub but that sounds strange.  But if the AMA was verified on the pilots for 9/11 website using the admin&#39;s account, I don&#39;t know how Rob could be someone other than who he says unless someone hacked his account or he had someone else take control of it for some reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;m as curious and confused about the whole thing as you, believe me.  No idea why he wouldn&#39;t have first tried to consult with us mods (or anyone really) before making the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Balsalmo, I&#39;d just like to inform you on something you may or may not already know about this subreddit.</p>

<p>We are a fairly popular sub amongst all of the &#39;conspiracy&#39; related ones. And because of that, we are the target of a vast amount of manipulation from Meta-subs like subredditdrama, and mock-subs like r/conspiratard.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that these AMA&#39;s are still a fairly new thing for us and from what I&#39;ve seen, the mods are doing everything they can to make it go as smoothly as possible. The faked Richard Gage AMA was a consequence of that, but the benefit will hopefully outweigh the damage it caused.</p>

<p>I only say this because I too am disappointed with the amount of vitriol directed at you in some of these comments, but would be equally as disappointed if you (or any other legitimate guest) were left with a negative impression of this sub as a whole due to what I view as a campaign of injecting FUD into the community mindset against it&#39;s mod team and subsequent AMA guests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rob, thanks for your years of dedication to finding out the truth. A few questions:</p>

<p>1.) Do you believe Barbara Honneker&#39;s (sp?) account of what happened at the Pentagon? I&#39;ve seen virtually every piece of evidence for it and I&#39;ve concluded she is the most correct as far as what it was and what it wasn&#39;t. You and your team obviously did a great job analyzing the data recorder.</p>

<p>2.) What do you have on the horizon as far as new projects or anything like that.</p>

<p>3.) I found a thread (I&#39;d link it but I&#39;m on my phone and it&#39;s difficult to maneuver) that debated whether or not the uA plane could have reached the speeds it did at sea level without breaking up. I believe it was Mick West&#39;s site. Do you have any doubt the plane could have gone that fast unless it was not standard?</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this garbage.  This makes perfect sense.  /s  Those capable of covering up all of the lies would not allow seekers of truth in their government.  Key word, their.  No longer of the people, or based in truth.</p>

<p>Anyone with even a mid two digit IQ can see through the lies of 9/11.  The planes were physically incapable of the speeds and handling claimed in the sham of a report.  The videos are clearly faked.  If you possessed even a rudimentary understanding of physics, you would understand this.  The planes smashing into the twins towers would react identically to the planes being hit while standing still with a ~500 mph tower swung just like a baseball bat.  They in no way would have entered the facades of the towers perfectly with absolutely no blown back pieces of plane.  Remember old Newton? </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t foolish enough to believe the Zionist lies any longer.  They had Mossad agents living with the alleged terrorist hijackers.  They were also involved with insider trading that required foreknowledge.  They had agents pre planted to record the incident, and they were caught with explosives in vans.  They were involved with the anthrax hoax attacking only those who fought aagainst the Zionist plot.  </p>

<p>But by all means, keep posting lies. You might ensnare the idiots, but you will not change the mind of anyone with critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>&quot;But for the most part, subreddits are like your next door neighbor&#39;s kid&#39;s birthday party that you&#39;ve been invited to. The reason you&#39;re all there is to celebrate a birthday and have cake. It would be completely inappropriate to give your elevator pitch and business card to everyone there - your host would likely ask you to leave or not invite you back again. Meet people, participate in discussion about the reason you&#39;re there, and make some new friends instead of trying to promote yourself and you&#39;ll have a much better time.&quot; - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion">http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion</a></p>

<p>Did you listen to the Captain sitting beside him who said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t do it, not at that speed&quot;.</p>

<p>Here are the qualifications of that Captain - </p>

<p>&quot;Rufus: He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, televangelism. But especially the factioning of all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always, built a belief structure on it.</p>

<p>Bethany: Having beliefs isn&#39;t good?</p>

<p>Rufus: I think it&#39;s better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier... &quot; - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655/">Dogma, 1999</a></p>

<p>I did. Saw the wrong wanted to see it righted. Once I chased the troll/shill a bit and a mod at r/conspiracy PM&#39;d them that they were contacting Gage, they deleted both their AE911Truth and Richard_Gage accounts, but it was Rob who straightened it out by having a correspondence with Gage to verify that he didn&#39;t actually say the things attributed to him by the impersonator.</p>

<p>There is ACARS data that supposedly shows both AA planes which hit the towers in NYC continuing on a westward trajectory over the state of Pennsylvania after their supposed impact time into the buildings. How can this be explained? </p>

<p>Furthermore, what do you think happened with those planes if the ACARS data is to be believed, and and what do you think actually crashed in to the towers on that fateful September morning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... let&#39;s break this down first....</p>

<p>It is reported that it was an &quot;AA&quot;(American Airlines) plane which hit the north tower.. (specifically &quot;AA11&quot;).... and a UAL plane which hit the South Tower (United 175).</p>

<p>It is important to understand the difference... as the ACARS messages released via FOIA are extremely specific and detailed. If you perform a google search, you will find our articles on the topic. I would post a direct link.... but you know how that goes... :-)</p>

<p>If you would like for me to re-post the article here without a link.... let me know. But first, it would be a good idea to understand that the official reports do not claim &quot;There is ACARS data tht supposedly shows both AA planes which hit the towers in NYC&quot;..</p>

<p>Quite honestly... I am still not sure if it was. But what I do know, is that the data we have received from govt agencies, does not add up to the govt story. And we have been attacked ever since for asking.</p>

<p>Yes... that is a fact.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. It is why we are here, to understand the Truth. So far, all we have been able to find are are a growing mountain of conflicts with the &#39;official story&#39;. When contacted, US Govt agencies refuse to comment. I don&#39;t know what the answer is... and not really sure we will ever know the full truth regarding 9/11. But if what we do gets more people to pay close attention to their govt and govt activities, regardless if they agree or disagree with our analysis... it will all be worth it... </p>

<p>Flight 77 - </p>

<pre><code>The NTSB Flight Path Animation approach path and altitude does not support official events.
All Altitude data shows the aircraft at least 300 feet too high to have struck the light poles.
The rate of descent data is in direct conflict with the aircraft being able to impact the light poles and be captured in the Dept of Defense &quot;5 Frames&quot; video of an object traveling nearly parallel with the Pentagon lawn.  
The record of data stops at least one second prior to official impact time.  
If data trends are continued, the aircraft altitude would have been at least 100 feet too high to have hit the Pentagon.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Flight 93&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The NTSB Flight Path Animation approach path and altitude does not support observations.
All Altitude data on the northern approach contradicts witnesses published by the New York Times.
Witness observations of approach path contradict northern approach as described by Popular Mechanics and the US Govt. Several witnesses observed the aircraft approaching from southeast over Indian Lake and from the south prior to witnessing explosion. Parts found in New Baltimore, 8 miles southeast of crater is a direct contradiction to the northern approach claimed by the US Govt.
Environmental Protection Agency reports no soil contamination of jet fuel after testing 5,000-6,000 yards of earth including 3 ground wells. Smoke plume photographed by a witness does not suggest a jet fuel rich explosion.  
Impact angle according to Flight Data Recorder does not support an almost vertical impact as the govt story and crater suggests.

<p>I think you need to read it again. Notice the quotation marks around the sentence - &quot;I Cum in my mouth&quot;. and the following linked source.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nzy7p/i_am_the_founder_of_pilots_for_911_truth_ask_me/cmindn4">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nzy7p/i_am_the_founder_of_pilots_for_911_truth_ask_me/cmindn4</a></p>

<p>What that means is that I didn&#39;t &quot;literally&quot; say anything with regard to &quot;cum&quot;. I quoted someone else. It also doesn&#39;t &quot;literally&quot; say anywhere, &quot;cum eater&quot;.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not interested in arguing about it anymore and I&#39;m sorry if you take offense to my thinking this AMA was not all it could have been.  I can only be honest and, after all, I&#39;m just some anonymous guy on the internet - no use getting too worked up.</p>

<p>Where are all of the other pilots for 9/11 Truth?  I was surprised that none of the others joined for the AMA.</p>

<p>Your opinion noted. Others disagree and found it quite funny. :-)</p>

<p>Again, when you get punched as much as I do, let me know if you don&#39;t get the urge to hit back every once in a while. Until you live a day in my shoes (or 8 years as the Founder of an organization which questions the govt), please don&#39;t judge me.</p>

<p>I have answered many legitimate questions on this AMA. Have said thank you to those who didn&#39;t have questions, but made supportive comments... Have ignored most of the attacks.. and responded to some. Again, feel free to create your own organization placing your face, name and professional reputation on the line.. .and we will see how you do.</p>

<p>But you are right, this is a pointless argument. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t at any point judged you personally (and if you felt that way I apologize), my opinions are solely based on the questions and answers given in this thread.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been in your shoes nor have I founded any such organizations so you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t know what it would be like.  Still doesn&#39;t change my feelings about this AMA though.  But again, nothing personal.</p>

<p>So yea I just want to hold a high standard here and verify, every possible way. You not being willing makes me suspect. Please post a video as you stated you would.</p>

<p>Look. I watched your films, a few times. I have wanted to do my own analysis on the FOIA data you have and used in your films to show the planes crossing paths, and maybe find out where the imposter planes came from. This part is so insightful I want to investigate it myself. I asked you in an earlier question (my first comment on this thread) where I could get it and you just said it is on the website. Thanks for answering but it is not useful. Others have voiced their complaints about the quality of replies. This is what makes me think its not you Rob. Im sorry buy post a video next time because it sucks to not know for sure and have to believe. You know?</p>

<p>lol... I have been conversing with SM for the better part of my time here on reddit.... he approves virtually all my posts at r/911truth... (and those which he hasn&#39;t gotten to.. .are approved by the other mods at r/911truth... when I was shadowbanned)... he has verified who I am a long time ago...he doesn&#39;t question who I am. </p>

<p>So, I guess all you have is u/moonpurr.</p>

<p>And as I told him (her?), i may answer questions via YT if they become overwhelming.. and he is ok with that.</p>

<p>So all is left is you. A person who has admitted you saw my shout out to you on FB (which shows my face).... yet wants me to jump through hoops to upload a YT video.</p>

<p>Are you attracted to me or something?</p>

<p>Do any of the mods here need a YT video of my face for confirmation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know. When I was in school i asked questions even though i knew the answer. Others around me either did not grasp the concepts and were too afraid or too embarassed to ask at the risk of being singled out, and maybe ridiculed. I hoped you would have posted a confirmation vid by now, so that anyone with a bad taste left in their mouth from the &quot;Gage Ama&quot; could satisfy their paranoia of infiltrators and shills and trolls. Call me what you want but I am asking simply for that which would affirm you are definitely you. SM is satisfied, good for him. But he mentioned he already knew you. I cannot just trust his judgement of you because he is also a faceless internet person. We are in the disinfo golden age, we need to be extra cautious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, Rob, and thanks for the AMA!</p>

<p>Are you aware of the connection between the Murrah Bombing and 9/11? Do you think Hussain Al-Hussaini was/is &quot;John Doe #2&quot; who was seen by multiple witnesses with Tim McVeigh numerous times, including renting the Ryder truck, parking the Ryder truck, and renting the hotel room which was later used by Zacarias Moussaiou and Muhammed Atta? </p>

<p>Do you think that Terry Nichols was meeting with Ramsi Yusef (&quot;mastermind&quot; of the first WTC bombing and uncle to Khalid Sheik Muhammed) when he was traveling to the Philippines? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello and thanks for doing this. I have watched the films that your group made and appreciate the insight learned. First I would like to ask, Is there a way to get the data presented in this film and recreate it myself? </p>

<p>Second, do you or other members of Pilotsfor911truth have any new films in the works? </p>

<p>If not, then may I note; there are many documentaries out there that are good and valid, but there is always room for improvement for presentation. If you want to reach out to those outside the truth movement then style is everything. You can only hold the doubtful watcher&#39;s attention for a few moments. Fast, clear, and watchable info snippets and critical questions in just a few minutes video.. like a movie trailor.. stylized to appeal to the non-conspiracy minded. But back it up with the dicumentary films when they decide to get deep. Cheers!</p>

<p>Edit: grammar </p>

<p>Which film? We have produced over 7 films all based on data provided by govt agencies. All data is available on our website.</p>

<p>No... not more than anyone else who steps outside. And I am glad you asked this question. Because... in my opinion, after reading both sides of the discussion regarding Phillip, I feel he did in fact take his life and that of his kids, based on all of the information available. And quite frankly... if he did do that... I hope he rots in hell.</p>

<p>I have no desire to commit suicide and have said it several times since I founded P4T in 2007. In fact... I have saved lives over the years (those of my students... Flight Instructors will appreciate this)....</p>

<p>So... if I ever end up &quot;suicided&quot;, you now have a record here on reddit as well. But again... I have never felt my life was in danger since I founded P4T.</p>

<p>Have I received death threats? sure... but I always respond to those anonymous idiots with my full address and welcome them to knock on my door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi cheneydidit,</p>

<p>The official record shows the banked turn as rather uneventful. But the hard part is the acceleration straight into the building due to the aerodynamic forces acting on the airplane at such excessive speeds beyond manufacturer limitations. Also, the FDR data from the NTSB shows the aircraft too high to hit the Pentagon. When contacted, the NTSB and FBI refused to comment.</p>

I have a friend who I forced to watch all the 9/11 is more than it seems and when faced with evidence say &quot;well these people say it cannot happen but an other group of people (here the government) says it could happen. 2 versions of the truth. Believing in the second instead of the first is a leap of faith&quot;</p>

<p>You... Poor... Baby. This is what happens when you leave your predefined circles and forums and venture out with controversial opinions (9/11 conspiracy stuff is the pinnacle of type of opinion in the US at least). What ever happened to just ignoring idiots? Isn&#39;t that what you do in real life? And what do you think happens when the real users here (not just the trolls/shills who come out en masse for high profile AMAs (<strong>which I would argue yours was not anyway</strong>). I&#39;ve been called a Truther, conspiratard, tinfoiler, IRL despite me holding my conclusions to facts, as well as two college degrees (one of them being a doctorate). Maybe just grow up or get outta here.</p>

<p>Ah yes, never miss a chance to plug your own stuff. That didn&#39;t get old at all. Next your going to tell me you really only want to talk about <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama">Rampart</a>.</p>

<p>This sub has its flaws, but is <em>ours</em>, not <em>yours</em>, although your opinion is noted. Maybe letting the mods know <strong>you are doing an AMA would help them in this regard</strong>. There was no hype for this dreadful post, and I found it in the new queue when it was minutes old and had no idea if it&#39;s legitimacy at the time (nor do I now, really).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An accurate statement, that I agree with. You really didn&#39;t present yourself professionally here, despite the trolls/shills (which you obviously had the option to ignore).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, the feeling is mutual. This whole sub is an embarrassment in its present state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least your post is. Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are multiple insightful posts and posters here, who are sometimes drowned out by crap. We deal with <em>any and all topics here</em>, and when you minimize censorship you have to learn how to sift through posts and comments to find legitimacy, much like wading through the disinfo and bullcrap related to the Official Version™ of 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone know who really controls this sub? I don&#39;t..</p>

<p>Why would you? You&#39;ve shown that you don&#39;t belong here. Go back to your website and stay there.</p>

<p>What do you mean by perishable? If we were on your web forum you could delete anything as a mod. Does that make your site/forum any less legitimate? And what everyone else feels about their &#39;perishable&#39; posts is their business, not my own. If they really did care, they&#39;d make their own sub/website.

<p>My &#39;citation&#39; is math.</p>

<p>The impact energy of a 767-200 (a standard 767 mind you, who knows what the mass was if modified), traveling at 510 knots (860 ft/sec), is nearly equivalent to the energy of 2000 sticks of Dynamite exploding.</p>

<p>KE=1/2mv<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>KE = 1/2(120,000kg)(262.4m/s)<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>where...
120,000 = Estimated Mass of 767-200 (it is actually higher, but for argument sake)
262.4 m/s = speed reported 510 knots (860f/s)</p>

<p>KE = 60,000(68853.76)</p>

<p>KE = 4,131,225,600J</p>

<p>Energy of 1 stick of Dynamite = 2.1 MJ</p>

<p>4,131,225,600/2,100,000 = 1967.25 Sticks of Dynamite.</p>

<p>This is what happens when 2000 sticks of dynamite explode....

    <div class="md"><p>oh boy.  are you trolling or what?  so the densities, masses and materials involved in the impact have no bearing on deformation?  the physics of impact is more complicated than just K.E.</p>

<p>&quot;In May 2006, I was watching Glenn Beck’s show on CNN. The Department of Defense had just released the infamous &quot;5 frames&quot; of stop-action video of the pentagon attack. Beck showed the frames and commented, &quot;You can see a 757 in 10 seconds flat!  Either that or a naked Michael Moore heading for the buffet!  This should put all those conspiracy theories to rest&quot;.  While watching it, I&#39;m thinking to myself, &quot;I can’t see any 757.”  And I&#39;m asking myself, “Are there still unresolved questions regarding 9/11?&quot;</p>

<p>So I started poking around on the Internet trying to find anything I can to back up the government’s story because I didn&#39;t want to believe our government might have had something to do with 9/11.</p>

<p>Early on, I came across Operation Northwoods.  It blew me away that elements of our government had seriously planned acts of terrorism inside the United States to justify invading Cuba. Consider that 9/11 Commission Chairman Thomas Kean had said, &quot;The greatest failure of 9/11 was lack of imagination&quot;, yet just under 40 years prior, elements of our own government imagined perpetrating such an event!</p>

<p>In late summer of 2006, I co-founded the group Pilots for 9/11 Truth, to more formally conduct research on the aviation-related aspects of 9/11.  In August 2006, Pilots for 9/11 Truth received from the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) a copy of the Flight Data Recorder data of Flight 77, which, according to the official account, hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>We analyzed the data and announced our conclusion on 3/26/07 that &quot;The information provided by the NTSB does not support the 9/11 Commission Report of American Airlines Flight 77 impact with the Pentagon.&quot;  Much more information about this can be found in our video documentary and our press release.</p>

<p>So now, a year after I began looking into the events of 9/11 and having devoted a lot of time and effort researching those events, I&#39;m frustrated because we haven&#39;t been able to find anything to confirm the government&#39;s story.  And what&#39;s worse is that the FBI and NTSB refuse to even discuss with us the many obvious problems we found in the Flight 77 Flight Data Recorder.</p>

<p>I continue to work with my colleagues at Pilots for 9/11 Truth, to grow the organization and to continue our research into the aviation-related aspects of 9/11, looking for confirmation of the government’s story&quot;</p>

<p>Hope this helps....</p>

<p>I have been banned and my posts deleted from &quot;Mick Wests site&quot;. Do a google search with those terms and you will find a full discussion on the topic, including the posts which Mick West has deleted in screenshot.</p>

<p>Bottom line, Mick West is not interested in the Truth.</p>

<p>No... not more than anyone else who steps outside. And I am glad you asked this question. Because... in my opinion, after reading both sides of the discussion regarding Phillip, I feel he did in fact take his life and that of his kids, based on all of the information available. And quite frankly... if he did do that... I hope he rots in hell.</p>

<p>I have no desire to commit suicide and have said it several times since I founded P4T in 2007. In fact... I have saved lives over the years (those of my students... Flight Instructors will appreciate this)....</p>

<p>So... if I ever end up &quot;suicided&quot;, you now have a record here on reddit as well. But again... I have never felt my life was in danger since I founded P4T.</p>

<p>Have I received death threats? sure... but I always respond to those anonymous idiots with my full address and welcome them to knock on my door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read through this entire AMA quite a few times like I have. You will notice me questioning why <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a> wasn&#39;t here last night but actively participating in the other thread about the upcoming AMA simultaneously. I find that odd as orangutan is a mod of 911truth and it seemed would have had a lot of good questions to ask in addition to assisting in this AMA. SoveriegnMan stated that he messaged orangutan to ask for assistance here and didn&#39;t receive a reply. This entire AMA is feeling to me like a social experiment of sorts. In more ways than one. I too am not quite sure what to make of it all. And you being a new mod were placed in a very questionable situation. Almost a damned if you do and damned if you don&#39;t scenario. You may be asked &quot;why didn&#39;t you _____&quot; (fill in the blank with your choice- remove comments, ask users or Rob to tone it down, give a warning, ban users, etc.) and if you did then you may be asked &quot; Why did you do that?&quot; I feel for you, it&#39;s a sticky situation. </p>
