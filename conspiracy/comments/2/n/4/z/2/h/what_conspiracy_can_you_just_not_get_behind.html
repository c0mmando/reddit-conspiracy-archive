       The photo "doctoring" I referred to was from an article I read that measured the parallax angles of lunar surface photos to distant hills in the background and concluded they were
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       closer than indicated (feet rather than miles), perhaps a rear projection screen.  This might be a case where a real picture was composited with a fake background to shield the view of something we mortals aren't allowed to see.

       They left a reflector on the moon that you can shoot either light or sound (can't remember which) at and detect it as it bounces back off the reflector.

       How old are you? How long have you been in the conspiracy world?  This was a common conspiracy back in the early days of the 9/11 conspiracy world.  It was used as a away to discredit the actual conspiracy theories floating around (IMO).

       I've been at this too long, and I've gone too deep.  People argue if it's this or that, black or white.  Near the bottom. its all grey.  The more I know, the more I realized how much I don't know, or even thought was possible. For me, now nearly anything is possible. Of course, some more than others.

       Black and white are simplistic labels for simple concepts. Unfortunately, too many people try to shoehorn complex issues into one of those simple labels.

       There's a Billy Joel song called "Shades Of Grey" that goes:
      </p>
      <pre><code>    Shades of grey wherever I go

    The more I find out the less that I know

    Black and white is how it should be

    But shades of grey are the colors I see

       With all the filmed interview accounts and actual audio of explosions on the ground floor and subbasement why isn't this possible? And then you have the whole perfect collapse that sure looks like a controlled demolition. And then the audio of "pull it" for building 7 and its fall... Even if you don't buy it, it seems like a theory you shouldn't dismiss.

Pretty sure that's to distract and obfuscate.

       Yeah, I always want to ask, "Ok, so why the planes then?"

       I mean, organizing and flying planes into things, faking passenger lists? flight plane? pilots? ground crew? towers? radar data? and everything that would have to be faked to send unmanned, or different planes into buildings would be much harder to do than, I dunno... drive a van with a bomb in it under each one and claim the explosives brought them down?

       No it didn't. The 1993 bombing was a failure. The actual plan was to blow up one building so it tilted on to the other one causing major structural damage. It failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the failure it was a case of back to the drawing board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind, the purpose of 9/11 was
       <em>
        theatre
       </em>
       not military. The point was to show to the world that Arab hijackers could overpower the USA with little more than box cutters. They weren't supposed to be explosive experts. The explosives were just there to make the theatre of it bigger and badder.

       I've never understood why people think one is mutually exclusive of another. Why not do both since bombing didn't work in 1993?  I think way too many people get hung up on the procedure rather than the result. Its much more interesting to me to consider who the hijackers were, who was supporting them, and why it might have been carried out.

       I think if the bomb theory were true, wouldn't it have been easier to say that the arabs snuck into the building and planted them? There could be a whole back story as to they infiltrated the building by being security guards, janitors, businessmen, etc. and then executed their plot.
