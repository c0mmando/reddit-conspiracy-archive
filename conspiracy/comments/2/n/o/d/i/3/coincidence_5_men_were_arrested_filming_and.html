<p>This part is super intriguing as well: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they&#39;re either fronting like a moving company or are an actual moving company. In either scenario it makes sense for them to have box cutters. To just throw that in there like it&#39;s a big deal is a bit ridiculous is all. I know those are the &quot;weapons&quot; that the hijackers were reported to use. But moving companies use box cutters. To say they&#39;re in league with terrorists because they had box cutters in a moving company van is a bit of a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess what he is saying is that a moving company having box cutters is not significant whatsoever and bringing attention to it distracts from your broader point. The box cutters supposedly used to hijack the planes were significant because they were concealable and used to gain control of the planes. Someone on the ground who isn&#39;t going through security checkpoints would have no need for a concealed utility blade, they would just use guns if they needed a weapon. </p>

<p>There is a lot to focus on in the info provided, the box cutters are a distraction IMO (you&#39;re free to point it out, it just detracts from the salient parts of the story). Let&#39;s talk about why Israeli agents apparently set up to film the attacks before they happened, or why the owner of the moving company was on a list of suspects along with Mohammed Atta.</p>

<p>The use of the term &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is not helpful. The term &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is simply a smear term used by the ADL/$PLC types whenever someone dares to criticize a Jew or Israel.</p>

<p>The sarcasm was appropriate. As you can see, merely pointing out that there is a taboo about criticizing &quot;God&#39;s Holy Jews&quot; gets the panties of people like you in a knot. I guess it went right over your head, but he was criticizing Christians, not Jews, for maintaining that taboo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So every man woman and child who is a Jew is part of this plan/conspiracy to plan 9/11? Thats like saying every man woman and child in Germany helped planned the Holocaust. There is nothing wrong with Jews, or Israelis, it is Zionists who are the problem. Zionism spawned out of the events of World War I and II, and it is Zionism and Zionisnts who stick their fingers in the business of the rest of the world for their own benefits, not Jews. The attitudes and and actions of those Jewish people who birthed Zionism is in no way synonymous with the entire Jewish people. Just like being German is not synonymous with being a Nazi. </p>

<p>There are wicked people everywhere, generalizing an entire group because some evil people work within it is not the way to go about exposing wicked men. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A generalization obviously does not imply universality.</p>

<p>Also the &quot;holocaust&quot; is a jewish big lie.</p>

<p>Also it is judaism that spawned zionism just as it spawned communism. Judaism is evil and has molded Jewry toward evil ways. A few jews resist but most go along with the plan. Which is what the masses always do. Jews just happen to be part of a racist cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh because antisemitism is an ad hominem attack designed to obfuscate the truth and im on a mission to expose the truth no matter what. Im not interested in being &quot;politically correct&quot; ie. Telling lies n half truths. Jews are not the only problem but they are an essential conponent to the conspiracy of the ages. That israel did 9/11 ought to wake people up.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>anti-semitism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of the term &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is not helpful. The term &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is simply a smear term used by the ADL/$PLC types whenever someone dares to criticize a Jew or Israel.</p>

<p>The sarcasm was appropriate. As you can see, merely pointing out that there is a taboo about criticizing &quot;God&#39;s Holy Jews&quot; gets the panties of people like you in a knot. I guess it went right over your head, but he was criticizing Christians, not Jews, for maintaining that taboo.</p>
