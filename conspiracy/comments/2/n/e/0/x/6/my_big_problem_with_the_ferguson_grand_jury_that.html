<p>But the question is, was this even how a Grand Jury works?</p>

<p>The legal guy on the news said &quot;a Grand Jury is able to indict a twinky normally&quot;.</p>

<p>The job of the Grand Jury is to look at the evidence and accusations and determine if their is enough probable cause to move forward with charges. </p>

<p>Their job IS NOT to determine who is and is not a credible witness, to separate fact from fiction, determine if self defense was acceptable, or to determine guilt or innocence. That is what a trial is for.  </p>

<p>The prosecutor&#39;s job is ONLY to present the evidence and accusations that show the accused committed a crime.</p>

<p>A real Grand Jury would have moved forward with = body with bullet holes..check...   gun man...check..  witnesses saying multiple things, some against the accused..check....  indicted, let the trial figure it out.</p>

<p>Instead they had a secret closed door TRIAL to prevent a real trial. Where the Grand Jury took on the part of a jury trial and the prosecutor took on the part of a defense attorney. All for a big official seeming show. This is why the prosecutor wouldn&#39;t step aside. He would not have been able to manipulate the Grand Jury into a secret trial otherwise.  A special prosecutor would have just presented the accusations to the Grand Jury, they would have indicted, and the trial would have had to figure it out from there.</p>

<p>A grand jury does what the prosecutor wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. If you had been on that jury, would you have let what you thought was a guilty man walk free just because the DA wanted it? </p>

<p>Our DA gave us a speech letting us know we were the deciders, we were the heart of the US judicial system and everyone I served with took that responsibility very seriously. </p>

<p>As an example, I asked the Asst DA if there was a list of illegal drugs in my state. He said he wasn&#39;t sure but he would get me one. By the next morning I was handed a full list the ADA had compiled solely because I (as a GJ) had asked for it.</p>

<p>They do not follow the DA. They hear the evidence, they ask questions, they discuss it among themselves without DA in the room and they make a decision, just like you would do.

    <div class="md"><p>Grand juries do not decide guilt or innocence.  They function as a rubber stamp for the district attorney&#39;s office, ostensibly to vet the trial-ability of cases the DA wants to prosecute.</p>

<p>The statistics tell the story.  In any given year, the number of indictments that grand juries reject in the entire nation can be counted on one hand.</p>

<p>Assuming you served on a grand jury, you probably have an explanation for why it&#39;s possible for the DA to get indictment against literally anything or anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did serve on a GJ and as stated, he gave a speech explaining that WE were the heart of the judicial system, we were the ones to decide if a case went to a trial or went free. He further explained that NO ONE outside other jurors should try to influence our decision.</p>

<p>At no time did I feel the DA was leaning us toward or pressuring us for convictions. If we sent most to trial it wa becasue we believed there was enough evidence to warrant it. We also gave &quot;no bill&quot; decisions too.</p>

<p>The one odd thing of note was we heard approx 100 cases. Three went sex abuse of minors. I watched a 14 year old boy testify he was forced to perform and have performed homo sexual acts. He cried and was under a lot of stress while testifying. In the other two case, two young girls had to testify similarly.
 i
The odd part was our local sex abuse detective testified also in each case. Everyone testified separately and each time the detective took the stand, he testified that he didn&#39;t think the accusations were true. In any of the three cases. We sent the accused to trial anyway.</p>

<p>That is odd. In my area they have given several months probation for 2 different child molestation cases. Pisses me off.

    <div class="md"><p>This is accurate and history proves it. OP has made an excellent post covering your point and more on why grand juries need to be abolished - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury">no other country in the world that uses common law still has grand juries</a>. Many used to but have since abolished them. This includes basically all westernized nations and any country with true representative government (correct me if I&#39;m wrong anyone, but my main point is grand juries have by and large been gotten rid of but we (the U.S.) still use them - Wiki has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States">another nice page</a> on them and their pitfalls).</p>

<p>Now the original intent of a grand jury may have been noble, to sift through the garbage and non-garbage cases, which is what they are supposed to do. This case absolutely qualified for trial compared to all the other much smaller cases that are passed along. I don&#39;t know if it was corruption or the grand jury just wanting to seize the trial for themselves due to it&#39;s notoriety, and/or both to protect the integrity of the police department. Ultimately these grand juries are an arm of the state, as is the prosecutor, as is Darren Wilson. That is why we have trials, so people can be judged by a jury of their peers in light of all the evidence presented, out in the open.</p>

<p>Grand jury proceedings, whether an indictment is handed down or not, are kept locked down and in secret. However, in an unprecedented move the proceedings and deliberations for this case were released to the public. This just lends further credence to the fact a trial was justified, that they felt this would appease most people. Which, unfortunately, it did.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s a big problem to tackle. We can start with mandating cops wear body cameras at all times, to protect both civilians and cops. Every city that has implemented their use has reported nothing but success with them. That could have avoided a whole lot of mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the police arrest someone for drugs, all they have to show the GJ is the drugs and the police&#39;s testimony who claimed he found it in the defendant&#39;s car. This is usually accompanied by a toxicology report stating the drugs were drugs and not tofu. </p>

<p>There is no need for a defense at this time. The GJ are preventing police/DA from railroading someone to a trial or having them in jail until a trial without at least some evidence. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost a two step system...1 ) prove you have enough evidence to hold him over for trial or let him go. If you do show enough, then go to a real trial and prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>I was able to ask some pointed questions at a woman who was involved in a road rage situation. While answering my questions, she became hostile and visibly mad. I interrupted her to ask if the apparent hostility she was showing me at this time was similar to the hostility she was accused of. She calmed the f*ck down instantly. We sent her to trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The prosecutor&#39;s job is to evaluate the evidence and decide if he or she thinks there is sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty at trial.  But this is a unique situation.  5 minutes after the shooting happened nonsense rumors had been spun into stories of a bloodthirsty execution, a couple days later citizens were rioting.  </p>

<p>So this prosecutor evaluates the evidence, decides the shooting was in self defense.  He now has 2 basic choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do the ordinary thing and simply not press charges.</p></li>
<li><p>Present a pretty dishonest case to the grand jury, secure and indictment, then see the officer acquitted at trial. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Option 1 is not viable because of the public shitstorm over the shooting.  Option 2 is embarrassing and hella unethical.  </p>

<p>So he came up with option 3.  Let the grand jury hear all the evidence, then when they decide the shooting was in self defense, they&#39;ll vote against an indictment.  He doesn&#39;t have to embarrass himself by taking a case to trial that he knows he&#39;s going to lose.  And he draws less public ire by being able to blame the grand jury.   </p>

<p>See there is your logical problem. The prosecutor is not a judge or jury. His job is not to decide guilt or innocence. His job is not to manipulate the Grand Jury towards his own bias opinion of the case, which this prosecutor took unusual steps to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta thank those baby boomers for setting a trend.  Here&#39;s the ultimate example of complicity (below).   I did the same test on my father with a bottle of non alcoholic whine and my pregnant sister.  She was drinking in view of my father, and we just told him the doc said it was ok.  He fully complied, dismissing his knowledge and reasoning that drinking can harm a child in the womb.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A real Grand Jury would have moved forward with = body with bullet holes..check... gunman...check..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re grossly over simplifying the components, those being the people involved and their actions. It&#39;s not merely a body with bullet holes or a gunman. What they were looking at was someone that attacked a cop, which nobody denies that he did, and the cop that was attacked defending himself. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to die don&#39;t commit strong armed robbery and don&#39;t attack a fucking cop. It&#39;s pretty cut and dry. Shit, man, if you don&#39;t want to die you better not attack me. Because if I&#39;m sitting in my car and you punch me and try to steal my gun I&#39;m going to shoot your POS ass. I probably won&#39;t chase you as you run away after having been shot, but I&#39;m not a cop whose job it is to arrest someone that just committed felony assault. And if I do get out of my car and you turn back around and start charging at me I&#39;m going to unload on your ass until you stop charging me. </p>

<p>I keep hearing people say &quot;BUT HE WAS THIRTY FEET AWAY!&quot; as if that is far enough to deem him no longer a threat. My response is, he was <em>only ten yards away</em>. That doesn&#39;t seem so far away now, does it? Especially considering that Wilson had no idea whether or not Brown had any weapons. <strong><a href="http://youtu.be/J_KJ1R2PCMM">Someone with a knife 21&#39; away can bumrush you and stab you in the heart faster than you can un-holster your firearm and shoot them.</a></strong>Knowing that undeniable fact, you&#39;re less likely to take any chances in just hoping he&#39;s rushing you to apologize for having just assaulted you and for trying to steal your gun.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve testified before a grand jury against a guy that broke into my house when I was home. I got grilled by the prosecutor and I was the victim. I was there because the fucker broke into another house a couple months later while a woman was home with her baby. Fortunately her husband got home from the store mid robbery and held him there until the cops showed up. Are grand jury&#39;s bullshit? Maybe. But they&#39;re not the way you have made them out to be. Prosecutors want to know they stand a chance in prosecuting successfully before they waste the time and energy going to trial. Grand juries are a way of eliminating potential trials that should never exist in the first place, and going to trial when there is enough evidence to warrant a trial. </p>

<p>In Wilson&#39;s case, there simply wasn&#39;t enough credible evidence, physical or testimonial, to even attempt to prove that Wilson <em>murdered</em> Brown. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The job of the Grand Jury is to look at the evidence and accusations and determine if their is enough probable cause to move forward with charges.&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what they did. There were a ton of eyewitnesses that perjured themselves by giving false testimony in the face of the physical evidence as well. How do you bring about charges when the physical evidence supports the officer&#39;s story and the eyewitnesses who did not support his story changed their version of events when faced with the physical evidence? </p>

<p>In looking at everything they released it seems that there was a mountain of evidence supporting the officer and not much at all corroborating the outlandish things we&#39;ve all heard in the news. That&#39;s the difference between this and what you call a &quot;secret closed door trial&quot;. They released the evidence.</p>

<p>This was a tragedy and I agree that police brutality has to stop but I really don&#39;t think that was the case here. If anything, this is a perfect example of why every officer should wear a camera. If we had video of the encounter and the officer was in the wrong, then this would have gone to trial and not to a grand jury. If Brown was in the wrong and people could easily see it, then there is no rioting. At least not at the level that we&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>edit: <a href="http://apps.stlpublicradio.org/ferguson-project/evidence.html">Here is a link to the evidence.</a> What everyone here should looking at is the federal probe going on right now. There is no way the Obama administration is going to let such a useful distraction go to waste so quickly. I can definitely see federal charges stemming from the probe to keep eyes on Ferguson and away from Washington.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked at the evidence? The physical evidence is really damning. They also have witnesses that support the story that the physical evidence tells. Also, keep in mind that this grand jury wasn&#39;t selected just for this trial. This grand jury was selected way before this incident even happened.</p>

<p>&quot;They released some of the evidence&quot; - Seriously? They released transcripts of witness testimony that refuted the now accepted narrative too. It just doesn&#39;t match up with any of the physical evidence and many of those witnesses admitted they lied. There were three different coroners that inspected the body including one that the Brown family hired. They agreed in all major aspects. </p>

<p>Everyone here is looking for a major conspiracy in Ferguson when there isn&#39;t one. We should be talking about how the government controlled media is creating this huge spectacle to keep us from looking at the real issues in Washington.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on board with how the police state needs to be reigned in, but this is a terrible, terrible example to use. Maybe even Missouri&#39;s system is flawed in how grand juries are convened and how secretive they are. Fine. We got a great look at the facts in this case though, and while we should always question everything the government does you should use your head and see the big picture. There is probably no conspiracy in Ferguson. What the federal government is trying to distract us from is what we now should be spending time figuring out.</p>

<p>The real truth is that the black community as a whole sees race first and foremost. They are the real racists.</p>

<p>I despise cops, yet this event has put me in the position of defending them. The fact is mike brown got exactly what he deserved for attacking someone with a gun, cop or no cop.</p>
