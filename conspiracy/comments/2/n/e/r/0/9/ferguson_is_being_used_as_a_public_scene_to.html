       They don't want the first time we see a US city covered in tear gas, flash bangs, and military-grade weaponry to be a serious incident(riots over war, lack of food, power, political uprising) when they cannot risk the additional anger(here they can, as it is a relatively simple situation).
      </p>
      <p>
       They also are making it precedent to make court cases that have high public attention to have secret jurors. This is so that if any case is brought to court that may cause public outcry,  any subpoenas, testimony, evidence, will remain secret(same reason they tried the 9/11 planner in secret military tribunal, not in NYC).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying anybody planned Ferguson.  I am saying they are using this as practice, and one can learn what they will really do if shit hits the fan(the "police" in Ferguson have automatic weaponry for a reason).  Also, this "secret jury" i expect to become more commonplace(especially if there are trials of "terrorists" who may implicate the CIA or Saudi Arabia, or if it is a government official/corrupt businessman who could potentially leak damaging info for a shorter sentence.)  It's a shitty precedent to set.  It's been set.  And accepted.  And most people don't  even realize it I feel.

       Yeah,  but they also do this kind of acclimatization stuff all the time starting in elementary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans have been acclimitized intentionally through religions,  monarchies,  etc.  for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing they don't want us to learn is how to ask intelligent questions.   So when we do start getting mad,  without fully understanding why,  we often act badly.   They use that against us too.   "Mentally disturbed",  "maladjusted".   So we have to get smarter,  and take care of ourselves.   Get more and more rational,  and stay calm.   And don't fall for the crazy tin foil hat stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not easy to be in the minority and state even the obvious.   There is a huge mental investment on the part of people who tout the party line.   Planting that first seed of doubt is very tricky.   It only works if you can stay polite.    And you can't give them ammo to doubt that you are rational.

       The most obvious of which being the

       which people seem to not even realize is brain washing. You are

       They did the same after the "Boston Bombings" - armoured vehicles and stormtroopers in the streets. And when they indicted Dzokhar Tsarnaev, no cameras were allowed in or outside the court. To my knowledge there isn't a single image in existence of Tsarnaev (or any other reliable evidence he is even alive) since he was taken into custody.

       The sketches don't look much like him. I guess we are expected to attribute that to the artist being shitty at doing faces.

       The funny thing is that for what they paid the artist they could have bought three or four digital cameras.

       militarized police has been used fora long time now for crowd control.  The first really big event I can remember of the top of my head was the Pittsburgh G20 submit in 2009 also the RNC in 2006  and we seen some of it during the Seattle riots in 1999 as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some videos of the G20:

       I don't recall it being like this.  Ferguson is the only thing on 10 stations at any given time.  Occupy Wall street, Gay protests, G20 protests get/got sparing coverage compared to Ferguson/OJ/Rodney.  Certain narratives are beneficial,and are pushed, while others are detrimental, and covered only enough as needed(IN USA at least).
