    <div class="md"><p>Shaming? Anyone ever notice the mass influx of people clamoring on the internet in recent years, only to slowly drift back into TV zombie land?</p>

<p>I hear people riot in the stores to get a game console these days.</p>

<p>Karma is Zero. Reddit is Conde Nastes opinion/sentiment polling/advertising and public relations machine.</p>

<p>Anyways, yeah, something happened in St.Louis?</p>

<p>Maybe reddit should disclose what it&#39;s daily donation goal is daily, and provide some sort of relief fund, bump the daily goal up by a couple percentages for a few lousy days.</p>

<p>I guess they pay everyone before the end of the day or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the Ferguson verdict...  I read mainstream and non mainstream articles and I think the cop was in the right. People rioting right now should be pepper sprayed and shot with rubber bullets until they go home. The protestors what ever leave them alone everyone has a right to an opinion even if its wrong but no one has the right to rob steal and destroy other peoples property</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, racist.. There is AT NO TIME reasonable to use deadly force when the person you are trying to arrest is unarmed.. He easily could of tazered the guy and had in on the ground.. Even if none of this worked.. You shoot the guy in the leg or the arm.. There is no reason to unload a clip into someone who is unarmed..</p>

<p>You must be a cop lol.. Shoot first ask questions later.. The more the idoit cops and government keep executing unarm people. The closer and closer we get to people having enough with the people we pay to &quot;protect and server us&quot;. They will be denouced.. As they deserve.. </p>

<p>Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.

    <div class="md"><p>What about my comment was racist? the homie G comment? breaking news white people can be homie G&#39;s too. Your instant &quot;racism&quot; reply just leads me to believe you must be a middle class spoiled white kid who has been sheltered from the real world. 
Should Mr brown be dead, probably not, but he also should have done what he was told by the officer (as long as it was within reason) and none of this would have happened. BUT he didn&#39;t he fought with a cop. </p>

<p>By the way no I am not a cop, and I don&#39;t even like cops, but I do feel everyone has a right to defend them selves with the tools they have access to.</p>
