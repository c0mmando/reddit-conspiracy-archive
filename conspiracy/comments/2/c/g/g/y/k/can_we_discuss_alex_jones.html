       Alex Jones made a lot of false accusations about Bill Cooper too later on. If you listen to Mr. Cooper's appearances on Alex's show you realize Alex was lying. It seems to me Alex's animosity towards him started later on after he started exposing him. One such interview can be found here

       Simple enough message...that's given him a net worth of 5-8 million. Can't knock him though. Know your audience, and by god fucking tap into it. Have you seen his infowars store? I swear if there's people buying that merch then Alex has earned every penny.

       He advertises those supplements so much it gets annoying and I just turn the radio off. I'm not big into supplements but I sure as hell wouldn't buy medicine with a talk show as the brand name of the medicine.

       I have bought documentaries from Infowars Store though. They're generally all the same stuff and are usually about 2 1/2 hours, very few are unique.

       Nobody in the media can be trusted, if one person or company is even partially lying they can all be lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a common complaint by liberals about conservative talk radio is that gloom-and-doom predictions might be tied in to their precious metals sponsors. Given that Alex Jones' syndicator is a division of Midas Resources I'd keep that in mind, since many of his predictions are off a year or two or don't happen at all.

       He's a soapbox preacher. Half the shit he says has some merit and half of it is pure fear mongering. That's always the way it is with a soapbox preacher... lead with the truth then sell them crazy ideas on the back end.

       Jones is NOT doing journalism. It only looks that way because the MSM isn't doing journalism either!
      </p>
      <p>
       I treat Jones the same way I'd treat RT... a viewpoint that is the opposite end of the spectrum from the government/media.

       The truth however is usually somewhere in the middle.

       The truth isn't always on the middle. That's called the middle of the road fallacy. That's very bad reasoning.  It's not 1, it a not 10 it must be 5!

       it can be a fallacy, but in Jones case it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the stuff jones says he has NO facts at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funniest and most ironic thing about Jones is how he trashes the MSM endlessly and then uses ALL their articles as proof of what he's saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's beyond hilarious when he says "So and so is corrupt, look CNN, FOX, look at these articles." then in the next breath he's saying "CNN and Fox are dinosaurs and puppets for the government."
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a soap box preacher and his "job" is to get people riled up... sometimes he does that using facts other times he does that spewing nonsense.

       I was fully in the "he's a shill" camp until I heard Rogan talk about him. If Rogan vouches for him, that's good enough for me. And by that I mean that I don't believe that he is actively a disinformation agent, but I still think he's a biased and paranoid fear-monger whose participation in this arena does so much damage that it overwhelms whatever good his spreading valid information does.

       I'm still not 100% on Rogan. I want to be, but there are a lot of important details he's either wrong/ignorant about or is deliberately misleading people who trust him -- the pedophile ring and Aaron Swartz's death, downplaying the NWO, western media, and the US govt, etc. And his podcast is so popular, you gotta know he's at least been approached. To be clear, I'm 99% sure he's legit, but there's that last 1%...
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones, well, I really don't know. I'm maybe 70% sure he's legit, just  has an offputting approach and an ego problem, but that's so common I wouldn't accuse him of corruption based on that. You also have to consider the massive pressure the guy is under, assuming he is legit.

       He thinks 9/11 conspiracy theories are stupid, his show "Joe Rogan Questions everything" is basically there to tow the establishment line, he is a TELEVISION personality, as in he was on Fear Factor, and does UFC announcing.  He wouldn't be on TV unless he was an "approved" commentator, don't forget that.

       For years I thought he was too sensationalist, and he still is, but since Mainstream Media America gets crazier and crazier every day, Alex Jones has become increasingly sane when compared to the insanity of Mainstream Media America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have great respect for Alex's investigative style of journalism, which has long since been abandoned by the Mainstream Media for the top-down "memo" style invented by Fox News. For example, one of his reporters recently attempted to get footage of the ongoing border trafficking scandal and was instead told to go to "the Fox News section"

       some of his early stuff was pretty good and he was even funny sometimes but he seems to have gone downhill in the past 4 years or so. Too much focus on local instead of global and the annoying long adverts for crap. Any testimonials?

       Was Jones fearmongering when he detailed the full spectrum militarized police state years before 9/11?  Everyone laughed at him and called him a crazy conspiracy nut.  Look around you.  What do you see? An all-encompassing militarized police state with warrantless spying powers and the ability to arrest and indefinite detain anyone.  If Jones is a shill, I still respect him for his work warning people about this...

       True. He fearmongers everyday.  Storm watchers tend to do that. I'll tell you this much, Infowars and others like Activist Post are right much more than the MSM, not perfect, but leaps and bounds better than other news.

       This is Very true his investigative journalism is what got us the inside footy of bohemian grove no reporter or journalist ever do things like this anymore. They go to school get told what to do, get out of school become an intern get told what to do, then become journalist or reporter and get told what to do, because it was already years of being told what to do at that point so why stop? This why Michael Hastings stood out as well. One reporter made an article and made a man stand down from a position as General is pretty impressive journalism. We need more independent news like Alex Jones I think people mistake his wealth for what he really wants to prove this guy has been around for a pretty long time and I think his ad's are to keep the show up and running because they are his sponsors. But I think Alex Jones is down, even though he goes a little bat shit crazy sometimes hahaha
