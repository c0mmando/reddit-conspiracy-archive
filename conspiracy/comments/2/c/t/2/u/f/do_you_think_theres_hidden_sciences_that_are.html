</blockquote>

<p>I feel it, too. But I&#39;m not <em>more</em> angry at the MS sciences, but the actually scientists who don&#39;t setup up enough. Below I have compiled some things that piss me off:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The weathering on the spyhinx has been conclusively stated that it could have only had been weathered in such a way by falling precipitation, as rain. Not just hunkered wind and sand-blasting. There were several scientists, experts I&#39;m geology and climatology, who all came to this conclusion after studying the weathering on the sphynx.  The only time in recent history where enough precipitable water occurred to produce such weathering was just at the end of the last ice age, around 11,800 BCE. That&#39;s some six to eight thousand years prior to the &quot;established&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot; date of construction according to egyptologists, who refuse to even acknowledge the expertise and findings of the other scientists because they do not wish to admit that the ancient Egyptians, also, their ancestors, weren&#39;t the ones who built Tue sphyinx, and by extension, the pyramids.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, most megalithic sites contain many pieces of evidence that makes the claim thst, as is currently accepted theory, primitive man built them using ropes and soft metals, before the wheel and before writing was invented. Okay, so maybe aliens <em>didn&#39;t</em> make them, and humans actually did. But, change the Damn official narrative because the current ones are complete shit.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there are things such as cold fusion that no one ever hears about. Mainstream POSs will have you believe it&#39;s jus t not possible, or not yet possible. </p></li>
<li><p>Then, literally everything Tesla did in his lifetime was confiscated and made confidential by the fbi and the American army shortly after his death. One of the patenets seized was literally a death Ray. A few decades later, the active denial system was announced to the public, almost exactly as tesla had designed. So, think about his earthquake machine that nearly destroyed his warehouse. Oh, and his</p></li>
<li><p>Free <strong><em>wireless electricity</em></strong>. That&#39;s right. Free. Wireless. Electricity. Proven as fact. Presented in real life to work. Unfortunately, Edison was a much more wealthy and powerful man. So now we have to pay for something that should be absolutely free for everyone on this forsaken planet.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, of course, there are aliens, and anything that can be seen as evidence for aliens , that the experts won&#39;t explain with common sense what it is. With no other legit answers, I can only feel that the most plausible is the ones that&#39;s true. Like,</p></li>
<li><p>There was some genetic studies that found (through studying the mDNA, or mitochondria DNA which is only passed down to the offspring by the mother) that every single living human today has the same exact female ancestor that lived roughly 200,000 years ago. And,</p></li>
<li><p>similar studies (that studied the Y chromosomes, only passed down by the father) found that every single living human today has the very same male ancestor--- <em>who lived roughly 200,000 years ago!</em></p></li>
<li><p>Then there are other studies that have found that the human genome has some 240-ish (recalling from memory, so sorry for not being precise) genes that exist <em>no where else in the animal kingdom</em>, <strong><em>ever.</em></strong> They just randomly appeared, literally all at the same time, with no precursors and no explanation. (PersonLly, I&#39;m thinking extraterrestrial intervention, but that&#39;s just me).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, of course, DMT and other psychedelics. If you&#39;ve read eeither &quot;supernatural &quot; by Graham Hancock, or that book called &quot;dmt: the spirit molecule&quot;, you will know what I&#39;m talking about.</p></li>
<li><p>Law of attraction, featured in Rhonda Byrne s book called the secret. There&#39;s some good stuff in there, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there is Bigfoot. Ichnologists (footprint experts) have the technology today and the expertise to figure out whether footprints are real or faked. And they have found plenty of footprints that they cannot conclude are hoaxes. As it turns out, it is extremely hard to fool an ichnologist by faking footprints, dermal ridges, print depth, and a bunch of other parts of the prints are incredibly hard to fake all at the same time. But this is always scoffed at and downplayed so much that everyone thinks they are fakes. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry, but I will cut my list off here, as I can go on and on about this. I firmly believe there is a <strong><em>shit ton</em></strong> of things mainstream science will not admit, do not want to admit, or are simply not allowed to admit. The paradigms of today&#39;s scientists echo those who used to be proponents of the flat earth theory. Sadly, the pioneers of science nd their critical thinking skills, that special out-of-the-box-thinking that allowed them to figure out the earth is not flat and that the sun does not revolve around the earth, that&#39;s gone. Or suppressed enough to be effectively non-existent.</p>

<p>You can thank the absurd indoctrination that is more commonly called higher education for this. They don&#39;t teach you to think for yourselves and question everything anymore. No. Instead, they teach you to parrot the officials unquestioningly ningly, and in turn, continue on this ancient practice of scientific manipulation.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;ll add one more thing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Think about all of the book burnings that have taken place. The sacking of the library in Alexandria, the ancient relics and texts stolen from Mali and iraq recently during &quot;uprisings&quot; or &quot;mobs&quot;, the destruction of the south American natives caused by the conquistadors... Etc. That&#39;s literally millions of ancient texts full of knowledge that was destroyed. I can help but to wonder if anything was copied or saved before such destruction, and then passed down through the generations using the occult fraternities and groups like the freemasons as a cover. </li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, she is called mitochondrial Eve, but she isn&#39;t the only one. In his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, by Richard Dawkins, he argues that there have been more cases of biological Eve&#39;s and biological Adams. I believe he states that there in fact has to be.</p>

<p>That means that there isn&#39;t just one case where we are all related to one woman, there are several (Spanning thousands and millions of years). It&#39;s the same for men. This isn&#39;t hidden or suppressed.</p>

<p>Hard to prove something when the technology and science behind the idea is hidden.</p>

<p>I doubt he was talking about generating free wireless energy (Nothing is free in this universe), but rather being able to transmit energy wireless.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love a citation with some actual science behind it. I don&#39;t necessarily doubt it, but it could be the same for almost any other living species (That each individual species contain a subset of genes that does not occur in other species).</p>

<p>Forgive the sourced website, as it was not my first source where I got the information. I now think I may have read it in a book, and when I find out I&#39;ll let you know. </p>

<p>Here is the page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_adn08.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_adn08.htm</a></p>

<p>You gotta scroll down a bit if you don&#39;t wanna read the whole thing. About half way down you&#39;ll get to this:</p>

<p>The Head-scratching Discovery 
It was here, in tracing the vertical evolutionary record contained in the human and the other analyzed genomes, that the scientists ran into an enigma.</p>

<p>The head-scratching discovery by the public consortium, as Science termed it, was that the human genome contains 223 genes that do not have the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. </p>

<p>How did Humankind acquire such a bunch of enigmatic genes? 
In the evolutionary progression from bacteria to invertebrates (such as the lineages of yeast, worms, flies or mustard weed which have been deciphered) to vertebrates (mice, chimpanzees) and finally modern humans, these 223 genes are completely missing in the invertebrate phase. Therefore, the scientists can explain their presence in the human genome by a rather recent (in evolutionary time scales) probable horizontal transfer from bacteria. </p>

<p>In other words: At a relatively recent time as Evolution goes, modern humans acquired an extra 223 genes not through gradual evolution, not vertically on the Tree of Life, but horizontally, as a sideways insertion of genetic material from bacterial </p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> Here is another site, from Zechariah sitchen, actually. I&#39;m not sure how much credit you will give him, but I tend to give him quite a bit. The info in this link is basically the same as the other link:</p>

<p>Except for the cost of his special towers, it literally was free. The towers tapped into the earths ionosphere, and transmitted that electricity wirelessly. Like you said, nothing is <em>Really</em> Free, but , besides the cost of the towers and the maintenance for each tower, there wasn&#39;t much else. Though, as I understand it, those towers were friggin expensive...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try and find it again. But to be honest it was awhile ago, but once (if!) I find it I&#39;ll post it back here. And, as for your last point, that could be interesting. But, let&#39;s say that every animal has the same amount of completely novel genes, how does evolution explain it?</p>

<p>I feel the theory of evolution breaks down in this hypothetical situation, because 240 something genes mutating at the same time all at once? The theory of evolution explain s that mutations happen a lot, but a lot, if not most, of them are harmful or detrimental to the species. But few mutations are actually beneficial to the species, and thus allows them to pass that mutation along. But 240 genes? If every animal had 240 unique-to-their-species genes, that would be astronomically difficult to explain with evolution. Well, natural evolution, anyhow.</p>

<p>Also, I remember one of those genes was the one, sole gene responsible for language in humans. It exists no where else in the animal kingdom. Had no predecessor, nothing. Man I need to find that article...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the Byrne tip, magnetism is a biggie. Someone posted about Edward Leedskalnin here, and I noticed something about what he was using - Y-shaped sticks wrapped with metal on the Y-ends. Mentioned its relation to the old-fashioned way of finding wells, with Y-shaped sticks, and the thread got tumbled with really, really angry people. What&#39;s interesting about that, too, is if you go to the Coral Castle, they&#39;ll tell you that a lot of the tools Leedskalnin used were confiscated shortly after his death by his &quot;brothers.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a secret cabal of scientists pursuing UFO&#39;s... but I&#39;m positive there are astrophysicists pursuing discovery of life on other worlds. They talk about it <em>all the time</em> and even have allocated significant hardware, mindshare, and budget to it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there are any (legitimate) scientists pursuing research into near death experiences, because that would require nearly killing people, which could result in actually killing people, which legitimate scientists hopefully wouldn&#39;t do. I could see some illegitimate scientists trying that. I could also see some scientists studying what people have written about their own near-death experiences, but the only science in that is behavioral.</p>

<p>It could also do the exact opposite and increase that gap, could it not? I feel it could go both ways depending on the morals and ethics of the individuals involved. Sadly, this means I feel an increase in the gap to be the more likely scenario.</p>

<p>If one breakthrough begets another then it would make sense for the gap to increase. On the other hand if cost is the main thing prohibiting this technology from entering the consumer market maybe the gap would remain relatively the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of any <em>science</em> being repressed by <em>other scientists</em>. Maybe we&#39;re not seeing some science that is being repressed by <em>political, military, and/or industrial</em> interests, for example there&#39;s a strong case for suppressing dissemination of weapons tech that could have national security implications if it fell into the wrong hands (like anti-personnel lasers or microwaves, SCRAM engine designs, chemical formulations for radar absorbing paint, or difficult to detect digital snooping devices, etc) or could lose some people with vested interests lots of money by obsoleting or damaging the reputation of a product they have for sale (like a big pharma company delaying a more promising drug til an earlier drug they&#39;ve developed for the same disease loses patent protection, or oil companies hiding studies that show the extent of damage from an oil spill is worse than anticipated, etc) but generally speaking, science as a model is pretty transparent and scientists are incentivized to share findings - whether good, bad, or indifferent.</p>

<p>Edit: there&#39;s a moral component that might be suppressed, for example human cloning or ape hybridization, or ways of breaking people mentally or physically by introducing drugs or a behavioral regimen without the subject&#39;s consent, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic to suggest those kinds of projects would be funded in America at least...too much liability if anything went wrong. And if they are, they&#39;d probably be censored, likely even by the scientists themselves doing the work to avoid damaging their reputations by conducting research that violates the ethics of the profession.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I also think there&#39;s a fairly strong case that <em>scientists</em> do a reasonably good job of suppressing <em>bad science</em> through peer review and duplication of experiments as part of the scientific method. Scientists who get caught doctoring data or pushing intentionally misleading interpretations of data can&#39;t ever really repair their reputations. For those that get caught, the only career paths are usually retiring from academia and doing something else or finding a biased think-tank to shill for as a lobbyist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, and on much more mundane things. Silica for cholesterol reduction is a recent one I&#39;ve run into. Lots of anecdotal evidence of 40-50 point drops in cholesterol on adding food grade diatomaceous earth to the diet, a single, small study showing silica (the major component of food grade DE) reduced cholesterol in patients. Zero follow-up, no further study. Take your statins, enjoy your diabetes and memory loss.<sup>1</sup> Pay no attention to the dirt behind the curtain.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t even get public funds/interest in studying something as mundane as silica (and actually, interestingly enough, there are some interesting things happening here - using silica as a transport method for anti-cancer drugs was one I just dug up), who&#39;s going to pay for consciousness studies? Nature of consciousness? Pharmaceutical companies and their subsidized researchers are too busy trying to coverup that their consciousness-affecting psych medications are facilitating suicide and murder. Plus, too much money and mainstream popularity for studies that get distilled down to PR bon mots like &quot;squeezing boobies slows down breast cancer!&quot; and &quot;sniffing farts cures cancer!&quot;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Edit: Forgot the memory loss/early Alzheimers side effect from statins. Biggest scam ever, and a bunch of people of my generation with very little heart attack risk (but high familial risk of diabetes, go figure) have somehow been convinced that they should be on them as a matter of course.</p>

&quot;On everything that is true, but not yet understood.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Suppression and denial</strong><br/>
The reason why most people deny alternative models of reality, is because they are trained to do so. Other people suppress other ideas because of career, status and money.  </p>

<p>For some reason the cognitive dissonance is very strong in science. Skeptics can&#39;t even imagine that they might be wrong, and think that they have the &quot;right&quot; to be unfair, manipulative and even fraudulent themselves.<br/>
Real scientists and doctors however are so much trained in their field of knowledge that they can hardly understand alternatives. Sadly they often are trained to deny alternatives as well. Some skeptic organizations are actively training people to deny and attack alternative views, in the name of &quot;science&quot;. But it is actually in the name of scientism, or materialism.  </p>

<p><strong>Materialism and upperclass</strong><br/>
Active skeptics are not only believing in pure materialism, but also in the idea that people are in essence stupid and need to be guided. They believe in an upperclass of people who are smarter than the common people, and that they have to prevent the common people from going into chaos (bad thinking).  </p>

<p>Science has actually implemented an upperclass system,
where professors and such have an higher status than new people (students).  </p>

<p>The biggest problems with that upperclass thinking are:<br/>
1) smart people make mistakes too.<br/>
2) people in the field or with experience often know better what is going on.<br/>
3) real smart people do not care about status, or don&#39;t find it helpful to invest a lot of time in something that is basically wrong.<br/>
4) the professors and such are often busy with education, career and other stuff, and do not have the time or interest in dealing with alternative views.<br/>
5) errors in the current models are not really researched, but rather theoretically explained. The educational system even promotes that, because that is the way you can graduate.<br/>
6) real scientists that are working for big companies are looking at how to get the most money from an idea, and are not interested in finding something that might contradict that idea.<br/>
7) They control and restrict the information on media and wikipedia.<br/>
8) No upperclass ever allows alternatives or major corrections.  </p>

<p><strong>The &quot;biggest&quot; failure</strong>  </p>

<p>One of the mainstream big &quot;hoaxes&quot; is the big bang.  </p>

<p>The <strong>red-shift</strong> is most likely only a side-effect of sparse plasma in space. That means that most of the inflation is invalid. So no dark energy or dark matter.     </p>

<p>The &quot;gravity-bending&quot; related to <strong>general relativity</strong> has only been observed in plasma. That means there is not really a gravity bending, but normal refraction. That means that general relativity is wrong. And that means that there are probably no black holes.  </p>

<p>Etcetera.  </p>

<p>I can not even watch a normal space-documentary anymore, without laughing about the &quot;new&quot; theories they have got. It is like people talking about flat earth.  Both need &quot;bending of space and time&quot; to make it work.    </p>

<p>The &quot;Poind Rebka&quot; experiment does not show the difference in the waves, but the difference in the timing and energy of the atomic structure. The light still goes straight and with same frequency as at the source. Einstein made a small error here in the assumptions. See GPS video, in it is explained that the energy is still conserved, but in a slightly different way.<br/>
Sometimes Science makes errors, but some are very BIG..</p>

<p>There are many issues with this site as identified by Dr Wright. I&#39;ll adress just one showing Lerner&#39;s model is wrong. He claims that the CMB is brighter over clusters because of additional emission. He says if the CMB were cosmic it would be absorbed by clusters and be dimmer, he ignores the SZ effect predicted by big bang cosmology. Which says photons will be boosted to higher energy and the CMB appears hotter. Additionally the boosting decreases the number of low energy photons so the CMB gets dimmer at low frequencies. His local model cannot explain why the SZ effect is observed.</p>

<p>TL;DR because we observe clusters having an intermediate effect on the CMB it cannot be local as he claims.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t explain geometric tests. Also makes false use of classical formulea to describe quantum phenomena, it doesn&#39;t hold. It manages to derive some of the formula of standard cosmology, exactly the same (fitting), but cannot explain other effects at all. It has yet to make a novel confirmed prediction, the BB made many.  By no means it is more likely.</p>

<p>The &quot;Poind Rebka&quot; experiment does not show the difference in the waves, but the difference in the timing and energy of the atomic structure... Einstein made a small error here in the assumptions.</p>

<p>It was predicted by GR and confirmed. It is gravitational time dilation. Einstein made no mistake. How else do you explain these results and the dozens of other times it was observed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this suppressed by mainstream science when NASA is playing with it? Also, didn&#39;t read your particular linked article, not sure if it clarifies, but the testing that was done is known to be inconclusive. Their control, that was not supposed to have results, had results. Thus, there is a problem, likely with their sensors, or they are just falsifying results to get more funding.</p>

<p>It could also do the exact opposite and increase that gap, could it not? I feel it could go both ways depending on the morals and ethics of the individuals involved. Sadly, this means I feel an increase in the gap to be the more likely scenario.</p>
