<p>A lot is being said about Israeli rockets killing kids. That sucks. I get that. What I want to know is are the rockets that Hamas et al are sending precision-aimed so that they won&#39;t hit Israeli children? Are their rockets better somehow? If one of their rockets makes it through the Israeli defenses and kills children, will you all condemn them equally as harsh as you are Israel? Just curious. Because really the only difference I see at the moment is that the Israeli rockets work and the Hamas rockets don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an objective point of view, because I think they&#39;re <em>both</em> assholes, Hamas is using pretty stone age stuff. I think they&#39;re doing they&#39;re best to go for military targets, but nothing is guaranteed.</p>

<p>The difference is, Israel has the best weapons money can buy. If their satellites can read license plates off cars, and their missiles could hit something the size of a chalkboard from 300 miles away, they don&#39;t have an excuse for hitting kids, do they? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say for a second that Hamas <em>could</em> hit something and <em>does</em> somehow kill a couple of children. Does that warrant Israel going in and destroying the entire country?</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying you&#39;re justified for murdering every innocent [<em>insert human race</em>] person you encounter simply because one of them killed a member of your family.</p>

<p>Genocide is not justice. I don&#39;t see how people, Israeli or otherwise, can support the destruction of Gaza yet denounce Hitler&#39;s actions. Hypocrite much? (And to say the Jews never did anything to Germany is a flat-out lie).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are twisted.  &quot;potentially children murdering&quot; vs &quot;ACTUAL CHILDREN MURDERING&quot; and you pick which side? </p>

<p>No, using a bat vs a pebble thrower in this case would be me throwing pebbles at you from my yard, into your yard.  Then you come into my yard and break my face with a bat.  In a court of law your retaliation would not be considered reasonable force.  I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t understand the law.  Learn before commenting on it. </p>

<p>And there is a massive huge difference between advocating for Hamas and stating that Israels response is excessive.  Hamas shoots a rocket.  yes its bad.  Hamas also gunned down Palestinian protestors standing up to Hamas.  Twice.  </p>

<p>So then the response to Hamas is to fucking annihilate Gaza killing hundreds (literally) of Palestinian civilians.  The death toll for Israelis vs Gaza civilians alone is so staggering as to be sickening.  Israel isn&#39;t killing the people responsible for the rockets.  They are killing civilians and telling them to stand up to Hamas and this wouldn&#39;t happen.  </p>

<p>So its clear to you whats going on.  Killed by Hamas for standing up to Hamas.  Killed by Israel for not standing up to Hamas.  WTF do you expect these people who are herded into this tiny area to do? Fuck people, this isn&#39;t rocket science!</p>

You don&#39;t know how to perform the most basic of Google searches? Or are you here to shill for the fucking JIDF, creating agitating discourse in your pathetic wake?</p>

<p>Of course both precise and imprecise rockets are fired on both sides; look to the impetus of Palestinian aggression. Look to the overwhelming numbers of Palestinian civilian deaths versus the numbers of Israeli civilian deaths. Look to Hamas&#39; usage of precision killing of IDF soldiers via their tunnel systems. </p>

<p>And your claim of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try looking at the &quot;which side is hiding missile/fighter caches in UN schools and apt bldgs the most&quot; stat. What does that say?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is completely based on the Israeli perspective, which can clearly not be trusted, what with their targeted child-killing and all.</p>

<p>Why do you defend the killers of children? Why do you defend genocide? You know how the current State of Israel came about, do you not? What kind of horrible person are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending the murder of children. It&#39;s hideous. I&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s going to be a celebration on this sub once one of Hamas&#39;s rockets breaks through and hits a grade school.  </p>

<p>I do know how it was founded. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t hate them. When you throw the word &quot;genocide&quot; around from that point of view, your ignorance of what&#39;s going on over there is exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding? You are playing the fiddle of the advocatus diaboli--arguing the counter-point to the world-wide empathy for the mass murder of the Palestinian people. You are either joking or you are a paid shill for the JIDF--spreading lies for one of the numerous organizations which comprise the propaganda arm of both the IDF and the State of Israel at large. I see through you.</p>

<p>I am done arguing with you. You are a piece of shit as a human being if you support the targeted killing of both civilians and children. You must live with the burden of your own conscience, not I.</p>

<p>Enjoy the fruit of your labors.</p>

<p>I actually know how Israel was formed, why, and the fact that all parties involved agreed to it. Then it was attacked, then they struck back and claimed land. So..... time to take off them conspiracy shades, bud.</p>

<p>the rockets are just hopeful that they hit something whatever it is, any casualties are good casualties for Hamas (on either side)</p>

<p>In the court of ridiculous public opinion, we question this and say the pebble thrower had it coming. </p>

<p>And in the court of reason and logic, we ask what do we expect a people to do when they have their homeland taken away and given to someone else by another country, are herded into small impoverished area&#39;s and kept there under gun fire.  </p>

<p>In the US, we justify bullshit like that and say fighting back for being herded into pens like this from land that was yours before, is terrorism.  Fucking sick. </p>
