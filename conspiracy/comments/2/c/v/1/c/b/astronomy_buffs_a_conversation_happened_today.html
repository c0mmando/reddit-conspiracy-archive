       Jesus, you should at least have some concept of what you are asking. Constellations moving into alignment? Do you even know what a constellation is? This has no meaning. Its like saying.

       It is called "Precession" and the constellations of the Zodiac do actually "move" across the sky over time IF you observe them over time from the same position.

       Oh my god! I know what precession is. The constellations don't move, not in relation to each other, only in relation to when in the calendar year they appear, and the declination they are at. What concept of astronomy do most people have? I mean can't people figure this out from basic principles?
      </p>
      <p>
       Constellations are just made up groupings of stars that seem to be relatively close to each other when viewed from Earth. And the ancients attached stories of gods and goddesses to them. More modern constellations in the southern hemisphere, like
       <em>
        telescopium
       </em>
       were designated by modern astronomers. Stars move, as they appear on Earth, with what is known as proper motion. Whole constellations don't move with respect to each other but individual stars do. The upshot is that constellations over large periods of time change shape, because its just a connect the dots game humans play, but they don't ever change position. Trust me, Orion is not going to be groping Ophiuchus someday.

       The are called the "fixed" stars for a reason. Guess what it is? The don't move (not enough for us to notice in our time frames, at any rate). The planets move. That's why the ancients called them the "wandering stars" -- but they aren't stars. They don't form constellations. Stars form constellations. And the stars are proverbial for not moving.

       Yes, actually there is some merit to it. Careful with how you interpret this though, as it leads down some crazy conspiracy rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My source on this is Graham Handcock, who has some pretty... alternative theories on ancient history so take it with a grain of salt. He's done plenty of lectures and a lifetime of research, and if you're interested I'd say check him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not out of the question to align major monuments with constellations. In fact, since they will stand for such a long time, it's a way of dating those monuments. We did such things with the Hoover Dam when it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are theories that the three pyramids at Giza are aligned with the constellation of Orion, but much of this gets repressed... but why would something so trivial be repressed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out, if you did the dating on the last time the pyramids at Giza aligned with Orion you get roughly a date of 10 to 12 thousand years ago. This is a problem because it's in direct conflict with how traditional history of Egypt is told.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also turns out that the precession of the Equinox's have about a 12 thousand year cycle. So it's true that the alignment is happening again. This also means that, if the alignment truely is there, then the
       <em>
        earliest
       </em>
       the pyramids could have been built is that 10-12 thousand year range... and it's quite possible that it's even older by 12 thousand year chunks in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another cool "coincidence" is that the Sphinx shows signs of water erosion at the base. Guess the last time there was any significant rainy weather patterns in that area of Egypt? Yup, you guessed it, 12 thousand years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm not certain, and would be highly skeptical, of any significant meaning being drawn from alignments happening today, but the
       <em>
        important
       </em>
       part of the issue is that the evidence we've been finding in the past few decades completely smashes our traditional models of ancient history that are still taught in schools today.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty more important sites and evidence being still found today that is pushing civilization dates back. What's even more intriguing is that a lot of these sites get
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       sophisticated the older they get.

       Furthermore, OP's question is about "constellations" about to "align... with each other".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how quickly the stars move
       <em>
        relative to each other
       </em>
       but I think it's on the order of millions of years, so "about to align" is pure BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly,
       <em>
        constellations
       </em>
       wouldn't move together, even if stars did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth.... "Three constellations in the shape of pyramids"-- now, I can see where you can jump to the Giza pyramids / Orion's belt there. But technically those are three stars
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       a constellation....
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds to me like the rantings and ravings of someone un-hinged. I am in this sub because not every amazing/surprising history/prediction can be discounted purely on the basis of being unorthodox/ant-mainstream....
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do have to maintain some threshold of knowledge, sense, and facts on the part of the speaker. And this is far from that threshold, sorry.

       Here's where I explain the man was schizophrenic. I didn't have time to ask what stars or planets he was referring to, but just the fact that he spoke about planetary objects, moving into alignment of three "pyramids, pointing directly at each other" intrigued me tremendously. Perhaps I really could have elaborated on my post, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of any triangular alignments in triplicate? Or did I reinforce the madness of an extremely charming, but cray cray man?...

       I've read up a lot on this subject.  I think we will eventually push civilizations start much further back than it is now.  Scientists have already had to push back hominid evolutionary start to beyond the 1 million year mark for the first actual hominid.

       There are tons of studies and research done that shows that the pyramids do in fact correlate with orions belt, and the airshafts do in fact point out specific constellations, but the point of the precession of the constellations that they correlate to all indicate that it was engineered that way back in a time of that point in the precession. This points to roughly 12000-9000 BCE. This also parallels the dates of precipital weathering found on the sphyinx, as the only time in recent history the climate in that region was see enough to produce the weathering was at the end of the last ice age, roughly 11,800 BCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all indicates that the pyramids, along with the sphyinx, were built several thousand years before the ancient Egyptian dynasties. This would mean that they were built before the invention of the wheel, and before the establishment of the "accepted" oldest human civilization known, Sumer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is controversial because the egyptologists  don't seem to want to admit that they were wrong and that the ancient Egyptians were not the ones that built these structures. And, as it so happens, the egyptologists sanctioned by their government are the only ones with the authority to enter and study these structures, unless they give approval to other scientists. They wish to establish and maintain their self-described label of leading experts of ancient Egypt, so that it is not widely accepted that their ancestors were not responsible for the constructions. (That last part is actually my little theory.)

       I think what the other guy was trying to say is that constellations don't move this way. These are made of stars that are mostly hundreds, or even thousands of light year away. They do move, but because of the inconceivable distances involved, the movement is imperceptible to the naked eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is the Pyramids of Egypt. The 3 main ones are thought to have been built to represent the 3 stars in Orion's belt. Even after 4500 years, the alignment is still almost perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is an alignment, it is probably between constellations, and some
       <em>
        planets
       </em>
       . Planetary movement is visible in a matter of weeks or even days. There may very well be some planets, such as Venus, Jupiter, Mars etc. that have moved into some kind of pyramid shaped configuration with respect to some other planets or even a constellation.

       There's always this.... The pyramids were built around 2400 bc. In the 4400 years since then, the stars in Orion's belt may very well have shifted their positions enough to throw the match off by a visible amount.

       Yes, but again, these are solar objects moving in regularly timed orbits. Stellar movements are different. These occur at such vast distances as to make their movements imperceptible. Think about a car driving around in a circle just a couple of blocks away. You can see the circle. Now think about another car that's moving in the same circle a couple of miles away. You can just barely see the car and the circle looks much smaller. This is an optical effect called parallax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine the car is doing the same thing all the way out to the Moon. Maybe you can see the light from the headlights. At that distance, the circle that the car is moving in will not be apparent to the naked eye. Let's use the same example to compare the distance between us and a planet (or comet) to us and another star.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like the car was driving along somewhere out past Pluto. You'd have to watch for centuries to notice that the car had moved at all.

       Ahhh, I see what you're saying. You are saying that they didn't know, or even mention, that those fixed points in their constellations and star charts move on their own accord, as well, outside of what is called the precession of the equinoxes, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Polaris is currently our north star. However, it isn't always so due to the precession. The ancients knew that "the north star" changes from one star to the next, but what you are stating is that, for instance, they had no idea that Polaris is also in motion, moving around the center of the galaxy on its own orbit. Is this what you are saying?

       There's the galactic rotation itself which takes over 200 million years to complete each full rotation. There is also the movement of the stars themselves relative to each other. Stars in a constellation appear to be close to us in a 2D sort of way. But in terms of actual distances from each other, some of them can be close and some can be very distant. So think of snowflakes in the air just drifting around. Our view of stars in a constellation (in the timespan of a human lifetime) is like an ultra high speed movie of those snowflakes. they appear to be motionless. But in the timeframe of thousands, or millions of years, they just drift around like snowflakes in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       That thing about precession really interests me. The ancients apparently  knew about it, and yet one full precession cycle takes about 26,000 years to complete. I've yet to see a convincing theory about how they would be aware of this phenomenon without a lengthy, sustained period of astronomical observations and
       <em>
        accurate
       </em>
       record keeping.

       Interesting, thanks for that info! Where'd you find the galactic roatation time span? And, I especially like how you mentioned that even the stars in the same constellation could be thousands of light years further away, but they're part of the same constellation. I learned this not too long ago, actually. I find it brings things into perspectives.

       Aliens. Haha but seriously, there isn't a lot to conclusively say
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they came to knowing the precession. Although I am fascinated with the ideas and implications of aliens, especially in this context, I feel the more likely answer is that human civilizations have been around for a lot longer than we realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently the oldest civilization known is Sumer. Though, gobekli Tepe was built some ten thousand years ago. So, knowledge and technology had to have been obtained long before that "first" civilization. However they did it, there are certain steps they needed to come across. One of those is cooperation--a civilization. So, I tend to believe that there were much older civilizations that happened to be more advanced than we give credit to. With the catacylsms that happened around 11,800 BCE, all traces, or most traces, could've been lost forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever seen "after man" or whatever that show was called on the history channel , you would know that even in today's civilization, it would only take a few thousand years for almost every trace of our existence to cease to be recognizable. So, I posit that the ancients knew about the precession from their ancestors and the knowledge they passed down to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I digress. I feel an apology is in order, seeing how I misunderstood the first post awhile ago. My bad.

       No, actually, predicting solar and lunar movements is very different. Planets in our solar system as well, and comets.... these are all things orbiting our sun (or even closer-- us).

       Hmm, "relative to each other" seems to be the key phrase, here. As even the ancient sumerians had star catalogues and even their own version of the zodiac, it would be ridiculous to claim that the ancients did not have the knowledge of the precession of the euqinoxes, for they have described such phenomena as the precession, and even the precession of the milky way galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is, does the precession of the equinoxes count as motion of the stars relative to each other? Even if your answer is no, the fact they had this knowledge about seven thousand years ago is astounding.

       <p>
        does the precession of the equinoxes count as motion of the stars relative to each other?

      <p>
       The answer is clearly, undoubtedly, and importantly: "No".
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it's amazing how long ago our ancestors knew about precession/etc... but the OP had a very specific question and it frustrates me when people offer interesting-yet-irrelevant factoids to the conversation, because, well, that can confuse people.

       Yea, seems I was confused myself with the actual context there. Another commenter spelled it out for me. It's not the precession y'all were talking about, or anything like the precession, but the individual movements of each star on their own journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       See I thought when it was said that they never had an idea of the motions of the stars, it was meant as in the way they seem to glide over our skies every day, every year, and every precessional (isn't it called a platonic year? Or something close to that?).
      </p>
      <p>
       But now i understand that's not what was said, so sorry for that.

       I think there's someone who checked the alignments of some of the features on the Great Pyramid. It would have been in perfect alignment with some stars in 2467 BC. This correlates well with other archaeological evidence. So yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sphinx, not so sure. I know some people believe that it's been around since 9000 BC. I'm open to the possibility. There are some other theories that it predates the Pyramids and originally had a lion's head and predates by a few centuries. There's another theory (that I like) that the Sphinx originally has the Jackal head of Anubis. Then one of the Pharaohs had it redone to look like himself, or his father.

       I've been checking out the idea that the pyramids align better with the wing stars of Cygnus.

       I chose this page because it contained both images:

       </a>

      <p>
       I'm not sure about the page's general content as I haven't read it in its entirety.  I'm going to read it this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find most intriguing is the general acceptance of the Orion theory (possibly disinformation?) and the more obscurity of the Cygnus theory.  Solve those clues and the mystery of the pyramids
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       come a clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, my user name.  Cygnus X-1 is theorized (widely accepted) to be a black hole.  Cyg X-1 is the star right behind the wings, opposite Deneb, the tail of Cygnus.

       Even if the article is way off, I like how it starts by questioning Dr. Zahi Hawass' integrity... I hate that obnoxious fucker!

       They fit amazingly well, but that does not mean that there is any connection between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can pretty much find a representation of any 3 points within the 88 constellations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use 3 random cities as points for example and you could find a connection.

       Only a slightly valid point.  Ancient structures are
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       to have celestial alignment.  Therefore, seeking those alignments is not unreasonable.  The random cities argument, though, is just completely unreasonable.

       If there is a connection between (ancient) buildings and star constellations (which very well may be the case) there must be more evidence than just a matching pattern to confirm it.
