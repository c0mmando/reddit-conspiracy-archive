<p><strong>Here is one of the death-celebration songs that <a href="/u/Einstimer">/u/Einstimer</a> likes to sing:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rachel Corrie was a Whorrie</p>

<p><strong>A comment of his:</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rachel Whorrie was not a kid. She was protecting a confirmed terrorist smuggling hole.</p>

<p><strong>These are the people who run r/Conspiratard, r/EnoughPaulSpam and r/EnoughLibertarianSpam</strong>. </p>

<p>They also operate <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/l4uoi/subreddits_affiliated_with_or_created_by_nolibs/">a bunch of other hate-groups.</a></p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Again, these are the people who defame this subreddit <em>daily</em> as being immoral. The shameless hypocrisy is astounding. The fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T549VoLca_Q">their hate-group is <em>nominally</em> bigoted and so reliant on using bigoted slurs</a> (anti-bigotry PSA contains <strong>NSFW</strong> slurs) to demean people that they dislike is just the icing on their rotten, hate-filled cake.</p>

<p>You may be operating under the assumption that people are motivated by the same thing... that is, the search for truth. However, the same people who lie to us in the mainstream media have a motive to employ an online component to their operations to try to hold their bullshit together at least until the news cycle distracts us with something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation given in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is satire, and satire carefully planned to discourage others from digging too deep, too greedily. If you want to know what really happened, the story of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, of the treason and plot that will eventually lead to our downfall, well, this old redditor knows the tale.</p>

<p>Through various mod mails, leaked screen caps of PMs and infiltrated IRC sessions, I have discovered the real truth about <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. It took a lot of effort, I can tell you. Many people were uncooperative at best, and many outright avoided my questions, ignoring them for hours at a time. But a good detective knows when he is on the scent of something huge. My gut told me something huge was afoot. Something that involved not only the meta subs, but all of reddit itself. Yes. This one went all the way to the top, to the very last person you&#39;d ever expect to be involved. As I dug further and deeper into what happened, I realized this encompassed all of Reddit. A conspiracy the likes of which have never been seen on any content aggregator ever before.</p>

<p>Secret pacts. Alliances made and broken. Subterfuge and spying. Nothing was off the table and everything was permitted, as long as you came out victor in this Machiavellian scheme of epic proportions. Many of those involved were actually involved in downright illegal activities: identify theft, hacking, larceny, arson. Maybe even murder. As a long time (6 months) meta redditor, of course I was partly involved. But I knew it would be more important to stay in the shadows, writing, researching, gathering, checking and rechecking sources. For this is a story that needs to be told. After I tell it to you, all stories will seem banal and flavorless. Truth, as always, really is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>Edit: sorry, I had a meeting and forgot to say what actually happened. Luckily my meeting cancelled last minute so I can pen this tale for posterity. </p>

<p>A lot of what I am about to write will seem untrue. It will seem false. I am an exceptionally gifted writer, that is true. It is one of my very few gifts (along with the jawline of Odin and the body of a Mario Lopez). Yet even one such as I gifted with such an extravagant prowess in the written word could not tell a tale so full of twists and turns. Nay, there is not a writer who <em>could</em> tell a tale so devilish and interesting. Not Shakespeare, not Nabokov, not JK Rowling. For each individual actor in the tale I&#39;m about to tell so creatively sought each others&#39; destruction (and found it, also as creatively, for themselves) that any who could so devise their plots themselves would be driven to the edge of madness and beyond, or, at least, accused of being mad by those who read it. That is to say, no one person could create such a sordid tale as a work of fiction. But everything I am about to tell you is the God&#39;s honest truth, even the part about the FBI and the San Diego zoo. But I digress. </p>

<p>I am writing this because we in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> deserve to know. Deserve to know the truth. For it touched on everything we hold dear: the Gender Wars, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, mod drama and administration drama, free speech, atheism, libertarianism. All forces we see every day in each individual post make an appearance in the most unlikely of places. And the one man, thought banished forever, who stood in the middle, playing each side against each other like a band of marionettes until he emerged victorious from the fray, the man who made <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> what it is today, and the rest of his plans for Reddit itself, all of this I know and will tell you now.</p>

<p>Edit 2: ugh I keep getting pulled into things here at work and I really want you to know what happened. This will have waves and reverberations throughout Reddit for years to come. Honestly, many are speaking of a mass exodus, like the Digg exodus many years before. What has just happened will fundamentally change Reddit forever.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is just the beginning. Just a test. Soon many other subreddits will fall, like domino&#39;s, into the hands of one single person. Indeed, Reddit&#39;s greatest success will turn into Reddit&#39;s greatest failure. The meta Reddit&#39;s, God help them, will be shouting into a storm of tyranny and oppression, all efforts pure, unadulterated vanity at the onslaught that will come.</p>

<p>If we believed in God, or cared at all, I&#39;d advise us all to begin praying. For even though I&#39;m about to tell you what happened, it may already be too late. Too many things have been set in motion, too many brave meta warriors have fallen, too many mods were asleep and allowed posts that should never have gone through have now gone through. To us it means less karma, maybe at worst we find a new way to pass the time other than Reddit. But to the players in the gripping drama, it means everything. Not just karma, not just Reddit notoriety, but real life consequences. Real money, real fame, real power. It was a high stakes game. A game where many staked it all and lost. And one who staked more than any, one man who before was betrayed by his own, shunned and discarded like garbage, one man who swore to destroy everything that he once held dear, and vowed a scorched earth, Biblical revenge upon those who wronged him, who waited for <em>years</em> in the shadows, watching, waiting for the time to strike. Now his plan is in motion. All of this I will tell you, dear reader, if you will hear the tale.</p>

<p>I will begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>This is the most long-winded, pointless, no data or facts or evidence to back up any of your alleged claims, and absolutely nothing revealed about anything.</p>

<p>You crafted an imaginary story claiming to have done things that you have literally zero evidence to verify the truth of your story, of which there is none, because it&#39;s a completely made up story.</p>

<p>It certainly is, just gonna throw this out there though, I wouldn&#39;t be greatly surprised if there <em>were</em> a group of legitimate, adolescent trolls who <strong><em>conspire together</em></strong> for the sole purpose of fucking with this sub. And even less surprised if they participated in certain IRC channels, taking suggestions from some JTRIG employee/s thinly disguised as Redditors.</p>

<p>What lead you to even think that? Seriously, I want to know what about this post made you think it might possibly be an attempt to boost the ego of trolls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>did conspiratard post this thread themselves?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mask accusations dude, you factually knew ( or at least should have been capable of figuring it out ) who posted this submission, your question is alleging that <a href="/u/gavy101">/u/gavy101</a> is a conspiratard. If you don&#39;t understand that, God help you.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t fucking trust you <a href="/u/shmegegy">/u/shmegegy</a> , you appear to be a waffle if I&#39;ve ever seen one.</p>

<p>They can Yuk Yuk all they like, it&#39;s all part of their game, if they don&#39;t Yuk Yuk, then it appears that it actually &quot;got to them&quot; and is true, since if it&#39;s not true they should easily be able to rebut the claims, so they HAVE to Yuk Yuk in order to keep up their ruse.</p>

<p>Ah, this is the &quot;convince them&quot; part of the rebuttal, the part that is meant to turn me to his side, but look what it really is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is the accusation that is meant to evict a sense of guilt and doubt, which was also previously seeded in his earlier statements as stated earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I prefer engaging people to challenge their own beliefs.</p>

<p>Now, he moves on to the final step to complete the change to his side by offering a beacon hope, a shining slice of illegally downloaded twilight zone glory to illuminate my life, and turn me into a rational and reasonable person.</p>

<p>Why do I have to watch a TV show to understand a concept?</p>

<p>What concept is it that is so important that I am not understanding?</p>

<p>Why are you not able to explain this concept to me, so that I may be able to understand it?</p>

<p>Why do you not provide people with the information with which you wish to share with them, instead trying to force them to look it up on their own? Is the possible reason for that, so that you can accuse them afterwards of being ignorant and close minded and unwilling to learn, while at the same time hypocritically refusing to teach?</p>

<p>Please answer me these questions sir, I sincerely doubt that you have good answers for all of them.</p>

<p>they or a serious proportion of they, are dedicated to downvoting and obscuring discussions of non-official topics.</p>

<p>they are a censor, and it hides behind the Randi pretense of being skeptic, when in reality they are authoritarian faith believers.</p>

<p>some of their people write in the style of CPA/Iraqwar supporters from nine or ten years or so ago, likely the same types that were Bushco apologists are now doing r/conspirturd duty.</p>

<p>I wandered in there and gave/showed them two hires <strong>MSM</strong> official news agency photographs (both of which cannot be true pictures without photoshopping), they downvoted me to oblivion.</p>

<p>groupthink, they never bothered to examine the impossibility of the two same/different pictures, they just knee-jerked on command from their handlers.</p>

<p>they are closed minds.</p>

<p>This is exactly why we don&#39;t need to concern ourselves with them. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has far more users then they do. I don&#39;t imagine they can influence much, not to mention the fact that they are far more likely to upvote something here, increase the visibility, so they can link to it in their own sub.</p>

<p>I have no strong feelings towards them, as their agenda is not to silence us, but to amplify our extremists to the delight of their audience.</p>

<p>There are good people there, just like there can be bad people here.</p>

Thanks to your insightful comment I have no choice but to see the error of my ways &amp; completely shift my total understanding of the function of the world, thanks to you. I had no right to question the ways of the world &amp; now I can just sit back &amp; watch it all roll by.

<p>I made you questions, you avoided answering them so I will assume by default that you agreed with them.</p>

<p>Now on to your question, that&#39;s not the same thing. There isn&#39;t just one mod there and there are also others besides the mods and the thread was brigaded after being x-posted, resulting in the downvotes you see.</p>

<p>If anything I am glad that you at least agreed with approved acts of violence being enough for a hate group.</p>

<p>Want more? Let&#39;s just do a very simple &quot;hate&quot; search in their brigade sub, let&#39;s see what we find:</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/21svyl/another_conspiratard_ad_i_really_hate_these/">Another conspiratard ad. I REALLY hate these idiots sometimes.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1zzw6l/i_hate_people_like_this/">I hate people like this</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xomrj/i_dont_care_they_scream_like_idiots_this_is_why_i/">I don&#39;t care they scream like idiots, this is why I hate /r/conspiracy... &quot;we don&#39;t need proof, but you do, and we&#39;re gonna downvote your proof anyways!&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/245pi0/what_i_hate_about_conspiracy_theorists_and_why_i/">What I hate about conspiracy theorists and why I created /r/actualconspiracies</a></p>

<p>and so on</p>

<p>Shall we search for &quot;retard&quot;? Oh my, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/search?q=retard&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">there&#39;s just too many</a>.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, the point has already been made pretty clear and I am happy that this conversation is over.</p>

<p>Just to play the ball back: calling every tragedy a false flag, telling the victims are crisis actors, encouraging doxxing and harassing the families of the victims does not?</p>

<p>Just to remind you: the last guy who excessivly did this, doxxed the hell out of the families etc. got shadowband multiple times now and every time <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> decryed the shadowban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straw man. I&#39;ve never done that and 99.9% of the people here haven&#39;t, either. </p>

<p>Also, they&#39;re not even equatable. I think the &quot;hoax&quot; shit is a plant to keep people from getting near the real conspiracies. Look up the guy behind the Sandy Hook hoax pushes - that guy is sketch as hell.</p>

<p>And for the people that fall for the bullshit, they honestly think they&#39;re doing something good. They&#39;re drawing circles around pictures and posting it to YouTube. They&#39;re not calling dead kids pancakes. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand how you can defend and stand behind people that make the disgusting jokes and pictures and other things they disseminate about another human being. I refuse to believe that, deep down, they feel good about what they&#39;re doing, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s no strawman as it&#39;s the same standards you want to push on others. Or you&#39;re simply working with double standards.</p>

<p>Or to say it with your words: 99.9% of the people haven&#39;t embraced the pancake. It&#39;s a thing from the long past (beating dead horses?) that get&#39;s warmed up here again and again. The false flags claims on the other hand are alive and striving here. Every time again voted to the top.
The complaints about the shadowban of my mentioned doxxer were at the top. Again and again.</p>

<p>In my book the pancake and calling the dead victims and grieving families crisis actors is one and the same thing.</p>

<p>While one can say that one party evolved away from the pancakes and devolved into the jewshekels-circlejerk, the other party of false flags and crisis actors is strong and thriving.</p>

<p>So to paraphrase you: I just don&#39;t understand how you can beat a dead horse with absolutely no recent occurence while defending the doxxing (complaint about the shadowban was at the top), ongoing hostile allegations towards victims as crisis actors and other things they regularily disseminate about another human being.</p>

<p>It seems that you are just working with double standards and that those &#39;circle guys&#39;, even when they doxx and harass, are excused because they believe to do the right thing. Al Quaida also believed to do the right thing. ISIS believes to do the right thing. Overzealous pastors spewing hate against minorities believe to do the right thing. Are they excused for the same reason?</p>

<p>It&#39;s disingenuous to compare that with a few misguided and a MORE THAN A FEW plants that insist a bunch of little kids are alive to keep people from digging deeper into the medication shitshow that was Sandy Hook schools.

<p>Try as hard as you want for whatever weird reason you seem to want to, but you aren&#39;t going to ever get me to defend people who crow and croon and cheer about girls being run over by bulldozers. </p>

<p>Who on our mod list doxxed anyone? Who on our mod list makes jokes about activists being murdered by bulldozers and makes gross and graphic little memes about it?</p>

<p>I had just felt sorry for them over there on that sub for being ostrichy and angry about stupid stuff and actually agree with some of the posters over there on a few things from time to time, but holy cow. I understand that not all frequenters of the sub represent the views of the mods, but they&#39;re the mods, man/woman. </p>

<p>And there are only two or three people on the meta conspiratard thread companion to this one who even mention how fucked up the sick shit is. Bless &#39;em for speaking up, and there should be more. I had really no idea until I viewed this thread and to be honest, I wish I hadn&#39;t.</p>
