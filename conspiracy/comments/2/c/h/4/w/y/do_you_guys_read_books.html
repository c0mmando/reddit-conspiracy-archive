<p>Reading two classic books that I and everyone I know has read does not make you a genius. I was in AP classes too, it&#39;s not hard. Read the news and documents and form options. I don&#39;t know what your point is but no offense you come off as a 15 year old that thinks he&#39;s a genius and knows the world. Have you seen first hand, third world countries and what it is like there? No. Have you read official documents regarding 911, Boston etc and read between the lines and formulated an opinion on them? Maybe bit re read and figure out what they&#39;re NOT telling you. Goo job and waning to get a higher education. Once you&#39;re out of your parents and experience these issues first hand, go to protests and ask why people are there and explain your point to real scholars and see how your opinion matches up. </p>

<p>Going on conspiracy and actin like you&#39;re a genius makes you look like a dumbass kid, which you may not be but base on your post you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have <em>you</em> read and comprehended 1984? Like, at all? The totalitarian police state in the book is pretty much exactly the way we are headed thanks in part to how the media portrays events and how it suggests to us how we should respond or feel. I&#39;m not going to say 9/11 was definitely an inside job, but I think they knew about it and could have prevented it. Do you really think we belong in afghanistan and iraq to fight terrorists instead of oil or furthering NATO&#39;s agenda?</p>

<p>If you think false flags are outside of the scope of our government then you should do some more homework. If the govt is willing to start coups, incite riots and revolts, attempt assassinations, smuggle drugs and things like that in other countries, what makes false flags verboten?</p>

<p>&quot;Us all&quot; don&#39;t worry about lizards, only some of us and a minority at that. </p>

<p>That&#39;s great that you&#39;re educating yourself at an established facility beholden to the mil-ind complex. You will know the truth as they care to explain it to you. Does a degree somehow make you a better citizen than everyone who has forgone one because of their own abilities, circumstance and preferences? Being on that path certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be helping your sympathetic ability or open-minded investigative skills very much. If it is, you&#39;re certainly not expressing it. Or maybe condescending judgement is the highest virtue eh? </p>

<p>I hope <em>you</em> stop acting like this. It&#39;s very mean.</p>

<p>If you really think the government is a force of good and that it has our best intentions in mind I feel a little bad for you, but not a lot. Take care and good luck.</p>

<p>I know the government isn&#39;t perfect. Honestly, I just wish that people in this country were more intelligent so they wouldn&#39;t vote into office the guy with the prettiest campaign. The FCC should not have ex-comcast employees in it. The FDA should not have employees from Tyson or another similar corporation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for being mean. I&#39;m sorry. I really am. Maybe we can get along. The thing you brought up about the media; I agree completely. I don&#39;t watch the news, or really listen to it at all outside of companies like BBC, which seem to be the least sensationalized out of the bunch as far as I know. I think a good phrase to describe this stuff is the subjectification of modern media. We are following Orwell&#39;s story in that regard. </p>

<p>Well my friend said she believed 9/11 was inside job. She watched some documentaries and went on a few websites that follow that mindset. It bothered me because it seemed she so quickly aligned to that concept without thinking too much, as far as I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is a lot of suspicious activity before and during 9/11 so I don&#39;t blame her. I&#39;m not 100% convinced it is, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was.

<p>Spend a while in the sub and understand that the people who come to this sub are incredibly diverse. Fringe communities in general are going to have a lot of wild shit going on, so reacting because of one person&#39;s response to one event isn&#39;t much of a reason to preach to a community of several thousand.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the dynamic between <a href="http://mobilismobili.com/2010/03/25/wissenschaft-and-kenntnis/">kenntniss - practical knowledge - and wissenschaft - abstract knowledge</a> - isn&#39;t exactly the same thing as the difference between intelligence (knowing information/data) and wisdom (being able to actually use and apply that information correctly and effectively), but I would say that this not a bad example you bring up none the less.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go quite as far as to say that &quot;no European country gives a damn about an American college degree.&quot; as there are certainly pros and cons to both the American and European forms of education.</p>

<p>It would seem the concept of wissenschaft would likely advocate for an excepting of <em>every</em> type of information that is beneficial to one&#39;s growth and development regardless of where it comes from, no?</p>

<p>Such seems the wise path to follow, after all.</p>

<p>The Boston bombing was indeed a false flag operation.</p>

<p>I will show you that here and now.</p>

<p>The Tsarnaev brothers who are accused simply did not do the bombing. It was done by our government.</p>

<p>Here, very close up, is one of the two backpacks that the FBI says exploded at the Boston Marathon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of that even remotely connects the event to the US government.</p>

<p>I have seen the same evidence you have seen in regards to the September 11<sup>th</sup> attacks. Planes can do heavy damage. The amount of force applied to the building is a joke, almost. Going at a cruising speeds, the plane can easily pierce through steel, as it did on the WTC towers and the Pentagon. The other flight luckily crashed instead of taking more innocent lives. As for the explosion... Does anyone here know a single thing about chemical explosives? First of all, an explosion is essentially a rapid expansion of a material, usually a gas. The fuel in the jet exploded due the rapid rise in pressure as the planes slammed into their respective targets. As the explosion escaped the fuel tanks, the heated material reached it&#39;s ignition point <strong>and</strong> had oxygen to start the fire. At this point, the fire spread burning down the towers and part of the Pentagon. Not even the hundreds of firemen could save the day. Thousands of people died that day. </p>

<p>Now I do have to say that I disagree with Bush starting a damn war that lasted almost a decade. Honestly, I think we became the terrorists. We have killed a lot of innocent people under the guise of &quot;war&quot;. That&#39;s pathetic for a developed country such as the US. I&#39;m just glad that&#39;s over with, but there still war everywhere else. It&#39;s sad. War sucks. Sadness sucks. I wish people could just talk things out nicely without resorting to violence. It&#39;s not hard. MLK jr. did it! Gandhi did it! The Buddha did it (as far as history tells us)! It&#39;s possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuel was mostly dissipated in the fireball outside the buildings. </p>

<p>The jet fuel couldn&#39;t possibly have gotten hot enough to &#39;soften&#39; steel. Here&#39;s the math.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uscrusade.com/forum/config.pl/read/1064">http://www.uscrusade.com/forum/config.pl/read/1064</a></p>

<p>None of what you believe excuses or explains the violations of physics that would have had to happen if the governments story were to be believed.</p>

<p>The physical law of conservation of motion/momentum is what was violated when the top of the south tower began tilting over and then instead of conserving momentum and continuing to tilt and fall over the side of the remaining undamaged floors, it changed direction in mid air, having collided with nothing at all and fell straight downward.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Kwb8A">http://imgur.com/Kwb8A</a></p>

<p>Conservation of motion is a law of physics , not a suggestion.</p>

<p>The only physically allowable way for that to happen is that the upper and lower floors were  completely pulverized at that moment to allow the material to take smaller arcs in its fall.</p>

<p>As the tower fell it gained a speed of collapse that defied the fact that it was overpowering resistance from  the steel frame.
Steel has power to resist weight. It also was thicker and thicker as it descended floor by floor. The building was not made of noodles.</p>

<p>Physics was defied in the fact that the upper floors fell in the direction of most resistance.</p>

<p>Proof?</p>

<p>Stack two objects that are similar to each other such as the upper and lower portions of the towers., weak or strong, doesn&#39;t matter. I use salt and pepper shakers, you can use anything you like.</p>

<p>Now have the upper one fall through the lower one.</p>

<p>It simply cannot be done unless you first pulverize them both. as in a  controlled demolition.</p>

<p>The fourth defiance of physics is that in a gravity fed collapse the floors would &#39;pancake&#39; that did not happen.</p>

<p>The term pancake applied to the collapse infers that each floor would pile directly on top of the floors below.</p>

<p>No layers formed in the debris pile therefore there  was no pancake collapse.</p>

<p>There was instead shrapnel as would happen when explosives turned the buildings into shrapnel.</p>

<p>That is visible, pancake layers  are not. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called physical and forensic evidence as opposed to your misplaced faith.</p>

<p>In regards to Boston your suggestion that the government is not implicated by the clear evidence of  a government agent actually taking the bomb to its final location   is simply denial in the face of the  facts.</p>
