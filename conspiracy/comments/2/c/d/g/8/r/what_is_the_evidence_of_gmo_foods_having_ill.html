      <p>
       the Forbes
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/09/20/scientists-savage-study-purportedly-showing-health-dangers-of-monsantos-genetically-modified-corn/">
        article
       </a>
       mentions how this is just one study against 100s of others, and that the study itself is whacked out somewhat.
      </p>
      <p>
       the following quotes are from scientists that are challenging the study
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mark Tester, a research professor for the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics at the University of Adelaide noted that the  findings raised the question of why no previous studies have flagged similar concerns. “If the effects are as big as purported, and if the work really is relevant to humans, why aren’t the North Americans dropping like flies? GM has been in the food chain for over a decade over there—and longevity continues to increase inexorably,” he wrote in a comment emailed to Reuters.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Even though I strongly support labeling, I’m skeptical of this study,” said Marion Nestle, professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University. “It’s weirdly complicated and unclear on key issues: what the controls were fed, relative rates of tumors, why no dose relationship, what the mechanism might be. I can’t think of a biological reason why GMO corn should do this.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       also, a list was made of the questions raised against the study
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The London-based Science Media Centre, which assists reporters when major science news breaks, posted an entire page of criticisms from scientists, researchers and professors. David Spiegelhalter of the University of Cambridge writes that the methods, statistics and reporting of results were all below standard. Among the concerns highlighted:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The published does not present all the data. “All data cannot be shown in one report and the most relevant are described here’”—this is a quote from the paper, which means that no reader can evaluate the findings, which mean the data may have been cherry picked
      </p>
      <p>
       Small sample size. The control group is inadequate to make any deduction. Only 10 rodents some of these develop tumors. Until you know the degree of variation in 90 or 180 (divided into groups of ten) control rodents these results are of no value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maize was minimum 11% of the diet—that’s nor a normal diet for rats and invariably distorted the data
      </p>
      <p>
       In Fig. 2, the bars with a zero appears to be for the non-maize control, yet those bars don’t look significantly different from the bars indicating 11, 22, and 33% of GM maize in the diet. The authors do not appear to have done analysis of their data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The data from the control group fed non-GM maize is not included in the main figures making it very difficult to interpret the results
      </p>
      <p>
       No results given for non-gm maize
      </p>
      <p>
       The same journal published a paper showing no adverse health effects in rats of consuming gm maize (though this is a shorter 90-day study)
      </p>
      <p>
       so, the forbes article shows that the study was flawed
      </p>
      <p>

       Well for one, you didn't hear about all the farmers killing themselves in India? Seems like that's a pretty major effect.

       Why limit to just ill effects on humans? What about the environment?

       “The issue of farmer suicides is not just entirely a farmer issue, or rural issue, or a village issue — it is a much more broader political-economic problem,” said Raju Das, a developmental studies professor at York University.

       watching an intro to a documentary isn't really "evidence". and according to Academics Review, a site designed for scientists to peer-review each other, their article suggests
       <a href="http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-individuals/jeffrey-smith/">
        Jeffery smith has used unreliable studies, and his sciences on GMOs is completely wrong
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       his documentary Genetic Roulette has also been
       <a href="http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/">
        'torn apart'
       </a>
       by other scientists who give reliable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arpad Pusztai, another 'scientist' among Genetic Roulette and Scientists under attack has been proven wrong on the same

       Look at the GMO situation. everybody is up in arms over it, but no evidence given whatsoever for the hysteria. when it is, i try to critique it. that is what debate is about, and science.

       How about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans can't get simple shit figured out and they want to go and start fucking with the food supply in really hard to reverse ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if corporations gave a shit and weren't so focused on profit people might be cooler with it but as it stands corporations have shown time and again that they just don't fucking care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Monsanto is heading up the GMO charge, have you seen their record? Fuck them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, how about Monsanto actually generically modify food in a way that benefits people? So far they only seem to GMO stuff to make it compatible with their bug sprays. WOW! Talk about self serving and proving my point!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you love GMOs so much? Do you eat them everyday and go "OH BOY THIS STUFF IS SO GOOD, I GOTTA GO ONLINE AND TELL EVERYONE THEY'RE WRONG!

       The problem is that anyone who studies it gets ostracized and pushed out of the community. Gawd, Seralini. Researchers see the abuse and harassment sent that guy's way and just back off.

       But here's the thing - if RNA in rice can affect our gene expression, and we are doing things like putting human DNA in rice, how does that affect the population consuming that rice? Where are the studies, long-term studies, before foisting that stuff on people in third world countries?

       This whole "GMOs are awesome" vs. "GMOs are suck" debate is purposely obfuscating the fact that there are some modifications being performed that are risky and dangerous and thoroughly undertested.

       I don't understand how and why a bunch of people who run around crowing about how much they believe in science
       <em>
        actively and adamantly and vociferously
       </em>
       stand in the way of
       <em>
        conducting science.

       You're not all paid and don't all have a financial interest in the outcomes, I know this for a fact.

       The problem isn't the GMO per se, it's the copious amounts of Round-Up pesticides that are used on the GMO plants that they're genetically modified to be immune to. That Round-Up gets in our food and makes us sick.

       Modify mRNA, DNA and dangerous unknown side effects start happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       One type of dsRNA is microRNA (miRNA). MicroRNA are basically small pieces of RNA that interact with your genes, essentially stopping certain genes from being expressed. MiRNA exists in human body fluid naturally; however, microRNA also exists in plants, and research has shown that eating the wrong plants may transfer this plant miRNA to humans — with potentially devastating implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study, published in 2011, determined that microRNA from cooked plant foods like rice, wheat and potatoes can in fact collect in your blood and tissue, leading to a number of potential health problems. The study further revealed that microRNA remains completely stable after not only cooking, but through the digestion process as well. Most importantly, the researchers found a significant quantity of microRNA in the human body, concluding that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “… plant miRNAs are primarily acquired orally, through food intake.”
      </p>
      <p>
       MicroRNA has been widely shown to alter many critical biological processes, including apoptosis – the process of programmed cell death and DNA fragmentation. As a result, the dysregulation of microRNAs has been linked to cancer and various other diseases. And, as noted, plant miRNA has been shown to interfere with human microRNA by mimicking it and binding to the receptors, and also potentially through alterations in gene expressions.

       While some GMOs have been designed to make new dsRNA molecules, in other GMOs such molecules may occur as a side-effect of the genetic engineering process. Still others may make naturally-occurring dsRNA molecules in higher or lower quantities than before.
      </p>

       RNA is one of three major macromolecules, like DNA. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is responsible for regulating well over one-third of human genes.

       GMO'S modify DNA, RNA.... you should be able to put 2 and 2 together. This is very related.

      <blockquote>

        There is a widespread perception that eating food from genetically modified crops is more risky than eating food from conventionally farmed crops. However, there is broad scientific consensus that food on the market derived from such crops poses no greater risk than conventional food.[1][2][3][4][83][84][74][85] No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from genetically modified food.[4][5][6] In 2012, the American Association for the Advancement of Science stated "Foods containing ingredients from genetically modified (GM) crops pose no greater risk than the same foods made from crops modified by conventional plant breeding techniques."[1] The American Medical Association, the National Academies of Sciences and the Royal Society of Medicine have stated that no adverse health effects on the human population related to genetically modified food have been reported and/or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date.[4][5][6] A 2004 report by Working Group 1 of the ENTRANSFOOD project, a group of scientists funded by the European Commission to identify prerequisites for introducing agricultural biotechnology products in a way that is largely acceptable to European society,[86] concluded that "the combination of existing test methods provides a sound test-regime to assess the safety of GM crops."[87] In 2010, the European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation reported that "The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies."[2]:16
