<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And I think you think wrong if you &quot;don&#39;t think so&quot;.</p>

<p>These are revolutionary times we live in, and the fathers of this country - revolutionaries that they themselves were - had <em>no</em> use for half-assed thinking of this type.</p>

<p>This is not to say that getting up in arms and trying to fight the 1% and the MIC in an armed conflict should be the first resort or anything.  Of course not.  However, and again I say, <em>fuck</em> the list.  One should not be afraid to be put on any such list.</p>

<p>In a world of falsehoods such as the one we currently live in, telling the truth and standing for what&#39;s right can be a very dangerous undertaking.  So be it, however.  There is no reason to continue living our life in lies.</p>

<p>A lot of Americans don&#39;t - especially compared to other countries.  We&#39;re boiling frogs with first world problems being covertly manipulated by a powerful elite, however, and that powerful elite know that the longer they can keep us complacent, the easier it gets to completely overtake us.</p>

<p>So yeah.  Of course you don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting fucked in the ass.  TPTB use a LOOOOT of lube and cover the entire place with rose petals and the scent of mir.  It smells real nice around here and there&#39;s sweet music playing in the air.  We almost don&#39;t notice the foot long dong we&#39;re getting shish-kabobbed by.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, refer to my previous statement.  TPTB work subtly and <em>behind</em> the scenes (all pun intended).  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to do shit all up in front of your face for everyone to see.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard of Gulliver&#39;s Travels right?</p>

<p>Well...we&#39;re <a href="http://nishitak.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/gullivers-travels.jpg">the giant</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If things were as benign as you think they are, then I guess they shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Things are nowhere near that benign, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Network, spread information, be a useful efficient node, and spread information, inspire discussion, convince or make the cases for. </p>

<p>Spreading awareness means more people will know and can act.
The internet, social media has brought plenty of opportunities to harness and fine tune the raw populace power the elites/power structure have so much vested in trying to subdue, control.</p>

<p>I would advocate the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get out of whatever pessimism you&#39;re sickened with, choosing action is a positive willful act, with purpose. So think efficiently and cut any harmful inhibitions or prejudgements about what others will think and say. </p></li>
<li><p>Get in tune with the debate/ rhetorical/ linguistic flows of conversation and idea exchange. Dialectics, some philosophy shouldn&#39;t hurt either.</p></li>
<li><p>a. Get informed about whatever you want. You should at least try to really understand the debate around one major issue and commit to that. Understand the debate first. One thing about processing all the information you&#39;ll come across is that you have will have to sift through sand for nuggets of truth.<br/>
b. Mainstream media sources in America have been given the air of expert information seekers/ truth sources and can be &quot;what they want us to think&quot; (If you end up suspecting some elite conspiracy)</p></li>
<li><p>Participate and Share. At the very least, get to this level of functioning. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the difficulty as well is if you wanted to go further and lend your effort to an organization, how to discern the true ones vs. the co-opted ones. </p>

<p>The danger of calling for Democracy in America may be disheartening as well. I mean if Occupy were to get big enough, I&#39;m sure a couple of kids may have gotten sniped or arrested, I mean the weapons and men were in place. 
Would it be inevitable for a legitimate movement to get infiltrated?</p>

<p>Is there any hope?
Yes. </p>

<p>I sit here every day wondering if their will be a revolution soon...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t stagnate. There won&#39;t be a &#39;revolution&#39; or &#39;collapse&#39; for many months, if not years. [At least, this is what I see/believe]</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to jump start it. A collapse will come, but not for quite some time. </p>

<ol>
<li>Before you see a revolution, you will see Bank &quot;bail ins&quot;.</li>
<li>A Bank bail in won&#39;t occur until the market &quot;crashes&quot;.</li>
<li>A market crash won&#39;t occur until the Fed stops printing cheap money.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve will not stop creating money until god knows when.</li>
