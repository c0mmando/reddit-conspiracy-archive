    <div class="md"><p>People are waking up and there is a tipping point where the critical mass of conscious people will turn the scales towards truth. More and more we are seeing the emergence of a new paradigm. For example, alternative media prevented the U.S. from open war on Syria, Elon Musk is making alternative energy a reality with Solar City and Tesla Motors, and the push to reform the criminal justice system and end the war on drugs is coming from both sides of the aisle. Having an exit plan dual citizenship isn&#39;t a bad idea, but I think change is coming.</p>

<p>For me, the biggest thing is for the already politically awake people to start realizing their higher potential. The Field and other books have done extensive research on the power of people to affect reality with their mind. When we create positive energy within ourselves, it literally changes the world. Also, I recommend Rav Ashlag&#39;s &quot;On World Peace&quot; for help realizing how to create inner and global peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you apologize? </p>

<p>For the record, I always hated that you apologized... I thought it was pathetic that you gave away the moral high ground so easily. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In society, as in life, there are consequences for not following the rules. In this instance, not following the rules has imposed consequences for many people other than myself, people who have seen their school, and perhaps their degree, tarnished in the eyes of others through no fault of their own. For that again, I am truly sorry.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An apology can also be for the sake of a relationship. I apologized because it was the right thing to do for the sake of peace with the people that wanted an apology, and I meant it. </p>

<p>Now, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t stand by asking questions to Senator Kerry. I also looked into suing the police, but it was difficult to find an attorney that wanted to go after them.</p>

<p>Rand on the other hand is either a sell out at this point OR he is going along with the game to get into office to stir shit up..hopefully.</p>

<p>Gary Johnson for prez.</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<p>Has anyone come up to you (specifically in the past few years) and told you how you were right?  A lot of people around me have been waking up to the 9/11 false flag and shadow govt since 2012/13</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on Alex Jones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Gary, maybe even more than I like Jesse, but I think he&#39;s too unknown to win. Even Andrew Napolitano has a better shot IMO, and he&#39;s not even running.</p>

<p>Yes, plenty of people have told me they see what&#39;s going on, and a lot of people even told me I helped wake them up. </p>

<p>Alex is the biggest platform in alternative media right now and he&#39;s done well in expanding Infowars. I hope he does even more to unify the community by collaborating more with people like David Icke, Max Keiser, Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul, Luke Rudkowski, Ben Swann, Carlos Miller, etc. There is power in unity, and the more we all work together, the more closer we are to a shift in reality.</p>
