       A lot of people sent me messages, wrote supportive public comments, and had my back. The situation was a learning experience for everyone involved, including the American public, most of whom have had over a decade of conditioning in public school to obey authority and remain ignorant about the state of reality while drinking fluoride in the water.

       Agreed, I was absolutely outraged when I saw this and have suffered a similar fate to yours but it was the metal batons and not electricity. Thank you for your courage to speak up to that vampire and ask the hard questions.  I too saw people snicker and laugh at me for exercising my 1st amendment rights.

       Thanks to you I started researching skull and bones back when it happened and what I've uncovered is pretty nasty people think they know where they live but they don't have a clue.

       Running away nor physical confrontation will help. Pure exposure of who these people are really, and the crimes they committed will set us free starting with 9/11

       People are waking up and there is a tipping point where the critical mass of conscious people will turn the scales towards truth. More and more we are seeing the emergence of a new paradigm. For example, alternative media prevented the U.S. from open war on Syria, Elon Musk is making alternative energy a reality with Solar City and Tesla Motors, and the push to reform the criminal justice system and end the war on drugs is coming from both sides of the aisle. Having an exit plan dual citizenship isn't a bad idea, but I think change is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the biggest thing is for the already politically awake people to start realizing their higher potential. The Field and other books have done extensive research on the power of people to affect reality with their mind. When we create positive energy within ourselves, it literally changes the world. Also, I recommend Rav Ashlag's "On World Peace" for help realizing how to create inner and global peace.

       Why did you apologize?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I always hated that you apologized... I thought it was pathetic that you gave away the moral high ground so easily.

       An apology can also be for the sake of a relationship. I apologized because it was the right thing to do for the sake of peace with the people that wanted an apology, and I meant it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that doesn't mean I don't stand by asking questions to Senator Kerry. I also looked into suing the police, but it was difficult to find an attorney that wanted to go after them.

       Has anyone come up to you (specifically in the past few years) and told you how you were right?  A lot of people around me have been waking up to the 9/11 false flag and shadow govt since 2012/13

       I like Gary, maybe even more than I like Jesse, but I think he's too unknown to win. Even Andrew Napolitano has a better shot IMO, and he's not even running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, plenty of people have told me they see what's going on, and a lot of people even told me I helped wake them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex is the biggest platform in alternative media right now and he's done well in expanding Infowars. I hope he does even more to unify the community by collaborating more with people like David Icke, Max Keiser, Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul, Luke Rudkowski, Ben Swann, Carlos Miller, etc. There is power in unity, and the more we all work together, the more closer we are to a shift in reality.

       No doubt, this country has been an oligarchic duopoly since Teddy's failed bid in 1912 (with the exception of perhaps JFK).

       That's why I'm asking people if they prefer Jesse or Rand or X. We need to unify behind a third party candidate. There's a video where I discussed this at length here:

       I wanted to connect with people who wanted to hear what I have to say, and also help in any way. A lot of people in the truth community get stuck in anger or depression, and I've been on a long journey and find myself in a place where I feel I can help others rise above negativity. You can poke around my website to get a sense of what I'm talking about. theandrewmeyer.com

       Good question, I've thought about that a few times. I would probably have lined up at the microphone sooner. My intuition told me I needed to, and I ignored it. If I were first in line at the mic, I wouldn't have been out of line in any way.

       Hey now, Jesse was publicly defamed and he proved it in court. He pursued a lawsuit to restore his reputation. Watch his interview and then tell me how you feel -

       I see Jesse on WWE wearing a Jacket with a Freemason symbol on it on a network known to be used to further TPTB agenda tells me who's side he's on. You realy think he would have a tv show if he wasn't doing their bidding ?

       I've thought about that, but I need more evidence than a jacket patch and a blanket "If he's on TV he's Bilderberg." MSNBC locked Jesse into a contract and took him off the air in order to effectively silence him when he came out of office, and the news anchors always do their best to ask him derogatory questions. If you think Jesse is not on the level, come stronger than a jacket patch.
