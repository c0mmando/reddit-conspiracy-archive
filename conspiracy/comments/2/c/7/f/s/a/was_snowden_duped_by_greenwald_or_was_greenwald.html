       1) Snowden had to put his trust in somebody.. maybe he didn't think that somebody would partner with a billionaire
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Greenwald says all the right things, and I like to think he still has the passion. Maybe he doesn't know his work has been co-opted?

       Snowden dupes Greenwald, Snowden is and will always be CIA.

       Greenwald dupes Snowden in to thinking he's going to get cash for the coolr story/screenplay they will write together. Greenwald fucks off to try to make his own money.

       At the end of the day the American people now have another distraction. Every couple of months Snowden will all of a sudden release a tidbit that we all already knew.

       Why do people dismiss his releases? He has verified a lot of what we
       <em>
        suspected
       </em>
       but didn't have hard evidence for. I understand nothing revolutionary has come of his documents (so maybe it isn't entirely legit, who knows) but don't pass them off as if they were pointless.

       I'm afraid you might have entirely missed the point of his leaks. Ten years ago people claimed the government was spying on us. They were called loonies with tinfoil hats. He vindicated all of those people and then some. Just because YOU understood what the government was doing doesn't mean the majority of America or the world knew. In fact, a very small percentage of people knew before Snowden. He brought a ton of attention to federal surveillance (among other things).

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       For
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , his leaks were pointless because everyone "knew" the NSA was intercepting all communications.  Just like everyone "knows" that 9/11 was an inside job, JFK was killed by the CIA, and that the moon landing was a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's still goddamn nice to have the government's own documents backing up your claims.  Documents backing up suspicions aren't pointless at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , it isn't good enough.  Every event is carefully orchestrated and nothing happens that wasn't part of the ruling elite's plan.  When planes crash, it's a false flag... always.  When a country is invaded by Russia it must be a good thing.  When a whistleblower leaks documents, they must be a undercover agent.  If someone disagrees with you, they must be a shill.

       All I know is that the Snowden story feels all wrong to me at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greenwald has gone completely off the radar. He hasn't done jack shit in the past year other than do speaking events to cash in on his celebrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to think that Russia is actually stashing Snowden as a favor to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easiest way to make sure no one ever uncovers what the hell really went on with Snowden is to make sure the press has zero access to him. The only way to do that is to stash him in a place like Russia.

       Both were duped by those that let them go full disclosure, with all-out media attention. Other previous whistleblowers didn't had the chance to do so, or their reveals weren't displayed with the same wide scope. The flood of leaks that became a puny trickle has helped mainly to the war between the TLAs, and to put the fear of god on everyone from activists to businessmen to general public over the assumed power of the NSA over the electronic data universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Snowden is about to become even more of a pawn in the USA Vs Putin play, and Greenwald will discover he might have been a little itty bit naive when entering in deals with that guy, and perhaps has already been shown the possible consequences of revealing any more than what is convenient to the narrative.

       Greenwald took a good story and turned it into a business. Snowden took good information and turned it into celebrity.

       His name will live on in the history books. For a lot of people that's a HUGE motivator.

      <p>
       And he'll eventually gain a lot if they ever let him back in the country and basically say he served his time in exile.

       Greenwald was all set to make the next Snowden related revelations when he suddenly reported that the government had raised new points that had to be considered before any further facts could be divulged.
      </p>
      <p>
       . At that point Greenwald basically shut down the planned revelation and reported soft news that made it all go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess from that, that the government made him an offer he couldn't refuse, as in, lead or silver.

       I would suggest that he merely did it to cross all of his 't's and dot all of his 'i's, a sort of journalistic integrity, as he claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often the simplest possibility is the true one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is considerable fervor over the rightness of their disclosures. Many are - not without at least the appearance of merit - claiming that they are disclosing matters which have no bearing whatsoever on anyone's legitimate rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden has explained these disclosures, where he has been a part of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has pointed out some material not relevent to the whistleblowing agenda, he felt, was required for context.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is, apart from similitude of merit, as well legal issues here. For both Greenwald and Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would point out, however, obtaining wide public backing does require sidestepping the issue of doing anything other then whistleblowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many in the wider public would condemn Snowden and Greenwald if they felt they hurt intelligence in general, and were some sort of information anarchists.
