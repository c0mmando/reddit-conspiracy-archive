    <div class="md"><p>Are you the real Laura Poitras, the filmmaker? The woman who interviewed Binney for a New York Times short film? The woman who claimed to have been repeatedly stopped by US border agents upon entry to the US and had her laptop repeatedly searched? I&#39;m genuinely curious. I do respect the journalism she&#39;s done.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t think you are the real &#39;Laura Poitras&#39;. And I think it&#39;s really shitty to ride on a famous journalist&#39;s coattails in order to promulgate views that person opposes. I note that the real Poitras is a founding member of First Look, and long time collaborator of Greenwald, yet digging through your account history it&#39;s clear you repeatedly smear Greenwald as an NSA hack. I don&#39;t think the real Ms. Poitras would do that.</p>

<p>Go ahead and present your views. But do you have to do it under the aegis of someone else&#39;s real identity? </p>

<p>Not funny. Not cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why have such a sarcastic tone with regards to a genuine whistleblower and the journalist who helped make those allegations public? The documents leaked by Greenwald brought not only worldwide attention, but <em>credibility</em> to abuses of power and illegal recording of communications. These documents also gave specifics that you failed to mention. Here&#39;s one leaked presentation that I&#39;ve always found interesting: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/">The Art of Deception.</a></p>

<p>Basically, NSA agents pose as conspiracy theorists on forums, news sites and social media to present a mixture of true and false information, mislead other commenters and discredit certain individuals or organizations. &quot;[Small truth], [small lie], [disregard this person], [check out my own conspiracy theory].&quot;</p>

<p>For instance, imagine if a person made a Reddit account, naming themselves after...let&#39;s say, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">a journalist who works with Snowden and Greenwald</a>. Let&#39;s say they <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/LimitedHangouts/">moderated a subreddit</a> dedicated to discrediting Snowden. And maybe they posted constantly on a popular conspiracy forum trying to discredit him as well.</p>

<p>A truth: They collect metadata. A lie: Every journalist Snowden spoke to is in the pocket of the US government. Message: Disregard Snowden and all of the information that comes from these leaks. Proposed theory: Spying methods have not changed in over a decade, free journalism does not exist, and Snowden is either in on it or incapable of using the internet to release anything himself at this point in time.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not with the NSA, you&#39;re doing a damn good service for them.</p>

<p>whats an NSA agent? you mean systems admin? what about the CIA or FBI? do they do this too? also, did you just learn this in 2013???</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say they moderated a subreddit dedicated to discrediting Snowden. </p>

<p>is that what it is dedicated to? or is it dedicated to spreading the term &quot;limited hangouts&quot; which , is a propaganda technique? </p>

<p>is that all they do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that the UK and now Australia are starting to/already have implement(ed) laws that basically allow for the same level of spying that Snowden revealed. You&#39;re right, nothing has changed. No one claiming limited hangout has denied the truth of what Snowden has brought to attention, however it seems that the NSA is operating in an even broader scope than what he&#39;s stated. UK and Australian governments implement the same unpopular laws after such a controversy, why? They want people to know they&#39;re being watched, we live in a Panopticon.</p>
