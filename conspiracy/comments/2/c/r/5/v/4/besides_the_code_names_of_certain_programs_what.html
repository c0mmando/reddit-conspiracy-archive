       Are you the real Laura Poitras, the filmmaker? The woman who interviewed Binney for a New York Times short film? The woman who claimed to have been repeatedly stopped by US border agents upon entry to the US and had her laptop repeatedly searched? I'm genuinely curious. I do respect the journalism she's done.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I don't think you are the real 'Laura Poitras'. And I think it's really shitty to ride on a famous journalist's coattails in order to promulgate views that person opposes. I note that the real Poitras is a founding member of First Look, and long time collaborator of Greenwald, yet digging through your account history it's clear you repeatedly smear Greenwald as an NSA hack. I don't think the real Ms. Poitras would do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and present your views. But do you have to do it under the aegis of someone else's real identity?

       Why have such a sarcastic tone with regards to a genuine whistleblower and the journalist who helped make those allegations public? The documents leaked by Greenwald brought not only worldwide attention, but
       <em>
        credibility
       </em>
       to abuses of power and illegal recording of communications. These documents also gave specifics that you failed to mention. Here's one leaked presentation that I've always found interesting:
       <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/">
        The Art of Deception.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, NSA agents pose as conspiracy theorists on forums, news sites and social media to present a mixture of true and false information, mislead other commenters and discredit certain individuals or organizations. "[Small truth], [small lie], [disregard this person], [check out my own conspiracy theory]."
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, imagine if a person made a Reddit account, naming themselves after...let's say,
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">
        a journalist who works with Snowden and Greenwald
       </a>
       . Let's say they
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/LimitedHangouts/">
        moderated a subreddit
       </a>
       dedicated to discrediting Snowden. And maybe they posted constantly on a popular conspiracy forum trying to discredit him as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A truth: They collect metadata. A lie: Every journalist Snowden spoke to is in the pocket of the US government. Message: Disregard Snowden and all of the information that comes from these leaks. Proposed theory: Spying methods have not changed in over a decade, free journalism does not exist, and Snowden is either in on it or incapable of using the internet to release anything himself at this point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not with the NSA, you're doing a damn good service for them.

       I find it interesting that the UK and now Australia are starting to/already have implement(ed) laws that basically allow for the same level of spying that Snowden revealed. You're right, nothing has changed. No one claiming limited hangout has denied the truth of what Snowden has brought to attention, however it seems that the NSA is operating in an even broader scope than what he's stated. UK and Australian governments implement the same unpopular laws after such a controversy, why? They want people to know they're being watched, we live in a Panopticon.

       He brought the whole issue front &amp; center to my awareness. I'd thought sure these things were being done here and there, but I'd never considered the scope being so massive.

       Subscribers to this sub are the vast minority in case you've forgotten. Most people walking down the street have no idea what shamrock was. But Snowden did reveal
       <em>
        to them
       </em>
       what exactly the NSA is for. Ten years ago, outside of conspiracy theorists, I doubt anyone really had a good idea of how the NSA operates. Whether he's controlled or not, he has spread a ton of awareness on the topic.

       If that is "their plan" (totally unfalsifiable by the way), I would argue it has backfired to a degree. I think when the average person heard that even they were being spied on, their response was fuck the government (as opposed to altering their behavior as the government had hoped).
      </p>
      <p>
       If your idea is that they only told us we're being watched so that we would "behave" then I think they miscalculated. It certainly hasn't stopped dissent online, if anything it has promoted it.

       I only just woke up like 8-9 months ago. At the time, I pretty much assumed everything ran "as advertised", with some sketchiness around the fringes. Yeah I feel stupid for not catching on sooner, but Greenwald/Snowden helped a lot in waking me up.
      </p>

       Are they limited hangout? Or is one but not the other? I dunno. Seems that way sometimes.

       as of yesterday im now in the belief that snowden and greenwald dont matter, but what matters is that the digital panopticon is real
      </p>
      <p>
       so when thinking of limited hangout and surveillance/4th amm... just think of the message they are sending us and what they want us to think and say (they want us to think less, say less)

       Yeah, I've gone pretty deep since -- I dunno what Snowden/Greenwald could tell me that I don't already know. Still, as a source that corporate media gives air time, they are good for waking up people still deep asleep.
