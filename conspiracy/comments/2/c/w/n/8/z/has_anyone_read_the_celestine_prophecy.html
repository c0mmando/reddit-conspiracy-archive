This book made me think and wonder, more and more people are seeing the truth behind the puppets, but does it seem likely that in time a mass awakening will occur? So many people will have this insight that the world as a whole will have this flow of energy causing it to unravel all at once and having the people finally see the truth in things. When do you think this is likely to happen?</p>

<p>I personally do think it is going to happen within my lifetime at least (im 21, not sure how old you are).</p>

<p>The Latin phrase on the dollar bill &quot;order out of chaos&quot; will play a big role in this. 
When the world is at the pinnacle level of shit storm, some entity, human or non human will come and tell us, humanity, a bunch of bullshit, that people will believe will be &quot;truth&quot;.
Some of these truths will be, that aliens created humans, our religions are about them, etc. al.</p>

<p>The &quot;truth&quot; these things will be telling us will be much akin to &quot;new age&quot; wisdom, which is worth less than a few cents in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you want truth, discover it yourself. Don&#39;t expect anyone or anything to do something you can do for yourself.</p>

<p>Also, if you want truth, study Hermeticism, or alchemy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny, I grew up as a complete athiest materialist, but the more I read an expand my knowledge the more I realize that a lot of these concepts seem to have been given a lot of weight by a lot of very advanced cultures who developed the ideas independently. To me it&#39;s a sign that there is something of substance there. Whether it&#39;s all a collective delusion based on some aspect of human biology or there really is truth there I don&#39;t know, but it does appear to be more than fairy tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally understand what you mean. </p>

<p>For a while I used to be an atheist too, and then I started to see that these people who lived so long ago, back when they didn&#39;t have the means to share the stories they were coming up with with people across the world, who, in ways, were coming up with some of the same stories, but the names were different, and some of the themes were too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s peculiar. Too fucking peculiar to be an &quot;accident&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe it is something so deeply embedded in our psyche that it is even in our chemical makeup as well, our biology. </p>

<p>Truths that will never leave us because they make up who and what we are. 
Collective truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. </p>

<p>As an overall modern interpretation, I would check out the kybalion. It&#39;s a great start. </p>

<p>For applications of the art itself and extended explanation of the philosophy behind it, Franz Bardon&#39;s Initiation into Hermetics is a great book. Lengthy and old it gives solid information. </p>

<p>One of my favorites is the Hermetic and alchemical writings of Paracelsus. </p>

<p>I would also recommend studying plant alchemy, or Spagyrics. </p>

<p>When performing transmutation on your self it is best to have experience with something more subtle than your soul or body, such as plants. </p>

<p>Many people make the mistake of jumping into something larger than them and not knowing the consequences of their actions.
 I was one of them. </p>

<p>There is a fuck ton of information on alchemy. Many sites have full books as PDF files. 
It&#39;s one of, if the not oldest science in human history. 
Many a great man and women have studied it throughout the ages, my favorite being Sir Isaac Newton. He wrote more than alchemy then anything else, since he was nearly obsessed with it. </p>

<p>Be weary if disinformation. The art started in Egypt. Your best bet is to look there first. </p>
