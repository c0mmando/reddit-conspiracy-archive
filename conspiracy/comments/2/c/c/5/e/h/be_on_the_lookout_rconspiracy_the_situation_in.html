        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so, have been watching what has been trending on the popular subs and news agencies recently, and one can start to see a tried and true tactic starting to be installed on Reddit. It is a very easy tactic to see, but this time, watch for this tactic to be bigger and more impactful. Not sure what it is going to be, but rest assured it will be something huge to divert the attention away from Gaza and Israel&#39;s slaughter of those people.</p>

<p>There are actually 2 tactics in play here:</p>

<p>Most people on this sub already know the first tactic, a False Flag operation. Now, keep in mind this next false flag has to be pinned on someone that Americans hate, ie; middle east country, or russia right now, maybe an internet thing, maybe the border crossing situation has a false flag or even a Marijuana Legalization crazy person happens allowing the story line of legalization to run for a couple weeks, who knows.</p>

<p>Second main tactic, diversion (either by false flag, or by news from other countries) You can see a lots of upvoters starting to push news stories with bad press from other countries.  Over the past 2 weeks or so, you can see, some have been ramming the inhuman acts going on in Saudi Arabia (which have been known for many years, but have the same reoccurring theme, they are outdated laws, yeah, we know, that story is getting old) down our throats. Here is the kicker, everyone and their mother knows we won&#39;t mess with Saudi Arabia, they sell their oil to us for cheap and with the US Dollar. So this story will fade really quick. Something bigger has to happen.</p>

<p>So, Diversion by way of False Flag. Some common examples could be; major oil pipeline blown up by terrorists, suicide bomber either middle east or ukraine, a drone captured by some terrorist, heck, maybe even a nuclear warhead goes missing, who knows, it has to be a big enough story to divert attention away from Israel for a couple weeks (we all know how the US Media runs with a story for weeks on end)</p>

<p>Also coming into play here, American Football season, or the NFL, starts in 3-4 weeks, MLB playoffs also start, usually a opportune time for a catastrophe to happen and be run with all through the end of MLB playoffs and world series (Remember those scenes of 9-11 and Boston Strong)</p>

<p>There you go, not saying anything is going to happen, but this is usually the time something like a false flag to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The danger here is, if you recall over a decade ago, GWB&#39;s ratings were sinking like a rock, then 9-11 happened.  Don&#39;t put it past the Likudies to have some horrific plan B that they throw up as a smokescreen to divert attention, as they run away, hide and regroup.  That&#39;s what the exacerbation of tensions with Russia is about, a diversion.   </p>

<p>Look for Ebola quarantining to start happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew i was missing some other big possibility! Yes, the Ebola thing. I&#39;m no scientist, but i would think someone or some authority could stop the Ebola thing from spreading as fast as it has. Maybe someone lets something slip and the Ebola Virus gets out into other countries and spreads way out of control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A massive ebola infection in Africa could impair Chinese business.  The Chinese are controlling much of Africa with business investments and the West mostly has controlled Africa with simple brutish force.  This could be a way to shit out Chinese investment.  Actually I think that this ebola crisis helps a lot of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Events happen in sequence. It&#39;s called &quot;news&quot;. The media are supposed to cover it. They can&#39;t devote all their attention to a single story for weeks or months, when major events are taking place elsewhere. Yes, Gaza will be overshadowed by more recent events, as the atrocities committed by Israel in the past have always been overshadowed and forgotten. That&#39;s the way the media works. That&#39;s the way the public mind works. All you can hope for is that the genocide in Gaza will stick in enough brains that when Israel tries to win back public favor, it will fail.</p>
