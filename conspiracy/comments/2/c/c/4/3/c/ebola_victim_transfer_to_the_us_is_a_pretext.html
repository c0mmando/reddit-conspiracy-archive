    <div class="md"><p>Well shit. I literally just commented about this on another thread pertaining to this virus, and now apparently we&#39;ve already transferred them to the U.S.??</p>

<p>When I read about this I immediately thought what a terrible idea this would be. I&#39;m not a doctor, but I think logically they would want to contain the virus to whatever area it&#39;s already in. That way they could at least not create any risk situations where the virus may potentially have a chance to spread to other countries. If this is true, and they already transferred these 2 people to the states, then we are definitely in trouble. </p>

<p>What&#39;s really fucking creepy is apparently the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes plot line centers around this: <strong>&quot;Starting in 2016, the ALZ-113 virus causes the collapse of human civilization following martial law, civil unrest and the economic collapse of every country in the world.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna sacrifice my rights. They&#39;ll have to forcefully take them from me. And I have friends :-)</p>

<p>But seriously, this could be big. I mean, not the outbreak, Ebola isn&#39;t the best choice (of course, unless it was modified) for such a thing. But, it <strong><em>is</em></strong> perfect for causing panic amongst the populace, all the better to install martial law when everyone is freaking out about an outbreak that doesn&#39;t have much of a chance to being global...</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>It might be possible for them to simply lie and say the outbreak is worse than it is and use that as a cover to destroy political dissent. Spam media outlets saying it is spreading and roll out martial law to stop it, the average person would be too afraid to question it while they were herding everyone wherever they wanted.</p>

<p>Edit: This other post I just read here fits into it as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. People won&#39;t bother congregating if there&#39;s an Ebola outbreak outside. One only has to look at the stores during a hurricane. Everyone stocks up all at once and the shelves get cleaned. Looting happens, and that&#39;s a big enough reason to call martial law. The bonus with using Ebola is that they can quarentine a large region of areas just by drawing up a report that even a handful of people have had Ebola in America, and they need to find all people who has been in contact with them the past few days/weeks, and need to quarenteen these areas to find them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this Ebola outbreak as the start of the depopulation plan. It was a test run in Siera Lione, and quite successful. Now they&#39;re going to spread it internationally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m already waiting for the &quot;mistake&quot; to be made once the patient arrives. Then they will discover it is airborne and it will become a full scale epidemic. I&#39;m sure there are other countries who will take on contaminated patients too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Pianka">Wikipedia</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pianka&#39;s acceptance speech[13] for the 2006 Distinguished Texas Scientist Award from the Texas Academy of Science[14] resulted in a controversy in the popular press when Forrest Mims, vice-chair of the Academy&#39;s section on environmental science, claimed in the Society for Amateur Scientists e-journal The Citizen Scientist that Pianka had &quot;endorsed the elimination of 90 percent of the human population&quot; <strong>through a disease such as an airborne strain of the Ebola virus</strong>.[15] Mims claimed that Pianka said the Earth would not survive unless its population was reduced by 90% suggesting that the planet would be &quot;better off&quot; if the human population were reduced and that a mutant strain of Ebola (which has up to a 90% mortality rate) would be the most efficient means.[16] Mims&#39; affiliate at the Discovery Institute, William Dembski, then informed the Department of Homeland Security that Pianka&#39;s speech may have been intended to foment bioterrorism.[17] This resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewing Pianka in Austin.[18]</p>

<p>That <a href="http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues_2006/2006-04-07/feature1p/index.html">source [16]</a> is dated from 2006.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you also read the part of that wiki which said &quot;<strong>Pianka has stated that Mims took his statements out of context and that he was simply describing what would happen from biological principles alone if present human population trends continue, and that he was not in any way advocating for it to happen.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>And where he explains himself on UT&#39;s website, &quot;<strong>I believe it is only a matter of time until microbes once again assert control over our population, since we are unwilling to control it ourselves. This idea has been espoused by ecologists for at least four decades and is nothing new. People just don&#39;t want to hear it... I do not bear any ill will toward humanity.</strong></p>

<p>But, it is perfect for causing panic amongst the populace, all the better to install martial law when everyone is freaking out about an outbreak that doesn&#39;t have much of a chance to being global...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>It might be possible for them to simply lie and say the outbreak is worse than it is and use that as a cover to destroy political dissent. Spam media outlets saying it is spreading and roll out martial law to stop it, the average person would be too afraid to question it while they were herding everyone wherever they wanted.</p>

<p>Edit: This other post I just read here fits into it as well</p>
