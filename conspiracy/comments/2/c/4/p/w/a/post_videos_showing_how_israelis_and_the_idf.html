       Never in my life have I seen an objective point of view from any pro-Israeli folk. Racists and fascists are never objective.

       Ever met a bunch of israeli's irl?  I have.  I spent 3 years living, working and travelling with dozens, late 80's to early 90's.

       It's mystifying how so many think and act exactly alike.  The same crap coming out of shills post after post is the very same crap that came out of their mouths all those years ago.  Fucking identical.

       They are a nation of brainwashed murderers.  Always have been.  They're very dangerous and the only rational emotion you should recognize is a healthy fear for your life.

       They don't deserve the benefit of doubt.  They have collectively lost the plot.

       Israel should be held up to higher standards with them being a Democracy, and having a substantially better military. The Palestinians have barely killed anybody since this offensive, yet Israel has racked up over a thousand dead, mostly civilians and children.

       I find it appropriate that they're being criticized as they very well fucking deserve it.

       Or did Hamas take 800 human shields? I find it odd they even would when the IDF obviously doesn't give a single fuck.

       I agree. I'm trying to work out the morning grumpies issue. I apologize, I'm not a hater.

       To Israeli's or anyone who I might have offended I'm sorry for calling you cunty. I know people by nature good human beings.

       I feel helpless as an empathetic human being standing by while this indiscriminate killing continues to take place. If it was muslims killing Israeli children I'd say the same shit to them. It's wrong and it doesn't have to be this way.

       Now as anyone that has seen my posts will know, I am not an Israel supporter by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do think we should be careful of how we phrase things. These videos show some deplorable behavior and the power structure in Israel certainly supports this behavior. However that does not show "how Israelis and the IDF really are", it shows a subset of the population. They have quite a lot of support in the populace, but not total support by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like showing police brutality from across America and Abu Ghraib and then saying that it shows "how Americans are".

       Israeli's and the IDF both treat Palestinians like shit. It's a nation full of racists and abuses. That is how they really are; not all of them, but a majority. There are countless videos showing Israeli and IDF abuses, the videos in this thread aren't even the tip of the iceberg.

       If Hamas gave a shit about humans they would not engage in combat intentionally from locations with innocent civilians. In fact they do this knowing that they will die from counter strikes. The hope is to make Israel look evil. So just who is evil? Israel for striking back or Hamas for parking their rocket launcher in the fucking playground.

       Jews and Muslims used to live peacfully together in Palestine and Jerusalem, until the Zionists brutally forced the creation of the current state of Israel which is blasphemous in Judaism, since God nor a messiah did not give them the land to create Israel, and the UK, U.N., nor the Rothschilds are not gods nor messiahs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Dahiya doctrine is a military strategy put forth by the Israeli general Gadi Eizenkot that pertains to asymmetric warfare in an urban setting, in which the army deliberately targets civilian infrastructure, as a means of inducing suffering for the civilian population, thereby establishing deterrence.[1] The doctrine is named after a southern suburb in Beirut with large apartment buildings which were flattened by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the 2006 Lebanon War.[2] Israel has been accused of implementing the strategy during the Gaza War.
       </p>

       Israel breaks ceasefires (2009, 2012, etc.). Hamas did not agree to the latest attempted ceasefire since Israel would probably break it and Israel would not lift apartheid off of Palestine (allowing them to trade internationally and letting Palestinians flee from Palestine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is run by a Zionist Occupied Government that is known for brutality, playing dirty, committing war-crimes, staging false-flags/placing false blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Political/Rothschild) Zionism has only been around for about a century and is a racist and genocidal ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists that claim to be Jewish are hardly Jewish at all (like terrorists claiming to be Muslim). The Zionists hide behind Judaism, in part, to label anyone that calls them out or criticizes them with an anti-cogent conversation ender by calling them "anti-Semites".
      </p>
      <p>
       True Jewish people denounce Zionism and the State of Israel. The current state of Israel goes against Judaism; God nor a messiah did not give the current state of Israel to the Jews, and the UK, U.N., and the Rothschilds are not gods nor messiahs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also "Christian" (faux-Christian) Zionists, such as the Bush Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       This most recent conflict started by the kidnapping and murders of three Israeli teens. The Zionist Occupied Government of Israel was quick to blame Hamas for it. It was latter reveiled that ISIS had claimed responsibility,  and more recently Netanyahu has admitted that Hamas was not responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that some of the rockets fired from Palestine are not actually Hamas but perhaps Mossad or people working for Mossad to frame Hamas for the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the U.N. is not a god nor a messiah, they are also not infallible, they were also created by Big Banking Families such as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.

       Are you saying that the evidence in these clips don't warrant any investigation of crimes against humanity? Since when is it ok for soldiers to arrest a 5 year old kid and many other innocent children. The IDF

       My thought is that Israeli agents are adept at finding out dirty secrets member of the US Congress wouldn't want made public and using that knowledge to blackmail them.  If Israel can't find any dirt they set politicians up.  Does this politician like young boys?  Arrange that somehow and surreptitiously film it.  That's how they control the US Congress, and they probably have something on the president as well.

       You should start asking your government to stop funding Israel then. That will go a long way to stopping this conflict. Stop bitching about 'this sub' and get off your ass and do something.

       I would love the next world power to declare the US a terrorist state and lay waste to people like you. My only sympathies will be to those civilians who will end up caught in the middle of it all. Same goes for the Israeli citizens, and the citizens of Gaza, I feel for them deeply. Hamas and the IDF respectively can burn slowly.

       You are advocating the wiping out of entire nations, you're saying you want Palestine and Israel turned into parking lots; I'm surprised you didn't say a sheet of glass. You're promoting the idea that the people, civilians included, of both of those nations deserve to either die or be misplaced. You're presenting it from the standpoint that you think the almighty American government should be the one to make those decisions globally. The fuck is wrong with you? Are you completely unaware of what your statements make you sound like? Are you aware that the US is NOT the world police and the rest of the world is sick of them acting like it? They're the only god damn nation supporting Israeli action right now! Does that not speak volumes to you!?

       Yes, I would love ignorant people like yourself to bear the brunt of their own attitudes. Maybe then you'll think empathetically for a change, thinking out the consequences of the shit you're so blindly promoting.

       I know what I said, see the part where I said it again? I didn't backpedal, I made it clear that if you think those nations should be laid to waste, so should you. If you're ignorant enough to wish that upon people you've never met, I would love to see you reap what you're promoting. I cannot wait until the American public are the insurgents and you experience first hand what it's like to be a victim of war.

       Jews and Muslims used to live peacfully together in Palestine and Jerusalem, until the Zionists brutally forced the creation of the current state of Israel which is blasphemous in Judaism, since God nor a messiah did not give them the land to create Israel, and the UK, U.N., nor the Rothschilds are not gods nor messiahs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Dahiya doctrine is a military strategy put forth by the Israeli general Gadi Eizenkot that pertains to asymmetric warfare in an urban setting, in which the army deliberately targets civilian infrastructure, as a means of inducing suffering for the civilian population, thereby establishing deterrence.[1] The doctrine is named after a southern suburb in Beirut with large apartment buildings which were flattened by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the 2006 Lebanon War.[2] Israel has been accused of implementing the strategy during the Gaza War.

       Israel breaks ceasefires (2009, 2012, etc.). Hamas did not agree to the latest attempted ceasefire since Israel would probably break it and Israel would not lift apartheid off of Palestine (allowing them to trade internationally and letting Palestinians flee from Palestine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is run by a Zionist Occupied Government that is known for brutality, playing dirty, committing war-crimes, staging false-flags/placing false blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Political/Rothschild) Zionism has only been around for about a century and is a racist and genocidal ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists that claim to be Jewish are hardly Jewish at all (like terrorists claiming to be Muslim). The Zionists hide behind Judaism, in part, to label anyone that calls them out or criticizes them with an anti-cogent conversation ender by calling them "anti-Semites".
      </p>
      <p>
       True Jewish people denounce Zionism and the State of Israel. The current state of Israel goes against Judaism; God nor a messiah did not give the current state of Israel to the Jews, and the UK, U.N., and the Rothschilds are not gods nor messiahs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also "Christian" (faux-Christian) Zionists, such as the Bush Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       This most recent conflict started by the kidnapping and murders of three Israeli teens. The Zionist Occupied Government of Israel was quick to blame Hamas for it. It was latter reveiled that ISIS had claimed responsibility,  and more recently Netanyahu has admitted that Hamas was not responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that some of the rockets fired from Palestine are not actually Hamas but perhaps Mossad or people working for Mossad to frame Hamas for the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the U.N. is not a god nor a messiah, they are also not infallible, they were also created by Big Banking Families such as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.

       OK, this sub is a one sided circle jerk of condemnation of every action performed by the one Democracy in the Middle East that happens to be SURROUNDED by psychotic slavers, beaters, murderers, rapists, and genocidal pedophiles.  Or are you actually able to name one neighbor of Israel who isn't being eaten alive from within with violence?  Maybe if Israel chopped off 50 Pally noggins and jammed them on poles in the middle of down town Tel Aviv you guys wouldn't have anything to say.
The very thread title is structured in an inflammatory way with"Post pictures to show how Jews really are."  It's picture after picture of bomb victims with no context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be wrong, but I swear to Goober that the "picture of a family that was huddled in a stairwell" is a repeat picture form 2009.  You may not remember but it was when the Pallywags were doing a shit job of photo editing the smoke from burning tires to make it look like Israel bombed a maternity ward or something.

       Oh and so you feel better, this is just one account.  It is intended to be used to make comments that are fully expected to get negative karma.  Sometimes its troll, sometimes is vulgar, sometimes it is just to say the opposite of the thread majority just to see how people really react when confronted with something that is different than their own values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try it some time, I recommend it, its interesting and therapeutic.

They are murdering themselves so we don't have to.

       There are corrupt/powerhungry/egotistical officials in every country's army/police force and as well there are civilian extremists in every country.  To lump us all into one category is ridiculous.
