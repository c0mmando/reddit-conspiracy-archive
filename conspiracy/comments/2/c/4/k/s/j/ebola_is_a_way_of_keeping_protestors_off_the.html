       They've timed the release of Ebola for the start of WW3, as Gaza gets burned to the ground and as Russia is provoked into a nuclear war.  Now wherever there are protestors you will see Ebola spontaneously (deliberately) appears and the people of the nation are quarantined, allowing corrupt politicians to continue this apocalyptic agenda
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been so many decades for Ebola to spread, what are the odds of this convenient timing?

       If we look at this Rothschild Guinness advert from just before the outbreak, it has visual clues of what's coming e.g. African's showering, huge fires to burn infected areas, almost every one of their adverts foretells the imminent agenda

       The difference now is we're starting war with a country who can actually hit any area of the planet with weapons of mass destruction, Ebola was saved for the big one.

       Excellent finds Nicktendo86!  Also not far from the Ukraine which could be rather convenient e.g. spraying Ebola on the enemy from the sky to scare them off, people will assume it's a natural spread

        It has "spread" several times before
       </a>
       , so thats nothing mew. Bit what is new is its scope. As of July 20th, about ten days ago, there were over 1200 cases with 673 deaths (giving a 56% mortality). The high amount of cases is unprecedented, bit the fact thst its an outbreak is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless, i have always suspected ebola would eventually be unleashed to the public somehow. Though this current outbreak, in my opinion, seems to be natural. But thats not to say they camt facilitate its spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyways, why do you feel it will ne used against protestors? Is that a theory of yours? Or is there some source you have that made you come to that conclusion?

       All the other outbreaks were much smaller, this is the biggest and it's still growing.  The timing is perfect, as soon as protesters are about to orchestrate a coup, you scare the people back to their houses with an Ebola outbreak in the area i.e. people will then feel compelled to stay away from crowded areas.  Imagine if Ukraine had done this when their government was under siege, they would still have the old leaders in power.  Ebola is a tool, a highly effective one, it can be used to control the people through their fear; Ebola gives the shepherd complete control over his flock.

       I put the emphasis on "can" because just because it is possible doesnt mean it is happening at the moment. I wont deny it, i just wont claim it as fact. Its certainly possible, and yes, it would be terrifyingly efficient as a tool used in such a manner as you propose.

      <p>
       Of an infectious disease?  Throughout human history, just about 100%.  This era is the most free of diseases of all sorts, ever.  We have so few that a disease that has killed ~700 people in 7 months, in africa of all places, makes international headlines and gets everybody's onions in a bunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, if you're concerned about ebola, you'd better not think about the diseases that kill hundreds or thousands of times as many people every year as ebola has since its discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what gave you the idea that anyone cares about protestors this millennium?  That's been designed out of the system for decades now.

        Also what gave you the idea that anyone cares about protestors this millennium? That's been designed out of the system for decades now.

       Look at what the 'protestors' did in Ukraine, look at what the 'protestors' did in Libya.  'Protestors' are sometimes real and other-times being used as a means for regime change, often by another nation.  The US regularly uses this tactic on it's targets, who's to say that Russia wouldn't try the same on a Western nation, especially during a time when trust in the Western leadership is at an all time low.

       I would suggest you research into the history of Ebola, this is by far the worst outbreak, it's never been likely to hit Europe or USA before, but this time is different.

       People will be begging for ebola-free FEMA camps if there's a bad enough outbreak.  Not to mention martial law for the "contaminated zones".

       Also of note is that the lab the recent outbreak stemmed from is funded by George Soros.  Hmm...

       Good point about George Soros, a known Rothschild Agent, this can all be used nicely with Agenda 21 i.e. Ebola will infect all the areas where they don't want people living, they will say it's too dangerous to live there anymore, we will only be allowed to live in Hunger Games-Style UN Habitat Zones

       Still speculative and there are many questions left to answer but
       <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/07/a-link-between-ebola-outbreak-and-us.html">
        here is a source discussing the possible links to Kenema Hospital
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also of note is that one of the head doctors who was "on the front lines fighting the outbreak"
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/29/health/ebola-doctor-dies/">
        died at Kenema Government Hospital
       </a>
       .  He was no small fry either - the article describes him as one of the world leaders in treating hemorrhagic fevers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that both George Soros and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates have provided funding to the hospital/lab.  And we know what their thoughts on "population control" are...

       This...is terrifying. Why drop bombs when they could corrupt the very air we breath. They will then blame it on Iran or Russia. Label the false enemies as biological terrorists, and in an attempt to save the West and her ally (Isreal) they will initiate nuclear warfare. Civilians will be burned alive from nuclear fire, crying tears of blood from Ebola, while the elite hide in their bunkers. Essentially burn earth, and from the ashes they will recreate a new order.
