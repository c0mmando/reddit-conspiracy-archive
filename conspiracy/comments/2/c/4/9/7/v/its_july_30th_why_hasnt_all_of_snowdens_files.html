    <div class="md"><p>If that were the case, why has he, Cryptome founder John Young, allowed people to continue thinking that he was going to release the files. This is the guy that went around claiming that Wikileaks was fake with no evidence at all. </p>

<p>Either he&#39;s the one who&#39;s &quot;fake&quot;, or he&#39;s a crackpot. These tweets about releasing documents sound like a mental patient. And for him to just leave them and their implications hanging out there all this time just confirms my suspicion that Cryptome is bogus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i remember on the 18th, the date the original article stated the info would be released, cryptome made a statement saying something along the lines of they didnt have the files, and the article was misleading as they said they would aid the release of the files if they were provided the files.
this happened in the middle of the gaza/plane saga, i just did a quick search and could not find the statement, though i did find this tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptomeorg/status/483568842698797057">https://twitter.com/Cryptomeorg/status/483568842698797057</a> and a reddit thread on the issue <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/29hz0b/remaining_snowden_docs_will_be_released_to_avert/">http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/29hz0b/remaining_snowden_docs_will_be_released_to_avert/</a></p>

<p>Something i have been thinking is (this in only my opinion) that the cryptome misrepresentation by the original article could have been to prevent people from acting.  bear with me, people were less likely to make a scene over the gaza/plane incidents if they believe the truth is about to be exposed, preventing the impending war.  i do not believe cryptome mislead anyone, i think cryptome was used by a 3rd party as a distraction, without cryptome being aware of it.</p>

<p>i also believe the gaza/plane incidents were both to distract us from the ISIS movement as there has been next to no coverage on ISIS since the gaza/plane incidents happened.</p>

<p>In the weekend after the gaza/plane incidents, ISIS infiltrated syria and killed over 700 people. i saw 1 article on it, as everyone was experiencing burnout from the media frenzy over gaza/planes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-civil-war-bloodiest-48-hours-sees-700-killed-isis-gain-influence-1457596">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-civil-war-bloodiest-48-hours-sees-700-killed-isis-gain-influence-1457596</a></p>

<p>its obvious that isreal and usa are partners in crime, while usa is sanctioning russia for aiding rebels in the ukraine, the usa is funding ISIS, who are achieveing for the usa what the usa tried to achieve with the chemical weapons saga.</p>

<p>and today we see ISIS celebrating with a mass execution
<a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/07/islamic_state_advert.php">http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/07/islamic_state_advert.php</a></p>

<p>isreal does not care about international public opinion, and are happy to test more weapons of war on their palestinian lab rats, and take more land from them, and help usa by distracting the world from isis in the process.</p>

<p>2 birds 1 stone</p>

<p>thats my 2 cents anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t get your hopes up.  Most of what has been &quot;released&quot; from the Snowden files (Wikileaks as well) hasn&#39;t been all that significant.  Most people that actively follow and/or participate in online conspiracies communities have known a bunch of the stuff for years.  </p>

<p>No wars have been started because of the leaks, electrical grids are not going down, satellites aren&#39;t falling out of orbit, and global anarchy isn&#39;t running rampant. The fact is the status quo is still going strong and will probably be able to maintain things the way they are until approximately 2025.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Young never made any promises (at least clear ones) and is generally speaking an extremely cryptic writer/orator and fairly unhinged at the best of times.</p>

<p>Also Cryptome don&#39;t vet their docs so it&#39;s not a question of &#39;holding the info&#39; the dude just never had the docs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more of a case of people who had no idea of JY&#39;s nature taking his comments, parsing them in a manner he didn&#39;t actually mean and running away with them though.</p>

<p>No disrespect to JY or Cryptome as an organisation, just realise the dude is like 90, angry as fuck, and get a flavour for his writing/speaking style to grasp the subtext.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I&#39;m actually right there with you. Heres what I find funny: SOPA was a big deal for most about a year before snowden, blacked out websites, etc. I believe they gauged the reaction and developed a plan to release the &quot;dirty details&quot; threw a mole, snowden. Greenwald I believe isn&#39;t in on it, but really just a pawn who they handed picked for his other reports. </p>

<p>But yeah, I&#39;m kinda tired of them jerking us around with these docs. Cryptome hasn&#39;t responded to me other than just retweeting my question, so at this rate I believe hes in on it. </p>

<p>I know if I had the amount of docs these guys had, the first thing I would do is give it to as many people as possible to keep it circulated. Even if this wasn&#39;t a front, that means that they honestly believe giving MSM these documents to provide to american people was going to work, yet they know first hand that the documents state otherwise.</p>
