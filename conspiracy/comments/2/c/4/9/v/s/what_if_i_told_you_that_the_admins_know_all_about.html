      <p>
       I've communicated with a few of the administrators of Reddit over the past several months using various accounts. I became friendly with them and they were friendly in turn. I made little suggestions to help improve the site, helped point out some spam and other ways to get on their good side. All in all, they seemed to like me quite a bit. I even managed to talk to some of them through other methods besides Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I brought up government content manipulation on Reddit. Astroturfing, shills, whatever you want to call it. We all know it happens, and though I contacted them for months, they never brought up the possibility even once that this was a concern to them. And so, as part of my plan, I brought up the subject myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then these admins who apparently trusted me and some even considered me a friend, immediately turned on me. The moment I said "Hey, you know, there's a lot of astroturfing happening on Reddit, and I think this user and that user may be involved, and you should probably look into it", I found that they were not so friendly anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had the administrators of this very website call me "crazy", tell me "there's nothing to worry about" and "I know (x) and they would never do something like you're suggesting", and some of these users are very well known shills, people who cannot go a day without people accusing them of being so, since we can all see what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do I know next? The admins have cut off all contact with me, shadowbanned all of my accounts, even ones that I had never contacted them with, and even set it up where if I make a new account, I automatically get shadowbanned (which has been trivial to bypass). I've attempted to contact them through Reddit and off-site and not received a single reply in many weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all for what? For telling them that Reddit is being manipulated by the government. I'd never antagonized them - I was nothing but nice to the admins I spoke with, but just one message, trying to expose shills on Reddit got me completely blacklisted. What more proof do you need that Reddit is being controlled by a government agency? That Reddit's admins only allow the content that they want to reach the front page on the front page. This goes deeper than mere mod corruption, which is the common accusation. The mods are corrupt, yes, but the admins are just as bad or even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has been compromised. Or maybe it was compromised from the very beginning. All I know is that it is not safe to discuss the truth here, and we need to find an alternative.

       Dunno about everybody else, but I think it's obvious after poking around for 3 days that Reddit is compromised from the top down. If Alexis Ohanian won't mention the pedophile scandal when discussing Aaron Swartz's death, we have a major problem.

       He had discovered a huge pedophile ring at MIT and was on the verge of exposing it. There have been posts about it in this sub.

       Well...we are all already being tracked on reddit and other sites via adthis. And no, we can't block/stop it. Have a buddy who works for a big 10 tech company.... the tracking of your internet behavior is HIGHLY monitored. Not by the government, but by businesses wanting to collect data. The data can then be sold or given to the gov. by simple request. It's not just where we go....it is what we post and who we talk to. Fucking everything.

       You are naive if you think that works. Hidden browsers or IP spoofing isn't as secure as people think. Every comment you make/website you visit, no matter how you made it, is eventually going to be in a data pool with your name on it. The amount of money corporations are putting in to collect data points on "customers" is obscene. I am horrible at explaining tech side, but when it was explained to me, it basically makes spoofing or privacy software a joke.

       So you are implying that what I meant by not big on the tech stuff was not understanding how day one computer shit works. If you seriously think I was talking about little trackers and cookies, you clearly have no clue what is about to be implemented.  Do you honestly think multi billion dollar corporations with the worlds best programmers aren't a step ahead of you? Please. What I meant by tech side, is that I am horrible at explaining the new measures they are implementing on a programmers level (because I am not a programmer). When I was originally told about it, i said the exact same thing as you are to me....and no, it has very little to do with cookies, caches, trackers, or packets. Very soon, if not already in some cases, nothing is going to stop these places from not only collecting basic data, but everything else you say or do irregardless of any protective measures you take.

       It is not dead. It requires great effort to be anon if you so choose to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best solution is to just go about your normal internet use as a normal person. Let a profile be made and data collected. When you feel the need to become anonymous then jump through the hoops you need to so that you can post anonymously.

       Way too late. Reddit is totally overrun by psy-ops. Billions are spent by governments around the world to shape social media opinions. 
What better target than the self-proclaimed 'front page of the internet'? Any front-page post is seen by infinitely more people than any Facebook post.

       I am sorry, and in no way am i calling you a liar, but i dont take anecdotal evidence as proof. I tend to speculate alot using anecdotal evidence, but i never claim it as proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, there could very well be admin manipulation of content. Even for the governments bidding. But then again, i
       <strong>
        <em>
         never

       </strong>
       go to the front page. Front pages are never organic. No website is excluded from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I browse the "new" section myself, to get all the posts in chronological order, and thus i am able to view/participate in every thread i find interesting, regardless of its popularity. I have never liked the idea of only being presented with ideas/threads that are most popular/manipulated/whatever you believe causes them to be on the front page.
      </p>

       The alternative you speak of, as a solution, is the "new" section. At least imo.
