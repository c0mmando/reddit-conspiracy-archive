<p>What has to be done in your book to prove that he isn&#39;t a racist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in anyone proving they&#39;re not a racist.  That sort of thing is unprovable.  That&#39;s why allegations that someone is a racist are so toxic.  There&#39;s no way to prove otherwise.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very likely that George Zimmerman didn&#39;t think &quot;those niggers&quot; at any point in his life.  (Which, oddly, is the only thing someone can do that <em>everyone</em> will agree is racist.)  I also think he would not have followed me around with his gun if I, a clean cut white guy, had been on the block in my hoodie.</p>

<p>This is because there&#39;s a strong cultural stereotype that specifically associates black men with crime in the U.S. and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15598112">psychologists have found that many people have an unconscious link between the two</a>.</p>

<p>Does that make someone a racist?  I guess it depends on your definition.  If you <em>consciously</em> like black people but <em>unconsciously</em> paint them as criminals, I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re a racist.  But you need to be able to recognize that in yourself and let your conscious mind influence your decision-making.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s clear that George Zimmerman is an idiot in general and I don&#39;t think he had the presence of mind to do that.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR;  Nobody can prove anyone is not a racist.  George might truly not be racist on a conscious level, but probably had subconscious associations about black people that influenced his decision-making.</strong></p>

<p>First your designation is wrong secondly they&#39;re American so their &quot;cultural identifier&quot; wouldn&#39;t be Hispanic (not counting areas taken over) and lastly the 3 you chose are white. White people still exist in central and south America.</p>

<p>perhaps he did have his gun out</p>

<p>You&#39;re speculating. The facts of the case (as heard by the court) do not match your version of the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If i followed a woman in the same way that george followed trayvon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most women who are being followed by a creep are going to go to a safe area. It&#39;s foolish to try to take on some unknown opponent. He might have a gun. He might know kung fu. He might be on meth. If a woman was 100-200 yards from her house and being followed, she&#39;d run home, lock the doors, and call the police. If the guy tackled her or grabbed her then she would be forced to defend herself. But, a pre-emptive strike on an unknown opponent is the worst defense strategy possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, we all need to realize that nobody knows for certain ( other than zimmerman ).  That being said, we also are all aware of the context to which these events happened.</p>

<p>Zimmerman wasn&#39;t just out on a walk, walking casually past trayvon or something like that.  Although, for anybody arguing Zimmerman&#39;s case, that would literally make the pro zimmerman case 1000 times stronger.</p>

<p>No, he was driving... saw a black kid whom he mistook for another black kid he&#39;d seen before and stopped his grocery trip short to stalk a teenage kid.</p>

<p>Then after agreeing to meet with police at a neutral location he apparently decided to do something other than that, and of course other than looking for a street sign.  Because who the fuck needs a street sign when the police are en route to meet you at a location that&#39;s already been established&gt;?</p>

<p>If you read the actual court notes Trayvon realized he was being followed and doubled backed on Zimmerman. When Zimmerman lost track of him he turned around to return to his car and Trayvon confronted him. Words were exchanged, egos collided, and Trayvon attacked Zimmerman. During the struggle Trayvon saw Zimmerman&#39;s gun and went for it. The two struggled for the gun and Zimmerman managed to pull the trigger killing Trayvon while Trayvon was on top of him.</p>

<p>All of this was in the court notes and was decided by the court to be the facts.</p>

<p>And he didn&#39;t just &quot;shoot the kid&quot;. Trayvon was out of sight, Zimmerman was walking back to his car. Then Trayvon came and jumped him from behind and attacked him. When you&#39;re being attacked, and you have a gun on you (which he had every right to have), it&#39;s pretty reasonable to defend yourself with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, I&#39;ve identified myself on official forms as &quot;White-Hispanic&quot; since the late 90&#39;s when they finally had to implement it. Before then you could only choose &quot;white&quot; or &quot;hispanic&quot; which made no sense. This isn&#39;t some new description. The reason why that description came to be was predominantly because of the all the really white Cubans and Puerto Ricans giving birth to really white American citizens.</p>

<p>They were white but, had hispanic heritage. So the term was born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. Hispanic individuals who identify as/pass for white has been a recognized group, at least in sociology, for several decades now. If you look at demographic information about the USA for the past two censuses, most analyses will mention that a considerable amount of people identifying as &quot;white&quot; could also accurately be reported as Latino/Hispanic. Not the majority, of course, but certainly a non-negligible amount. </p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re still free to think the concept is bullshit, but it wasn&#39;t invented by the media solely for the Trayvon case.</p>

<p>Edit: really? Downvoted for correcting mistaken information? White-identifying Hispanic has been a category in sociological texts for decades. Wouldn&#39;t you rather your arguments be factual? </p>

I have always identified myself as White first because I&#39;m freaking white and on top of that an American. This was also during the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s on all the school forms and you could only check White OR Hispanic. It wasn&#39;t till later(late 90&#39;s early 2000&#39;s) that they started separately asking for race where I would select &quot;white&quot; and then heritage where I would select &quot;hispanic&quot;. </p>

<p>People like me are why that White-Hispanic category was created a long time ago. I just looked like your average white American until I opened my mouth and not only spoke perfect English but, perfect Spanish as well.</p>

<p>...&quot;why do we assume things about young black men&quot; thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it quacks like a duck... it probably is a duck. The failure was with Trayvon&#39;s parents. </p>

<p>They needed to beat the crap out of that kid and make him fly right. Too often you read about young black men committing crimes, like armed robbery, and their family says: &quot;He&#39;s really a good boy&quot;. No. When you commit armed robbery, you&#39;re NOT a good boy. If your child is committing armed robbery or running in a gang then you have failed as a parent.</p>

<p>When you see kids starting to fall in with the wrong crowd or exhibiting criminal behavior, they need to be dealt with strongly like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APrV0UOR-lo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APrV0UOR-lo</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black people probably beat their kids more than any other race. If you spent 10 mins of your time looking it up, youll find and overwhelming amount of violent crime offenders were beaten or abused at home.   </p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying is we should teach people not to be violent, by being violent towards them. How does that make sense? All beating your kids does is teach them they can control other people through fear, anger, and violence.  </p>

<p>Such is your case. You just want to take your anger out on someone, not correct behavior. And it&#39;s been studied for a very long time punishment and worsening punishment does little to nothing to correct behavior.  </p>

<p>Not to mention, you weren&#39;t even there, you don&#39;t know either of these people&#39;s life stories, and the dude in the video probably laughed at his dad after, or went back to school to take his anger out on someone cause he can&#39;t even find peace and comfort in his home. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. It teaches them respect, consequences and limitations. I&#39;m not against other methods of punishment as long as it works. Honey is better than vinegar. But, if the nice approach doesn&#39;t work, then you have to find methods that do work. Putting kids on a &quot;time out&quot; or grounding them is why they&#39;re out of control to begin with. Nobody wants to be a parent anymore. They want to be friends with the kid and be seen as the &quot;cool dad&quot; instead of the disciplinarian. Your job as a parent is to set limits and tell the kids &quot;no&quot;. </p>

<p>BTW.... the guy in the video is the kid&#39;s uncle, not his dad. It takes the participation of the ENTIRE family... not just one parent. If every one of the kid&#39;s relatives told him &quot;<em>being in a gang and committing crime is unacceptable</em>&quot; --- and then beat his ass when he didn&#39;t comply -- he would get the message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree all you want but statistics don&#39;t lie. Don&#39;t encourage violence just because you personally believe it&#39;s a solution, even though all sociological and psychological studies say otherwise.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing theory at this point. Facts are facts. The majority of criminals, sex offenders, abusers, and people with violent psychological issues are people who got hit as kids. Just because your parents hit you doesn&#39;t mean you should. And don&#39;t be a lazy ass parent that can&#39;t find any other solutions besides being violent.</p>

<p><strong>Go do some research</strong> and try to enlighten your methods instead of descending into barbarianism that already plagues the black community with high emotionally charged and religious beliefs that violence is an acceptable form of discipline and control.  </p>

<p>The point is that black people in America are associated with crime, by racists and by non-racists who <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15598112">carry unconscious biases due to the prevalence of that theme in our culture</a>.  That&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>I see little evidence that George Zimmerman was truly a racist.  But I&#39;m pretty sure he wouldn&#39;t have followed me around with his gun, suspecting me of being a burglar, if he had seen me on that same block.  What Obama was trying to say is that black men carry a stigma.  Maybe that stigma played no part in the Zimmerman case.  Maybe it did.  But it&#39;s something we should keep in mind whenever a black man is wrongly accused of a crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Treyvon Martin is not 100% innocent here. A lot of the character evidence was suppressed, especially by the media, who continued to paint Zimmerman as a racist. The same with the evidence that Zimmerman was the complete opposite of racist. Treyvon liked to fight and definitely threw the first punch. Zimmerman was getting his ass kicked so he pulled his gun and shot him. Sounds reasonable to me. Especially if Treyvon was smashing his head into the sidewalk. He probably wasn&#39;t thinking to clearly. There was also evidence that Treyvon was involved in some of the burglaries that Zimmerman suspected him of. He had stolen property that came from some of the houses that were burglarized. Didn&#39;t see that evidence on the tv.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Treyvon Martin is not 100% innocent here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trayvon&#39;s innocence is 100% irrelevant to the point I was trying to make.  Unless you&#39;re arguing that Trayvon was actually in the process of robbing or casing a house at the time George Zimmerman called 911, which there is no evidence for, and Zimmerman has never alleged.  He was just &quot;suspicious&quot; because he was walking around in a hoodie and was carrying the stigma of a black man in a hoodie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Treyvon liked to fight and definitely threw the first punch. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I watched almost the entire trial from gavel to gavel and there&#39;s no &quot;definitely&quot; about it.  We have no idea what happened between Trayvon disappearing from George on the street and Trayvon on top of George.  It&#39;s quite likely that Trayvon through the first punch, sure, but it&#39;s far from a definite fact.</p>

<p>Even if he did throw a first punch, we have no idea if Zimmerman had brandished his gun or something, which is an act of force.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not enough evidence to show Zimmerman was guilty of any crime, but he disobeyed 911 and went looking for trouble while carrying a gun.  As a supporter of people carrying guns, I think it&#39;s essential that people who carry guns <em>do not look for trouble or put themselves in situations where they might have to use it</em>.  That&#39;s what Zimmerman did and that&#39;s why I think he&#39;s a moron.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t able to find any support for this other than on conservative blogs.  The Miami Herald reported that Trayvon was found with an assortment of jewelry in his bag from school but there was no conclusive evidence it was stolen, especially from Zimmerman&#39;s neighborhood, and he was never charged with any crime.</p>

<p>As per so many other things, this is all verified via audio recordings whereas anything about trayvon is speculation and totally unverified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self defense would come into play if Zimmerman wasn&#39;t the one actively looking for Trayvon.</p>

<p>He&#39;s on the phone agreeing to meet with police across the street.  He then changes his mind and decided to play police.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not self defense at all.  He should have been waiting for police to arrive at that point.  He knew this in fact, because he had a history of calling the police and never once actively pursued the person because he knew he wasn&#39;t supposed to.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the prosecution over charged Zimmerman.  Mostly racist people donated $500k to him for having killed a black kid who they assumed off the top was a thug, before any information was available or before any images of black kids giving the bird who were not trayvon were released as being trayvon...</p>

<p>Which kinda ties in with how Zimmerman was following him based on thinking him to be another black kid he&#39;d seen in the area.</p>

<p>I think the facts (money discrepency / video footage) prove he illegally initiated a straw purchase for a drug. </p>

<p>As per the rest of your  comments... context is everything.  Zimmerman wasn&#39;t just out for a walk.  He was driving, stopped, left his car, and followed around somebody he thought suspicious enough to report to the police... but then he was not patient enought o wait on the police?</p>

<p>Yup. It helps to know the basic facts of the case. What can I say?</p>

<p>You people!?!? What do you mean by you people? You racist?</p>

<p>Zimmerman was clearly in the right. He had every right to be in his neighborhood. He had every right to leave his car. He had every right to follow trayvon per the dispatcher&#39;s instructions. He had every right to return to his car. There are no laws saying you have to freeze in place and hold your breath after you call 311.</p>

<p>TRAYVON HAD NO RIGHT TO ATTACK HIM. That is illegal. </p>

<p>All you are doing is blaming the victim here(Zimmerman). And it is disgusting. It is no different from the people who blame women for getting raped if they were short skirts.</p>

<p>Note: The police didn&#39;t arrest the painters who called the cops and followed the burglary suspect the week prior in the same neighborhood. That burglary suspect was actually arrested and tried by the same judge as Zimmerman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless the person is attempting to harm you or breaking into your house, it&#39;s the police department&#39;s job at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I would argue that when a 911 dispatcher requests that you stop following someone and tells you police are on the way, the best choice is to stop following that person. martin was not seen doing anything illegal at that point, and martin knew he was being watched, so it&#39;s unlikely that martin would have done anything illegal after that point knowing he was being watched. the point being, it was not illegal to continue to follow martin, but there was no good reason to continue to follow martin, either, and the whole situation would never have happened if zimmerman stopped following martin when the dispatcher requested he do so.</p>

<p>also, the goal of a NW is typically to notify the police and let them take care of it from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, NW covers it&#39;s ass legally by adding the disclaimers you mentioned. Regardless. Zimmerman did nothing illegal by following Trayvon. Are you claiming that walking in the same direction as someone else is illegal? I think not.</p>

<p>Trayvon double backed and jumped Zimmerman and then proceeded to beat him. This is illegal.</p>

<p>Your claim that stand your ground allows someone to shoot someone else for simply being in the same area as another individual is ridiculous. Please provide additional proof that the law is being used to justify this sort of behavior.</p>

<p>You are edging pretty close to a logical fallacy here.</p>

<p>They&#39;re lawyers; that&#39;s their job.  Even so the defense didn&#39;t pounce on that statement of hers as much as they should have, imo.  Trayvon is standing outside his house, it&#39;s dark, raining and the basketball game he wanted to watch was just starting.  Almost a football field away is a creepy ass cracker/stranger with unknown intentions but instead of going inside to safety he went back and &#39;instigated&#39; (your word) the attack with &quot;What are you following me for?&quot;  GZ: &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot;  Trayvon delivers the surprise punch breaking GZ&#39;s nose, the pummeling ensues, GZ calls for help, no one does, and ultimately shoots his attacker.  </p>

<p>Listen, I went into the trial thinking Zimmerman was guilty.  I despised the son of a bitch.  Late 20&#39;s beating the shit out of some kid and then shooting him?  What an asshole.  I remember the first day of the trial it looked like he was having trouble staying awake.  Loser.  And the victim was what?  14?  I&#39;d seen the pictures.  It wasn&#39;t until I heard the testimony and the truth emerged that things turned around.  The State&#39;s own witnesses destroyed their own case; it was over before the defense even started.  And say what you want to about Rachel, she told the truth and for that she&#39;s to be applauded.  </p>

<p>Bottom line, I&#39;d like to know what evidence you heard that I apparently missed for you to think that Zimmerman was guilty.  By way of reference, there was a case in New York where a man saw three teens breaking into his neighbor&#39;s car, he had his girlfriend call 911 and went out to confront them.  One of the teens ultimately charged the neighbor whereas the neighbor shot and killed him.  He was found not guilty by way of self defense even though the kid never touched him.  Search Roderick Scott if you&#39;re interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well shit... if we&#39;re treating Rachel as a genuine witness now : 
&quot;
Jeantel says she heard Martin talking to Zimmerman in the background of the call.
&quot;He said, &#39;Why are you following me for?&#39; And I heard a hard-breathing man say, &#39;What you doing around here?&#39;&quot; said Jeantel.
Jeantel also said she heard a bump from Martin&#39;s headset hitting something and &quot;wet grass sounds.&quot;
&quot;I start hearing a little bit of Trayvon saying, &#39;Get off, get off!&#39;&quot; said Jeantel. &quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine that.  Trayvon asks Zimmerman why he&#39;s following him.  Zimmerman responds by asking what are you doing around here.</p>

<p>THENNNNNN She hears trayvon saying &quot; get off &quot; which sounds like somebody would have been grabbing him.</p>

<p>Of course, with Zimmerman not taking the stand we will never know the truth of the matter.</p>

Not only did they find no evidence of racial bias, they found a preponderance of evidence that he wasn&#39;t racist at all.  They also concluded that his suspicion of Martin <em>was reasonable</em> due to his attire matching that of a local gang.</p>

<p>But even if he did think he was another black person reported in the area, so what?  Are people not allowed to use race in description of people?  Or, if they are given race as a description of a suspect, are they &quot;racially profiling&quot; someone when they use it to be suspicious?

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re saying is nice and all ...  But the fact of the matter is that with his own words, George Zimmerman describes how his suspicians about Trayvon arose.  And that is that he believed him to be another black kid who&#39;d been seen in the area thought to be committing B&amp;Es.</p>

<p>So, with the logic anybody who isn&#39;t retarded will have, you&#39;ll immediately see that he mistook Trayvon for another black kid that night as he set off on what would end in him killing Trayvon.</p>

<p>If Trayvon were white, he wouldn&#39;t have been mistaken for that other black kid, now would he?  This is all documented w\ Zimmerman&#39;s own words available to anybody who cares to look them up.</p>

<p>The hate crime thing would be the most extreme end you could go on the pro Trayvon side so as to suggest Zimmerman was out looking for a black kid to shoot to death.  Nobody is making that case.</p>

<p>And while this alone doesn&#39;t amount to much, none of it does.  But when you piece it all together, you have what the prosecution could well have used to convict Zimmerman something like manslaughter or a lesser murder charge.</p>

<p>So then you agree, Zimmerman did nothing wrong? Surely, if people can walk in neighborhoods they don&#39;t live, Zimmerman was more than free to walk in the neighborhood he did in fact, live in.</p>

<p>Please show me a law outlining this. I think you&#39;ll find there isn&#39;t one. </p>

<p>Think of the chaos this law would cause. I could kill 10 soccer moms in my neighborhood on an average dog walk if this were the case. If they follow me I&#39;m allowed to murder them like Trayvon tried to do to Zimmerman right?</p>

<p>In fact, a burglar was caught by police in the exact same neighborhood a few weeks prior to the trayvon incident because some painters/contractors followed someone around relaying the suspect&#39;s location to police.</p>

<p>I notice police did not arrest the painters as well. That would have been crazy.</p>

<p>On top of that, the dispatcher told him to follow Trayvon.(The dispatcher testified to this at the trial.) None of that really matters though because Trayvon attacked Zimmerman as he was returning to his truck long after Zimmerman had completely lost sight of Trayvon.</p>

<p>You seem to have misread the facts of the case. Nobody was &quot;playing police&quot;. Zimmerman was not wearing a police uniform. He did not identify himself as being a police officer. He didn&#39;t have an exposed weapon (it was concealed).</p>

<p>They were both in a public place. When you&#39;re in public, you have no legal expectation to privacy. If we&#39;re both in public, I can follow you around and stare at you all I want. I can even take pictures of you. If you don&#39;t like it you can leave the public place or you can stare back and take pictures of me. But, you can&#39;t physically hit a person because of some perceived injustice. Once you cross that line and physically touch someone you&#39;ve committed a crime.</p>

<p>Trayvon should have gone to his house, gone inside, and locked the door. If he was afraid of Zimmerman, then he should have called the police. But, Zimmerman gave no indication that he was trying to physically stop Martin. He never touched him. He wasn&#39;t blocking his path. All he was doing was observing him from a distance. </p>

My brother is 26 and the nicest person in the world but he knows how to stand up for himself, and I guarantee if someone was following him, he would try to run (which Trayvon did). Trayvon&#39;s girlfriend said on the phone that he noticed Zimmerman following him so he put his hoodie on, and then said he would walk fast but not run. She said he got scared and eventually started to run and then stopped once he thought he had escaped, but then Zimmerman showed up again. So Trayvon tried to get away from a creep and then realized the creep was in fact following him, for sure. So call the cops and wait 10 minutes for them to get there when you&#39;re running around in backyards and might not even be able to describe where you are? No. My brother would have asked him what was going on also. This crazy man that you know nothing about is following you...so run until you get to your house and he knows exactly where you live? Oh ok, sounds safe. Any guy I know who thinks they can handle themselves (and then was actually unable to escape him) would have done the same thing, asked him what was going on.

<p>If it were a woman bashing in Zimmerman&#39;s head before being shot, it would be presumed she was afraid she was gonna be raped. Especially if she ran and called a male figure. But black males are big and athletic, he played football! (As if that makes him tough)</p>

<p>Ambushed? Really? Are you suggesting Trayvon ran away in order to lure Zimmerman into a trap? You are delusional if you believe that, Trayvon may have beat the shit out of Z but don&#39;t make it sound like he&#39;s some savage out to kill somebody, he was scared, so he ran away.  He was being followed at night by a man in a truck imagine this was your sister and not just some black kid. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>She said specifically that Trayvon told her he was by his house not at his house. They are in different cities so the distance is ambiguous. And the four minutes could have been spent holding out after he lost Z. Why would he run home in the rain with his tea and skittles, turn around once he got there, bringing his snacks and come back to man he was seemingly afraid of enough to run from even though he didn&#39;t commit a crime. Explain a scenario where that makes since.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Based on the testimony of the killer of course. How do we know Z wasn&#39;t extremely confrontational? Are we to assume Zimmerman just walked up to Trayvon and said &quot;hi buddy&quot;? </p>

<p>And? He called her to chat with her. He didn&#39;t call her for help.</p>

<p>Yes he did... what are you talking about you seem biased now. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>She said she thought he should run, he said he would just walk fast but eventually he began running.</p>

<p>Why do you think Trayvon ran?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeantel knew Trayvon was the attacker. She thought it was Trayvon&#39;s victim (George Zimmerman) who was in danger, while Trayvon would be fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea maybe that is true, I only take issue with this racist line of thinking that this 17 y/o wasn&#39;t running for his life, no he was running so he could find a way to ambush Zimmerman and  kill him. This seems to be what you think and its fucking racist . If this were a 17 y/o white girl and she ended up kicking his ass people would understand the threat she must have felt. But hes a black guy he must be a thug and a violent one. The racist line of thinking was &quot;But black males are strong and athletic.&quot;(he played football and liked fighting! As if that makes him tough or different from any other male his age) </p>

<p>I think T was scared, ran, than crossed paths with the overzealous Z and Trayvon, knowing he had been followed by this man attacks him after a short confrontation. He should not have did this obviously but in my mind he&#39;s fighting a stalker whom may or may not have flashed his gun considering the incidents that have happened  since (pulling his gun on multiple people for no reason and getting arrested) . I think his head wounds are massively exxagerated, he told the court he had his head banged over 40 times and that&#39;s clearly a lie. Trayvon probably knocked him out mounted him when  Z pulled a gun and tray  starts banging his head and is shot. But I find it strange how Zimmerman didn&#39;t have blood on his shirt considering he blew a hole through someones heart laying on top of him... </p>

<p>Zimmerman is a thug he attacked an undercover police officer, he pulled guns on people multiple times for NO reason, his niece told CNN he molested her for years. Zimmerman should have never been following kids around assuming they are doing something wrong. Trayvon would be alive today if he hadn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The prosecution in the case was ridiculously bad. The worse ive ever heard of. If you consider the possibility that he was afraid it makes sense. Why would he lead this man who&#39;s been following him do o his home instead turning a corner and bidding for a minute. He didn&#39;t go home because he was being stalked. I think this makes more sense than saying he didn&#39;t gp home because he wanted to lure Zimmerman into a trap. That&#39;s just silly dude no one runs away from a car at night going they will chase you if he wanted to kick Zimmerman&#39;s ass why would run? ANSWER THAT!</p>

<p>Yes Trayvons violent and so I Zimmerman, thats why this all happened two people on the edged confronted each other. Zimmerman has a larger record and he&#39;s aimed guns at about 4 people in the last years he&#39;s a power hungry guy who needs anger management. </p>

<p>Gotta stop you there his injuries were soo exaggerated by Zimmerman himself. he lost but it was in no way a Savage beating lmao I can&#39;t believe people sometimes. If he had slammed his head on the curb 40+ times like he claimed Zimmerman would be dead. He had a cut on his head and a bloody nose.</p>

<p>Trayvon overreacted but my argument is it was understandable. But he did not know Zimmerman was calling the Police they weren&#39;t staring at each other Zimmerman was watching him. I would be happy of they gave him a few years at least. </p>

<p>I have another question,  considering Zimmerman&#39;s history before and after this event would you call him prone to violence or outbursts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sympathetic to your point and this host&#39;s conclusion, but I don&#39;t admire the way he went about getting there.</p>

<p>Lambasts the population and the media for speculation regarding Zimmerman but uses it at will when it helps illustrate a point against the &quot;facade&quot; of Martin. The skittles and watermelon drink bit was interesting...plausible, but otherwise completely irrelevant. &quot;Mixed Martial Arts&quot; moves he performed on Zimmerman, &quot;tough talk&quot; on the internet. He works hard to craft a narrative while criticizing others that have done the same.</p>

<p>He complains about the tactics the media used against Zimmerman while using many of those same tactics against Martin. Hyperbolic , overblown, and at certain parts, ridiculous. Again, I don&#39;t begrudge his defense of Zimmerman, but promoting a 17 year old as being mature, tough, and even vicious by characterizing aspects of his life and personality doesn&#39;t lessen any injustices this guy may feel were carried out against Zimmerman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the community needs to be involved in solving their own problems too. Bill Cosby has <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/cosby.asp">pointed this out</a>. So has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3PJF0YE-x4">Chris Rock</a> (...in a round about sort of way). There are YouTube videos of people taking a stand and saying &quot;no more&quot; in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APrV0UOR-lo">their own family</a>. </p>

<p>People need to stand up for decency and values and say &quot;enough is enough&quot;. It shouldn&#39;t be tolerated. It shouldn&#39;t be accepted. It&#39;s a complex set of problems and throwing money at it will only go so far. The best thing we can spend money on is education. The rest requires an active and engaged community who stands up for what they believe in. </p>

<p>If it were me, I&#39;d change the laws regarding small businesses and I&#39;d teach entrepreneurship in schools. Make it easy for anyone to start their own business and then give them training and inspiration for how to do it. If you removed the barriers to entry, you&#39;d be surprised at the level of creativity that you&#39;d see. You have to be pretty entrepreneurial to sell drugs. The kids are smart and capable. But, they don&#39;t have the tools, resources, or training to run legitimate businesses. Creating jobs through entrepreneurship is probably one of the best things you could do to reduce crime and poverty.</p>

<p>&quot;Zimmerman provided a statement claiming he acted in self-defense which at the time was supported by physical evidence and testimony,&quot; Lee wrote in a memo posted on the city&#39;s website. &quot;By Florida Statute, law enforcement was PROHIBITED from making an arrest based of the facts and circumstances they had at the time.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A killing that is excusable or was committed by the use of justifiable deadly force is lawful.</p>

<p>If you find Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, you will then consider the circumstances surrounding the killing in deciding if the killing was Murder in the Second Degree or was Manslaughter, or whether the killing was excusable or resulted from justifiable use of deadly force.</p>

<p>JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE</p>

<p>The killing of a human being is justifiable and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the attempted killing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In deciding whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you must judge him by the circumstances by which he was surrounded at the time the force was used. The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual; however, to justify the use of deadly force, the appearance of danger must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person under the same circumstances would have believed that the danger could be avoided only through the use of that force. Based upon appearances, George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you brought us to this point, because the answer in incredibly simple here. It is this:</p>

<p><em>Stand your ground law was not invoked as a defense by zimmerman.</em></p>

<p>That is the <em>one simple fact</em> why SYG has nothing to do with this case.</p>

<p>You are quoting <em>jury instructions,</em> not <em>the substance of zimmermans actual defense.</em></p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t <em>my claim</em>, this is simply fact and the truth. If you still can&#39;t comprehend this, then I truly am sorry. You have been entirely misled and misinformed. But I don&#39;t fault for this however, as discussed above, the American state media apparatus was unified in perpetuating this disinformation and &quot;outrage&quot; narrative. To stir up public outrage against an entirely unrelated law that <em>serves the best interests of you, me, and all of our fellow citizens.</em> Self defense is a human right, and immensely worthy of defending.</p>

<p>I am largely ignorant of the Trayvon-Zimmerman case, except from what I&#39;ve heard off the internet. Currently, I feel like Zimmerman should have been found guilty of murder, because he simply suspicious of a black kid following him. The only time- <em>I believe</em> -you can kill someone, is when your life (or another&#39;s) is clearly being threatened. <strong>Logically</strong>, that is the <em>only</em> time you should ever kill someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just finished typing my post and it&#39;s way too long. </p>

<p>tl;dr - Zimmerman was in fear of imminent death or serious injury when he shot and killed Martin. Because of this, <strong>his use of deadly force was legally justified</strong>. &quot;Murder&quot; is basically legally defined as the unlawful killing of a person. Since Zimmerman&#39;s killing of Martin was not unlawful, he is not guilty of murder, as decided by the courts.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll explain. Hope you&#39;re ready for some reading!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get some background information. Zimmerman had lived in that community for several years. He would call the police (non-emergency number) often to report things, mainly simple things like to report potholes or noise disturbances, but in the year prior to the shooting, he started calling in to report suspicious people. This makes sense because in the year prior to the shooting there had been nearly two-dozen reported cases of burglary and theft, an increase over years prior. There were also dozens of unreported cases of attempted break-ins. In each of his calls to the police, he never once brought up the person&#39;s race unless prompted by the dispatcher. </p>

<p>In the weeks prior to the incident, Zimmerman spotted a suspicious person whom he believed was scoping out houses to burgle (he was walking up to empty houses and looking into the windows). By the time the police had arrived, the person had already run away. A few days later, residents saw a group of black teens acting suspiciously in front of a house, the same house which was later that day found to have been burglarized with a laptop and jewelry taken. The very next day, the police stopped and searched the backpack of a black teen and found the laptop which was stolen from the house mentioned above. And guess what? That teen with the stolen laptop was the same person that Zimmerman called the police on earlier that week (but had fled). </p>

<p><em>So we&#39;ve established that Zimmerman&#39;s neighborhood recently had seen a significant increase in burglaries, thefts, and attempted break-ins. We&#39;ve also established that very recently, Zimmerman successfully spotted a suspicious (black) teen, who fled before police arrived, who was found with stolen property a few days later.</em> </p>

<p>Zimmerman legally had been carrying his pistol for several years. He originally purchased and got licensed, at least partially in response to a few incidences where a loose pit bull in the neighborhood had acted aggressively towards him and his wife, in which an animal control officer suggested that he get a gun, as this would be more effective than pepper spray or other means of defense.</p>

<p>On the night of the shooting, Zimmerman noticed a suspicious person (Martin) walking in the neighborhood. He called the non-emergency police number again. Zimmerman basically said that the suspicious person was just walking/looking at houses in the rain and that he didn&#39;t look right. As usual, he didn&#39;t mention Martin&#39;s race until the dispatcher asked him. Martin noticed Zimmerman and approached him with his hand in his waistband, and then started running away. Zimmerman mentioned to dispatch that &quot;they always get away&quot; - probably in reference to at least the incident a few weeks prior. </p>

<p>So, dispatch asks him where Martin is running, where he is headed to. Zimmerman is following Martin, trying to see where he is running to. Dispatch says &quot;we don&#39;t need you to do that (follow him)&quot;. After coordinating with dispatch regarding where the police will meet him, the call ends. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where it gets fuzzy (the above are from police records and the recording of the dispatch call). </p>

<p>Several people call 911 after hearing shouting/fighting, followed by a man screaming for help multiple times, followed by a gunshot. Witnesses saw two figures fighting on the ground, with one person on his back being pummeled by the man on top. Multiple witnesses reported that a man wearing red was on the bottom. Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket, Martin was wearing a black sweatshirt. </p>

<p>When police arrive, Martin was dead, face down on the grass. Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head, and also had swelling/damage to his face and nose. Zimmerman&#39;s back was wet and covered with grass. In initial statements to the police, he mentioned that he was screaming for help but no one came. </p>

<p><em>So, putting the witness reports and the evidence together, it is reasonable to believe that Zimmerman ended up on his back in the grass with Martin on top of him, getting beaten while screaming for help.</em> </p>

<p>Now, some people blindly claim that Zimmerman attacked Martin initially, which they believe disqualifies Zimmerman from being able to use self-defense as a reason for the shooting. They are wrong.</p>

<p><em>2012 776.041 Use of force by aggressor:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The justification described in the preceding sections of this chapter is not available to a person who</strong>:</p>

<p>(1) Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the commission of, a forcible felony; or</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself, unless</strong>:</p>

<p>(a) <strong>Such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he or she has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant</strong>; or</p>

<p>(b) In good faith, the person withdraws from physical contact with the assailant and indicates clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to withdraw and terminate the use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes the use of force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people claim that Zimmerman is racist against blacks. Zimmerman went to prom/dances with a black girl, started a business with a black friend, and protested at a demonstration for the civil rights of a black homeless man. </p>

<p>Really, it comes down to this question. At the moment that Zimmerman shot and killed Martin, is it reasonable to believe that he was in fear of death or serious bodily harm? Yes? Well, that is reasonable doubt so he is not guilty. No? Then present tangible evidence to the contrary (no one has been able to). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, thats why i acknowledged that in my comment above. And I didn&#39;t matter that Zimmerman wasn&#39;t &quot;white&quot;. To those pushing the agendas and the narratives - he was &quot;white enough.&quot;</p>

<p>And then by following the trail back to those pushing the prosecution of Zimmerman - tell me again who the real racists are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are a lot of factors. </p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that the trayvon case preceded it. the choking incident may be similar, but we&#39;ve already gone through something like it before. the incident loses its news appeal that way (and our ability to emphatize). </li>
<li>martin was a minor. the other guy wasn&#39;t. (i might be wrong on TM being a minor though)</li>
<li>a gun was not used. that adds another layer for people to argue (gun control. add to that the whole &#39;stand your ground&#39; debate. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trayvon Martin case was in essence a distraction from the Bradley Manning wikileaks trial. The media wanted people to believe that a young child was murdered in cold blood. Other sources dug a little deeper and they showed him as wannabe thug with a history of violence and drug use. Fox and CNN portrait him as a victim of hate, they even posted pictures of him when he was twelve, when in fact he was 17. But lets face the reality here this story was used as a veil and the real story was unfolding behind closed doors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not trained LEO though. There are less lethal methods that could have been taken. He could have used his night stick and given a beat down. He could have used his taser and zapped the fuck out of him. Instead he chose death and went for the gun first. The problem is too many of these power-hungry thugs are choosing the LAST RESORT option as the first resort which is completely unacceptable. Off duty or not he made the choice to carry lethal weapon instead of less-lethal and chose to use that lethal weapon despite being no need for it. You are the idiot and are a useless contribution to society. Thinking like yours is the problem and I am very thankful you are not a LEO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and decided to give a real answer.</p>

<p>In 2012 the FBI reported 14,661 murders (this includes manslaughter). This averages just over 40 murders a day or a murder an hour. The real question is: why are some murders given more air time than others?</p>

<p>Most murders aren&#39;t too special/interesting and people don&#39;t care unless they live nearby. The goal of a news outlet is to give people content they care about. Very few want BREAKING NEWS: Another American murdered every hour.</p>

<p>Murders by on-duty cops are a little more interesting. The murder rate by cops is only 500/year (just over 1.33 per day or one every 18 hours). It&#39;s more important but news outlets still aren&#39;t going to have a daily &quot;Another officer kills citizen&quot; story.</p>

<p>If you have a video with proof that clearly shows something unjust happened, you&#39;re in a situation that happens once every few months. It&#39;s enough to mention but not enough to make a big story. Most people will be more interested in Israel.</p>

<p>The Zimmerman case wasn&#39;t just another murder. It brought into question the already controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, giving both sides examples to argue. Plus add the fact that it was a older guy who was big into the community killing a younger kid. Plus add the fact it brought racial discrimination into the case. Add the fact it wasn&#39;t -00% clear what happened. Add the fact it was a slow news week making this one of the more important national events that happened at the time.</p>

<p>TL;DR: how relevant a story is and how much people care is directly proportional to news coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you need to do is look at how the media handled the Zimmerman affair to realize how orchestrated, how choreographed, it is. Almost the entire corporate media jumped on the Zimmerman case and they all took the same line, even though that line was manifestly unjust. Then they tried to push that line by distorting and misrepresenting the facts (showing Martin as a 13-year-old, editing the audio tape of Zimmerman&#39;s comments, avoiding comment on Martin&#39;s criminal history). Anyone who saw the outrageous abuse of the press in the Zimmerman case doesn&#39;t need to ask if the media is manipulating the public.</p>

Zimmerman isn&#39;t even white, but the press made him white to make a more controversial story. No one cares about white on white violence, or black on white violence.  White on black violence is a blockbuster.   Mexican violence doesn&#39;t even register at all against anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend reading The Iron Heel by Jack London Pub 1906</p>

<p>Here is a line from the book, this isn&#39;t the main point at all but just one piece to the story. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look up the reporters that kept Jackson&#39;s case out of the papers, and the editors that run the papers. You will find them all slaves of the machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may click in your heads that over 100 years ago the same sort of control occurred and 100s before that. This work was yet just another warning.</p>

<p>Free to read legally - <a href="http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/IronHeel/toc.html">http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/IronHeel/toc.html</a></p>

<p>When I read this I literally got chills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This, then, is our answer. We have no words to waste on you. When you reach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease, we will show you what strength is. In roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns will our answer be couched. We willl grind you revolutionists down under our heel, and we shall walk upon your faces. The world is ours. we are its lords, and ours it shall remain. As for the host of labour, it has been in the dirt since history began. And in the dirt shall it remain so long as I and mine and those that come after us have power. There is the word. It is the king of words. Power. Not God not mammon but Power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly the media controls everybody. Right now where I live a girl found a wallet with 2000 dollars cash in it at a local Texas Roadhouse. She reported like every employee should do. The owner got it back, and tipped the girl 20 dollars for that. But it got in the newspaper and the news channel. And the media was making this guy sound cheap. So now she is getting money from people because they thought the man was cheap an didn&#39;t give her enough. I personally think that she didn&#39;t really do it because she thought it was the right thing to do, I think she did it because it&#39;s most likely a policy to report lost things. And if she tried to pocket it, and the wallet was reported lost by the man himself. And they looked at the footage from cameras she would be seen pocketing the cash. So then she would be fired. But anyways, sorry for my ranting on.. My point is that the media has control over people&#39;s minds. They only have things on the news that are controversial. Like you hear about a murder on the news. But most of the time it&#39;s only on the news for like 5 mins then done. But like the Zimmerman case, it was controversial, so people would watch it non-stop </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the guy should have been killed. But, the place to fight it is in court. He should have just cooperated with the arresting officers. Then, he should have called a lawyer and sued the crap out of the officers and the police department. The officers are a bunch of goons. They aren&#39;t going to listen to you. Resisting them or trying to protest only escalates the violence. Ideally, the police should be smart and reasonable people. But, most of them aren&#39;t. They tend to be drug and alcohol abusers who have violent tendencies, poor impulse control, anger management issues, and low IQs. They are hired muscle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it is not a sexy news title, it dosent sell. People know that Police have killed people in the past during arrest, whether it be misconduct or at the fault of the party being arrested. However, a big bad white man who shoots a poor little innocent black child is something that people eat up. And not to bring racism into this, but the majority of people who tend to sensationalize news coverage are uneducated. The majority of uneducated are blacks and other minorities. It is simple marketing, if you want people to eat something up then give them something simple to chew. There is no video evidence of the trayvon shooting so it is disputable, however this arrest was on film and it look standard to every other police misconduct video. The truth hurts, but it is true that nobody gives a shit about a fat old black man but a young innocent child with their life ahead of them is a different sales pitch. </p>

<p>TL;DR Black people victimizing themselves are why our society is fucked, and white people are labeled as &quot;racists&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing anybody should take away from the George Zimmerman case is how broken our justice system is.</p>

<p>If George Zimmerman didn&#39;t have people donating $500,000+ to him for having killed a black kid, who knows how the case would have been.</p>

<p>They probably over charged him w\ murder... But they probably would have had no trouble convicting of a lesser offense like negligent homicide or manslaughter.</p>

<p>At the end of the trial, it was a joke.  The prosecution repeatedly showing witnesses pictures of Zimmerman&#39;s head and pointing to things you couldn&#39;t tell were injuries and getting people to give them answers that only further confused the situation.</p>

<p>They put the victim of the case on trial, which should really sicken anybody actually believes in our justice system.</p>

<p>Most people, 96% if I&#39;m not mistaken in our justice system plea out to charges.  What does that mean?  It means they&#39;re put in a position where they&#39;re made to believe if they proceed with fighting charges, that they&#39;ll be locked up for a much longer period of time.  SO, 96% of people settle for not going down that road.</p>

<p>Zimmerman was one of these 4% who could afford legal defense 96% of the population can&#39;t afford if facing criminal charges.</p>

<p>The system is a farce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically an extremely high regressive tax which occasionally involves brutal beatings, summary execution, theft, destruction of property, rape, psychological torture of jail/prison, and forced labor enforced by uneducated, racist swine sanctioned by corporate owned, racist, filthy rich sociopaths paid by our money through both taxes and consumption of corporate goods and services. Basically, fascism, totalitarianism, feudalism never died. It just learned new disguises.</p>

<p>Though I disagree with you about the poor. The free representation is worthless and the &quot;crimes&quot; they commit are either trivial, non-violent, or a result of the fascist and racist nature of the government. Not saying murderers, rapists, etc. don&#39;t deserved punishment. Just that some of the other &quot;criminals&quot; aren&#39;t actually criminals at all. Others lacked the education and social necessities to know better. And others may have their backs against the wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the point I was trying to get across is that there&#39;s so many cases that they literally could not take to a trial.   No evidence, bad evidence.. you name it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the game comes in.  You have to take off work to come to a 8:30 court date.  Sit there for 2 hours, before somebody tells you it&#39;s being reset because there really wasn&#39;t anything even planned to happen that day anyhow aside from get you to miss a day of work and put stress on you to do what they want at the next date.</p>

<p>They were just summoning you to court to give you a taste and fuck with you.  </p>

<p>Then you goto court the next time around and find out you can either pay your lawyer thousands of dollars you don&#39;t have, admit guilt to a crime that they can&#39;t convict you of in a trial, or go on probation in order to get the case off your record and in the process let them pad their books to make it look like they&#39;re doing their job.</p>

<p>Per my original comments in the thread, had they not been rushed into pressing such charges and properly charged him, they easily would have gotten a lesser conviction. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because normal citizens don&#39;t stop what they&#39;re doing to follow around minors, and then shoot to kill when they apparently are too fucking soft to defend themselves against a minor who for all intents and purposes could be viewed as defending himself against a stranger in the night following him to do god knows what.</p>

<p>haha you don&#39;t know how charges work!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Per my original comments in the thread, had they not been rushed into pressing such charges and properly charged him, they easily would have gotten a lesser conviction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Per my original comments in the thread, they had a bulllshit case. They had no evidence. They only charged him for political reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s because normal citizens don&#39;t stop what they&#39;re doing to follow around minors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they do. It happened literally the week or two before. The burglar was arrested because he didn&#39;t try to murder the people following him on the phone with cops.</p>

<p>haha you don&#39;t know what defending means</p>

<p>He was charged with manslaughter and found not guilty. </p>

<p>So not only do you not know what drink Trayvon had on him, but you don&#39;t know about the lesser included charges.</p>

<p>Did you know they tried to charge Zimmerman with 3rd degree murder based on child abuse?</p>

<p>This is news to me! Who did Zimmerman think Trayvon was? What makes you think he knew he was black when he spotted Trayvon? Have you heard the NEN call?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-Calls police to report the suspicious person ( he had done this before. Never before had he left his vehicle to tail the person on foot )</p>

<p>Not illegal to call police. Not illegal to tail people on foot in your own neighborhood.</p>

<p>Is it illegal to change your mind when talking to NEN dispatchers? No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>police were en route, he was not looking for a street sign after having just agreed to meet police at a specific location away from where the alteration would take place.</p>

<p>What makes you say this?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This statement proves you have no idea what happened that night.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The logic does not apply to Zimmerman&#39;s actions because Zimmerman didn&#39;t start a physical confrontation/fight. Trayvon did.</p>

<p>Trayvon knew Zimmerman had no idea where he was. The fact that he didn&#39;t go home proves he had bad motives. It also proves he started the fight because he stopped heading home to double back and attack Zimmerman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Zimmerman, having lost Trayvon was attempting to return to his vehicle and meet police.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious you have no interest in understanding the world we all live in.  One where people agree to meet police and then claim to be looking for street signs to tell police where they are in their own neighborhood...  </p>

<p>Really.. come on.  You and many other people have this idea that you think you know what happened.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m telling you is I don&#39;t know what happened... and you don&#39;t know what happened.</p>

<p>George Zimmerman does... and he plead the fifth to prevent from cross examination resulting in him being found guilty.</p>

<p>Most people in his situation don&#39;t have people donating 500k to them for killing a black kid.   An average person in his situation with no media coverage would at the end of the day plead their case, because they&#39;d be rail roaded into a plea deal and threatened with harsh prison time if they dont.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is all about really.  Our fucked up justice system.  If you&#39;re rich, you get off.  If you&#39;re poor, you get a lawyer appointed to you.  If you&#39;re in the middle, you get nothing.  </p>

<p>Oh come on that is the worst argument ever. No legal expert in the country suggested he testify. There was absolutely no case against him. No reason for him to testify and let those &quot;sneaky lawyers&quot; trip him up into saying something he didn&#39;t mean to.</p>

<p>An average person in his situation with no media coverage wouldn&#39;t have been charged.</p>

<p>Much like how Zimmerman wasn&#39;t charged until the Martin Family got a multi-million dollar PR/Media consultant involved.</p>

<p>The media rail roaded him into a kangaroo court joke of a trial. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Our fucked up justice system where if someone attacks you like Trayvon and his parents have enough rich friends (Sharpton, Ryan Julison, Crump) they can get the state to throw you in jail and cost you 500k$ in legal fees. It&#39;s sick.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When the state spends millions of dollars to convict you of a crime you didn&#39;t commit it costs a lot of money to defend yourself.</p>

<p>That is a problem.</p>

<p>Same w\ Zimmerman.  and it&#39;s even more funny because the people who come out all pro 5th amendment are the same ones who will spout bullshit like &quot; Well, if you have nothing to hide ... &quot; or in the IRS case, call shenanigans when this woman takes the fifth.</p>

<p>If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, <strong>he had no duty to retreat</strong> and <strong>had the right to stand his ground</strong> and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</p>
