        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You know, it&#39;s 2014. We&#39;ve got the ability to communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world in real time. Heck, you can have face to face video chats with them if you want. </p>

<p>We know more about science than ever before. Our ability to produce food, transport food, cure disease, prevent disease, is light years ahead of any other period in history. </p>

<p>And yet, despite all these advancements, people&#39;s standard of living is declining. The average life expectancy is starting to decline. Wars are breaking out all over the planet. </p>

<p>When we SHOULD be living in the most amazing glorious time of human history - where we have the means and knowledge to drastically reduce human suffering - we are instead living in one of the most turbulent times. </p>

<p>How can anyone see this and not wonder how the hell this is happening and who are the ones making the decisions leading to this outcome?</p>

<p>Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for participating in this thread. It&#39;s uplifting to see so many smart free thinkers in one place :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t want to believe that their world view is a.lie. they want to live in their own world. As long as it doesn&#39;t affect the average person, noone will care.</p>

<p>I just got into this stuff around last year. I think its so interesting. I don&#39;t believe anything I hear before I do research now. That&#39;s the thing. They want a majority of people to be asleep. So when people like us talk about whats really going on, we get called conspiracy theorists and we are crazy blah blah blah. </p>

<p>Especially now with us not getting the full.story as usual from the MSM, and people having Facebook getting most if their news from there, some people are starting to see that what they put on the news every night is only small percentages of the story</p>

<p>I would love to be wrong and hate to say to every one I told you so. I want to open as many peoples eyes as I possibly can. With more numbers, we can make a change</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya this Israeli thing has really shocked me. I mean over 160 children dead and over 1,000 children horribly injured (ie. paralyzed, or life long injuries,  near fatal injuries)... and yet there are still LOTS of people who think Israel are the good and that it&#39;s all Hamas who is to blame. </p>

<p>I mean, the willingness of people to simply blindly believe that one side is ALL bad and the other side is ALL good is astonishing. </p>

<p>I mean if killing children doesn&#39;t get people to wake up, I don&#39;t know what will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I know. What&#39;s crazy is is that people still think in terms of &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. There&#39;s so much if a grey area that those words are almost meaningless. Each side is bad or good depending on how they view things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously blame professional team sports like Football for many of our ignorant mis-perceptions, in America and elsewhere (i.e. Futbol).  Sports have become a cultural indoctrination to believe in &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;Them&quot;, that Us is right and Them is hateful, and that these differences should be so emotionally charged and compelling that sportsfans will fight with each other or have their whole week ruined by the outcome of a game.  I mean I&#39;ve often enjoyed sports in my life, but never let it become my Identity....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Synchronicity strikes! This morning my shower thoughts drifted to professional sports and I realized how absurd they are. We idolize these clowns who can&#39;t even pass a high school math test as if they&#39;re sent from above. 90%+ of them go flat broke within a few years of retirement anyway - hardly a life worth worshipping. Sports have absolutely divided humans further. Just look up &quot;Brian Stow&quot; for a great example of how sports enhance this divide between us and influences hate and violence. Finally, who in their right mind would paint their faces or body and go shirtless to an outdoor game in December in @#$%ing Wisconsin?! These people have lost their minds!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the same goes for both sides. But the &quot;free thinkers&quot; have one up on the people who only listen to the news. They think the government has their best Intrests at hand when in reality its the opposite. Because we know how shady the government is to us, while the people who &quot;don&#39;t care&quot; will be completely blind sided when Shit hits the fan and they will wish that they &quot; did care&quot;. The average American doesn&#39;t care. Only when it affects their lives do they care. Well when it affects their lives, its already to late. You need to be pro active not reactive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anarcho-capitalism, to me and many people is not anarchism. Its another form of fiefdom. You want corporations running the world more than they do now? For example, private corporate armies taking over all the fresh water in a region while millions die because they can&#39;t afford to pay for water? Because that&#39;s what AnCapistan would look like.</p>

<p>For me its about (fully free) markets not capitalism, which are not the same. Anarchist thought on property is difficult to understand, but worth it. There are some complex things here.</p>

<p>However IF you are going to call yourself an ancap, have you at least read any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard">Rothbard</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no problem and rightfully so thats a common question. and the reason why people think anarchy is chaos is because of movies like the purge. it means no hierarchy.</p>

<p>the market would take care of it. the only reason corporations exist today is because of government regulations. without them they are businesses and exist to serve the market. without government regulations, people are held accountable for their actions so there would be no bailouts or special things for corporations as they wouldnt exist.</p>

<p>heres a quote from rothbard. i know its about air pollution, but the premise is the same</p>

<p>&quot;The vital fact about air pollution is that the polluter sends unwanted and unbidden pollutants—from smoke to nuclear fallout to sulfur oxides—through the air and into the lungs of innocent victims, as well as onto their material property. All such emanations which injure person or property constitute aggression against the private property of the victims. Air pollution, after all, is just as much aggression as committing arson against another’s property or injuring him physically. Air pollution that injures others is aggression pure and simple.&quot;</p>

<p>Anarchy comes from Greek. </p>

<p>An- meaning without,</p>

<p>Arkhos - meaning chief, ruler. </p>

<p>The word people should be using when they say anarchy is anomie. </p>

<p>Anomie, also Greek roots, comes from Greek anomos, meaning lawless. </p>

<p>Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in that case, the community would come together and think of a solution. He would be kicked out of the society. </p>

<p>I could see how having no rule would be better. Let&#39;s take your example of pollution. That company that is polluting, would lose business. The reason companies are able to do this today is because the government bails them out. These &quot;to big to fail companies&quot;. In a true free market, if you have shitty business practices or pollute the environment, the market will take care of it. Without government there would be noone to save these companies. So in the end, the free market decides which business lives or.dies.</p>

<p>Without law enforcement, companies would pollute with impunity.  They would dump their toxic waste in middle of the night when no one was looking and no one would investigate to find out who did it.  </p>

<p>Without regulators checking up on what they put into the air and water, they would simply lie about the pollution.  The market wouldn&#39;t take care of anything.  The market relies on valid information. Without it, it doesn&#39;t function efficiently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then minarchism. I&#39;d take either minarchism or anarchy. What we have today is to huge. Maybe your right and we do need to be robbed by our government by robbing us for taxes. I&#39;m hella.cynical of.people, but I believe everyone is kind. We don&#39;t need the government robbing us and then saying here you can only have the rest because we say so and if we wanted 90% we would take that and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it</p>

<p>I believe we don&#39;t need to be taxed. Taxation is robbery. 40% of the governments income comes from our tax money. If we took that away our economy would be in 1997, when we had a surplus and.money to spend. I hear all the time that &quot;government is a necessary evil&quot; but I truly believe everyone thinks that because we are conditioned to believe we need government and without them there would be &quot;anarchy&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I think those who are self proclaimed &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; are not necessarily &quot;free-thinkers&quot; either. If you consider the fact that the conspiracy community is only supported by a handful of websites and that the term itself was engineered then it&#39;s easy to suspect that much of the information that&#39;s disseminated throughout the community is disinformation in of itself and that may be a little ego shattering but if you think about it it might help you as far as pursuing truth goes. Consider this, we generally have an A or B choice regarding candidates in this country and many now suspect that both may be manipulated by the same will, so to speak. Now consider as an example, as &quot;A&quot; is let&#39;s say r/worldnews, frontpage, r/politics, etc and the other extreme is &quot;B&quot; which is r/conspiracy. It&#39;s creating a polarity in people&#39;s minds and promoting a faulty mode of thinking. A person who is a victim of this &quot;loop&quot; so to speak, is simply going from &quot;A&quot; then to &quot;B&quot; and then drawing conclusions. Well what if neither A or B are true but are just like the Republican and Democrat ideologies, extreme examples of each other? I think many people on here are waiting for some new NSA monitoring where they are taking people away in droves for certain actions, but what makes you think this isn&#39;t the system I had just discussed and that it&#39;s been implemented for longer than we thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is very easy to avoid the truth. It is ridiculously uncomfortable to realize that the media, your schooling, your government and so on are all intentionally lying to you. People generally don&#39;t like having their preconceptions shook up.</p>

<p>It takes a specific kind of mind to even be curious, because curiosity is squished out of us every step of the way. You have to either have society fail you or you have to not be involved in it in a major way to be able to see past it. The Matrix brilliantly illustrates it. How many people ever feel that something is wrong, much less pursue it, and if they do how often do they turn into Cypher, or die in vain like Mouse? In the USA where seeing through the veil is most important, we are also sheltered more so that it is harder or more &quot;uncomfortable&quot; to do that sort of seeking. If you do try to break away in the USA, you are ridiculed/ostracized or find out it is illegal.</p>

<p>As far as our scientific progress, much of it is misguided or done amorally or in a neutral state where wisdom is not involved. Look for the TED talk by Rupert Sheldrake for more about this. Science cannot give us the answers in its current form.</p>

<p>Most people in this country actually <em>cant</em> see it. People in their 20-30s have a much better chance because we see it in our jobs, grew up with the internet and are seeing that get shut down etc. Older people just can&#39;t comprehend that their world is being phased out/falling apart and younger people are having their brains scrambled at a young age by ritalin and distracted beyond belief with their phones. </p>

<p>And like the matrix, it&#39;s almost as if should they wake up there&#39;s a chance their brains might just &#39;pop&#39;. </p>

<p>I think a huge part of the problem is that as a human race we&#39;re no longer building towards anything. </p>

<p>Ask anyone &quot;So what are we building towards?&quot; and no one is going to be able to tell you. </p>

<p>The system has entered this kind of auto pilot mode where people just &quot;do things&quot; for the paycheque. They have zero sense of being a part of anything greater or moving towards some societally defined goal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rabbit hole keeps going...</p>

<p>CIA made the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; synonymous with &quot;crazy&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.</p>

<p>To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (II) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein&#39;s theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane&#39;s book is much less convincing that Epstein&#39;s and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you then account for the gradual increase in wealth within the one percent and the obscure tax laws and policies that ensure it? All the while wages stagnate and even decrease on a percentage of inflation over time factor? Maybe it isn&#39;t conspiracy, maybe it&#39;s just been slowly ingrained into the political sphere over a period of time. Bit by bit, line by line, drop by drop with lobbyists pushing the cart? It isn&#39;t just economic concerns people should worry about either. It&#39;s the sublime mind-creep of socio-psychological control over the people by powerful corporate/government interests. Telling everyone to be afraid of everything that moves, but not to worry, they&#39;re handling it. Send in a FOIA request, and you might get a denial....6 months later. You tell me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) life spans are lengthening in large part of infant mortality being much better than before. </p>

<p>2) Yes, in the third world things are getting better. </p>

<p>3) I shouldn&#39;t have used life spans but rather quality of life. Because keeping people alive longer isn&#39;t necessarily better if they are getting sicker younger. </p>

<p>4) Obviously there is less war when you consider there was previously two world wars and the vietnam war. But I&#39;m looking at my life time (so the past 3 decades give or take). </p>

<p>Your point is valid, but I think mine still remains so. During my lifetime I&#39;ve seen the world become MORE extreme, more wars break out and poverty increase. </p>

<p>You can always go back to a worse time and say things are rosy. I&#39;d obviously rather be living now than living under some king with my teeth falling out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be careful in picking a small time window to compute stats on and drawing conclusions from it.</p>

<p>Example 1: the people claiming that global warming has &quot;stalled&quot; over the last N years while on longer timescales such stalls have happened repeatedly while the overall trend is upwards. Increases aren&#39;t monotonic, but the long term trend is upwards.</p>

<p>Example 2: Pick two stocks and compare their prices over a period. Many of the finance sites will give you a nice graph comparing their indexed performance, showing who did better over the period. Now change the start time a few times. Who looks better at the end will change.</p>

<p>So even if it&#39;s true that quality of life has not improved in the past ~30 years (which I strongly doubt, but let&#39;s say it has), that says very little about long-term trends. </p>

<p>You conceded that things are getting better in the third world. Remember that most of human population lives in the third world or BRIC countries. Even if income growth has stalled in the U.S., that&#39;s only 320 million people out of 7 billion, or &lt;5%. Meanwhile, standards of living in China are going up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdata is not data useful for evidence. To claim that &quot;quality of life&quot; has declined, you have to point to something more than your personal perception of people&#39;s expectations. </p>

<p>People now have cable TV, satellite TV, cell phones, the internet, mobile access to the internet, more cars, bigger and bigger cars (over our lifetime anyway), more education on average. </p>

<p>Yes, employment and salaries seem to be stalling for a large part of the western population. But that doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;quality of life has drastically declined&quot; as you claim. If you have statistics on large increases in homelessness, hunger, etc across a number of Western countries, I&#39;d be curious to see it.</p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;re going entirely on your personal perception of the news, which is highly subject to all kinds of bias (e.g. paying more attention now than before, or better access to more media types, changes in media treatment of topics). Like <a href="/u/rednail64">/u/rednail64</a> above, my impression of reports of actual data is that the trends are positive (improving) over the long run on both standard of living and violence. </p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s a whole separate debate to be had about whether we could be doing much better and why we&#39;re not. </p>

<p>actually they are not, go research male mortality in average US towns, use city.com or simialr for demographic details.</p>

<p>the numbers of males is pretty constant until age 50, then the numbers per five year slice of the population plummets. </p>

<p>an age 50 male prob has a 1-in-10 chance of seeing 70. there will be five females alive for every male aged 70.</p>

<p>diet, smoking, alcohol, bad jobs that destroy the body, industrial chemicals. all these factors make it very likely that a male in their 50s is on the fast decline and on the way out.</p>

<p>if the average person wants to see 70 or 80, then a radical lifestyle change is called for.</p>

<p>EXERCISE daily, no smoking, no excessive drinking, a good balanced restricted calorie diet. no nasty industrial job handling chemicals or inhaling dust or particles or smoke/fumes, move to a location that is not polluted and is pleasant to live in (stress etc).</p>

Nobody is going to believe anything that makes you sound like a nut job. If you want to be effective and inflict change, you should talk about the more concrete issues like global conflicts, our economy, immigration.. things people can relate to and easily grasp. It&#39;s gotta be done in small steps if you want to create a global awakening. I believe this is already happening as a result of our ability to communicate today.. despite how manipulated we all complain all sources of information are (mass media, newspapers, the internet).

<p>you know, I really wonder what percentage of the population could define the word &quot;fact&quot;. It means an argument with general consensus, not truth. But people mistake this for fact. That is how the educated stupid in the mainstream are able to fool themselves, their favorite word is fact, yet they likely cannot correctly define it. The greatest lesson from the holocaust is that consensus of the ignorant is meaningless, yet consensus of the ignorant is the basis for many peoples belief in regard to conspiracy history/theory (and many other areas, in some cases also in science). </p>

Your standard of proof is subjective, documents can be faked you know.

    <div class="md"><p>I know you can always forge a document, there are many to dismiss. But you can&#39;t forge the source. Northwoods was declassified by the DOD in 1997. So I&#39;ll take their word for it. It&#39;s in the national security archives.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also say the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0">evidence</a> behind Mockingbird is uncontroversial. Same thing with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf">MK Ultra</a>.</p>

<p>Northwoods+MK Ultra+Mockingbird=All false flags all the time. If you want to use your imagination.</p>

<p>On 911, I do have some suspicions, but the truther movement, sort of drowned out the conversation. I&#39;m no physicist but I do know the Bin Laden relationship with the Bush family is too embarrassing for them to chose such a scenario. The &quot;physics took a day off&quot; argument doesn&#39;t hold up logically. Why would they execute such a stupid plan?</p>

<p>This all distracted from the link between Bin Laden, Bush and The Carlyle Group. There was also CIA involvement in creating what&#39;s known as Al-Qaeda today. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqn0bm4E9yw">Take it from Hillary</a>. It&#39;s now a case of history, not theory. I&#39;d just like to know how far that relationship between the CIA and Al Qaeda went.</p>

<p>There are just not that many revolutionaries in any given human population.

<p>As for the suicides, I agree that there seems to be a sharp statistical increase (for middle aged Americans,) however the number I found in the primary source is a 28.4% increase, as opposed to the number for white males only which was 40.4%.</p>

<p>And yes, I thought that some of the statements you made were vague and careless, and took your suggestion to search the answers out for myself.  Argument breeds truth; challenge is important. When people throw around statements haphazardly passing them as truth (which clearly at least one of yours was patently false, and another slightly misleading,) and spread misinformation, that is harmful.</p>

In other words, we are currently safer right now in the immediate present only, but everything is so centralized that all it takes to destroy the entire planet is the wrong press of a button, one world leader/corporate fatcat to go crazy, one scientist to release that killer nano bot or virus, whatever. so we are enjoying ourselves but it could all change in a instant, whereas before things were more decentralized and less risky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, centralization may (simply statistically) imply conspiring, in order to be created as well as in order to function, because if a population is dominated by hierarchical rulers at the top of the pyramid, that strongly implies a small number of individuals are conspiring. It may strongly imply this because of, for one reason, Gall&#39;s Law. Theoretically this is not necessarily &#39;negative&#39; in terms of real results, which is possibly part of what you mean, however, it is risky for the species, and I might claim that is inherently &#39;negative&#39;. plus, you mentioned the media is acting like things are great, well if what i said is true, then that is a coverup, whether intentionality can be proved or not, because they are focusing on distractions instead and as you say, acting like everything is a-ok.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a branch of psychology that looks into people&#39;s beliefs about their own status (i.e. beliefs about self-worth). What was found is that a threat to a person&#39;s status will activate the same area of the brain that would be activated if someone poses a threat to their survival. Therefore, humans are indeed PROGRAMMED to overreact and defend our beliefs as though they are sacred. We really are such cowards that we can&#39;t take a hit to our belief system. When you understand this basic psychological pattern, you&#39;ll stop feeling quite so frustrated when you&#39;re not getting the results you hope for with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a few reasons:</p>

<p>The term is only used pejoratively. Most people regardless of anything else don&#39;t want to be called a pejorative term. </p>

<p>The other reason is difficult for people to consider their &quot;team&quot; being wrong. The &quot;leaders&quot; of these teams are sociopaths who leverage good will &amp; fancy talk for support. This goes for political parties, religions, nationalism, whatever the hell you want. That is humanity and history of everything in a nutshell: Humans are unthinking masses led by bastards and everything&#39;s fucked. </p>

<p>The difference is people who see and understand this (the term &#39;awake&#39; gets thrown around), and people who still think <em>their</em> politician, religious sect, TV pundit, news channel, whom or whatever is The One True Person Or Group Who Is Right And Will Fix Everything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a great <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_on_the_psychology_of_evil">TED talk by Philip Zimbardo</a> about the psychology of evil.  He says evil isn&#39;t really something inherent in people, but rather that specific conditions established in systems, institutions, departments, etc. bring out the worst in people.  It&#39;s very enlightening.</p>

<p>But my point here is that one of the first conditions needed is &quot;adherance to authority&quot;.  I think one of the prime reasons people don&#39;t grasp conspiratorial agendas is that they believe that people in authority are there for a reason, there to do good, there to serve us, etc. You especially see this with the &quot;good student&quot; personalities: people who went to Universities and applied themselves to do well and bought into the doctrines they were being taught so that they could be seen as, well, good students.  Then they begin to spread those internalized doctrines with faith and fervor, even if they&#39;re one-sided or prejudiced toward, say, corporate  interests or The American Way or whatever.</p>

<p>Now lizard people and moon landing denial are just fucking stuipd and crazy.  The illuminati is far fetched but not impossible.  But when you get into things like NWO and 9/11 people are more open minded than we think.  While they are not going to jump on the wagon and say NWO is real and 9/11 is an inside job they really do think about it because most people agree that the 9/11 story was spotty, and the fact that our country is an Oligarchy keeps the possibility of rich people around the world creating a one world government possible.  </p>

<p>the market would take care of it. the only reason corporations exist today is because of government regulations. without them they are businesses and exist to serve the market. without government regulations, people are held accountable for their actions so there would be no bailouts or special things for corporations as they wouldnt exist.</p>

<p>heres a quote from rothbard. i know its about air pollution, but the premise is the same</p>

<p>&quot;The vital fact about air pollution is that the polluter sends unwanted and unbidden pollutants—from smoke to nuclear fallout to sulfur oxides—through the air and into the lungs of innocent victims, as well as onto their material property. All such emanations which injure person or property constitute aggression against the private property of the victims. Air pollution, after all, is just as much aggression as committing arson against another’s property or injuring him physically. Air pollution that injures others is aggression pure and simple.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uh, how does the current US government handle that situation? unless you advocate complete totalitarianism, then he will always be able to dump it one way or another. in reality the government &quot;regulations&quot; like the fda are owned by monsanto and could be much better replaced with free market competing NGO&#39;s and labeling. just one example.</p>

<li><p>Actually troops on the ground fighthing started in 1965 and ended in 1975. So not over 10 years, but i&#39;ll give you it was 10 years. We&#39;re currently going on MORE than 10 years in terms of fighting wars in the middle east. </p></li>
<li><p>As for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/health/suicide-rate-rises-sharply-in-us.html">suicide rates read on</a>.</p></li>

<p>not to be rude, but we&#39;ll have to cut our conversation short here. You clearly are just looking to argue because you could have easily found the facts I just referenced above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself a firm believer in many things on this subreddit but this one is bullshit in my opinion. Your theory on decalcifying the pineal gland this is just ridiculous. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEN4hcZutO0">Check of these guys who have never even ate chocalate let alone the processed junk food we eat here in america</a> and there as dull as any other human there ist anything special going on with their &quot;pineal gland&quot;. Third eye crap is just a sham. Ive traveled aboard to diffrent countries in south america deep in the jungles of guatemela, where they literally live off the land. They have no aspartame, caffeine, sugar, alcohol, tobacco, and fluoride and guess what? They have no fucking third eye, there is NOTHING special about them. </p>

<p>PS: I have a berky water filter that tries to elimanate flouride because i do believe flouride is not safe for drinking but the other garbage about opening a third eye is just redicolous. </p>
