        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US government is trying desperately to drum up public support for a war with Russia.</p>

<p>The USG is attempting to blame Russia for the downing of MH17, even though there is no solid proof of who downed the aircraft and how. All we have received so far are shoddy satellite pictures, which could have been misinterpreted, or doctored completely, as we saw during the pretense of the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Now the USG is dredging up an old charge against Russia for violating an international treaty by testing ground fired cruise missiles, despite the fact that the alleged events happened in 2008, despite the fact that the USG nullified it&#39;s own participation in the treaty in 2002, and despite the fact that testing new ground-fire cruise missiles is something the US military does on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Who knows what will come next from the spin machine called the US media?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t pay any attention to it. The US citizens have paid for enough murder already. If Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq have taught us anything, it&#39;s that the US should never participate in another war of aggression again.</p>

Seems like proof enough to me as to who shot it down. And we all know who&#39;s supplying the separatists.</p>

<p>That of course, doesn&#39;t change the fact that the U.S. is beating the war drums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see anything. I don&#39;t know what that site is. Video won&#39;t play. Proves nothing. Kiev had a military plane tailing MH17, even if eastern rebels did shoot it down, they warned they would shoot down military aircraft. This is a complete false flag. It reeks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush%E2%80%93Blair_2003_Iraq_memo">Bush Blair memo</a> and Russian radar, along with eyewitnesses, as well as Carlos in the tower all confirm military aircraft tailing MH17.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re reading a little too far into this... the plane really was accidentally shot down by separatists and not a false flag operation. The U.S. would be directly involved by now if it were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always bail out of that ship and simply go somewhere else.  Usually though a wife will put on the breaks of anything like that.  The wives also stop a man with forsight from selling his home at a peak bubble.  They are full of fear of the world and most will not leave.  Between this fear then you have to contend with the fear of grandparents and everyone else in the tribe.  Then on top of that to leave is to invalidate your friends and families life since they gain validity by having others to be like them.  After returning home friends, family and random people would beg me to answer rhetorically if I was &quot;happy to be home&quot;.  They want to know that their life is alright and if you don&#39;t pander to their begging then they will resent you.</p>

<p>For me I must look at the positive aspect of this and I see it that so few Americans will ever want to leave due to their delusional fear of the world that the government will not need to clamp down on the borders for a very long time.  I suspect that the borders will be closed in many regards in all but name at some point but that period will be very minimized in duration simply because not many would be trying to leave.  They will likely be doing very strong resource checks at customs but that will be manageable if you have not so much wealth.</p>

<p>For me I see that it is far too late to change course and that they have pushed the accelerator all of the way forward to try and just crash up and over the rocks by creating huge wars in Euroasia.  I very much agree with the Russian officials sentiments at the round table that the US has gained massively from each war in Europe and that this is the source of their economic miracle.  So it stands to reason that they will try to do another one to gain some similar benefits.  I&#39;m not sure when I had this epiphany (possibly early in the Syria conflict) but I&#39;ve been chewing on this for a while and now it seems rather obvious in fact.</p>

<p>I find that Russia is currently the only large power that is routinely speaking any sense on these issues and of course this can change at any moment.  I&#39;m currently in L&#39;viv, Ukraine and this place has fairly strong anti-Russian sentiments so I definitely feel that I&#39;ve heard all of that angle but it just doesn&#39;t resonate with me as much as the Russian position.  I agree with the Russian official that Kiev is basically a puppet state of the IMF and US.  I just don&#39;t believe that Ukraine in general is mature enough to handle their own stuff and their anti-Russian sentiment is just a tool to be used in yet another exploitation.  They haven&#39;t kept up with the times that Russia is not the same that it was 50-100 years ago and neither is the US.  Some people see a place for where it will be in five years and others for what it was in their grandfathers days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in L&#39;viv, Ukraine and is was rather disheartening to hear otherwise intelligent Ukrainians refer to people being bombed in Southeast Ukraine as terrorists.  Its like Ukrainians can&#39;t do anything to Russia directly so they will take out their infantile frustration on Russians in their own country.</p>

<p>Its insane what people can be made to think.</p>

<p>Now seeing this I absolutely side with Russia in annexing Crimea and you&#39;ll notice that only three people died in that process and Russia does not need to drop bombs on those people to get them to play nicely.  I was drinking in a real shit hole dive bar (now turned somewhat Nazi-esque) in L&#39;viv days before news was big about Russia in Crimea and the guys fresh back from Maidan were talking about what to do to stop Russia.  So I see it that Russia was right to protect these people and also gain the resources.  The Kiev government was no longer going to be a proper steward of these lands and I see it as completely legitimate that they were relieved of them.  Seeing how people were talking I believe that they were beginning to plan to go down to Crimea for some trouble.  I find it likely that small groups had already done so but that more likely it was days to weeks in the making and Russia just jumped on it at the opportune moment.</p>

<p>Now Ukrainians are engaged in an infantile frustration based ethnic cleansing on the Southeast of Ukraine and really it is the IMF paying for all of it.  Kiev is broke and the IMF is giving them money for this war and you can bet that if the IMF didn&#39;t want the war then they would change conditions.  They are trying to completely bomb out an economy that is strictly tied to Russia and either way they figure that they will win.  If Russia enters this main land territory then the hundreds of articles that are prewritten will be published in a non-stop frenzy and Russia will lose big time.  If Russia does nothing then basically part of their economy will be crippled.  Meanwhile &quot;Ukrainians&quot; all want to have their one big country but also the right to cleanse any particular region at their whim.  They want to be all one big country but they despise the people living the in Southeast.  They believe that they are culturally inferior, etc.</p>

<p>So only with propaganda can you get people to ethnically cleanse people in their own country under the guise of saving them from an external enemy.  That is some fucked up shit when you think about it.</p>

<p>Seeing the response to Syria makes me think you are right, but the level of hatred in American culture for Russia makes me think that this one may be succesful. You can see it all over the internet, jokes about Russia and how drunk, stupid and corrupt they are are the norm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good prediction. It lines up perfectly with my assessment as well. It is scary to think that all of this propaganda is ramping up to something big like that. And it would make perfect sense.</p>

<p>Something explodes in the US, killing everyone, (and probably some part of the region that the government already wanted to get rid of: see WTC7), and then the finger is pointed at Russia and EVERYONE blindly believes it.</p>

<p>Do we really need any more proof that the people will believe anything the government says at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These &quot;radical &#39;Muslims&#39;&quot; would not have existed if it were not for the atrocities committed by the US and Israel, and the US and Israel creating the main terrorist groups. Iraq used to be a secular state, until the US went and fucked that up with the first invasion of Iraq and the US installing a dictator for their new president (as they have done with many countries). Why did the US invade Iraq again in 2003? Iraq had no involvement with 9/11 and the official reason for the 2003 invasion was that they had WMDs (Weapons of Mass Desteuction) which we all know now that they were not used and did not exist. The president of Iraq until 2003 probably stopped bending-over-backwards for the US. The US wanted Iraq&#39;s oil/gas, gold, and to instal a private central bank to control the currency of Iraq. Dick Cheney&#39;s Halliburton has made $39 500 000 000 USD off of the 2003 Iraq war. Conflict of interest much?!</p>

<p>As you may know, the worlds Big Banking families want to control all central banks in the world. They are in control of very many of them and also control the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) (the central bank of central banks).</p>

<p>Yeah, a lot of shit in this sub is crazy so take it with a grain of salt. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s unreliable. When I read stuff on here I do it more for a big picture perspective. Yes the shooting down of MH17 is suspicious but watch the other hand when shit like that happens. I can assure you that the biggest story on any given day is not the one you see headlining the nightly news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know this. But this sub upvotes images with text that fit the narrative they want to hear, which usually under scrutiny falls apart, yet it&#39;s still upvotes to the top.</p>

<p>Oh and with regards to my quote, I was obviously being facetious.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re at least not one of the people who I&#39;m talking about. 
The main steam news isn&#39;t as bad as this sub makes out, especially once you cross reference different outlets. That way you can usually figure out a believable version of events.</p>

<p>Just step back and look at what&#39;s happening in Eastern Ukraine (US special forces are heavily involved there) and the rhetoric that is coming out of the US media. The US is trying to catalyse, to antagonise something which is a local conflict into something more...global. </p>

<p>The US failed to secure international consent for their plans to bomb Syria and Iran, so they have switched tack and are going &quot;all in&quot; trying to conjure up a ground war in Ukraine between NATO and Russia. </p>
