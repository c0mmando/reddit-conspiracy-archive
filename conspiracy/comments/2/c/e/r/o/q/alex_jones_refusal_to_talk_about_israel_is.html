In the last week he has not brought up the conflict in Israel one time and it absolutely boggles my mind.  What is happening in Israel right now is 100% in line with his &#39;end game/new world order&#39; rhetoric.  I have heard before that he is a shill for Israel and the Zionists and now I am starting to believe it.  Thoughts?</p>

While you&#39;re failing to make even single points in pro or A. Jones, you won&#39;t even address the point made you&#39;re attempting to counter.  In the last week, has the disinfo shill discussed or addresses even 30 seconds of Israel on-air?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.  Your game has already failed here.  Alex Jones is definitively proven himself a worthless israli shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This piece of shit windbag gets his PAYCHECK from ultra-Zionists Jeffrey Smulyan and George Friedman...and he says NOTHING that they do not want him to say. He&#39;s disinformation to a &quot;T&quot;-nothing but controlled opposition...a mouthpiece for Zionism and Stratfor.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen his mansion payed for by the money gullible listeners send in? I have. If you&#39;re ever in Austin you should check it out.</p>

<p>He is COINTELPRO all the way. He exists to marginalize the &quot;conspiracy movement&quot; so they can look stupid. So far...it&#39;s been working.</p>

<p>Remember that his wife/CIA handler is a Jew so his ENTIRE FAMILY can return to Israel once people finally figure out what he&#39;s been up to here. </p>

<p>Hopefully they won&#39;t let him in. But I dunno...he can provide a LOT of hasbara.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sadly agree with you. I have watched AJ from a distance for a while now, and I rarely disagree with what he has to say, I even personally love how American he is and that he is constantly espousing the false notions that we were led to believe this country was founded on <em>the dream it used to be</em>. However over the last few weeks as the greatest humanitarian fail of our life time is going down he is silent, even though the crooks that stole the dream are wholly complicit and he must know this. All he is talking about is what is going on at our southern border. How is what is going on down there really any different from what is going on in Palestine? Americans are at our border screaming at brown CHILDREN to get the fuck out. <em>Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free</em> this is part of the American that was and still is my dream.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPxv4Aff3IA">how different is this</a> from what is going on at our own borders? Shouldn&#39;t we be ashamed and really really concerned that Americans seem to be under the same indoctrination as these Israeli&#39;s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was this episode of decoded where the team investigates the Bohemian Grove. Apparently Alex Jones is the only &quot;outsider&quot; to ever make it in to one of their festivals.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m thinking about what kind of people are supposed to be there. Bilderburgers, Illuminati etc. For Alex Jones to make it inside would be like me making it to the backstage party of a Rolling Stones concert without a pass. Kind of unlikely to say the least. Also, check out the expression he makes when one of the Decoded team mentions how he looked like he could have passed for a member of the one of the delegations (Texas I think).</p>

<p>So my theory is that Jones was there by invitation. Now if this got out, his credibility (and career) as a conspiracy theorist would be damaged. So he explains his presence there as some kind of stunt. And now he shills for them, distributing disinformation. </p>

<p>This is, of course, just a theory. But the theory has to fit the evidence. And the evidence is that Jones has been completely silent on the topic of Israel. Just imagine that you&#39;re in his shoes. You&#39;re a conspiracy theorist and one of the groups you like to talk about asks you to join them..... or else. What do you think he&#39;s gonna say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy is an entertainer.  Not a newsman.  He knows that a lot of what he says is bullshit.  He knows that most of what he sells thru his website is also bullshit.  He&#39;s making money by reinforcing ideas that his listeners already have.  He knows where his bread is buttered so he says what he has to to keep people listening.  As far as his not addressing Israel, that is a business decision.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a lot of the stations that broadcast his show are owned by Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid not.  Every single link tested was dead.  Actor Jones, controlled Stratfor counter intelligence and fonrolled opposition.  Personally, I feel you&#39;re quite lacking mentally that you cannot see this.</p>

<p>Has Alex Jones asked his listeners to do illegal and dangerous things?  Putting your life and liberty in jeapordy?  Are you intelligent enough to see through his lies?  Intelligent enough to avoid him advocating your demise and/or incarceration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is his cover.  Where did he post a single comment of what is going on with Israel.  Pretty critical stuff, and what does the Israeli actor Alex Jones say about the most important, critical world events?  He is Stratfor controlled opposition.  He will advocate you destroy yourself.  He will advocate that you destroy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you cannot debate a single thing?   Not even one item.  Here&#39;s a thought:  Post some actual links then fool, and as I requested so simply, you are incapable of providing anything to the cobtrary.  You&#39;ve been challenged, and unsurprisingly, you can do nothing more than continue to act like shill.</p>
