        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The book is called &quot;A Gathering Of Twine&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gathering-Twine-The-Spirals-Danu/dp/0992696402">http://www.amazon.com/Gathering-Twine-The-Spirals-Danu/dp/0992696402</a></p>

<p>Pretty much everyone who has reviewed the book has a history like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AXX9ABI2Y8ZJS/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp">http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AXX9ABI2Y8ZJS/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp</a></p>

<p>That person has &quot;read&quot; and reviewed a ton of books and everyone single one is five out of five stars, except ONE book that <em>only</em> got four stars. </p>

<p>On Good reads its the exact same pattern for this book- almost exclusively very high reviews from users that only ever give very high reviews. </p>

<p>I mean seriously, what kind of coincidence would it be that the 168 people that reviewed the book all happen to love every single book they&#39;ve ever read?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You&#39;re not kidding. Definitely bullshit, first reviewer I clicked on was &quot;Bruce&quot;. Don&#39;t need to go farther. Here&#39;s one of his reviews:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to know more about Acne. In fact I got more than what I wanted. The book has much information regarding Acne and the ways to get rid of it. I found this book a easy read and I now know the causes of Acne and how it can be prevented. Good Book!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Even better</strong> on July 26,2014 he wrote this review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i will be a parent soon and I thought why not get a few tips on how I can sharpen my skills before that time comes. I didn&#39;t know much about parenting until I read this easy to read book. I believe I am ready now to face parenting; thanks to this book.
Very helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a month earlier, on June 28,2014 he already had a kid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a baby boy and that&#39;s why I needed this book. This book is easy to read and understand. I got it for my wife as this is our first child. The book has helpful information regarding the care of a baby. My wife was so happy to read it and the tips have helped her in the upkeep of our baby.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend it to all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets worse. I heard from a guy who worked at Amazon and he was sent to take a packing crate loaded with books, on a forklift, to a warehouse where things are stored before &#39;disposal&#39;. In other words, for damaged items. </p>

<p>So in the process of checking the crate and notices that the tag on it has a buyers sheet with address (somewhere in Texas). In other words, this whole pallet of books (Limbaughs kids book in this case) was already sold to someone in Texas. But it&#39;s going to the disposal warehouse. </p>

<p>Thinking it was a mistake he checks with a manager and discovers that this happens all the time. There were multiple pallets of Limbaughs and other authors books in the disposal warehouse that had been purchased by the truck-full. They weren&#39;t damaged but they were slated for destruction, post-purchase.</p>

<p>The savvier authors purchase blog &quot;book tour&quot; packages for a few hundred dollars apiece to get better quality and less suspicious reviews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, I would call it a conspiracy, AND I would say it is normal. To my mind, another word for conspiracy is &quot;business&quot;. This is business as usual</p>

<p>I would define business as:
<strong>an agreement between persons to</strong> deceive, mislead, or defraud others of their legal rights, or to <strong>gain an unfair advantage</strong></p>

<p>which also happens to be a definition of conspiracy. business = conspiracy</p>
