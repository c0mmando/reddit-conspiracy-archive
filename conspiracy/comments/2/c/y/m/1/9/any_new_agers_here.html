    <div class="md"><p>Well, I will not say that I believe the law of attraction. But, my wife does, and I support her. By supporting her, I&#39;ve inevitably invited it into my life, but willfully so. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve researched it, and a lot is compelling, but a lot is anecdotal and speculative, as well. Nonetheless, I liked the part that says you don&#39;t have to believe the law of attraction works to utilize its benefits.. so I tried it. I was working 90+ hrs at the time at a shitty restaurant. </p>

<p>Now, I have a job where I take home the same amount of money but working only 28 hrs a week. Good thing I read that book called &quot;the 4he work week!&quot; </p>

<p>But anyways, my wife and I created vision boards for us, and on one was a picture of our ideal dog. You see, we&#39;ve been wanting a dog for a long time, but we weren&#39;t ready because we haven&#39;t found &quot;our&quot; dog. So we waited, and focused on it while meditating together. </p>

<p>You can call it the law of attraction, or you can call it coincidence (can never rule out coincidence imo), but just two weeks ago we found a dog in a neighboring states humane society that looked <em>exactly</em> like the one on our vision board! He was even given the same name at the shelter that we were going to give him, Mo. </p>

<p>So, you can take this as anecdotal evidence. Or a sityuation created by coincidence. But it is still amazing. We own our own business now, as well, and have doubled our income in the past year as well.</p>

<p>Again, I won&#39;t say I believe it, but things in my life certainly have gotten better since implementing the law of attraction ideas into our lives. </p>

<p>Also, we recently went to an Andy Dooley workshop earlier this year. The things we&#39;ve learned there help our marriage, as when we get grumpy, we start telling each other the things we love about each other and how we appreciate one another&#39;s existence in our life. </p>

<p>Whether you believe it to.be true or not is not important. But, it is definately beneficial to a positive way of life---and there for condusive to happiness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly we create our realities. </p>

<p>Whether this is simply a projection of our preconceived beliefs acting as a filter of our every day experience, or our subconscious interacting with reality at an unknown quantum level is still widely debated. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m less interested in new age mumbo jumbo, and more interested in philosophy and logic, but these subjects do blur into eachother. </p>

<p>Anyone interested in these ideas should visit <a href="/r/psychonaut">/r/psychonaut</a>, it&#39;s a fantastic subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Passio has sort of scared me away from the new age thing... he makes some good points in his lecture about why new age is bullshit and designed to make people passive. Let&#39;s face it, truth and perception are not always aligned, our brains jump through a lot of hoops to present the world to us in the way it does, and thinking that your perception can somehow affect the truth seems crazy to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, maybe the idea is right but for the wrong reasons. I think it&#39;s absolutely true that you get out of life what you put into it and spending time focusing on positive things is probably a useful exercise. I&#39;m just not sure I&#39;d take it as far as some do in thinking that your thoughts can actually cause real change outside of your direct sphere of influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To tell you the truth I didn&#39;t believe this either at first being a athiest that had read THe God Delushion multiple times, but I got into it from a hippie group of friends that had read The Secret and talked a lot about it. At first I scoffed at the idea because it would imply that there&#39;s more to this world that meets the eye. But after reading the book and puttiing it into practice wierd things started happening.</p>

<p>One thing I never understood about my friends is why they always had girls head over heels for them being average and one who was below average looking when I asked them they said you have to percieve yourself as attractive and others will. I started this and like my friends girls started paying attention.</p>

<p>Not just that but much stranger things happened like going with my friend who needed a job to apply where my brother worked and saying I wish I had a Pho especially with some siracy but I have no cash (While in my mind trying to attract it, I know it sounds wierd but I&#39;m a bit crazy). We go into the place and my brother asks me if I want a Pho because his friend had added too much sirachi and didn&#39;t want it. As I ate the practically untouched pho my friend had this suprised look on her face.</p>

<p>Another time while with the same friend and some other people we go to a gas station to buy beers and she left the keys inside her caar so we&#39;re outside trying to figure something out. I start imaginging getting help because like I said I believed in this law of attraction a lot and low and behold a couple sees us outside the car and asks us if we&#39;re locked out. We tell thhem we are and they said same thing happened to them yesterday and they had a hangar and proceeded to jimmy the car door open.</p>

<p>Another time I was coming back from my first day of work and I remember thinkging to myself I wish I had some weed  started thing to myself that I was going to find some on my bike ride home. Again I was amused when next to the sidewalk on the side of the street there was a bag of a 1/4 oz of really good weed that was also really dense and lasted a while, I joked it was God Weed to my firends.</p>

<p>One last example is when My best friend Brandon told me and my group of friends that he was going to die in a couple of months due to organ ffailure. Apparently he had been given some medicine for a genetic disorder and his body had not reacted well. I had already noticed he was really skinny and didn&#39;t look well. In my crazy thinking I told him not to believe the docters and to imagine surviving and that your not going to die. He got better over the next few wekeks and didn&#39;t end up dying. </p>

<p>To finish, these are just the stories I remember the most but I could write a bunch more. I swear I haven&#39;t lied about any of it, I have no reason to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One suggestion I might make is about the initial internal paradigm shift between atheism/hard agnosticism and really jiving with &quot;quantum&quot; psychology or new age topics. Western secularism plays ALL of its games by the rule that empirical perception should govern and define belief. However, the reverse is also true: in all things psychological and mind/body related, beliefs <em>affect</em> perceptions. Unless you are crazy accomplished in meditation or something, the entirety of life is placebo and perception.</p>

<p>I kind of believe in the secret but I feel like it misses the point somewhat. It shouldn&#39;t be used to increase materialism, even if certain synchronicities do drop money, food, medicines etc into your lap(and it does happen!). I think there is an element of eschatological meaning to it. When you are living your life properly(taking care of yourself, following your curiosities, not dwelling in mental/emotional states that are imbalancing, being yourself as much as possible) you are moving towards that spectacular future and because there is meaning that we are pursuing as a fundamental fact of being alive, we are all rewarded for following the plan so to speak. It isn&#39;t that you attract things with a psychic ability or are imposing your will on the universe, instead it is that you are so in line with an ideal that you just know what needs to happen or could happen before the item-event has manifest in the world of form. </p>

<p>The phenomenon in my own life which convinced me of the above brings me to my next point. Before my meaningful LSD trips(4 or 5 of them), I start to trip earlier in the day or the day before, before I even touched the LSD. The easy argument against that is that it was placebo. The only thing I can say to that is that if I had the ability to create those sensations and experiences totally through an act of will or convincing myself then I would have absolutely no reason to ever seek more stoned or trips. Now, I do fully believe that it actually is possible to trip(or better) while sober through concentrative abilities but I am not there yet. So my question for you was whether you had any experience with mushrooms, lsd, DMT and other substances like that, or any forms of meditation? These modalities are esteemed for providing some sort of cosmic event if you&#39;re looking for that sort of thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, appreciate the insights. I had a pretty amazing experience with salvia one time. A complete loss of ego where I had no sense of self at all. The only way I could ever describe it is that I was a point of energy, or light. It played a big role in opening my mind to these kinds of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff man. Sounds like you&#39;re already on a path. Drugs are a shortcut and lots of fun but learning to use your mind on your own time with meditation, lucid dreaming and stuff like that has the real power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO basic breath focus(&quot;anapana&quot; if you want to google it) is the best medicine against depression, anxiety, concentration issues... The problem is that it is very hard to make money on so it never gets trials or any research. I really think that the majority of ritalin/aderall/antidepressant/xanax cases could be solved with a habit of 20m-1h of anapana once or twice a day. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard so many people say &quot;well I <em>should</em> meditate but I can&#39;t concentrate&quot; or blame it on some psychological issue like that. Of course, maybe your situation is way worse than I am imagining. But if you&#39;re a reasonably put together human being and not in danger of totally losing your shit, you absolutely can meditate. </p>

<p>Anapana isn&#39;t about having to first clear out all thoughts before you can begin. It begins as soon as you think of starting and it begins again every time you notice that you are distracted by thoughts. Fighting away the thoughts and trying to force yourself to be empty or whatever isn&#39;t how it works. All you do is breathe and when you notice that you&#39;re thinking again you let that train go without judging it or fighting it and just go back to breathing. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of effort, you will find that your mind starts to empty itself on its own. That&#39;s when the really fun stuff can happen. But not meditating because you can&#39;t first set down your anxiety or whatever is a misconception. Meditation doesn&#39;t begin once you are empty of all thought, meditation is the act of redefining your relationship with your thoughts. If you were already empty, there&#39;d be no way to measure your progress! A common metaphor is thoughts are clouds in the sky and the sky is still the sky whether or not the clouds are in it--it doesn&#39;t have to wait until the clouds are gone before it can be the sky. Additionally, once you stop trying to direct or control or expend energy on/at the clouds you will find that there are less of them naturally.</p>

<p>The law of attraction is the name given to the belief that &quot;like attracts like&quot; and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.[1][2][3][4] This belief is based upon the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from &quot;pure energy&quot;, and the belief that like energy attracts like energy.[5] One example used by a proponent of the law of attraction is that if a person opened an envelope expecting to see a bill, then the law of attraction would &quot;confirm&quot; those thoughts and contain a bill when opened. A person who decided to instead expect a cheque might, under the same law, find a cheque instead of a bill.[6]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve learned is feeling = manifestation. You can focus all you want to attract stuff, but that doesn&#39;t do much when compared to focusing on the feeling of already having what it is you desire. It is the feeling s that are produced by doing this that alledgedly resonate with the universe and attract the things you want.</p>

<p>Also, by saying things like (I have so much debt, or so much bills, or not enough money,&quot; you are apparently telling the universe that this is what you want. More importantly, when you <em>feel</em> like you don&#39;t have enough, you are resonating inadequacy with the universe, inviting only more inadequacy into your life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about how we feel. The more we focus on positive feelings, the easier it becomes to cause manifestation.</p>

<p>Or so the research I&#39;ve done says...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the last few years, I&#39;ve given up beseeching God for help. While I appreciate it, (i give glory for luck and whatnot to Him) I&#39;ve taken to taking what I want, I don&#39;t mean thieving, (other than women, they are their own beings and if they are willing, then I am able) but it seems apparent to me that life is meant to be lived, not observed and wished at.  I haven&#39;t perfected living yet, but my ultimate goal is to have happy fulfilled children who live out their wildest fantasies, which hopefully won&#39;t be limited to sex, as that is easily attainable.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m trying to say is I&#39;m trying to figure it out, but what I do know is that life must be lived, not observed, and too many people spend life on their knees, God gave us feet for a reason, Stand and Deliver. </p>

<p>Even if God doesn&#39;t exist, isn&#39;t life better if you try to do the coolest, most honourable, most brag-worthy thing at every chance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually one of the reasons I was wary about it at first too. Sounded too much like a religion. Then I read one part of it that said you don&#39;t have to believe it for it to work. So I said, wtf, why not try it then? I still can&#39;t say that I believe it to be true, but my life certainly has gotten better and more positive since I&#39;ve been implementing some of the techniques and ideas...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only part of  the &quot;Law of Attraction&quot; which the &quot;new agers&quot; can say they &quot;unveiled&quot; is the specific linguistic characterization and the breaking down of the barriers used to keep the understanding away from the masses. </p>

<p>There are occult functions still to be expressed however most have subconsciously held this &quot;belief&quot; for a very long time. It is no secret that if you physically manifest your desires onto an environment that the environment has a really good chance to physically manifest them back to you. If you physically plant a seed, given the right interactions with the environment you will get the desired outcome, a plant. If you physically care for a wild animal on your property, it might too physically care for you some day. Just like providing a stream with care it might provide you with clean water. </p>

<p>However we are all in this together, regardless of your beliefs your non/actions can and will effect not only the environment but the being of another. Hence, we are all one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will dispel the new age thought form and if you&#39;re really taking in what you&#39;re reading, you&#39;ll quickly come to see why the New Age movement is full of garbage. The universe is governed by immutable laws which when you become consciously competent of such laws, you can really apply the law of attraction. This is not New Age. This is as old as time itself. The Master Key System was written BT Charles F Haanel who was a 97th degree Memphis-Misraim Freemason.</p>

<p>the law of attraction <em>is</em> real, if you want apples you plant apple seeds; not lemon seeds. often i think, altho&#39; it&#39;s good to discuss the problems of the world, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to seek ways to solve the problems. </p>

<p>based on the law: focusing on what you don&#39;t want, will not manifest what you do want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To tell you the truth I didn&#39;t believe this either at first being a athiest that had read THe God Delushion multiple times, but I got into it from a hippie group of friends that had read The Secret and talked a lot about it. At first I scoffed at the idea because it would imply that there&#39;s more to this world that meets the eye. But after reading the book and puttiing it into practice wierd things started happening.</p>

<p>One thing I never understood about my friends is why they always had girls head over heels for them being average and one who was below average looking when I asked them they said you have to percieve yourself as attractive and others will. I started this and like my friends girls started paying attention.</p>

<p>Not just that but much stranger things happened like going with my friend who needed a job to apply where my brother worked and saying I wish I had a Pho especially with some siracy but I have no cash (While in my mind trying to attract it, I know it sounds wierd but I&#39;m a bit crazy). We go into the place and my brother asks me if I want a Pho because his friend had added too much sirachi and didn&#39;t want it. As I ate the practically untouched pho my friend had this suprised look on her face.</p>

<p>Another time while with the same friend and some other people we go to a gas station to buy beers and she left the keys inside her caar so we&#39;re outside trying to figure something out. I start imaginging getting help because like I said I believed in this law of attraction a lot and low and behold a couple sees us outside the car and asks us if we&#39;re locked out. We tell thhem we are and they said same thing happened to them yesterday and they had a hangar and proceeded to jimmy the car door open.</p>

<p>Another time I was coming back from my first day of work and I remember thinkging to myself I wish I had some weed  started thing to myself that I was going to find some on my bike ride home. Again I was amused when next to the sidewalk on the side of the street there was a bag of a 1/4 oz of really good weed that was also really dense and lasted a while, I joked it was God Weed to my firends.</p>

<p>One last example is when My best friend Brandon told me and my group of friends that he was going to die in a couple of months due to organ ffailure. Apparently he had been given some medicine for a genetic disorder and his body had not reacted well. I had already noticed he was really skinny and didn&#39;t look well. In my crazy thinking I told him not to believe the docters and to imagine surviving and that your not going to die. He got better over the next few wekeks and didn&#39;t end up dying. </p>

<p>To finish, these are just the stories I remember the most but I could write a bunch more. I swear I haven&#39;t lied about any of it, I have no reason to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I finished Tao Te Ching a few days ago. It was a recent translation.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. </p>

<p>Truth is subjective for the most part. I was just suggesting Hermeticism and Kaballah because those two systems are deeply embedded at the core of western thought, philosophy, religion, psychology, law, and even Magickal practice and theory, itself.</p>

<p>I never said that those two systems were the ultimate &quot;way&quot; or anything, as you suggested.</p>

<p>Any serious occultist can tell you the &quot;New Age&quot; is just a mundane translation of Theosophy poured out into a shallow, but broad pond. 
It touches the surface of something much deeper.</p>
