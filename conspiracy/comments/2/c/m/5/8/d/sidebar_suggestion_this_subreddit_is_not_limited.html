       I propose an addendum to the sidebar of this subreddit to (hopefully) stop the belabored "...so where's the conspiracy?" comments. Those comments are annoying and do not contribute any value to the discussions here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, potentially another rule to incorporate warnings to those who do this. It should be clear that an actual, eloquent debate about whether or not something is a conspiracy should be encouraged, just not the one-liner dismissive comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all seen this subreddit become somewhat an "alternative news" outlet due to the exponential rise in reddit censorship. Many articles that are posted here (or x-posted) have been removed in other subreddits due to questionable reasons, so they arrive here. We've even reached the front page on numerous occasions which is awesome!
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be some purists who consider this "corrupting" the subreddit itself but I disagree. Posting a "weak" conspiracy theory here is far more of a detriment (even while appropriate) than an interesting article that has been suppressed elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people become "conspiracy theorists" due to thinking critically and taking the official stories with a grain of salt. Alternative news is typically what we look for as we all are very skeptical and distrusting of the mainstream media. It is only logical that this subreddit would organically evolve to include this content.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, you can't please everyone. There will be those who dislike this and those who appreciate it. From what I can tell, these annoying comments of "what conspiracy?" are often down voted and seem to be frowned upon, suggesting the subreddit does not thrive off these.

       It should go without saying...

      <p>
       I find it curious that a subreddit, seemingly populated by questioning, skeptical and free-thinking people can't work it out for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often post things that fit patterns or illustrate various topics that I think should raise flags, doubts or questions. Developments that shouldn't just be
       <em>
        shrugged
       </em>
       off.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the vast majority of people become so desensitized that they can no longer perceive changes in the flow of current events; it's useful to have the

        canaries in the coal mine

       <em>
        it is that

       You have to consider there are orchestrated groups that have it in to undermine this subreddit. That and there are people who are honestly just either ignorant, obtuse, or trolling for "lulz" and comment accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being an open group (meaning not invitational) means we will get everyone, including the bad apples. I think it is important to weed them out, but also be upfront and transparent about it (hence the sidebar and rules).

       What I find perplexing is the mysterious lack of conversation going on here. There is less than a few hundred comments on the entire front page of this sub combined at any given time. I don't know what it means but there has to be something to it.

       My guess is that a lot of people subscribe to this as somewhat an "RSS feed". They come to find interesting articles and things to read, and never post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that there is anything wrong with it, it is similar with standard web forums. Lots of "lurkers," and often times they become members/contributors over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least we are exposing more people to information they would otherwise be repressed from seeing (in the MSM). There have been a lot of "come to Jesus" moments here on this subreddit where members have posted how they "woke up" and now are going through all the information they can find. It's great.

       I post very conservative here, I tend to just bypass comment threads I don't buy into the theory on, as I am fairly conservative about it and think most things are much more haphazard than people think.

       This times a million.

       This subreddit is not a place for people to play semantic games like "Hurr, I though a conspiracy had to involve 2 people because that's what Webster's Dictionary says".
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the ever famous "Where's the conspiracy" post found in every fucking thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the moderators start listening to user suggestions and then involving the community, this place will continue to be still like a stagnant pool of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, this sub is being destroyed by people, intentionally, and we are doing nothing to make it harder for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will never stop them, and a lot of people capitalize on that as an excuse to do nothing about it. But we can make it
       <em>
        harder
       </em>
       for them, by being a community that aggressively battles back against those who wish to stop our discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, most subs can make some rules and the mods can sit back and chill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not here. We are a target precisely because we talk about the things we do.
      </p>

       The target needs to move. As a target, standing still is the dumbest thing we could be doing and it is showing.

       Very well said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, not all of us stand in the same place, even if we are in one spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll put this lightly but as representative as I can, some of us have opinions about free speech, versus racial issues, controversial political views etc.. This assuredly causes a lot of friction.
      </p>
      <p>
       These views and opinions tend to be what divide us. Whereas some solidarity would go a long fuckin' way. It should not be focal points on what seperates us but what unites us, and two things come to mind;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          While I may not agree with what you say, I'd defend to the death your right to say it.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Some people think those who hold any "controversial" views are not true members of this sub. Whereas some do, and believe in free speech so adamantly (myself included) that they are willing to defend them. How do you get true representation and balance?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, it is hard to unite as a community when there is obviously some polarization on many issues. And those groups you mentioned, they always
       <em>
        capitalize
       </em>
       on that division.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is more participation, to focus less about the things we hate about one another, and more about compromise and betterment of this subreddit.

       It's been awhile since I've seen you haha. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I believe our diversity of thought is what unites us. Discussion s, discourse, and even debates work best when there are opposing sides that respect each others right of perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the lack of  this level of respect that I feel causes a lot of friction amongst users. The arrogant comments that only say, "where's the conspiracy?" Or those comments like "troll! Shill! Wrong!" Whatever, are useless and based on ignorance and disrespect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can get passed the fact that there are over 200k users here with just as many opinions, we will be united. We can argue, we can discuss, we can debate topics, but only with respect can we do those things constructively.
      </p>
      <p>
       By embrassing our divisions, we take back the power that those who capitalize on the same could wield against us. Just my opinion, of course...

       Yeah I been around, I just lurk more lately, and tend to comment infrequently. Hope you've been decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't agree more though, and I would have worded it that way if I wasn't trying to be so ambiguous. being ideologically diverse is good, being disrespectful is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed I am all for proper debate, especially with people I disagree, those conversations usually last longer and sometimes things can be learned. Whereas I usually don't enjoy talking to or reading when a person is disrespectful.

       Agreed, and I think we need to make some changes here. The most important part is that we do not become the beast we are "against". We should be transparent, fair, straightforward, and always open to discussion about how we operate.

       I look at it as a way toeither supress information as you said, or antagonize users who post incidents, events or what have you, that can leave the conspiracy

       would be the shelling of children, civillians. And the

       I'd not be too upset if it were made an actual rule or anything official, but I'd prefer it as a suggestion, where users could if not cite it directly, at least utilize the reasoning behind it, and call out the people saying it for no other purpose than to dissuay people from reading the article.

       If you look and read other 'conspiracy' forums it quickly becomes clear that they do not just cover conspiracy related content, fringe topics and indeed many lunatic-fringe subjects are openly posted and discussed.

       has become more of an alternative news page in recent years and no bad thing, the difficulty however is finding a balance. We are in essence a conspiracy page, i personally try to keep my posts varied and that take into account a wide range of conspiratorial issues - such as the current side-bar link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the mods get flamed for removing unworthy content. The reality is that it is a juggling game. The whole mod team recognizes the need for a larger scope of topics here, but where do we draw the line?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Where is the conspiracy?" Is an annoyance i agree but look at the page name. We will always attract such comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our users can think of a work around, or a well worded rule regarding alternative news and stories being posted here that are not strictly conspiratorial but of fringe interest we will listen and look to implement the suggested rule change.

       Imo many "fringe" topics could be labelled as "forbidden investigations", or prohibitted questions. Not for this sub, but in reality life in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if it is a topic that if an expert scientist were to seriously and publicly discuss, at the risk of losing their career, then I feel it belongs here. For example, discussion of extraterrestrials. That is a career ender (or used to be, anyhow) for many astrophysicists/scientists, but does not necessitate a conspiracy. That is, of course, unless you count the suppression of knowledge/information and coverups that go hand in hand with alien discussions as a conspiracy to suppress the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But having to explain why certain topics are relevant kind of takes away from the essence of open discussion. Such fringe topics, I believe, are easily connected to conspiracies, and so any posts concerning those topics should be considered as such, even if the OP does not dictate the connection. Especially if they are self.posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link posts are a little different. When you cross the low investment effort it takes to make a link post with a subject matter that is not easily recognized as relevant, that is when you cross the line, imo. I have much more tolerance for self.posts that invite discussion versus link posts that serve as karma bait for some users and discourage discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, this is just me. And there is like a quarter million other users of this sub...

       'a cop shot my dog' / 'a cop groped me' / 'a cop abused me at a traffic stop' doesn't belong here. it happens everyday, in every country of the world. just because everyone has a video camera with them these days doesn't make it any more interesting or important.

       If these things bother you that much then you should vote/comment/reply. Educate the one who asks the question, because some are sincere, and deserve an answer. For many, voting on a comment is enough, but to truly matter, people need to comment.

       Instead of just posting articles, or self posts about what to do, users should post more self posts on current theories or former ones. Show their research as a self post. User dialogue should be encouraged, not controlled. Any attempt to use rules to deny speech, can only be viewed as censorship.

       I agree with some of your suggestions. I think its important to encourage debate because whats the point in having a "theory" and not being able to defend (Maybe not defend... but support) your position. A lot of posters are lazy when it comes to this, and others are just plain dismissive if people challenge them or give contradicting info. For some reason people feel compelled to pump out as many conspiracy articles as possible for that sweet karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree that articles that challenge the current narrative are beneficial to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       However content that has been removed from other subs could have a better home than here. Because then it just becomes a reddit circle jerk, and I think there are already subs that handle exactly this. Maybe the mods should include more subs that are related to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the side bar?

       One thing that has been driving me nuts lately is the anti-Jewish articles getting passed around. They dont always make it very far but this sub is getting quite a name for itself as being anti-semetic. Israel does not represent Judaism, they just happen to be Jewish... Ive literally been called a JDIF shill for trying to get folks to back off the Jew thing.

       smart people clearly distinguish between the Jewish State of Israel (i.e., netenyahu's israel) and "Jews" (who live in every other country around the world, and have essentially NOTHING to do with Israel -- just like most "christians" had NOTHING to do with Cheney/Bush' invasion of Iraq and subsequent torture of innocent Iraqi civilians).

       I've seen it posted in cases where there is an

       conspiracy and I'm starting to think it's part of the anti-conspiracy campaign to undermine this subreddit.

       This subreddit is about contributing information, evaluating it, and even challenging others (respectfully). But when someone "contributes" with the equivalent of "cool story bro," it's just rude and immature.

      <p>
       I wouldn't mind if the person posted something like, "I don't believe this one is a conspiracy, it could be an honest mistake of XYZ. Here's why.." At least that's a valid counterpoint and not just a dismissive comment with zero value.

       The bigger issue is that this sub is a ghetto. Walled off and segregated along with all the particular content of interest; one dense, meticulously collected, concentrated data point perfect for study and analysis. All the rotten eggs in one basket, so to speak.

       Other than that, I think your post can be implemented in a more organized way if we allowed tagging ([9/11], [Israel], etc) like r/science and others do. That way, we users can choose what we wish to find and what to filter out.

       Well maybe if people actually point out what they are trying to infer when they post some off the wall shit that seems to have no conspiracy connected to it, we wouldn't have this problem.

       Here is why you get the snarky comment in here all the time. The majority of people in here are hateful. They cant help it that is what this sub is about.  We all know that a change is needed and that we cant do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       99 percent of the ones that will actually comment dont know what they can do to help others. I was one of them. So I am speak in from experiance. I gave up cause the fury was consuming me in more ways then one. I gave up being proactive and now I just answer questions about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone wants proof all the time in here as they ask for a source. Screw that. It isn't like they will belive a thing they read anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just let it go op. The trolls that populate this sub will just downvote you anyways till your comment cant be seen without clicking on it anyways. Let the ones that wanna argue do that. It has long been clear that this sub along with others on reddit are being shaped so find a new resource and just read what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commenting and posting in this sub is a futile task.

       Well, the post should at least be able to be connected to a conspiracy. For instance, I recently made a post about a theory that we are actually living inside a Black Hole. I did get a comment that asked where's the conspiracy, but that user continued on with the discussion which was awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what I am saying is, technically, my post wasn't directly talking about a conspiracy, though, it was concerning a theory that could be suppressed for obvious reasons. When there is suppression of a certain knowledge, information, or even simple questions, it can be tied into a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, where did Man come from? God? Aliens? The truth isn't known. And if it was, it is being suppressed. Regardless, there is definately a negative reaction to these certain topics that aren't "mainstream", and therefore get ignored by the "experts", disregarding any plausibility it may contain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to sum up, I think submissions should at least be relatable to conspiracies, but does not need to strictly present a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just me, though. I feel I am fairly tolerant of off topic posts, anyways...
