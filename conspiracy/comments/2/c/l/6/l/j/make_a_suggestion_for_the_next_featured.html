    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;amp;artid=167"><strong>9/11 - the New Pearl Harbor</strong></a>.  By far the best, most comprehensive, most well-organized, most rational documentary on 9/11 in my opinion.</p>

<p>Some description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor&quot; is a 5 hour documentary that summarizes 12 years of public debate on 9/11. While aimed primarily at a general, uninformed audience, the film also contains some new findings that may be of interest to advanced researchers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This documentary is <strong>very different from most conspiracy theory documentaries in that it does not forward its own theory</strong>, instead it simply asks questions stemming from the official theory of events.  In this way, it is more open to a general audience and something you can share with more people without tinfoil-hat type responses.  In my humble opinion, these questions become quite damning.</p>

<p><strong>Index</strong></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>0.01:02 - 12 parallels between Pearl 
Harbor and September 11</p>

<p>1.01:52 - Ziad Jarrah (UA93)</p>

<p>1.03:06 - Hani Hanjour (AA77)</p>

<p>1.04:00 - The debunkers&#39; positions</p>

<p>1.48:30 - The debunkers&#39; position</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.americanradicalthefilm.com:">http://www.americanradicalthefilm.com:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>American Radical is the probing, definitive documentary about Jewish-American political scientist Norman Finkelstein. A devoted son of holocaust survivors, an ardent critic of Israel and US Middle East policy, Finkelstein has been steadfast at the centre of many intractable controversies, including his denial of tenure at DePaul University. Called a lunatic and self-hating Jew by some and an inspirational street-fighting revolutionary by others, Finkelstein is a deeply polarising figure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: In light of what Israel is doing right now, this seemed like a good pick. If anyone is unfamiliar with Finkelstein, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNQSV3BBtZ4">here&#39;s</a> a short clip of him criticizing people who continue to exploit the holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to nominate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWd4KblpDsc">The Origins of AIDS</a> from 2004.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438938/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">imdb link</a></p>

<p>From an imdb review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a careful step by step look at the probability that AIDS started as a disease in chimps and crossed over man in polio vaccine in the late 1950&#39;s in Africa. It begins with a story in Rolling Stone back in the late 80&#39;s or early 90&#39;s that was crucified in the scientific community not because it wasn&#39;t possible, rather because it named the wrong monkeys used and attacked a pillar of the research community and then moves on from there to later investigations on the subject which show very clearly that the race to cure polio may have made us the target of something worse. </p>

<p>Using the words of those involved as well as the papers and documentary films from the time this is a chilling look at how science can go really wrong and how scientists will circle the wagons to protect one of their own, even in the face of evidence that something is afoot.</p>

<p>I like the calm and unsensational connecting of the dots that is used to lay out the case keeping everything on a level playing field, even at the end where the film makers say flat out that short of ever coming upon a sample of the drug from that time we will never know if this is a source of the HIV/AIDS virus. </p>

<p>However there is enough circumstantial evidence to make you reasonably sure that they have gotten things right. (an interesting note is the quoted exchange of letters between competing scientists where one warns that the other that his vaccine appears to be contaminated with an unknown and here to fore never seen before virus, a warning that was completely dismissed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That warning, btw, was given by polio vaccine pioneer Albert Sabin to Hilary Koprowski, who was running the fraudulent polio vaccine campaign in Africa (fraudulent because he claimed WHO was backing him...which was a lie).</p>

<p>Sabin tested Koprowski&#39;s vaccine and claimed to have found a mysterious &quot;unknown virus&quot; that had contaminated the polio vaccine Koprowski was using in Africa.</p>

<p>Koprowski pretty much said fuck you.</p>

<p>He was truly an evil man. It was somewhat shocking when he was given so much praise by the press when he died last year.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another imdb review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why this documentary is not considered worthy of prime-time airing, allowing a far greater number of the population to see it and draw their own conclusions escapes me. But then again, maybe not.</p>

<p>In essence, was the HIV pandemic created by a fluke accident of tribal rituals or the &#39;cut hunter&#39; theory, i.e. tribal hunters in central Africa (the Belgian Congo, now Zaire) becoming exposed to contaminated monkey blood containing SIV (Simian Imunodefficency Virus) through cuts or abrasions on themselves, or was this tragedy &#39;man made&#39; through mass inoculations in Africa of Polio vaccine which had been cultured from monkey tissue contaminated with SIV which, when entering humans turns to HIV.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but my simple advice would be, make this the next documentary you watch, I was hooked from beginning to end. One of its strengths is the way it puts across all the evidence supporting its key theories in a very matter-of-fact, understated way, hence avoiding slipping into the dangerous arena of &#39;sensationalist journalism&#39;. It&#39;s enthralling, intelligent and, as one may imagine, deeply disturbing. It&#39;s a film, I believe, that should be seen by as many people as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely a must-see. Stop reading comments and go see it. When you&#39;re done, come back and read, if you are still able to. More likely your mouth will be stuck in an open position, your body in a state of near-paralysis on the couch. This is mind-bending stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The rise of Putin and the fall of the russian-jewish oligarchs&quot; or as IMDB it apparently calls &quot;Vlast&quot;.</p>

<p>When communism is falling in Russia there suddenly opens a climate perfect for the predator classes, multiple businessmen do their best to get close to the then president Boris Yeltsin, they go play tennis together and they try to rub shoulders as much as possible. The result of this is Yeltsin selling off resource extraction companies that were publicly owned for pennies on the dollar. The Oligarchs as they are called start gaining massive sums of money on natural resources that according to Putin didn&#39;t belong to them but Russia. With these exploits they not only become incredibly affluent but they become powerful, they understand that it is important to get into politics and even control media to shape perception. </p>

<p>It was hard to get into anything political without having been approved by these people, they are basically running the country. Then suddenly there is Vladimir Putin a young guy that is being pushed forward as a representative, he is able to befriend and be trusted by some of those most powerful Oligarchs and he gets to power. What he then does is why I personally look up to him and trust him. He gathers a meeting with these people and he tells them the order of business is going to change dramatically, they thought they had put their own man in power but instead they had put in their worst enemy. He collectivized their private exploits and jailed those who were working against him, most fled to Israel for asylum. The western (Jewish controlled) media railed against Putin for what he was doing, he was portrayed as a tyrant and fascist but Putin was merely protecting Russia, he did what nobody managed to do in America, he prevented them from owning and ruling the country. You will see massive amounts of parallels between American and Russia and how it all went down. Maybe if he was shot like JFK it wouldn&#39;t have happened but his timing was perfect. </p>

<p>Imdb gave this a 7,2 rating but that&#39;s because they are idiots. One of the best docu&#39;s Iv ever seen because its so relevant to the world today and it talks with the oligarchs themselves. </p>

From imdb.com</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The modern day Four Horsemen continue to ride roughshod over the people who can least afford it. Crises are converging when governments, religion and mainstream economists have stalled. 23 international thinkers come together and break their silence about how the world really works and why there is still hope in re-establishing a moral and just society. Four Horsemen is free from mainstream media propaganda, doesn&#39;t bash bankers, criticize politicians or get involved in conspiracy theories. The film ignites the debate about how we usher a new economic paradigm into the world which, globally, would dramatically improve the quality of life for billions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on all governments to join with the United States and the community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture and in undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment. I call on all nations to speak out against torture in all its forms and to make ending torture an essential part of their diplomacy. I further urge governments to join America and others in supporting torture victims&#39; treatment centers, contributing to the UN Fund for the Victims of Torture, and supporting the efforts of non-governmental organizations to end torture and assist its victims.</p>

<p>No people, no matter where they reside, should have to live in fear of their own government. Nowhere should the midnight knock foreshadow a nightmare of state-commissioned crime. The suffering of torture victims must end, and the United States calls on all governments to assume this great mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best friend just completed this documentary that expands on Kubricks Odyssey and others, but focuses on the movie eyes wide shut and the occult symbolism, mostly on Stanley&#39;s genius more than anything. It starts a bit slow, but I think that is by design. He did everything himself, I had no idea he was even doing it. He made me promise to not share it with any of our mutual friends. He is an Italian with a strict Catholic family, even though he is in his forties, he is scared to have his name associated with this IMHO a master piece, for what he was working with. You will want to watch eyes wide shut again. I love him, he is such a natural genius. He would literally do this with every movie we used to go see in our twenties. It is debuting right here. I&#39;m the only other person that has seen this. Please be kind. If you have helpful critics, I will pass them along. This isn&#39;t necessarily the final cut so your opinions or any knowledgeable side notes could very well make it into the final cut. Thank you in advance for viewing and your opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do, this is definitely one I am looking forward to seeing. I watched something on YouTube a while back related to this subject when I was rabbit-holing fake moon landing stuff. IIRC it posited that Kubrick may have been killed because that occult ritual scene in the movie was far too close to the truth of what happens in the secret occult rituals the elite participate in. I downloaded the complete unrated version of Eyes Wide Shut off Pirate Bay and watched it again a couple of times as a result. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intent on shaking up the ultimate &#39;sacred cow&#39; for Jews, Israeli director Yoav Shamir embarks on a provocative - and at times irreverent - quest to answer the question, &quot;What is anti-Semitism today?&quot; Does it remain a dangerous and immediate threat? Or is it a scare tactic used by right-wing Zionists to discredit their critics? Speaking with an array of people from across the political spectrum (including the head of the Anti-Defamation League and its fiercest critic, author Norman Finkelstein) and traveling to places like Auschwitz (alongside Israeli school kids) and Brooklyn (to explore reports of violence against Jews), Shamir discovers the realities of anti-Semitism today. His findings are shocking, enlightening and - surprisingly - often wryly funny.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Discover the definitive truth about 9/11 and learn why even the most popular movies on the subject have failed to address the evidence exhaustively presented in this video.
 The facts will make it abundantly clear that the so-called 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; movement has been infiltrated and is ultimately controlled by the same criminal group who masterminded the attacks.</p>

<p>As they say, &quot;if you want to control the dissent you lead the dissent.&#39; Utilizing evidence from the FBI, CIA, NSA, US Armed Forces Intelligence sectors, Foreign Intelligence organizations, local law enforcement agencies and independent investigators, Missing Links goes where no other 9/11 video has dared to.</p>

<p>Israel&#39;s negative impact on America &amp; other countries: 9/11, attack on USS Liberty, theft of state secrets, control of our government&#39;s policies re the Middle East and much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when economic liberalism was conceived we didn&#39;t have the ability or knowledge to understand that there&#39;s an abundance of goods and energy resources to sustain human consumption for thousands of years. 
Thus we have a barter system using currency which is fundamentally flawed and doesn&#39;t account for technological advancement and our ability to care for the mass majority of human life.  Instead it relies on the movement of money and capital to keep our society running. 
Imagine if we dropped the monetary system and were able to sustain ourselves thru common sense distribution of goods instead of a system based on the pursuit of wealth and consolidation. We have the technology and manpower, but our reliance on a 300 year old interpretation of a monetary system holds us back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4</a></p>

<p>Award winning filmmaker Bart Sibrel presents his highly acclaimed (and much hated) controversial documentary showcasing newly discovered behind-the-scenes out-takes from the first mission
to the moon, proving that the crew never left earth orbit.</p>

<p>Never before in all of recorded aviation has a flying machine worked on its first attempt, much less the most complicated one ever imagined, landing on another heavenly body on its maiden voyage, and returning roundtrip with a crew that lived to tell,
all with 1960&#39;s technology. (More computing power is found today in a $10 watch.)</p>

<p>According to William Kaysing, a NASA contractor for Apollo,
a classified interdepartmental memo rated the odds of a successful and survivable manned lunar landing on its first attempt at one in ten thousand. That is why the returning men of the mission looked so dejected rather than triumphant at their press conference,
as they were blackmailed into lying about the alleged greatest accomplishment of mankind, to the detriment of their own souls.</p>

<p>Sibrel has been interviewed, and his documentary about
the moon landings have been featured on, The Tonight Show,
The Daily Show, Geraldo at Large, The Abrams Report,
Coast to Coast, NBC, CNN, FOX, Time Magazine,
The New York Times, The L.A. Times, The Washington Post
and USA Today.</p>
