<p>it is not &#39;properly&#39; airborne, but the animals in the trial had evidence of contracting the virus through inhaling it. it apparently got suspended on droplets sent into the air by sneezing or coughing.</p>

<p>The CDC AVOIDS saying it is NOT airborne.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-20341423">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-20341423</a>
Canadian scientists prove its airborne to a limited extent. aka. large particulate suspended in air by coughing.</p>

<p>and here is the study, which points out that the infection seemed to be starting in the oral nasal cavity, and in the lungs. aka the animal inhaled it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to explain now why Reston does not infect humans, and why Zaire is not aggressively airborne.  At the very least we know ebola has a mutation easily available to it that causes aggressive airborne spread.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Canadian study did demonstrate airborne spread, but did not show how aggressive that spread is.</p>

<p>One shred of good news is the fact that only one out of ten doctors working with ebola victims has contracted the disease.  That means that in the vast majority of cases, the shitty tyvek overalls and hood were successful at stopping transmission.  In the remainder I think non-airborne contamination (shit and vomit) is more than sufficient to explain 10%, especially considering the terrible conditions in ebola wards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>then why doesnt anyone explain to me why humans cant suspend ebola virus in the air on water droplets via coughing if pigs and monkeys can. i, being a non expert, think thats kinda easy to to. virus is in your mouth and nose, your aspirating blood. you cough. whatever is in your mucus and saliva goes airborne. granted it might not survive long outside a moist warm environment but the fact of the matter is i dont see any reason given my limited knowledge and understanding that its not possible. common sense.</p>

<p>i honestly dont see where it HAS to mutate to be spreadable by moist airborne particulates from human to human. please enlighten me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. Since you&#39;re not willing to look into it and research yourself I&#39;ll explain. The viral load of the current outbreak in airborne saliva would be too low to allow for infection by a cough suspended in the air and the virus dies relatively quickly when exposed to air. Its ability to infect is negligible in this way. I mean if someone infected coughed on you into your mouth or on a wound then yeah there&#39;s a high chance you may contract it but the key point is the virus cannot survive for any great length of time outside of the host. If it did, you&#39;d see a much higher infection rate in Africa at the moment. The other strain you mentioned which doesn&#39;t infect humans can survive longer outside of the host. Therefore the current strain in Africa would have to develop the ability to survive outside the host for extended periods to be considered airborne. So seriously, do some research before you start spouting off uninformed nonsense. You&#39;re getting down voted because you are wrong, and nothing else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on all the experience we have with filoviruses?  Out of a few strain types, one is aggressively airborne and the others kill 60-90% of victims.</p>

<p>There are many mutations possible that cause aggressive airborne spread.  Only a subset of those will cause less virulency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Reston can survive best in vapor (has the longest halflife.)  Perhaps it has a different coating composition that impinges on its virulency in tissue.</p>

<p>what the Mayo <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebola-virus/basics/prevention/con-20031241">says</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow infection-control procedures. If you&#39;re a health care worker, wear protective clothing, such as gloves, masks, gowns and eye shields. Keep infected people isolated from others. </p>

<p>what the CDC <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html">says</a> (go read the long list of guidelines)</p>

<p>PPE ie personal protection equipment.</p>

<p>the health care professionals <strong>ABSOLUTELY</strong> consider breathing in possibly contaminated air dangerous.</p>

<p>if theres only a 1% chance of becoming infected per hour of being with an Ebola patient, how many hours until you do become infected ?</p>

<p>How in the holy fuck would you possibly know that? Do you work with the current strain of the ebola virus, or are you just making shit up because you looked something up on Wiki? And don&#39;t just say research! If you have done research you should be able to show your research. Otherwise it is always assumed that you have not done any. That is academia.  If you want to seem superior to others by use of your intellect, then you need to prove the shit that pours form your mouth, not just insult people. Seriously, you couldn&#39;t have made a point or offered information without being a patronizing dick? Nothing further that you say will have any worth, because you just discredited yourself with your abuse. Next time you make a point, be civil and respectful and people might actually consider NOT arguing with you out of spite and a need to piss off arseholes.</p>

<p>I beg to differ. He is getting downvoted because people think he is wrong. There is a difference.</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t wrong. It can be transmitted through the air. It&#39;s just much harder for the reasons you pointed out. Maybe the scientific community won&#39;t label it as an &quot;airborne&quot; disease such as influenza, but technically, to be airborne, it has to be able to travel through the air. If we are talking pure semantics here, this virus doors have the capability to survive short periods of time through the air rising on saliva droplets. That is what is considered airborne. </p>

<p>But, it does not do so very well, hence why it isn&#39;t <em>considered</em> airborne. It certainly is possible, though, considering the definitions of the words we are using.</p>

<p>So, he is technically not wrong. It&#39;s just not <em>considered</em> to be transmitted via the air for exactly the reasons you pointed out. Although it is still possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely.  There is nothing magic about the human immune system or respiratory system.</p>

<p>One small piece of good news: apparently only one out of ten health workers working with ebola victims have become ill.  That is a huge number but on the other hand given close proximity with victims, having to clean up after their vomiting and diarrhea etc, it is a small enough number that it does not nearly indicate airborne contagion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the strains have the ability to be transmitted through the air. However, they have a much more difficult time doing so (when compared to other viruses like influenza). It is much more commonly transmitted via direct contact with body fluids.</p>

<p>Remember, even as little as one viable ebola virus organism can be enough to contract the disease. One organism sure can hitch a ride through the air via sneezing/coughing, as salive particulates contain viable organisms of the virus.</p>

<p>Though, like I said, it&#39;s not like influenza where being in a closed off room breathing the same air will probably get you infected. It takes a directional projection of mucus or saliva to be inhaled directly for it to be transmitted through the air.</p>

<p>So, to recap, it is possible, just much less common.</p>
