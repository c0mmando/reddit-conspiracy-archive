<p>He was caught using a number of alternate accounts to downvote people he was arguing with, upvote his own submissions and comments, and downvote submissions made around the same time he posted his own so that he got even more of an artificial popularity boost. It was some pretty blatant vote manipulation, which is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">against our site rules</a>.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Check out <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2c5dyl/bad_luck_unidan/">Bad Luck Unidan&#39;s comments</a>. [deleted]</p>

<p>My theory is they didn&#39;t want a thread showing a massive amount of ignorant support for Unidan. There were many comments in the thread that were blaming the Admins and saying that nothing with the Unidan/crow fiasco was ban-worthy.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s news he&#39;s a vote manipulator so the AdviceAnimals mods are clearing house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think people are quite understanding what is going on, especially the people who are desperately trying to defend him in the link you provide.</p>

<p>Unidan gamed reddit. He used every trick in the book to fool everyone and since the people on this site are literally retarded, it was not hard. If I wanted to screw people on this site and I had a whole system worked out with multiple computers and devices around me, I could downvote any competitor to -5 or -10 within seconds and then the idiot masses would take it from there because they will always <em>look</em> for something wrong in the comment if it is already that low. And they will find it, because everything exists in their own mind.</p>

<p>This is basic human psychology.</p>

<p>People treated Unidan like he was some kind of god when the reality is that he most likely just started out as a bored guy at work, or unemployed, and he could google or access a scientific database so he could copy and paste at will and change it just enough to put it into the &quot;voice&quot; he was going for. His &quot;persona&quot; was very well-crafted and when you add that to his vote manipulation system and strategy to extinguish competitors or naysayers early on, of course the people on the site began to worship him. And he realized it and then went straight for the money shot.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even give two shits about any of this. But when I did notice Unidan was when he started &quot;sponsoring&quot; AMA&#39;s and using the masses new religion -science- as a platform to give other people attention.</p>

<p>I could have told you back then that he was getting paid to do that. He was not doing it out of the goodness of his heart, or for science, or for learning, or whatever other bullshit he fabricated to keep the lemmings following him. He was doing it for straight cash. </p>

<p>People have such a shitty grip on reality that they do not even see these things for what they are. He built an industry around his name and then began to reap the harvest. People from all around the country would pay top dollar to have someone who could promise them millions of views on command and the potential to add links to funding their research or their website, or any number of things.</p>

<p>Reddit is like a fucking ray gun, but it shoots people and money. A few people have been smart enough to figure out its buttons and had the drive to gain a hold of the weapon. You point reddit at something, and you can make all sorts of things happen. I made a posts using my other account about somethin which I will not get into, it went slightly viral for one day, and I got 5000 visitors to a link I threw up there. And they kept coming for weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>And that was nothing, a handful of sand compared to what Unidan could accomplish, he got himself a fucking shovel and could shovel that shit all day.</p>

<p>He probably gave presentations and had charts showing exactly what he could do for the highest bidder. He could promise them the numbers and then he could deliver. I saw it happen multiple times.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, its me Unidan with Professor Givin Me-money from Blah Blah Institute here to talk about something something science.&quot;</p>

<p>The same thing happens all the time. Unidan had to do it the hard way. People from Hollywood merely have to have good agents and they can pump tens of thousands out of this website: </p>

<p>&quot;Hey Cancer Foundation, its me Will Ferrel, I can promise you X amount of money for your cause, how much are going to <em>pay</em> me to be your spokesperson. My agent has a great idea about a drum-off.&quot;</p>

<p>Etc, etc...</p>

<p>Its funny watching it and knowing you are in the small minority who actually gets it.</p>

<p>Gee, I had never even heard of this video and still called it <em>exactly</em> how it is. So maybe people like you should stop being so ego-driven for once and just accept that other people can draw the right conclusions without having to rely on <em>your</em> flawed analysis.</p>

<p>There is points of interest here....</p>

<p>I admit it&#39;s not of global significance but there&#39;s no reason this sub should shy away from it - this sub has been forefront of badgering subs/mods/admins when they act out and it&#39;s almost our duty to investigate.</p>

<p>I admit this is more SRD fodder than conspiracy, but those dudes just sit back with popcorn and attack the supposed &#39;bad guy&#39; with little question of the &#39;whys?&#39;,&#39;what&#39;s going on here&#39;s?&#39; or &#39;Is he really the bad guy or is something else afoot?&#39; questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is more of the speculation type talk that I was interested in. Though I will not deny that this <em>does</em> appear to be more SRD than conspiracy. But it&#39;s still important to have a discussion.</p>

<p>Your point about power users and shitty_watercolour is what I&#39;m interested in. I&#39;m sure the admins knew of Unidan. How could have have had such popularity for so long without the admins catching his manipulation?</p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly curious because of the vote manipulating. I believe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is attacked via vote manipulation. Admins do not seem to be helpful with this issue. Yet they can catch Unidan. Is it because Unidan was a single, important user that the manipulation was easier to spot? That&#39;s my guess.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to use vote manipulation do not be reddit famous.</p>

<p>Less likely is that Unidan actually pissed off the Admins somehow and they showed their wrath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect it&#39;s because the &#39;pro-unidan brigade&#39; is less nebulous and also less an artifact of genuine fucked up social culture than the &#39;anti-conspiracy&#39; brigade is.</p>

<p>Unidan is a tiny target, it&#39;s extremely focussed. Whereas plenty people have reason to deride and attempt to humiliate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>because a) we represent a collective threat to many systems, ideals and beliefs</p>

<p>and b) a good 50% of our output is actually fucking mental.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not deriding the mental output because I find it extremely interesting and many of the bits I dont even follow I find positive and interesting.</p>

<p>That said, many people read a single conspiracy it worries them, then they look it up and see it conflated with moon bases and all sorts of other things and it justifies their derision.</p>

<p>off-topic though....</p>

<p>I think your summary is probably nail on the head.</p>

<p>You get reddit big, you play ball or you get bamz0red. Be interested to speak candidly with unidan after this acrimonious (or not - if af other users have said, he confirmed the allegations) parting of ways.</p>

<p>I commented on the fact that you just accepted what the admins and Unidan posted as truth.  You shouldn&#39;t do something like that, there&#39;s always a chance something is NOT the truth.  Everything is open to speculation.  Unidan has obviously lied about a lot of things, you shouldn&#39;t trust what he says just on that fact.</p>

<p>Hell, if you want an example: Maybe Unidan was doing something even worse and the admins just found out a small part.  Of course he&#39;d confirm that small part, you sacrifice that little bit to try and retain &quot;honesty.&quot;  He later confirmed actively downvoting opposing opinions ONLY AFTER someone had pointed it out.  He&#39;s only admitting whatever they find out about him.  He&#39;s disingenuous and a con.  It&#39;s classic: only admit to what they can prove you did</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re lying or telling the truth, and neither do you.</p>

<p>No evidence is necessary to say: Unidan could be lying, or covering up worse information.  You really shouldn&#39;t just say &quot;well Unidan agreed with the allegations so that must be all there is, no speculation needed.&quot;  It&#39;s naive.</p>

<p>And if you want motives for Unidan to lie?  Aside from trying to save face, there&#39;s monetary connections to his reddit name, maybe he did something worse and is playing along with his lower punishment, etc  There&#39;s just so many.  He&#39;s a con and manipulator, why would you take what he says as the truth?</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: Again, not stating anyone is lying.  He confesses to whatever they can prove he does.  He literally admitted to using the accounts for a few minor things, trying to downplay everything, and then later admitted to doing even worse things with them only after someone called him out on it, .</strong></p>

<p>Did you believe him the first time?</p>

<p>What I understand as your perspective: &quot;Well he admitted to it so that must be the extent of it, no speculation needed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well shit now that they caught him doing worse things, he admitted to that too.&quot;</p>

<p>My perspective: why did he try to downplay everything in the first admission?  Perhaps since he so blatantly tried to dodge admitting things, I should be sure to speculate more about the truth of his posts.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that Unidan successfully fooled thousands of people on reddit into blindly following him. </p>

<p>He then used this support to trick other people into paying him to sponsor AMA&#39;s and various other endorsements.</p>

<p>In a sense, reddit was his partner in crime, even though they were too stupid to realize it.</p>

<p>So he originally lied, gained an unwitting accomplice, and then put his conspiracy into motion. Because without reddit backing him up, he had nothing.</p>

<p>Maybe this isn&#39;t the textbook definition of conspiracy. But I believe OP knew enough about this subreddit and the open-mindedness of many people here, so he posted it.</p>

<p>And I am glad he did. I never would have heard about it otherwise. Not to mention it becomes one more rung in the ladder of corruption that this site can spawn.</p>

<p>You seem to not understand what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is about. You have an issue with this submission but this submission makes sense being here as explained by the sidebar.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a mistake, like his hand slipped or something.
He was manipulating votes. There are literally only 5 rules of Reddit and he blatantly violated one of them. Repeatedly, apparently. In multiple different ways.</p>

<p>Combine this with the fact he was promoting and making money off of some of his submissions, and it is more more sinister than some minor mistake. It&#39;s pure spam, and he entirely deserves the ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I&#39;m just going off of my personal assumption that Unidan did <em>not</em> do something to anger the admins therefore causing his ban.</p>

<p>I believe that this is a case of Unidan simply gaming reddit. Then agian, how didn&#39;t the admins know &#39;til now? Ugh. I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But what could he have done to be called out now by the admins? Partnership gone awry?</p>

<p>Well he seems pretty narcissistic and how much attention is he getting from this? He is getting more attention now than he got when he was popular and his only punishment is having to create a new account with the same name. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he &#39;slipped up&#39; on purpose and let the admins catch him. </p>

<p>If it was IP based though, and if he is - as I understand - part of an academic institution, wouldn&#39;t it be hard to substantiate &#39;shill army&#39; from genuine local following?</p>

<p>Not defending the bloke. AFAIK he just liked biology. </p>

<p>Potentially a masterclass in reddit gamification though.</p>
