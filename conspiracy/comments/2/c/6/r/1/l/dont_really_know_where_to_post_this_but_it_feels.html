       I feel as though this is why cannabis was used... The third eye to be open to creativity, shrooms being the teaching aspect of third eye openings, and DMT can be the pure third eye inter dimensional travel/full sight (not sure if that makes sense). Anyway, I can't remember where I heard it but they say that the pineal gland/third eye is like a tool that allows us to travel inter dimensionally. I feel as though psychedelics are something we should all experience at least once to increase our collective consciousness, maybe this is why they're all illegal because the powers that be may know about this and if we all increase our consciousness then we can alter our realities... Not sure if I'm right, but hey... This is a conspiracy sub, just wanted to see what people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Hmm, so many downvotes! I just want discussion and creative assumptions/theories! Wether it discredits it or agrees with it.

       You are correct in both of your assumptions, anyone who assumes you have taken too much of anything has barely a base consciousness. I like to think of Woody's speech in natural born killers.

       If we all did dmt it would end sports, an amalgamation of warlike attitude. It would end shit tv, fake news, government as we know it, end all war, end egoism, end competition, end suspicion, end prisons, violence. We are a species with amnesia, dmt allows you to remember who you are, infinite and love, anyone who disagrees well they cut them off from the source long ago and snakes will perish in this reality. They act like we are here to serve them, we are here to sacrifice our infinite lives in order for them to spiritually evolve not us, we are only fooled into their bullshit temporarily. The game is up we know who we are, we know your snakey, hierarchical games. You will not world war 3 us you will only destroy yourself LOL. Read the lyrics of system of a down chop suey, you will get it. Big brother is right they need to evolve spiritually or perish.

       I'm so excited, I'm heading to Peru in like two months for an ayahuasca retreat. Looking forward to it. This explains, to me, why they use fluoridation to calcify the third eye... To essentially blind us.

       Amazing! Im incredibly jealous. One day i will do this, the right way, as well as a peyote ritual. One day....

       I know this is really late, but it all depends on where you go... The flights are more expensive than my actual retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find shamans in South America that will do it for free but you have to be careful, hence why I'm going to a retreat that will feed me, allow me to express my
       <em>
        visions
       </em>
       through art (they have a hut/maloka specifically for this), let me clean myself, and give me a safe Ayahuasca experience etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, my retreat is like $1400 (I'm staying four days longer than usual, but I get two extra Ayahuasca ceremonies).

       Dude, read supernatural by graham hancock. He talks about dmt in ayahuacusa brews and how interdimensional beings are seen universally amongst those who drink it during rituals. Basically, he came to you conclusion. Also, read "dmt, the spirit molecule."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, i have always felt exactly what you described. I also believe this is why psychedlics like lsd, lsa, weed, and shrooms are all illegal, despite each one being proven to be safer tham alcohol or tobacco. Also, the pineal gland is incredibly important for this third eye to function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important note, flouride has been proven to lodge into the pineal gland, and degrades its functioning. Just putting that out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, most folks against Psychedelics (at least in my experience) have never done them, or have only done them once and had a bad experience/trip due to their ignorance of proper respect of whatever substance they tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, good to see that there are more folks out there who have a similar understanding of psychedlics that i have come to know...

       Oh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well psychedelics are very powerful. You definitely don't want everyone out there to try them, some people can't handle them. Because, like this one Radiohead songs says "there are trap doors that you can't come back from." Not that psychedelics are a trap door, but, they are a door, and once you open it, you can't close it. Also I am of the belief that psychedelic experience is something that happens to some, naturally. Meaning that there's some people who get really high psychedelically naturally, by going into trance. I've talked with several friends about how when they were kids, they had psychedelic experiences out of the blue. Some didn't, but all of them had forgotten. It wasn't until it was brought up that they remembered. But talking about psychedelics themselves, as good or bad, mostly to me they are good, they are very good, and they change your mental programming and allow you to look beyond the social programming they teach you in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       But is there a conspiracy to control them just because of this? mmm I don't know. Maybe it could be. But then again some psychedelics are legal in some places in America to some people. Mostly native americans, they can have and transport some psychedelics without repercussions because of religious freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third eye in itself is a very big topic and talking about it, along with supernormal abilities can take all day. But it most definitely is a real thing.

       Ever ate an 8th of shrooms and looked into the mirror? I highly do not recommend that! Haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never could watch tv while on shrooms. I always managed to find myself outside playing with the grass, feeling each blades emotional gravitation towards eachother, and seeing how the paved walkway cut through and divided families of grass bunches. Physchedlics always have brought me closer to nature. Shrooms was the king of this phenomena.

       Ive noticed this greatly aswell, alot of times when im stoned, mostly in the first 15 mins of administering ill be thinking about something then seemily randomly a strong thought will pop in my head (about say my girlfriend or a friend) and seconds later ill get a phone call or message from them
I definetly belie in the powers of the pineal gland, powers everyone can access but some are obviosly more trained/experience and less calcified ect then others.

       Also another situation i suspect to be an outcome of the pineal gland at work is one im sure many people have experience / noticed, you know when your just sitting someone with a mate/mates in silence then out of nowhere both/two of you will start talking at the exact same time and about different things (as in not an event that just accurd) this seems to happen when me and friends are stoned although that is generally always the case so it could just happen whenever haha

       Haha I agree! I get a lot of those "thoughts before things happen" and it has to correlate with intuition. See, I used to smoke a LOT of weed and I've recently taken like a six month break? For a while it made me feel clouded and kinda dulled me, but that was due to just getting ridiculously high nearly every day... After smoking just a joint yesterday, I've noticed that I felt more in tune with energy etc. and I think this is why cannabis is being used for religious/spiritual purposes!
