        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What? No way. But I was looking at a bunch of articles and a bunch of stuff just, well, clicked.</p>

<p>This might be long, so I will place my hypothesis up here at top (and as TLDR):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The strain of Ebola currently attacking West Africa is NOT a random outbreak of the disease, but rather the result of an American (or Israeli?) test of a new strain meant for offensive warfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, at first glance this is completely insane. You are probably saying, &quot;Idiot, obviously not, this is Africa, disease outbreaks happen all the...&quot; Oh wait. </p>

<p>Think about it, what better place then Africa to test a possibly dangerous disease? Seriously, look at how we are all just reacting to this crisis, its just another deadly crisis disease in Africa, let&#39;s move on. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying any government intended it to get out of hand, my best guess would be that the government was testing the new form in rural Guinea, where it accidentally spread, either because this strain was more infectious then they thought, or one of the villager test subject managed to escape.</p>

<p>Now, that is all well and good, we certainly have motive for it, but without evidence, what would a good theory be? NOTHING. Truth is that there is quite a bit of evidence that something odd IS going on.</p>

<p>We keep seeing stories of people trying to block/ even harm doctors and aid workers. First we have the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28485041">Woman who was kidnapped by her family at a hospital after her diagnosis of Ebola</a>, and then we have reports of aid workers being attacked by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html">villagers and pushed out of towns</a>. I think something is up with this.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious answer is that these are stupid, superstitious villagers who don&#39;t know what is best for themselves, and that is exactly what <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> are saying. But what if they know something we don&#39;t?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying these aid workers have anything to do with the outbreak, though I have no doubt the government has some opperatives among them, but maybe these villagers are not lying when they say that &quot;Wherever those people have passed, the communities have been hit by illness.&quot; Maybe they know that the disease has come from an American lab and are suspicious because of that.  </p>

<p>Something else that gets me is that even those who, in theory, should know exactly how to not catch the disease, are coming down with it. In many outbreaks of disease, yeah hospital workers are at risk, but you would expect that the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/07/us-tries-calm-fears-as-ebola-virus-spreads-2014729537415802.html">top export on Ebola in Sierra Leone could protect himself from a disease that is spread through blood, sweat, and feces</a>. Or <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/29/doctor-who-contracted-ebola-fighting-for-survival-in-isolation-unit/">American-trained medical</a> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/27/world/africa/ebola-american-doctor-infected/">staff sent to combat the disease</a>. What this tells me is that either these professionals are being really sloppy, or the disease has a new method of entering the body, likely airborne, or waterborne. </p>

<p>Also, if you notice in the last article, it quotes the man who died in Nigeria as saying that he had not had contact, or baried anyone with the disease. Yet now they are claiming <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709180/Ebola-victim-sparked-fears-global-outbreak-American-Father-died-incurable-virus-Nigeria-taking-international-flight-going-visit-children-Minnesota.html">that he had been caring for his sister, who had Ebola</a>. While certainly possible he hadn&#39;t actually known it had been Ebola, but this is an American citizen with at least some formal education, one would think that he would have known to check his sister into the hospital if she came down with an extremely painful and bad disease. To me, this screams of a cover up to the fact that this strain of Ebola is Air/waterborne. </p>

<p>And... Then <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10998367/Ebola-Germany-accepts-infected-patient-for-treatment.html">Germany took in an infected doctor, again someone who should not have gotten sick</a>. Again, who would know better that the disease is different then past outbreaks then one of the top doctors? This just screams of a cover up involving the Germans, when most countries are starting stricter procedures to protect against people infected coming into their borders, Germany is voluntarily letting them in? Hmmm...</p>

<p>So, obviously this is not complete, I just think that discussion is importent, and I cannot do all of this on my own. I&#39;ve tried to see as much as possible, but I am sure I missed something, so feel free to add onto this in the comments (if it is well supported, I will add and credit you in here). </p>

<p>TL:DR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The strain of Ebola currently attacking West Africa is NOT a random outbreak of the disease, but rather the result of an American (or Israeli?) test of a new strain meant for offensive warfare.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably not a intentional test for a few reasons. First of all, Ebola is a disease that is originally from Africa (the Congo to be specific), so having it reappear in Africa again is fairly unsurprising. Next, the people who try and sneak patients out and whatnot tend to not actually know what they&#39;re unintentionally causing. This is a pandemic the likes of which that area has never seen. People are scared and confused, and when that happens, people will do stupid things like their relatives out of the hospital, start riots, and other such things. In terms of having western doctors catch Ebola, it&#39;s much easier than you&#39;d think (and the number is rather low considering how many doctors there are). Ebola is spread through bodily fluids, and those can get <em>everywhere</em> when you&#39;re dealing with diseases like this (which have many symptoms that cause spread of fluids such as diarrhoea). In terms of the guy who died in Nigeria, the most likely answer is that he either didn&#39;t realize it was Ebola (as you said), or even more likely is that he just lied. In terms of the patient going to Germany, the article you linked points out;</p>

<ul>
<li>German doctors agreed to accept the patient after a special request from the World Health Organisation (WHO), but it is not certain he will be able to come to Germany, amid reports he may be too sick to travel.
The patient has not been named, but the confirmation he is a Sierra Leonean national has fuelled speculation he may be Sheikh Umar Khan, one of Africa’s leading ebola experts, who was infected last week.</li>
</ul>

<p>If that&#39;s who it is, it&#39;s a pretty big deal that he survives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. I dont actually believe they would go through with it. But, i will admit that it is still a possibility.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree at all with the OP but your line of reasoning doesn&#39;t hold water-- Russia experimented repeatedly with Ebola to the extent of loading it into numerous warheads.  They liked it just fine.  It&#39;s possible that it fills a niche of infectivity in between the two agents you mentioned, while offering near total lethality.</p>

<p>The Russian biowar strategy was built on simultaneous use of multiple agents.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this was a test of anything.  Not only would that be totally unnecessary at this point (seriously, get a grip on sanity for a second. We already know it&#39;s deadly) but the transmission chain can be traced back to a single child and that seems to give the lie to any theories of a deliberate release.</p>

<p>Anyone who is looking for extremely disturbing conspiracies need look no further than Dr. Eric Pianka.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>or the disease has a new method of entering the body, likely airborne, or waterborne</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ebola has already shown to be able to be infectious through tiny saliva droplets suspended in air. However, it is not nearly as infectious in that route than direct contact with infected bodily fluids. But, thats not to say that they didnt alter its genes to make it more infectious in that route...</p>

<p>The thing about ebola is that it is highly deadly. However, there are several strains, with some having a mortality of close to 90%, while others are closer to 50%. This current strain seems to be around 56%. This may sound like good news, but hear me out.</p>

<p>The strains thst have 90% mortality often kill their hosts before being able to spread too far. Also, the route of infection is predominately through direct contact with bodily fluids, meaning most quarentines will be effective in curbing the outbreaks.</p>

<p>So, even the most lethal forms of ebola arent all that worrisome.</p>

<p>What is worrisome, is if a new strain came up, that had a lower mortality rate but a higher infectious rate. This will allowbthe virus&#39; hosts to survive long enough to spread to others, and higher infectiousness makes it, well, more infectious. A simple manipulation can target certain genes to make it more contractable via air than the previous strains. (To put it in perspective, small pox has a mortality rate of around 33% but it killled millions of people because it was soooo contagious and was able to be spread through the air. So mortality rates do not specificslly or conclusively relate or indicate its danger to society...)</p>

<p>This seems to be the case with this current outbreak. It has a lower rate of mortality compared to other strains, but for some reason it is much more eficient in spreading. But, there are so many variables involved with its spread that it is impossible to prove your theory either way without concrete evidence...</p>

<p>But, regardless, i have always been suspicious of this sort of thing.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Oh, also, there was a doctor at some point (i think in the &#39;90&#39;s, and i believe it was in virginia?) who contracted the virus in his lab by accident. He tested positive for the virus, but never showed any symptoms. He then sort of vanished, or fell off the radar. </p>

<p>I suspect maybe he was immune, and theyve developed a vaccine to ebola to be used only for the elite for whem they conduct such a test as you propose...</p>

No human died after being exposed, and they later found out humans were indeed infected by the airborne Ebola, but the specific strain was ineffective in humans and no one really got sick.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s incorrect, it appears to be E. Zaire.  It&#39;s only different because of geographical dispersion, which has in turn diluted the medical response.  I think maybe we just dodged bullets in previous outbreaks in that they were identified early and quashed.  This time the African governments hemmed and hawed.</p>

<p>I think extreme measures should be taken NOW to quash this one while it&#39;s still possible at all to control it.  By that I mean total restriction of air travel in Africa and leaving Africa, and compartmentalizing quarantines within Africa in the form of strict border controls even in unaffected countries, possibly with military aid if necessary.  I just don&#39;t think the affected countries are capable of handling it as they have already abundantly demonstrated.</p>

<p>That may sound extreme but I want this stopped not only before it leaves Africa but before the death toll reaches a thousand.  Guess I&#39;m just dreaming.</p>

<p>Because oh no, we can&#39;t have that, it&#39;s important that Liberians be allowed to jet set around the planet wherever they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im just saying that TPTB might not just want military bases in africa. Africa is in abundance of natural resources, and with china and other countries vying for their stake, america cant just sit by and watch. Hence, justification for occupation is a must, and an ebola outbreak is useful for this. </p>

<p>Im not saying this is the case, im just saying it would make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Make sense?</p>

<p>We want bases in Africa so our first move is to start an ebola outbreak, all of which can be traced back to one child?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares whichever explanation is more probable? We are in r/conspiracy. We are allowed to speculate. </p>

<p>And yes, it makes sense. <strong><em>IF</em></strong> tptb wanted more than military bases in africa, and <strong><em>if</em></strong> they wanted to go to war with the other countries who are currently vying for their influence in africa, and <strong><em>if</em></strong> before going to war they decide it is best to get a strong footing in africa prior to going to war, an epidemic would make for a good justification for heightened presence in that region. </p>

<p>The fact that in can be traced to one single child doesnt offer much support for the opposing argument. Lots of outbreaks had a patient zero. And, if they were testing a modified virus, it would make sense that they try and emulate that fact by only innoculating one person to see how infectious it would be, and be able to compare the results to previous outbreaks. <em>Im not saying this is the case, or even probable, i am saying this is plausible.</em></p>

<p>Of course, this scenario is not the most likely one. And, if you dig through some of my comments, youll find that i have even stated that i believe this outbreak to be organic, as in natural. However, i will reserve my right to speculate on whether or not they allowed it or otherwise facilitated its outbreak.</p>

<p>Good question. Its not a farfetched idea that a vaccine already exists, but it is doubtful they would be able to keep such a novel discovery under wraps. </p>

<p>And, of course, the world would be <strong><em>pissed</em></strong>. Thats almost certain. Anything after that is anyones guess.</p>
