       I just think 99% of entertainment and news is controlled by the jewish state. That and everything that seems to go against Jewish policy on reddit gets removed quickly by mods.

       Idk maybe not but it's a little weird seeing a lot of posts about what they are doing to the Palestinians get pulled.

       I think it's becoming too much to totally censor, so they're downplaying it as much as they can in the comments.

       They certainly didn't just give up. Glad to see the people are starting to be able to look beyond mainstream media.

       Oh no, they're trying to take over reddit!! By taking over reddit.. they'll take over the entire internet.. I mean seriously is this what you think? You think people give 2 shits about reddit and the opinion here? People are posting on reddit it's up to the people to vote whatever. If you don't like it then go to a more bias subreddit like here where it's all one sided. I'm trying to be unbias here, but really? What will 5 stories on reddit achieve in the long scheme of their plan for "world domination"?

       You legit believe that they won't try to manipulate reddit when they already manipulate all of mainstream media, it's not name calling saying you're ignorant, it just means you don't know something. Get more defensive about it.

       It's called perception management.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments and militaries engage in information warfare (propaganda, overt and covert, censorship, disinformation, distraction, etc.) directed at citizen populations through their various modes of communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being aware of its existence is the first step in diminishing its effectiveness on you. It's difficult to fully free yourself though because literally all forms of public communications are subject to it and are saturated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: and this place is fully subject to it, this is astoundingly obvious.

       Yes...Thank you. A lot of people are so oblivious to the fact that this exists.  both the Kremlin and the U.S have established ties with major media outlets and literally pay them money to sway their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of people look at this as a conspiracy. But it is 100% true. I've been working in entertainment and everything they do propaganda wise is very much similar to governments way of working.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think governments don't calculate their moves? You think they don't use rogue military groups to cause uprisings in other countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you what scares me the most. Hitler was able to brainwash and lead an entire country to kill millions of people using his voice and flyers dropped from the sky. What are they doing now, propaganda, news, videos, television, have all accompanied and are more prevalent now than ever before.  Think about how easy it is to control the minds of people, esp. in entertainment. Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, they use so much advertising, publicity stunts, and manipulation for people to purchase music for christ sakes. And people don't think our government uses techniques to get people to do the same......

       What's more, the more and more they try and manipulate the content and comments, the more obvious it get and the more people realize what's going on. When you resort to tricking people into seeing things your way, someone will always figure it out and tell everybody else.

       Hey, for anyone who's interested, I ran into one of these shills yesterday check out this

        thread

       and check his user profile. I'd be interested to see what someone else thinks.

       of course I do. I don't believe that the other people here do. I have been here for a while and there seems to be a false "us vs them" mentality when it comes to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       vs
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       . It's always "hey guys, ___ was censored over at ___! I'm posting it here, where
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       news is not censored" as if stuff here isn't also censored without them knowing. It's like when they blame CNN for being apart of the bad guys, then post a clip of Anderson Cooper exposing other "bad guys"

       You just seem to be really mad about your latest posts being removed.

       It's not because of the IDF. It's because you won't read the rules of the subreddits you post to!

       &lt;-- You complaining about a post being removed violates rule 1 of

       Cool your jets bibi. That actually has very little to do with it, I know I broke the posting rules. I've seen multiple posts of people getting their posts pulled (by mods) that reach the front page (in different subs which is very well likely) + a twitter post from an IDF account (the image was in another forum I will need to find.) stating they were sending people on reddit to down vote and mess with the voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, I don't really care the post was pulled. This was a long time post waiting to happen. That is what just tipped the scale.

       When I post anti-Hamas links here* they always get downvoted instantly...
      </p>
      <p>
       But do I think Hamas controls this subreddit? No. It's just that my view isn't popular here, and the anti-Jewish view usually isn't (well, wasn't) popular on most of reddit or in most of the world. If the Jews controlled the media and internet then you wouldn't see anything critical of Israel, yet every major news outlet and government has shown that they dislike how Israel is handling Hamas/Palestine.
