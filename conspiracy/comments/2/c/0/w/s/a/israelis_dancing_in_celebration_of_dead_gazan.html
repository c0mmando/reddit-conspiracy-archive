       seriously... there are americans just like this too, and crazy people from every country. some people are just violent motherfuckers, is it really a surprise that they get together in groups? there's really no evidence that these few people represent the majority opinion of israel, and there's a LOT of evidence that they do not. i can understand arabic media capitalizing on these videos, but it's a huge misrepresentation of jews. naturally, they have used it to characterize not only the israelis in the video, and not only the israeli people in general, but jews all over the world. naturally, this thought process is reflected in hamas' charter, which you can find on a number of websites, and i'll link one site where it is available:
       <a href="http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html?chocaid=397">
        http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html?chocaid=397
       </a>
       i encourage everyone to read it, so you can see that while the IDF is clearly committing war crimes against gaza, hamas is in support of genocide including all jews, everywhere, not just in the middle east. hopefully people can see that this shit will never end until hamas either amends its charter or is replaced by a government with a less genocidal contract. what the state of israel is doing may be wrong on many levels, but they're not going to stop until they no longer have any fear of another holocaust. you can't really blame them for being skittish, considering what happened just two or three generations ago. the smallest thing could cause the most massive overreaction, and it would be vaguely understandable in the light of hamas' charter, which directly calls for the murder of all jews, everywhere.

       Eh, I'd think they'd be less skiddish with Iron Dome and one of the most advanced militaries in the world. Most of the Israelis who have died in the last 15 years of this conflict have been holding weapons.

       i'm not saying gazans don't deserve the right to be skittish. they certainly have more of a right than israelis do. but i'm engaged to a jew whose family is from israel, and i know firsthand that her family lives in fear constantly. that fear may or may not be artificially manufactured by state propaganda, but the fear is real. the only people out there who say that israelis aren't actually afraid have never been to israel, and don't know any israelis. i'm not saying that you're ignorant, only that i have seen firsthand the fear that israelis have. i don't expect that to change your view, since i could easily be lying and you'd never know. but there are some objective facts i can give you. israel's military is one of the most advanced militaries in the world, and they probably have nuclear weapons, though they won't admit it. it wasn't always that way, though. i encourage you to look up a video on youtube called "israel sayeret units." anyway, the Iron Dome is not complete. the US is donating $1 billion in this fiscal year to try to expedite the research and development. it works pretty well, but the range is inadequate. also, missiles fired within the range are only intercepted at a 90% rate of success. it's easily the most advanced short range missile defense system ever made, but it can only stop 90% of conventional missiles. it can't stop nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological missiles. nor can it stop missiles that are out of its range. the majority of israel's land is unprotected by iron dome batteries. that's just because they haven't made enough of them to deploy yet, but i think within the next 10 or 15 years they'll cover at least 90% of israel. there are a few average sized cities which are not protected by iron dome batteries, and my fiancee's family lives in one of them. i don't want to belabor you with anecdotes, but my fiancee almost died from a bomb attack in tel aviv a few years ago. somebody planted a bomb in a duffel bag on a public bus in tel aviv. apparently these types of bombings are extremely common in israel and even more common all over the middle east. most of israel's population do not use public transportation because they know how dangerous it is, but tourists and visitors have no other choice but to use the bus. they know it's very dangerous so they keep an eye out constantly, but in this case the duffel bag was placed under a seat in the back. somebody noticed it eventually, and the bus was evacuated. about 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded before the police bomb squad arrived. nobody died because of the prompt evacuation, but the bomb was very powerful. i looked it up later and read that it was an ammonium nitrate/aluminum slurry bomb. these types of bombs are very powerful, very cheap, and very easy to manufacture clandestinely. there's really nothing the government can do to get rid of them, short of destroying all the fertilizer in gaza and israel. apparently the US government makes conventional bombs with virtually the same ingredients. for small tactical explosives, like C4, it uses expensive chemical mixtures like RDX and PETN, because the explosive density is higher. that is, the power per unit of weight is higher than ammonium nitrate bombs. but for giant explosives, there's really no need to use a compact bomb, so even the US government uses these cheap bombs which can be made in one's garage. so it can't be argued that hamas "isn't a threat," which is what some have argued. it's obvious that the israeli government is a fascist oligarchic dictatorship with military enacted apartheid. but it can't be argued that the israeli people live in fear. if nobody had noticed that duffel bag, 60 people would have died. when the bomb actually exploded, the entire bus was blown to smithereens in a public area. so clearly rockets are not the only threat. also, numbers given in the gaza casualties estimates do not include victims of domestic terrorism; only victims of rocket attacks, which tend to come from the border, and victims of ground warfare. this is because bombs cannot be traced beyond a shadow of doubt to hamas, and the "gaza war" is between hamas and IDF, not arabs and jews. when you consider this topic, it helps to recognize that jews don't only live in fear that a rocket will bypass the iron dome batteries. they live in fear that they will die in a suicide bombing. they live in fear that they will be kidnapped, raped, tortured, and killed by a suicidal arabic citizen of israel. they live in fear that they will go hungry because they have to pay so many taxes for the iron dome batteries, which cost tens of thousands of dollars a day to operate, and ~$30,000 per missile fired. the innocent civilians of israel foot that bill. also, importantly, qassam rockets cost about $800, and average sized ammonium nitrate bombs cost less than $200. to defend against these attacks, israel's taxpayers must spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. that's one of the reasons the war in gaza can be seen as economic warfare. if this keeps going on, eventually the israeli taxpayers will have nothing. because for every $800 hamas spends to manufacture a qassam missile, the israeli taxpayers have to spend $30,000 plus change to intercept it. this is why hamas is still firing missiles into israel, even though 90% of them are intercepted within seconds. isn't that crazy? why would hamas keep firing useless missiles, unless there was some purpose? and as it turns out, there is a purpose: to figuratively burn the israelis' money.

       also should be said that this is a
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       way for the government to funnel taxpayers' money into the bank accounts of the defense industry. the taxpayers pay $30,000 for every interceptor missile, but that missile only cost 10 or 20 thousand to manufacture... the defense industry is absolutely profiting from this. hamas might not even exist, it could be just a shell corporation operated by the military industrial complex to keep the money coming in. if the taxpayers continue to pay the defense industry so much to protect them, they will eventually be bankrupt and the defense industry will have hundreds of billions of dollars collectively. they're already extremely rich, so it's clear that it's working. but israelis can't take that chance. they can't just assume that this is a conspiracy, because voting to shut down the iron dome would put them at risk of actually dying. so either hamas is perpetrating economic warfare against israeli citizens, OR the israeli and american defense industry is using arabs to steal israeli citizens' money. i'm not sure which one is worse.
