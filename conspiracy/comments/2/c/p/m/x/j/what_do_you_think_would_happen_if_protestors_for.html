I&#39;ve seen countless protests where the people have no protection against what looks like a standing army. So... what do you think would happen to said protest if the people hired private security? How do you think the event would go down? Do you think it would be a good idea? Just a thought exercise here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve talked to a few in my life, they are alright with the status quo. They are fully legal and mostly do financing / shipping / construction type operation. I knew some of the meth guys of a rival gang in northern Ontario and Quebec who didn&#39;t want to play games. The hells angels are pretty comfortable. They don&#39;t even fight for some markets.</p>

<p>Having said that, I doubt they want their methods encroached upon and competition to open up. Their networks operate well because their holdings and investments are large enough to support the organization. They don&#39;t want to fuck it up, and have no incentive to abandon the 1%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a strong political advocacy group that supports both liberal and progressive standpoints? Of course there is the John Birch Society, which has always had some pretty strong numbers, including many ex-military, but I have a strange suspicion that an ultra-right libertarian group like that would not fight for both sides of the people&#39;s political ideologies. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s been my experience with far right activists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very admirable viewpoint, and I commend you for it. But obviously groups that advocate political changes typically lean strongly one way or the other. Usually to the right. I guess it&#39;s for the same reason those on the right tend to take up arms more quickly than progressives. I&#39;ve never heard of an American militia made up of left-wing pacifists, although I have met a few combat veterans who definitely fit that description after realizing their tours of duty were mainly acts of money grabbing for the illustrious elite.</p>

<p>Assume you hire 20 (?)  &quot;bodyguards&quot; for 100/hr (if you can find some willing to go up against militarized police)... that&#39;s AT LEAST 2000/hr.  (Or about 12,000 for an afternoon.)</p>
