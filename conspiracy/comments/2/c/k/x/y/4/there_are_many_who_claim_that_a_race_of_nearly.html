    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is certainly possible. What ignorance is needed to believe we are the only intelligent/sentient beings in the universe capable of complex communications and technologies. Also, I feel that it could certainly explain all the god theories called religion that exist today. </p>

<p>Though, to &quot;know&quot; that these beings are called the plaedians or whatever, is a bit ridiculous. What I mean is, we cannot know for sure either way whether this is true. I believe it is possible, but it probably is not the case. There are so many questions pertaining to this, if they do in fact exist. Who are they? Why are they here? For how long have they been here? Why the complete silence/lack of publicity? Why remain am observer while witnessing such horrors that we humans create for ourselves? There are so many more questions.</p>

<p>While I believe it is possible, I do not believe this is the case. I would like to believe it, as I am fascinated with the idea of aliens. But, just like the idea of God, I do not believe we can prove or disprove this notion. There is just no way. I believe this is actually a logical fallacy, to propose a theory that cannot be tested in order to find out whether it is true or false. </p>

<p>For instance, I could say that there is a yellow unicorn that shits gold living under the icy surface of Europa. You cannot prove me wrong. Is it possible? Well, maybe not one that shits gold, or a unicorn even, but either way it cannot be proven to be wrong or right. </p>

<p>Just like big foot. Until we get a live specimen, we cannot prove it is real. At the same time, we cannot disprove its existence, either. It is just unlikely, considering the variables.</p>

<p>The plaedians, the annunaki, the reptilians, all of them, cannot be proven either way. So, we must weight the variables of probability in order to logically place our beliefs. Thus, I don&#39;t believe this theory to be true, though I reserve the right to believe it to be possible.</p>

<p>Have you seen any Sci fi movies where aliens expose themselves? They would be foolish to reveal themselves. </p>

<p>The day the earth stood still  is a perfect example of how we treat guests. </p>

<p>As far as the why of them being here? Same reason countries here spy on each other. To keep an eye on us and see if we are becoming a threat. Observe but do not interfere. That is a common directive in many Sci fi movies. I would think they would have a similar method in place.</p>

<p>But I digress.  I&#39;m not saying this post is truth but it is possible</p>

<p>If you are in fact capable of interstellar travel, you are at the top of our little food chain.</p>

<p>Only two ways to make the leap from planet to planet:</p>

<p>You either have mastered the use of energy in truly enormous amounts, or you have an insight into how the universe works dramatically different than we do.</p>

<p>Either way, you wield a power far greater than we do. Plus, as the visitor, you have at least one separate biosphere to live in... So you are more willing to wreck ours if need be.</p>

<p>Thus... Any species capable of interstellar travel is automatically the new top species on earth and promptly takes over. If we disagree, they fry us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not... exactly.</p>

<p>The idea of aliens hiding amongst us is just very unreasonable to me. I am very skeptical of theories that require there to be secret aliens in deep underground bases or wearing fake skins a la &quot;V&quot; or somehow mysteriously evolved to look enough like us we can&#39;t tell them apart.</p>

<p>Why? Because there is no need for this, and all theories of why they might want be stay secret and in small numbers make such little sense when they can just appear. If they fear some sort of attack, I cannot imagine what that might be given they have the high ground, in every sense of the term. If they fear they can&#39;t get whatever they might want from us, it makes no sense - they can likely get what they want via trade or force far more efficiently than through some secret decades (or longer) long program skulking around.</p>

<p>The only set of scenarios where &#39;hidden aliens&#39; make any sense to me are those where they are some sort of benevolent gamekeeper, where they stay secret and hidden out of some need to be kind to us. Given a nearly infinite universe of possibilities, the odds the aliens that do encounter us are working really hard to protect us from ourselves seems really low. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will suggest you watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/?ref_=nv_sr_2">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a> if you haven&#39;t yet seen it. It&#39;s very good in my opinion even for a remake. It&#39;s Sci-Fi but it does address some of your points I think. Such as Why they should or would fear revealing themselves because maybe we are not as helpless as you might think and they know this? Or maybe we are? We may not be able to traverse the galaxy yet but we are pretty good at blowing shit up and killing things and &quot;if it bleeds we can kill it&quot;</p>

<p>who can say though if there is anything to this theory . Perhaps if there are aliens among us they like living here in our way of life. There is no reason they cant look like us. Some people believe we as a species came from elsewhere and were essentially &quot;dropped off&quot;. or that we began life here as an Adam and Eve scenario of different races who came to start over on a new world. Male and female of every race, white, black, Asian, etc. Its far fetched sure but its entirely possible given the nature of many religious undertones and how things were so misunderstood thousands of years ago. Food for thought in any case.</p>

<p>I mean evolution coming up with a similar shape due to environmental pressures is possible, yes, but I&#39;d except even vaguely humanoid aliens to have many sorts of difference, like scale, skeletal structure (assuming a skeleton, and not something else), atmospheric and temperature needs and a gazillion other things.</p>
