       From Farrell:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But here’s the problem: the idea of using microwaves for propulsion has been around since the 1950s, and it is known as the microwave soliton effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 1950s, however, as Dr. Paul LaViolette has indicated in his eminently worthwhile book, Secrets of AntiGravity Propulsion, the effect was being talked about not so much as a satellite space-propellent-and-cost saver, but as a means of getting off the planet, and, if some of LaViolette’s sources are to be believed, they were eminently successful, and fairly early on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such enormous microwave power would, of course, ionize dirt, burn and scorch the area beneath such a device, and so on (UFO landing trace enthusiasts, take note!).
       </p>
       <p>
        So why is NASA apparently “validating” these concepts now, and if quietly, then at least, it would seem, openly. Well consider: NASA’s Dr. Harold White has been designing proof-of-concept experiments for warp drive, and DARPA has come out and announced a goal for the USA: to be warp capable in 100 years. And, of course, we’ve seen the push in recent years for asteroid mining, Moon mining, and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I suspect, therefore, is that we’re looking at the controlled release of concepts that have been quietly – and very secretly – studied and developed for decades. That it is beginning to become more openly acknowledged is a strong suggestion that a new system – including a new financial system – is being put into place and slowly rolled out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The suppression of technologies that once prevailed, given a total electronic surveillance culture, no longer seems as necessary as it once was. One reason for that suppression, beginning of course with Tesla, was that the elites knew of the potential weaponization capabilities for such things, and of the difficulty of monitoring and tracking the technologies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, the proliferation and tracking problem seems to be eroding with the expansion of surveillance capability, and as a result, we could be seeing the slow deliberate release of concepts. Time, of course, will tell.
       </p>

       A better version of this technology is no secret. Invented in Britain, the inventor has built working scale models for china and Argentina. He tried NASA but they weren't interested at the time.

       It could be a limited hangout, as well. Personally I feel that surveillance technology is used to aid in the suppression of the truth (not to mention JTRIG and related tactics) and maintain the status quo.

       It isn't pseudoscience, it just also is not some government plot. That's not to say that they won't try to take advantage of it down the road. I just think it's absurd that people can't celebrate a true breakthrough without first claiming it's an evil plot.

       "ionic wind"? What is that exactly in the context of a vacuum propulsion system? Also why would the voltage of their circuit be relevant, surely the wattage when we're talking about propulsion is the metric to focus on?

       The PDF about how they specifically tested said "within a stainless steel vacuum chamber with the door closed but at ambient atmospheric pressure".  So not vacuum, therefore high voltage can cause ionic wind thrust.

        Also why would the voltage of their circuit be relevant
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because of ionic wind . Search youtube for "Lifter" if you don't know what that is.

       This breakthrough is still theoretical. We have no fuel to actually power these things. You're telling me they have an even more futuristic (and therefore more theoretical) alternative?

       I think different individuals all believe their own subset of events are conspiracies but I doubt any one individual here thinks ALL OF IT was one giant plot. It's still good to look at everything critically though. We know for a fact that there are groups conspiring against the masses, so why not be skeptical? There just needs to be a reasonable limit to that skepticism (less we look like tinfoil-hatted loonies).

       If you're going to make a claim about "the odds of something being a conspiracy" you would actually need correct data on how many events are orchestrated conspiracies and how many are not. I don't think you can back that claim.

       Keep in mind that I'm well aware conspiracies do exist. I just don't think this is one of them.

       OK after reading how the test was performed in the PDF, I call bullshit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        test article consisting primarily of a radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity excited.  within a stainless steel vacuum chamber with the door closed but at ambient atmospheric pressure.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So a RF energy producer inside a chamber. You will get standing waves that way. If that is the case it will not work in open air without an obstruction. Also they do not mention the voltage used, just the frequency. Ionic wind propulsion  is nothing new.  This just sounds like a BS testing method.

       Honestly, he's right. People here focus so hard on the conspiracy aspect that they lose sight of reality to an extent. A lot of events are orchestrated by hidden powers but a lot of things truly do just happen by chance. If you forget that, you lose your objectivity.

       I've already known for two years... that there's not much that can be known. But I know.  It's funny that you guys are just figuring this out now, because I've already known. What I know is... well, really, you can't know. See this? This is them hiding it. That's how I know we can't know what I know.

       What the fuck? I know a new financial system is coming. Its not complicated. Why in the hell would i know specifics about an economic system that hasn't even been put into place? I'm not the one making it, I'm just aware of it. Do you really need 2 sarcastic comments to show how stupid you are?

       Again, how would you expect me to know specifics? Its extremely easy to figure out that there will be a new financial system put into place soon, that does not mean its easy to figure out what the financial system will consist of. There is a difference between the two.

       Im sure it does. You literally have no reason to believe me, and i really don't care if you do or not. But the one thing id like you to explain is how i could have told you 2 years ago that you would start seeing articles like this if this is all just horse shit. And whats even more, you will see more and more articles about a new financial system until it actually happens. Just so you know when you do see it.

       There isn't much info available online, mainly so the "illuminati" aren't able to prepare for it. But what i can tell you is that it is strongly related to the National Economic Stabilization And Recovery Act (wiki says Security And Recovery but that was originally used to keep portions of the act secret). This will involve a revaluing of currencies, but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

       No, sorry, no references. That's because they're hiding it from the illuminati. That's how you know. Check this out: they changed the word "stabilization" to "security" in the name of this act because they didn't want the illuminati to know that they should read it. (the illuminati only skim-reads unless you use a word that seems 3.62% more interesting to them)

       They changed Stabilization to Security because they omitted portions of the act itself, its not just about the name. Do you really expect them to post their entire plan to overthrow the illuminati online? How stupid do you think they are? And honestly i really don't give a shit if you believe me or not, the new financial system will roll out either way.

       Im aware that i'm not giving much to go on, i don't need people calling me insane just because they don't believe the things i do. If you'd like to PM me i can explain much more in depth about what is going on right now, the new financial system is a relatively small aspect of it, the information that will be released will be much more important.
