    <div class="md"><p>From Farrell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But here’s the problem: the idea of using microwaves for propulsion has been around since the 1950s, and it is known as the microwave soliton effect. </p>

<p>In the 1950s, however, as Dr. Paul LaViolette has indicated in his eminently worthwhile book, Secrets of AntiGravity Propulsion, the effect was being talked about not so much as a satellite space-propellent-and-cost saver, but as a means of getting off the planet, and, if some of LaViolette’s sources are to be believed, they were eminently successful, and fairly early on. </p>

<p>Such enormous microwave power would, of course, ionize dirt, burn and scorch the area beneath such a device, and so on (UFO landing trace enthusiasts, take note!).</p>

<p>So why is NASA apparently “validating” these concepts now, and if quietly, then at least, it would seem, openly. Well consider: NASA’s Dr. Harold White has been designing proof-of-concept experiments for warp drive, and DARPA has come out and announced a goal for the USA: to be warp capable in 100 years. And, of course, we’ve seen the push in recent years for asteroid mining, Moon mining, and so on.</p>

<p>What I suspect, therefore, is that we’re looking at the controlled release of concepts that have been quietly – and very secretly – studied and developed for decades. That it is beginning to become more openly acknowledged is a strong suggestion that a new system – including a new financial system – is being put into place and slowly rolled out. </p>

<p>The suppression of technologies that once prevailed, given a total electronic surveillance culture, no longer seems as necessary as it once was. One reason for that suppression, beginning of course with Tesla, was that the elites knew of the potential weaponization capabilities for such things, and of the difficulty of monitoring and tracking the technologies. </p>

<p>Now, the proliferation and tracking problem seems to be eroding with the expansion of surveillance capability, and as a result, we could be seeing the slow deliberate release of concepts. Time, of course, will tell.</p>

<p>&quot;ionic wind&quot;? What is that exactly in the context of a vacuum propulsion system? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The PDF about how they specifically tested said &quot;within a stainless steel vacuum chamber with the door closed but at ambient atmospheric pressure&quot;.  So not vacuum, therefore high voltage can cause ionic wind thrust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why would the voltage of their circuit be relevant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of ionic wind . Search youtube for &quot;Lifter&quot; if you don&#39;t know what that is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>test article consisting primarily of a radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity excited.  within a stainless steel vacuum chamber with the door closed but at ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>So a RF energy producer inside a chamber. You will get standing waves that way. If that is the case it will not work in open air without an obstruction. Also they do not mention the voltage used, just the frequency. Ionic wind propulsion  is nothing new.  This just sounds like a BS testing method.</p>
