        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Palestinians in the West Bank believe that the 3 missing teens were used as a method of achieving Israeli objectives, these include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>War on Gaza (Hamas):</p></li>
<li><p>Bombing of two suspects, they instantly bombed two suspects at their homes, we don&#39;t even know why or who they are. Usually in a civil country, those two suspects would be bought before a court, but nop, just bomb them at their homes. </p></li>
<li><p>Re-capturing of all previously released prisoners. Thats just backstabbing in regards to the deal..</p></li>
<li><p>Training in the West Bank, exercises as to how they can search houses effectively for Hamas members and rockets in Gaza:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When Israel was searching for the 3 teens, they searched absolutely every house in every kind of way. To the point were someone report that the water was sucked from their water tanks, so that soldiers can go in there and &quot;check for the teens&quot;.</p>

<p>Question is, all that search, and they end up finding them on an open field? How bullshit does that sound? </p>

<p>Do those not sound like strategic Israeli objectives all satisfied from the fact that there are 3 missing teens?</p>

<p>Some neighbourhood Palestinians report that the 3 teens are believed to have been killed in a car crash. </p>

<p>Why Hamas is not responsible, and Israel is NOT dumb to blame them, when they know they haven&#39;t done it, but they blamed them to achieve their objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hamas is the biggest bragger about anything they do. Even if they launch 10 rockets that hit no freaking where, they still brag about it. THREE teens gone missing (they can literally claim thousands of prisoners for a swap), and yet they didn&#39;t claim responsibility? Come on. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel declared war on Gaza, there is NO WAY, anyone in Gaza could have committed a crime that happened in the West Bank. They are completely cut off from each other. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&#39;t post this to mock the deaths of 3 teens, that is a tragedy, but I posted it here because this is a reddit of thinkers and I just really want someone to logic this with me, because its honestly mindblowing that some people are so blinded by propaganda that they can only read you Fox and CNN news headlines.. and not think for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were allegedly kidnapped in Area C of the West Bank - an illegal Israeli settlement under full control of the IDF.</p>

<p>They were found dead between Halhul and Karmei Tzur (another Israeli settlement). The kidnappers would have had to pass through Israeli checkpoints to drop the bodies off...</p>

<p>The teenagers were likely already dead (the car crash theory) or shot during the abduction (the phone call) &quot;predicted&quot; a week earlier by Mossad. Either way they were already dead - all events having occurred in the West Bank - <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2a7bjl/so_those_teens_got_kidnapped_and_now_theyre/">before Israel went on their murder and kidnapping spree in Gaza</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the point of why I posted this thread. There has been absolutely ZERO published evidence about what really happened to the teens or who the real suspects are.

    <div class="md"><p>Good points, even mainstream media accepts that Israeli Intelligence likely knew that the teens were already dead. The main theory is that Hamas did kidnap them, but it was botched and the teens were killed.</p>

<p>If the teens were already dead Hamas gained nothing (apart from more bad press) by saying that they were the ones that killed them. It&#39;s better for Hamas, if they accidentally killed the kids, to say they had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>However you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel declared war on Gaza, there is NO WAY, anyone in Gaza could have committed a crime that happened in the West Bank. They are completely cut off from each other. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assault on Gaza was less about the dead teenagers. Instead it was (and has always been said to be by Israeli officials) about destroying the tunnels Hamas had dug into Israel.</p>

<p>From the start the assault on Gaza was about the &#39;terror tunnels&#39;, as OP said the kidnapping was on the West Bank, not Gaza.</p>

<p>It would be idiotic for the IDF to say &quot;We&#39;re going here to look for the teenagers, even though there&#39;s no way they&#39;re here...&quot; and they never said they went in to Gaza to look for the teenagers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The assault on Gaza began as revenge for the alleged kidnapping. Didn&#39;t have shit to do with &quot;terror tunnels&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Israel launched 34 airstrikes over the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “Hamas will pay” for the abduction and deaths of three Israeli teenagers.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/2944876/israel-hammers-gaza-strip-over-kidnapped-teens-deaths/">http://time.com/2944876/israel-hammers-gaza-strip-over-kidnapped-teens-deaths/</a></p>

<p><em>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for abducting the teens and said Monday the group would &quot;pay a heavy price.&quot; However, Hamas has denied involvement. Israeli helicopters and jets hit 34 locations in Gaza and the military reported 18 rockets were fired from Gaza in the past two days.</em></p>

<p>*“The despicable kidnapping of and murder of the students can not go by in silence, and those responsible in Gaza must pay the price,” Deputy Ministry Tzipi Hotevely said the evening the teens were found dead near Hebron.</p>

<p>“The government of Israel must declare a war to the death on Hamas, which is responsible for the murders, and return to a policy of assassination.”*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very correct, reports show that support for Israel slowed down after a while from the publication the murdered teens. Then Israel used rocket fire as a reason for a war (which doesn&#39;t make sense because the rockets are only fired BECAUSE Israel started a war), then again, a couple of days later, the public started realizing the ineffectiveness of the rockets, and that is why the tunnels excuse was introduced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sir, not true. Hamas has  never before attacked Israel using those tunnels. They were always used to smuggle resources, and sometimes weapons (yes, Hamas is the police of Gaza, and any gov. needs weapons). The smuggling happens from Egypt, and also from Israel. Israel&#39;s objectives of the attack on Gaza cannot (in no logical way) be to destroy tunnels that can be re-dug, or destroy home-made missiles that can be re-made. Do you really think it makes any sense for Israel to lead a war against Gaza to destroy something that can only be temporarily destroyed? I doubt it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can see videos of Hamas militants exiting the tunnels, guns strapped to their backs. </p>

<p>And I think that attacking makes far more sense than doing nothing. Those tunnels and weapons take time to make, smuggle and stockpile; destroying them at least delays Hamas until the next (inevitable) attack. </p>

<p>Additionally your argument could be used for any wars.</p>

<p>Also, Israel&#39;s goal right now is to destroy the launch sites and tunnels. It is temporary, but everybody knows as much, Israel just wants its people to feel safe again. Think of post 9/11 America, one terrorist attack lead to hundreds of millions being terrified, massive wars and the deaths of tens of thousands over the threat of another attack.</p>

<p>Move that up to thousands of attacks a week. People are terrified and the only way to calm them down is for the Israeli govt. to say &quot;See, we&#39;re doing something!&quot;</p>

<p>The only way to permanently stop the attacks would be to strike a peace deal (which <strong>will not</strong> happen with Hamas) or to take over Gaza/remaining Palestinian land.</p>
