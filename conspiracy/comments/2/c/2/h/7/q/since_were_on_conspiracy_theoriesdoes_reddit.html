<p>No. The question at hand is</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re on conspiracy theories... does Reddit itself whole heartedly believe absolutely in the 1st amendment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your question is off-topic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;ll answer it as well as I can. If Reddit allows government employees to become mods and delete comments, then IMHO that is not a violation of the 1st Amendment.</p>

<p>Oh wait... I see you&#39;ve actually changed your question since your first comment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it constitutional for the govt to hire somebody to limit your free speech, so long as no actual law was passed to that effect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suggest you ask your attorney. I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t answer that question. It&#39;s too vague for me. You&#39;ve gone away from simply the 1st Amendment and included the whole Constitution and the resulting entire US Code. You&#39;ve also gone away from just Reddit and apparently are including everywhere in the country.</p>

<p>What kind of a crazy cop out answer is this? Not Man enough to answer? Only sovereign enough to pay an internet bill?</p>

<p>To answer the question, YES, it IS constitutional.</p>

<p>Do you not know what THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS?</p>

<p>CONGRESS. Let&#39;s stop right there.</p>

<p>Supreme Court is not congress, therefore Supreme Court can make rulings which can abridge your freedom of speech, like they do with the no constitution zone which is 100 miles within the border of the United States of America, and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights-constitution-free-zone-map">look at the map</a>.</p>

<p>There you go <a href="/u/letshackreality">/u/letshackreality</a> , which is a stupid name by the way, because you can&#39;t hack reality, and no this isn&#39;t a derailment, because I answered the question, now I&#39;m saying something new because that stuff&#39;s over.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t hack reality and you can&#39;t reverse entropy.</p>

<p>The answers are there if you choose to accept them.</p>

<p>This sounds like yet another cop out excuse, because in this instance, the answer is clearly obvious, and should be very well known by a person claiming to be a sovereign man.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t you just do what I did and Google search it since you&#39;re already on the internet?</p>

<p>When finding the answer is that simple, your answer is a cop out excuse to not have to put out a definitive answer.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Free Speech</p>

<p><strong>Title-text:</strong> I can&#39;t remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you&#39;re saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it&#39;s not literally illegal to express.</p>

<p>Are our brains not forums by which infinite ideas can be manifest or be processed from external triggers?</p>

<p>Is consciousness not the ONLY modality of thought and therefor are not all venues by which conciousness are expressed modes of inspiration?</p>

<p>To me it seems that just as reddit has sub reddits and multiple ideas, some inspirational, some not, as well as the potential to be influenced by your ideas equally by those of another, so to do our brains.</p>

<p>If our brains are not the primary modality of consciousness, then what is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain why a forum of communication is not human consciousness, you have not dissuaded me. </p>

<p>And explain how, metaphorically, a website (like reddit, but any one really) is not simply a facet of the collective conscious that is internet, the same way an idea/thought/individual consciousness is not a facet of THE collective consciousness. Is this not analogous? And what is a model if not the best fit analogy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, Stephen King writes a scary novel from concepts and thoughts of his own making. You read that novel and put pictures in your mind about characters and events as you read it. Do you believe your conscious imagination is a match to what Stephen King&#39;s was? No, because it was a communication of ideas, not a mind meld of consciousness that exactly mirrors one anothers minds. You put the words together in your own mind to build a mental picture of what those words meant to you. There is no consciousness mental orb anywhere on the Internet. So, the Internet itself, while sharing great and insightful information, should be considered more of a tabloid than a truthful reference. Not saying there isn&#39;t truth on the Internet, but it does appear to be more and more of a type of marketing tool for tabloid fodder. Of that, I am conscious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if I have an interest in the novel and I choose to share this interest in the form of discussion, isnt that sharing consciousness, and isn&#39;t that exactly what reddit does?</p>

<p>Allow for the natural evolution of conciousness itself to be shaped outside of the infidivudal perspective to a concensus perspective, and is not then perspective itself conciousness.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are differing on our understanding of consciousness itself. How would you define human consciousness then? From that definition perhaps I can rephrase my original sentiment to one that we can both support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it is not sharing consciousness, it is sharing concepts, contexts, ideas and experience. Consciousness belongs to you and only you. A consensus perspective is just that. An agreed to context and concept by a group. Using Hitler as a reference, there was concensus. However each individual living in that consensus may have had conscious reservations about the consensus. So inwardly they were in conscious disagreement with the consensus, but outwardly they were conformist to the consensus regardless of their own conscience.</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this? I have been looking for one my whole life and have yet to find an adequate source for such a statement.</p>

<p>This example is inadequate for the terms of this discussion. Germans are not a seperate species and therefore do not have seperate conscious energy. Can you please rephrase this example in terms of a global/species perspective so that I may better understand your point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think threats (im assuming you verbally threatened them seeing you admittance to a felony assault, though i know you can get the same treatment by unlawfully brandishing a firearm and some other stuff too, for felony assault) are protected by the first amendment.

    <div class="md"><p>The cop went to grab me and all I thought was I did not want to go to jail, nor did I need violence on myself. The arrest report is absolutely a joke complete fabrication.</p>

<p>I had stuck up for another guy who got physically slammed face first on the hood of the car. This was 1999, I did not know the guy it just seemed very excessive as the guy was not really struggling. I basically got involved by trying to rally public support hence the shut your mouth bit.</p>
