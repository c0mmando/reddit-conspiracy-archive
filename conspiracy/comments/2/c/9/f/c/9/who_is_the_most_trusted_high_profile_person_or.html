    <div class="md"><p>Corbett Report is really an amazing source of information. I think that James Corbett is the perfect representative of the conspiracy community, with his professional citations and calm speaking voice James is an indispensable source of strange but true history. The fact that he is able to come off sounding so calm while saying terrifying but true things is the best part of his delivery. The mainstream media is more comfortable with ranting and raving Alex Jones as our figure head, alienating new people from joining or learning more about 9/11, JFK, etc. James Corbett, in more than 1 way is truly the antidote to Alex Jones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have world changing information, but it must come from a conspiracy brand that is implicitly &#39;trusted&#39;.</p>

<p>There is no such entity. If you have information, you should be looking for trusted names period. Of which there are also few.</p>

<p>If you cannot trust anyone on this sub with the information, then it follows you cannot trust anyone on this sub to provide a source.</p>

<p>My assumption is that you have infornation to feed the conspiracy community specifically, and you want the method that will hit the most targets in one shot so that you can remove yourself from the equasion. </p>

<p>I have my doubts this is meant to benefit the targeted. </p>

<p>The way I explain it is it&#39;s like a year long college class... that is how much info you need to go through to fully understand it. Some people in the conspiracy community may know more about the info than others.</p>

<p>I am not concerned about making a lot of money.. if I did try to make money off it it would be just to keep me surviving because I have worked on this for years with no pay.</p>

<p>I am currently trying to figure out how to document this on my own but it&#39;s an incredible challenge to do it in a way the general population can understand it..</p>

<p>Plus I suck at writing and I am even worse on camera...</p>

<p>Also key to understanding this is that all the info is out for anyone to find.. but we have been tricked into ignoring all of it.. even people in the conspiracy community.. even If I told you right now what it is you would think I am even more nuts than you probably already do.. and that is how it has been kept secret...</p>

<p>How can someone <em>steal</em> knowledge that is freely available? If you&#39;re not interested in making money from it and you feel it is important for people to know this, how does someone stealing this info and using it at all detract from your goals?</p>

<p>Further, I&#39;d argue that you already have shot yourself in the foot with this whole post and the atmosphere you&#39;re creating. Finding a ghost writer is gonna take $ and if you can&#39;t even organize it for a reddit post, what outlet is going to want to listen to you? </p>

<p>To really understand this you need to know what I know.. you don&#39;t so you just don&#39;t trust me... you have to trust I know what;s best since I know all the info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you definitely can&#39;t ignore him. He&#39;s arguably the biggest alt news guy out there so he gets scoops once in a while. I agree he&#39;s way over the top with his doom and gloom though. We&#39;d all be dead a long time ago if he was right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certain key aspects.. A LOT of the info is know... it&#39;s like the key to the whole puzzle.. but most aren&#39;t capable of understanding those keys..</p>

<p>BUT.. let&#39;s say one or 2 people WERE capable of understanding those keys.. my info still doesn&#39;t get out on a wide scale but they could take that info and try to start some energy company.. JUST to make money and not interested in other other info tied to it..</p>

<p>To really understand this you need to know what I know.. you don&#39;t so you just don&#39;t trust me... you have to trust I know what;s best since I know all the info.</p>

<p>How have I shot myself in the foot by trying to get help? Everything doesn&#39;t hinge on a subreddit...</p>
