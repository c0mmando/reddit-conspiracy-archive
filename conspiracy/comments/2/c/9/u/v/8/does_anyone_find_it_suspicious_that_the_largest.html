       Call me paranoid but I see Israel going for the last big push and their world sentiment being at an all time low at the same time as this world record outbreak of Ebola in Northwest Africa and now borders are about to be shut.  Additionally  the plane was shot down on the same day that they started their invasion.  I see US and Israeli interests aligning for this since the Dutch were large opponents in the EU for the sanctions on Russia and then they suddenly turned.  Russia successfully deflected the imminent destruction of Syria by the US and also frustrated Israeli interests at the same time.  There is a US puppet Kiev government engaged in ethnic cleansing on a region of Ukraine that is basically an extension of the Russian industrial economy.  Additionally Malaysia has strong opposition to the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) and they just can't get a break.

       Well it sounds like its pretty damn easy to stop the virus by locking down borders and it could just grind up those economies for future exploitation and also provide a great cover for things that are happening now.  I can just see the MSM animations running right now.  If the outbreak becomes very large then it will take most of the press off of what Israel is doing now.  Historically they know that they can do whatever they want as long as they do it in quick bursts.  They have demonstrated themselves to be capable of any rationalization and they have the reach to do just about anything.

       That being said, there is ZERO question in my mind that when they finally make the call to reduce the worlds population they will use a virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want a world pop of 3 billion, they'll release the virus, let the population plummet, then issue the vaccine when it hits 3 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, all the inner circle and their families will be inoculated even before the epidemic begins.

       I'm thinking that the African Ebola thing could be about getting something else to the front page while Israel expands and also about putting breaks on Chinese influence in Africa.  If China is doing lots of business then just lock it down.  We'll see if this spreads to East Africa.

       I'm saying that NOW is the big push for a hell of a lot of things.  My perspective is WAY different after being in Western Ukraine these last six months.

       oh I definitely agree its no coincidence that everything is going to batshit all at once. But the wars I understand, it's all an extension of what started in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq... countries are basically being split up to fall under the US/EU or Russia/China sphere of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's possible the outbreak is part of that trend, although I'm not sure it is.

       Well my intuition tells me that this is a Zionist puppeteer creation.  I was just thinking and what if Gaza is hit by this?  Do you find it interesting that Israel has been seemingly frantic and insane about closing all tunnels and has pretty much declared a buffer zone of hellfire between Gaza and Israel and that they have also called in reserve duty guards?

       The vaccines don't work and won't work and will be used to spread the virus not contain it. The inner circle of elite will be protected because they will not get the shot containing the virus (we will be told that it is going to protect us) that can only be spread with blood to blood contact.

       I'm already seeing disinfo that equates blood borne human ebola with airborn animal ebola.

       Expect shots to be pushed aggressively at your local Walgreens inside a fortnight. Buyer beware. And stay the fuck away from me.

       I was in the US Army for two months and I was given the full range of shots in one standing and within half of an hour I was sick as a dog and within a few days I was bleeding just a bit from my sinuses and feeling like a wreck.  I could go one about that but really I don't trust them one bit.

       Suspicious? Just because this outbreak is occurring before a major economic collapse and as peak oil is making itself very difficult to mask any longer, doesn't mean there is correlation. That's just more of that tinfoil hat thinking. Just like all those people who said that the NSA was spying on US citizens. Oh, wait....

       Yes, it's suspicious but not specifically connected with Israel.  There are many major turning points hapenning right now.

       Something particularly suspicious for me now is that Israel has been on this intense tunnel destruction push in Gaza.  If there was an outbreak I sure wouldn't want tunnels to be there.  Then there is the buffer kill zone between Israel and Gaza now.  So if its real difficult to get to the entrance of where a tunnel used to be and then the vast majority of the tunnels are destroyed then it would be quite some time before Gaza had any means of leaving.  If there was even the scare of an outbreak there then it could be the means to seal the genocide story there.  If there was an outbreak then the place is already a really solid prison but in that case it would be brutally contained.  Only major issue would be animals and such.

       No.  It came from a single patient zero which has happened many times before (ie in every other outbreak.)  the fact is, we just dodged bullets those other times.

       There's a lot of times in recent history where it would appear 'suspicious'. Selection bias.
