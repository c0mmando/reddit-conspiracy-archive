       Was is really just the Zionists so they could get their holyland and the Rothchilds' so they could fund both sides of an even bigger war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       seems something is fishy with at
       <strong>
        least
       </strong>
       the whole genocidal gas chambers killing 6 million
       <del>
        jews
       </del>
       people part, but who would make this up and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       My quest down this rabbit-hole started with
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eaf_1382262528">
        Adolf Hitler, the greatest story NEVER told
       </a>
       , which led me to question the narrative of "guy-guy USA saves world from evil-hitler", which led me to lectures by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFmHaygOF_g">
        Professor Robert Faurisson like this one
       </a>
       and this led me to videos like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieE22Apyn0Q">
        this
       </a>
       that soundly debunk the most solid evidence used which is confessions and blueprints of the gas chambers. I'm now pretty sure the deathcount was at
       <strong>
        least
       </strong>
       greatly exaggerated, but by who and why? That is the part where my research has hit a roadblock for now, I was just wondering if anyone here has any theories or links for me to continue researching and fact-checking in this quest for truth.

       The minimally conspiratorial reason for holocaust lies is to shift the blame of the deaths that did happen away from the allies who bombed supply lines nearing the end of the war.
      </p>

       "Hitler is literally Satan, and we beat him!" Looks better than "allied bombing inadvertently leads to millions of POW deaths" at the top of the front page.

       Also along the same lines, to soothe people upset because we blatantly committed horrific genocide of women and children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

       Without the holocaust, the bombing of japan seems to be out of context and seems to make us the bad-guys.

       A holocaust, by definition, was burnt offerings of flesh at the Temple. Everyone here screams Zionism, when I think it's really Luciferianism. There's black masses, rituals, sacrifices, charged locations. Shit is occult, layered as fuck and ancient. We only understand a glimmer of what is deep symbolism, rewritten history and stigmatized spiritual occurrences.

       That someone was trying to trick Lucifer into thinking they gave him a great offering? I am really not following this perspective at all here.  The question was about why the death tolls are exaggerated and the gas-chambers fabricated, not sure how Lucifer fits into that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may be an alternative hypothesis as to why there were genocidal gas chambers, but what proof do you have that there even were genocidal gas chambers and why would Lucifarians want to exaggerate death tolls and lie about gas chambers? I understand the theory I suppose, but not what it has to do with this post.

       If the root of most religious "good acts" is intention (prayer, spells, meditation, dances), there's a certain amount of energy in that. Not just the electrical energy of brains producing thoughts, but spiritual and psychic energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't claim to understand any of it, nor am I really interested in studying it, (I do believe there's black &amp; white magick, but hell if I would know the difference, nor if I was stumbling into a nonstick). I believe we create our own reality, based on thought. Our thoughts produce chemicals in our bodies, affecting mood, energy, cravings, pain, etc. We can alter our environment only so much (scented candles, comfy clothes, comfort foods, etc), but our reality is being human, in our bodies. In a way, we're little gods. We serve each other, ourselves, our corporate masters. Gah, I can't really explain it all. It's universal and minute. It's everything AND nothing. If I still smoked pot, I'd probably be able to express it better. But alas, no more burnt offerings for me.

       Do you have a theory that actually answers my question? WHO would do this, and what does a fictional character have to do with it? Even if the perpetrators think Lucifer is nonfictional, who would fabricate a genocide about it and what does the hoax of a genocide have to do with lucifer?

       The "Death Camps" and gas chambers we're discovered in camps liberated by the Soviets. Apart from Stalin, most of the elite bolsheivik hierarchy in Russia were JEWISH.  The U.S. also used atrocity propaganda. A ytube video shows U.S. military displaying shrunken heads, lampshades and human soap in Auschwitz. It seems simple enough. The Allies had SERIOUS war crimes to cover up, they also needed to de-nazify and pyschologically destroy the german people.

       In the jew bible, there's a prediction. The jews will get israel/Palestine when 6 million are sacrificed. They've been pushing that number for decades before ww2, they've also made the holohoax into a religion.

       Care to link proof that there were even some genocidal gas chambers somewhere? That proof will shut up most holocaust deniers, because there really doesn't seem to be
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       that I can find. People like  Professor Robert Faurisson have devoted their lives to finding this proof of genocidal gas chambers and are
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       empty handed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still not where I stand on this, but finding proof that there were genocidal gas chambers would be
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       substantial evidence against the claims made by the deniers who are actually almost all academics and professors from what I have seen. They are not the redneck uneducated southern neo-nazis like we are led to believe, they are simply people who realize history is written by the winner and seek proof for such extraordinary claims, which should be really easy to provide.

       They at least deny some parts of it, though I agree revisionists is a better term.

       I am well aware of the gas chambers, typhus was very real and very deadly at the time, that is why I was careful to always say "genocidal gas chambers" when talking about them in this context.

       Guards and other testomonies have been proven to be fakes and extracted through torture, the last link I posted was a testimonial being shown to not make any sense or be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photos I've seen show typhus delousing facilities far to small for the genocide of millions, and piles of bodies from the Typhus epademic.
      </p>
      <p>
       That we know the effects of a gas on the human body does not equate tot he genocide of millions.

       I know the official story we learned in school, if you can
       <strong>
        prove
       </strong>
       that there were indeed genocidal gas chambers please do I beg you. The lack of proof of these alledged genocidal gas chambers is where most all the holocost denialism comes from, because this should be a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       easy thing to prove especially if there are all these pictures you claim exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why this would be faked, that is exactly what I am asking and we have already come up with at least 3 good reasons. Though I was hoping to hear something new from someone with some insight, not simply someone parroting back the claim that is in question as evidence for it.

       You bother keeping them alive because you are dependent on slave-labor to win a war, and because the plan was to relocate them to Madagascar or Africa not murder them all.

       What about all the people who saw the chambers as I said before? Those who's family were murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not the effects of the gas. Core body temperature, the reason we know why it is bad to have it change from 37 degrees celcius is because of human experimentation.

      <p>
       For the slave labour, those who could no longer work, those under 18, those who were unable to work were immediately murdered upon arrival. The ones who could work were the slaves.

       <strong>
        genocidal
       </strong>
       gas chambers, or that the account was indeed by that man and that he was indeed there.

      <p>
       Kurt Gerstein is one of the biggest names because he is the only name brought up usually, and the words of one man who never actually saw any gassings himself are not evidence of 6 million dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, as I have clearly stated I do not believe the holocaust is a hoax quite yet, though the more I look into it the more I am seeing how little "evidence" for systematic genocide there actually is.

       Have you heard of the book "The man who broke into Aushwitz?" it is the true story of a British soldier who traded places with an inmate.

       Also Kurt Gerstein did see the doors close and then reopen to show the dead.

       In 1935 no nazi was seriously thinking about genocide. It was with them losing the war that caused this. At first they were prison camps, people were murdered but not on an official basis. When ex soviet territory was acquired (where there was a large population of Jews) the 'Jewish problem' became much larger and it was not viable to feed all of them. At first there were pogroms, unofficial murders of Jews, then the branch of the SS, the Einsatzgruppen, organised large scale shootings into mass graves. Soon they found that even those who were fully supportive of the murder began to crack due to the murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       This caused them to seek a new way to efficiently murder and remove the personal and expensive use of a gun. So they would attach pipes to exhausts of Diesel motors, this had it's own problems, diesel was expensive and the effects of the diesel created a great deal of mess from people ejecting their bowels.
      </p>
      <p>
       In comes zyklone b. One of the components of fertiliser which creates a lot of poison gas. Now all they had to do was lock the door, open the hatch in the top and shake some zyklone b inside, then close the hatch and wait

       The photos show evidence of dead bodies that may have starved from allies bombing supply routes or they may have been from typhus.

      <p>
       People have had deathbed confessions stating that they made holocaust stories up for attention or due to caving to pressure, what many would like to see is actual evidence such as these showerheads that spewed gas instead of water... O wait that was admitted to have never happened. The story just changes so much, the numbers keep going down and down. When will it stop?

        lots
       </strong>
       of evidence if 6 million people were executed yet there is little to none.

       Yes it is. As a historian you must consider alternate theories and agree with the one that you agree with the most with the supporting evidence. Therefore I believe what I have said and you believe want you have said

       but i know both sides, the side you know and the real side of the story. see this is the problem people have coming here and arguing the official version of a particular event, we all know the official side really well already and in most cases that is why we rejected it.

       I know these sides as well but I have decided that the conventional theory is the true one. The holocaust definitely happened though. We just disagree over the scale

       greater evil! Are you saying we should have waited until ALL the jews were exterminated before doing something?"

       Without the holocaust, the bombing of japan seems to be out of context and seems to make us the bad-guys.
