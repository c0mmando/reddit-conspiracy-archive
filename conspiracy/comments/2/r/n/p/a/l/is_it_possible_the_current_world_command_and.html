    <div class="md"><p>The pope is considered infallible and divine. They believe him to hold the place of God on Earth, believe he has the power to control heaven and Earth, and believe that all nations must submit to him. This is Catholic doctrine and is the very definition of royalty. The papacy is the longest running example of such a system.</p>

<p>Anyone who subscribes to the teachings of the pope is, at the very least, indirectly accepting this. Furthermore, we do indeed see his guidance being employed in government and religious unification. His support of the new world order is plain and on the table.</p>

<p>This is why there&#39;s so much disinformation about the Antichrist and Revelation in general. Pulpits aren&#39;t teaching this truth, but it&#39;s been known since the Reformation. Somehow it got lost and many protestant churches are turning back to Rome for guidance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shouldn&#39;t be your source of information. The Bible should. The Revelation in the Bible explains the central issue of mankind in general, demonstrating it with real events and real history. The battle is spiritual, and you either place your faith in God or you place your faith in men. You either take the Bible for what it says, or you trust men to tell you what to believe. You take the authority of scripture or the authority of the pope, there is no in-between.</p>

<p>The mark of the beast is demonstrated on the hand or in the forehead. It is in your actions and your thoughts. If you think for God and act in fear of the beast, you still wear the mark on your hand. You will not be able to buy and sell if you do not submit to fear of his authority, which includes the various governments around the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception_beast_666_Vicarius-Filii-Dei">There are multiple titles for the pope that equal 666</a>. His title Vicarius Filii Dei literally means in place of christ, or antichrist.

<p>The false prophets have, many of these coming from the Jesuit order sworn in allegiance to the pope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are immortal, dude. That&#39;s why we live forever... whether in Hell, or in Heaven.</p>

<p>No. That&#39;s false immortality. We&#39;re called to repent (change) and believe upon Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Praying to saints is simply asking them to intercede on your behalf to Jesus. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are in the grave. They know nothing and are asleep for the time being. You can&#39;t ask them anything. Nobody is judged until the end of days and none of them are in heaven right now. <strong>Jesus is our intercessor.</strong> You don&#39;t need to play telephone to get to Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It says you can choose to do some of your suffering on Earth instead of after death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works. You don&#39;t suffer in purgatory, there is no such thing. We don&#39;t suffer eternally, either. The wicked are purged. God does not make you suffer eternally, even the wickedest of the wicked. He sends them to the abyss.</p>

<p>The Bible also condemns adoration of the queen of heaven, whom they&#39;ve now transformed Mary out to be. Worshipping Mary is a serious problem. Infant baptism is not biblical. You must believe to be baptized and a child cannot make that decision. Confessing unto a priest is not Biblical. The Sunday sabbath change is not Biblical. Indulgences, as I said already, are not Biblical.</p>

<p>Salvation is only through Jesus Christ. Coming to repentance is changing within during your walk with Him, not paying money to other men and obeying their authority. It&#39;s not about suffering, though we do suffer tribulation. It&#39;s about understanding, trusting Him, and living by His word rather than fearing men.</p>

<p>The Catholic church is known for slaughtering those who obey God in opposition to the church. They exercise their own will, not God&#39;s will. They hoard wealth, and have turned the church into a den of thieves. Remember when Jesus said that? Examine those passages, the players in them, and ask Him for understanding.</p>

<p>Jesus is the rock and the cornerstone, not the pope. Jesus is alive and He needs no representative here on Earth. The Bible is His two witnesses preaching the gospel unto all nations.</p>

<p>The time is now when we must choose our mark. Do we obey Christ or do we obey men? They are deceivers causing people to bow before man&#39;s authority. They&#39;ve changed God&#39;s times and laws literally, changing the calendar and changing the commandments. The Son is Lord of the Sabbath, not of Sunday... but the papacy removed this in favor of unrighteousness.</p>

<p>Pope Leo XIII, Praeclara Gratulationis Publicae (The Reunion of Christendom), June 20, 1894:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They then place their mark of authority over people via Sunday, showing who the protestant churches (false prophets) are really obeying. From their own mouths...</p>

<p>Chancellor Albert Smith for Cardinal of Baltimore Archdiocese, letter dated February 10, 1920: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Protestants would follow the Bible, they should worship God on the Sabbath day by God is Saturday. In keeping the Sunday, they are following a law of the Catholic Church. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cardinal James Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers (Ayers Publishing, 1978): 108: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Letter from C.F. Thomas, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons on October 28, 1895:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act…And the act is a <strong>mark</strong> of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.&quot; (Revelation 18:4)</p>

<p>I have been looking into it since I could read; I know my religion inside and out.  The fact that you think Catholics worship Mary means you know nothing of the Catholic Church, and clearly have not ever thought to ask an actual Catholic about the matter, since any Catholic can quickly confirm that they do not worship Mary and have never even considered it nor been taught to by any priest.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand Catholicism.  Read 10 papal encyclicals and a couple books by some of the Catholic Church Fathers, and 100 Canon Laws, and the entire Catechism, <em>then</em>, come back and try to debate Catholicism with at least some semblance of understanding.</p>

<p>If any Catholic suggested the worship of Mary to another Catholic, they&#39;d be laughed at.</p>

<p>Pope Leo XIII, Sapientiae Christianae: On Christians as Citizens (January 10, 1890):</p>

<p>This thought has been, and is, a source of deep concern to Us; for it is impossible to think of such a large portion of mankind deviating, as it were, from the right path, as they move away from Us, and not experience a sentiment of innermost grief.

<p>This is not saying the Pope is God.  It&#39;s just saying that, since God gave the pope authority to do what he does, obeying the pope is ultimately obedience to God.  Like if your dad leaves you with a babysitter and says <em>obey her</em>, obeying her is the same as obeying your father.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s not.</p>

<p>The Vatican is there to maintain control over between 1 and 2 billion people.</p>

<p>The new Pope was put in place because the effectiveness of &quot;the old ways&quot; was rapidly deteriorating. The new guy presents the message differently, which maintains more hearts and minds and may even bring some who&#39;ve strayed back into the fold.</p>

<p>But make no mistake, that the whole shebang is a very elaborate, very effective mechanism of controlling a shitton of people and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The institution has since roughly the end of the Spanish Inquisition not been in control. It doesn&#39;t control enough people for the Pope to make any sort of a grab for more power, even if somehow he does have a clue how he&#39;s being used.</p>

<p>Yes, the leaders absolutely 100% want their subjects invested in (meaning controlled by) religion. But they, themselves are not.</p>
