<p>Our founding fathers believed in a Creator who gives us certain unalienable rights. Without recognizing a Creator, your rights are not inalienable and are subject to change. This idea is foundational upon the republic so many long for a return to.</p>

<p>We are headed toward a system where rights are given to men at the will of the &#39;common good,&#39; which is a deceitful way of saying other men. If you believe you have no Creator, you have no real foundation to object to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we weren&#39;t created, then we aren&#39;t necessarily equal. A belief in God is what gives us the right to declare our freedom and equality. It was this belief that we are created beings equal in the eyes of God that is vital to liberty.</p>

<p>If you take that out of the equation, you&#39;re left being subject to the collective majority - if not the assumed royalty. The only option is that we somehow mutated into our current state and there is no true right or wrong, but rather survival at whatever cost.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a worldview issue that underlies the transformation we&#39;re seeing in our country and around the world... What was lost that is leading to our destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution is an unproven speculation being passed off as fact. The scientific community hangs on to it because it&#39;s all they&#39;ve got. There is no mechanism to provide for new information, only loss of information and variation within limits.</p>

<p>Even considering we don&#39;t rule out the chance hypothesis, we have very much ruled out Darwin&#39;s ideas for life arising by chance. The extrapolations made have no supporting evidence, and we&#39;ve only found more reasons to discard it. There is a serious need for a better model based on chance because we currently don&#39;t really have one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean? You don&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>Darwin was an explorer, he was a scientist. One of the things that got him thinking was the finches with different beaks on different islands of the Galapagos chain. He spent years researching and gathering information. Remember he didnt know how traits were passed on, he knew it was by reproduction but he didn&#39;t know about genes, DNA </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but many still hold his postulate that cats and dogs have a common ancestor between the two without cause for believing so. The work done in the field of DNA have further exacerbated the issue, not improved its chances.</p>

<p>What we observe are many trees of life, starting with a certain kind of animal that branches off into many varieties of that kind. Darwin tried to connect these kinds further back than they go. There is no confirmation that this is possible and even more support that it is not, meaning we have an explosion of lots of kinds of creatures all at once with no real way to explain it.</p>

<p>The truth is not what it&#39;s made out to be, and even if we did discover a way it could happen by chance it doesn&#39;t rule out a Designer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ElA0--JNg">wonderful interview</a> with a non-religious PhD scholar and a presentation from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW6egHV6jAw">Stephen Meyer</a> (PhD) that can add more depth on the subject.

    <div class="md"><p>The core idea of evolution, the principles behind it are solid. We can see evolution only in rapidly reproducing bacteria mostly, they go through so many generations in a short time, antibiotic resistant bacteria? Through natural selection they survived and bred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antibiotic resistant bacteria is a loss of information. It does not provide a mechanism for bacteria to, piece by piece, become more complex.</p>

<p>My favorite allegory with the case for antibiotic resistant bacteria is that it is like saying a no armed man has an advantage because he cannot be handcuffed. Sure, it&#39;s good in some situations, but in reality it&#39;s something lost, not gained.</p>

<p>Natural selection and variation are not in dispute here. What&#39;s in dispute is a single, uniform tree of common descent among all living things. Rather than this being the case, we see an explosion of many kinds of life within a five million year period with no explanation as to how this could happen. Birds, fish, invertebrates, insects, bacteria and thousands upon thousands of others appear simultaneously.</p>

<p>I recommend viewing the material I&#39;ve provided. I&#39;m not claiming any other answer here, but I encourage your skepticism to approach this issue because it deserves it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean &quot;within a five million year period&quot;?  The anti bacterial resistance is a show of evolution, over time they will become more and more resistant. Also if it doesn&#39;t benefit the organism then the mutation of multi cellular structures would be inefficient and the organism would perish due to the excess energy required</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the Cambrian Explosion. The time for this to have occurred has only gotten shorter the more we find, and the breadth of kinds of life has only gotten wider and more complicated. The problems with Darwin&#39;s theory have only gotten worse, not better.</p>

<p>Yes. It is the result of massive catastrophe, considering how fossils are formed in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From a naturalistic worldview, yes. What we see is different, and scientific insight has not given this idea credibility.</p>
