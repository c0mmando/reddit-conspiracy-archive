    <div class="md"><p>Youclaim to be skeptics but you&#39;ve already decided Israel is behind this attack based on zero evidence. All you have is a statement by Netanyahu that could be interpreted in a dozen ways, and you automatically opt for the craziest one.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a conspiracy: Perhaps <strong>you</strong> and your fellow travelers are JIDF. Your goal is to make it so opposition to Israeli policies appears to be founded on racism and illogical bias / hatred. When a person sees a dead Palestinian kid murdered by an Israeli soldier or suspects something fishy is going on when Israel says it wants peace while expanding settlements, they suspect they aren&#39;t getting the real story and come here or to places like it, and what do they see? Jews sank the Titanic, tangled up your Christmas lights, and are responsible for everything that has befallen you in life. Wow, it looks like the ADL / AIPAC <em>were</em> right after all. <strong>At best</strong> you&#39;re a useful idiot. </p>

<p>Nice try, Benjamin. I&#39;m on to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it strange that everyone knows Mossad and other Israeli agencies and forces are some of the best, deepest cover, most advanced intelligence agencies in the history of the world. My Israeli friends love to brag about it, and from a historical perspective, I love to hear their stories. </p>

<p>Israel has a history on extreme action, and I&#39;m not putting a value on that. It can be argued that none are justified, but can just as easily be argued that many or most or all are. I don&#39;t care about that aspect of the debate right now. </p>

<p>What bothers me is people that play coy with history and current reality, as if all Mossad ever did was wait for terrorists to attack and then try to stop them. </p>

<p>Is Israel behind the Paris attacks? I can&#39;t imagine that being true. </p>

<p>If you agree, make an actual point. There certainly seems to be standard delegitimization and obfuscation going on by accounts that are clearly here for that purpose. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much of a dog in the Israel/Palestine fight. Both sides do a ton of fucked up things. </p>

<p>But this is a sub about discussing conspiracies, and it&#39;s clear as day that in the last few months, but especially the last few days, this sub has been inundated with posters attempting to shift and control the debate. </p>

<p>Before you get your panties in a twist about me comparing people posting online with killing cartoonists, that&#39;s not the comparison I&#39;m about to make in practical terms. </p>

<p>But attempting to limit and control the debate is ugly and dangerous, whether done by Muslim terrorists, the JIDF, the NSA, or paid corporate shills. And that&#39;s our current reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually funny, this sub is so mired in cognitive dissonance. One hand the mossad can plan this operation and make it so that no reputable outlet recognizes their hand and on another they are so careless, that a some amateur at a home computer can spot their fingerprint on the operation using publicly available news footage. </p>

<p>You cannot have it both ways. Why is it so hard to believe that some radicalized young men, usually fringe losers, who want an easy way to get purpose and fame (or infamy) would go out and do this? Its very much consistent with human behavior and patterns go back centuries. The mossad does not need to stage anything, there are plenty of losers in the islamic community who have shown themselves to be dumb enough buy into radical islam and hurt their own community&#39; interests...</p>

<p>Every community has violent fringe elements... no need for false flags. Islam in particular, because its mainstream adherents raise their children to believe that women should obey them, that their religion is better coupled with the youth unemployment in Europe and the existing body of violent doctrine online, are particularly vulnerable. </p>

<p>When are people going to stop blaming 6 million Jews for the problems of 7.5 billion? Why, because its easier to drag out the elders of zion than to discuss income inequality, unemployment, globilzation and automation,  decimation of the western middle class, assimilation vs multiculturalism, encroachment of western enlightenment ideals? </p>

<p>Its so much easier I guess, to state it dem zionist running the bilodenberg group stealing all the gold and running the world staging random false flag events to control the sheeple.... its so much easier to sit here and decry how blind the sheeple are, while corporations have more rights than you, our planet is heating up, our education system erodes... while the 0.1% literally runs off with everything including your and your children&#39;s futures? </p>

<p>And you know what, theses conspiracy theories are not so innocent. They impregnate the minds of the unstable and impressionable and then you get idiots like these acting on it... the arab communities, or the arab street as it is known, is really into these conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Why not get politically active and tackle the real conspiracies threatening your future and mine? Why because it might mean meeting live humans and working with them for incremental change... working through a boring and unpleasant process that may or may not succeed? Or because you might actually have to logically reason a position and no associate your way to a conclusion ala glen beck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are real conspiracies, just conspiracy theorists always rehash the same tired tropes and reflexively call every terrorist attack a zionist false flag... real conspiracies are more complex, more subtle but also less tight... the media is a market... they compete for a scoop, they published the snowden and manning files. They will report when they find things as they did with all the conspiracies you mentioned. Their analysis tends to be crap, biased and reflexive... but they do report the basic facts. Also glad you have friends and a girlfriend and maybe a job... glad the zionist have not taken that away from you...or is it bildenburg? or the illuminati? maybe its the rothchilds? </p>

<p>These conspiracy theories are literally rehashes of the same shit since elders of zion was published in the early 1900s or so by the russians.</p>

<p>Now, with that being said - I am not dismissing these alternative theories - as the seem at least more credible to the MSM&#39;s narrative - I want to caution all users and lurkers here that just because the Truth will likely be incompatible with what the MSM is propagating, does not mean we should lower our threshold of evidence we use to disprove MSM narratives (if evidence you first find seems to agree with your pre-conceived notions of the classic whodunnit research mentality).</p>
