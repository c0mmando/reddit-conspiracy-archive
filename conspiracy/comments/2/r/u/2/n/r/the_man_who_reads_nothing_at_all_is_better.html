<p>Reddit is mostly just tabloid junk. It isn&#39;t worded with headlines as dumb as <em>THIS ONE FLORDIA MAN FOOLED THE COPS WITH THIS TRICK YOU&#39;LL NEVER BELIEVE</em> headlines, but the content it points to is very similar. Lowest common denominator, exaggerated stories with tons of click ads on them. I find myself having to really just pull away from this website these days and stop wasting my time on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. The Ukraine thing is a big one. So many people are brainwashed on that. It was all Putin&#39;s fault and he stole Crimea, blah blah blah. I got one dude to watch <a href="http://youtu.be/fWkfpGCAAuw">the StormCloudsGathering video on it</a> and he said, &quot;well, even if that&#39;s true, I&#39;d rather have &#39;American style&#39; democracy in Ukraine than Russian.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With my family it pretty much went in a way where they said a lot of things about Russia and then when I clarify and give background then it turns into a team Russia vs team America conversation.  UFM2 even declared that I am a &quot;Putin boot-licker&quot;.  Additionally, UFM2 tried to disqualify me from the <del>conversation</del> live Twitter battle for being on my second serving of Scotch whiskey.  UFM2 was also kind of a dick to me by saying that it was the first intelligent thing that I had said all night when I explained some budding thoughts of his as having to do with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect">R2P</a> issue.</p>

<p>Also, my post was just linked to on r/thathappened and apparently being over there for 1.5 years and having multiple girlfriends is unbelievable.  Personally, I would of liked to of had a girlfriend more of my time there but I guess that apparently compared to some I&#39;m living some legendary unobtainable lifestyle.  I&#39;ve encountered this on the Internet a few times about Ukraine this year that people just can&#39;t seem understand that living there is not some huge deal and its just about wanting to go over there and to accept and deal with all of the changes in lifestyle.  In the meantime it won&#39;t stop people from overextending on their knowledge of an issue.  Its been real obvious to me for a number of years that I don&#39;t get respect for the things that I&#39;ve done.  In my ideal world I&#39;d like to see UFM1 and UFM2 saying &quot;WOW! You were living in that place that everyone was talking about this last year!  Whats going on over there?&quot;  Really the disparity of the breadth of our experience on the subject only highlights the fact that I can&#39;t get any respect there.  I really doubt that I&#39;m the only one in this boat either.</p>

<p>I could see him saying something <em>like</em> this considering the whole Sally Hemmings thing or the bitter newspaper wars, but the language just doesn&#39;t really sound like something he, or anyone besides Franklin, would say.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a paraphrase. He said, &quot;the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them&quot;.</p>

<p>With a little more context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, &quot;by restraining it to true facts &amp; sound principles only.&quot; Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it&#39;s benefits, than is done by it&#39;s abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live &amp; die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.</p>

<p>Here is a real quote from Jefferson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was inclined to agree with you before I realized that this quote deserves more attention.</p>

<p>As a man, the subject would have most likely already received enough education prior to becoming a man to be able to read.</p>

<p>Jefferson is describing one man who chooses not to read anything at all and another man who only chooses to read newspapers.</p>

<p>Both extremes are unlikely, and only provided to make a point that the choice to read nothing is better (actually more educated) than the choice to only read newspapers.</p>

<p>In other words, he is saying that the education provided by newspapers is detrimental.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to agree with that is another issue, but as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/putin_hates_cats">u/putin_hates_cats</a> said, the quote has nothing to do with reading ability!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good argument, although what I was trying to express, albeit imprecisely, was the lack of understanding, not literal illiteracy.</p>

<p>Although media such as newspaper is often not of high journalistic standards, and has its own agenda (the owners, such as Murdoch is a good example here), and that government&#39;s will apply their own pressures I&#39;d argue that there&#39;s still enough factual information contained in it that you can compare it to what you already know, and make your own determinations.</p>

<p>As an aside, I wonder what it would be like if Jefferson had been a contemporary politician and said “The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but the internet.”?</p>
