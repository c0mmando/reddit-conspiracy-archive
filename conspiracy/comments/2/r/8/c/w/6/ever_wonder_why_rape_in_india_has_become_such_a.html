<p>What does it boil down to? Money of course.</p>

<p>................</p>

<p>And as usual, reddit is right on the pulse of this propaganda wave. Isn&#39;t it amazing how the narrative on this website ends up aligning so well with the sensationalized topics the mainstream wants us to drool over?</p>

<p>There are two possibilities. Us optimists here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> prefer the less-scary possibility that Reddit has a highly productive &quot;official story enforcement division&quot; that goes around shaping discussions on this site to fit that narrative.</p>

<p>The other is that all the MSM has to do is say whatever they like in an authoritative tone and it reverberates around society (including redddit) like it is the gospel truth.</p>

<p>Most people just listen to the news and accept it wholly, without question or criticism, and they think that anyone espousing a contrary view is mentally ill.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the society we&#39;re dealing with. Sad but (probably) true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to take into account is verifying the actual rape and this can be a sensitive topic to discuss but it should not mean we should subvert the discussion altogether.</p>

<p>I know the Swedish reports of rape have come under extreme scrutiny for posting bias information mainly stemming from families not wanting to be associated with immigrant families as well as a lack of education on what means rape in a hyper-liberal environment. </p>

<p>No means no, but regretting it later does not mean no.</p>

<p>Take all of these &#39;statistics&#39; with a grain of salt because depending on the country and their level of poverty you can assume that some might be a one sided ordeal whereas others that suffer from &#39;real&#39; poverty and the issues associated with them correlate with increased violence against women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Least we forget that Assange is being prosecuted in Sweden for having intercourse with a sexual partner while she was asleep (ergo rape). Also in developed nations rape cases are more likely to be reported.</p>

<p>Then we have all the cases that go unregistered, which should put (on a per capita basis) ME nations alongside African.</p>

<p>As for India, besides the gang-rape incidents, which gets coverage no matter where it occurs (Brazil, S.Korea, England) there is the occurrence with foreigners (as the latest with a Japanese girl) specially tourists. And since India is an internationally renowned tourist destination the impact is much greater (it hits closer to home than some rape case amongst Botswanians).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this article&#39;s conclusion that the global evangelical movement is behind this a bit unconvincing, as if the MSM works for Christians. It would seem that the Asian gospel arm of said movement is using, or at least benefitting, from the sensationalist reporting/narrative, but I think that hardly proves that they orchestrated it. IMO, such a claim (i.e., a claim which identifies gospel missionaries of all groups--not a secret society, not Rothschilds or banksters or Jews/Zionists, not rogue government or intelligence agents--as the unseen power broker elite behind a given conspiracy allegation) would require extraordinary proof, as I consider that one a patently extraordinary claim, and against the weight of most other facts and narratives tending to expose the truth behind the elite and world events. </p>
