</blockquote>

<p>I share your opinion 100%. The following days TPTB had the full brunt of their online resources bearing down on reddit and this sub in particular. Mass shadowbans were handed out, an insane influx of new and old users drowned out the conversations here, and &quot;patriotic&quot; witch-hunts began on users trying to discover the truth.</p>

<p>God, I still remember the creepy Michael Jackson lady look-a-like that placed one of the bombs. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous that these poor kids have been murdered (yes, both are dead) and blamed for what happened that day. The fucking evidence is right there out in the open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening from the beginning when they called out the car was stolen at the gas station.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cnl3y/armed_assailant_on_mit_campus_gunshots_fired/c9ia4tl?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cnl3y/armed_assailant_on_mit_campus_gunshots_fired/c9ia4tl?context=3</a></p>

<p>Got that name shadow banned after I pissed off an admin over the user that so called doxxed the families of sandy hook. Kinda shouldn&#39;t have said what I did. But its done now.</p>

<p>Anyways there were many questions that night from how the officers in a chase vehile claimed there were explosives being thrown from the car and how there were explosions called put over the radio in the apt complex.</p>

<p>The officers actually were the ones that called out the reports too. Then how they switched to channel one almost instantly when fox news picked it up. Reddit got on it a full 36 minutes before msm got onto it.</p>

<p>Also why the fuck after the call was made by an officer advising the swat team that the boat was full of fuel they explicitly called for approval to use flash bangs. At the &quot;rear&quot; of the boat. They did this twice over the radio. </p>

<p>Then someone came over and said switch to channel 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok this thing is getting old mods. I know the reasoning and the point, but for gods sakes can we work on the assumption that the community knows that going to anotuer linked thread thru here and voting will get you smacked with a ban hammer?</p>

<p>Its obvious people from this community are hated. We deny the holocaust happened. We want to see the dead children from sandy hook so we can satisfy our pedophile/necrophilia hunger.</p>

<p>Its really a bad thing when someone has the gall to ask me if I dont think planes hit the trade towers. I mean really wtf else coulda done it? (Not bring down the towers just hit the building) We as a community are inn a bad light mods. Who cares if one deleted a post? Its a distraction from a sensitive topic that was brought up and they wanted the oh I got banned woe is me. </p>

<p>Then drama so it gets voted to the top instantly. Because others that despise this sub and the free thinking it promotes dont want you thinking about real issues that matter.</p>

<p>Come one people real talk. Do you really think a guy shot his g/f in Baltimore and drove all the way to the Bronx to kill two cops.</p>

<p>How many of you have made that drive at the times they suggest he did? I have its enough to make you wanna say to hell with it and go looking for weebo and Omar in the Baltimore projects.</p>

<p>Its a issue that is about to catalyze into the real us (citizens) vs cops. We dont want that. Sorry about the rant hopefully someone sees it and thinks about it before it gets buried like everything else ever posted in here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an active disinformation campaign on the sub, first with muligetta, then the Saudi. </p>

<p>But that was before the standoff, </p>

<p>It went bomb, then muligetta and the Saudi, then Sunil tripati, then the release of the actual photos of the guys by FBI, then the chase, then the gun battle, then the boat scene.  </p>

<p>Is &quot;standoff&quot; the gun battle ,or the boat scene? </p>
