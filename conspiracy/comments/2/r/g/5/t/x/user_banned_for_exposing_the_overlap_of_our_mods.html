       We can't let this happen, we are always here complaining about how media manipulates our opinion, and now that we have chance to expose those who censor us, the solution is just sit down and forget? NO.

       Create a competing sub called UncensoredConspiracy, be the mod, Never let in another mod, promote the shit out of it and never delete, ban or censor anyone, even if they express opinions you dont agree with. Anyone can create a subreddit and be a mod. Problem solved.

       The problem with secession of subscribers is that the sub that they secede from will always be the first stop that people make when searching for that topic. Whatever the second subreddit is named, it will have a much harder time building and maintaining a subscriber base. I've seen this happen with other subreddits, where certain users protested certain image posts that the subreddit was literally created for. It forced the users to move and set up their own sub, with a name that anyone looking for the subject it related to, would likely never find it. So, at that point you're relying on word of mouth to build the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, anyone can go off and start their own sub, but why make such a sacrifice when a subreddit that's dedicate to this kind of political outrage could just rally it's users to take it back? There are more of you than there are mods. If they ban everyone then the sub will die and creating your own might actually be more viable. This literally is your game.

       Well you can all sit here and bitch about the problem, post about the problem and blow smoke up each others asses about noticing the problem, yet the problem is still there. So why not simply cut the snake off at the head. I don't see how this is so difficult, it's not like you have to carve a new sub out of granite, it's a simple case of make a new sub and migrate the traffic to it.Have one mod and literally just clone this Sub taking the good and removing the bullshit, ie. the mods. (I'm serious though, just cross post your content and watch it not get scrubbed.)

        Look!
       </a>
       This took all of a whole minute to set up, direct traffic to it instead of here. Problem fuckin solved. Oh and I'm the Mod BTW only difference being from the current ones here is I truly don't give a fuck what you have to post as long as it is within the context of the sub (Anything Conpiracy related) and isn't outlandishly racist (No you're not racist for posting crap about Israel). I have no desire to hold sub power and control the content. You wanted your true conspiracy sub free of biased mods. Done and done.

       This will probably get me banned so I'll see you at the new one :)

       I've been here a long time and I have been pretty impressed by the mods. I only see assholes and trolls complain about the mods, and they usually can't back up their claims. This current situation is troubling, of course there may be problems, the mod team may have been infiltrated, we know there are people who would want to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I've noticed, over the last 6 months, a concerted effort to sow discontent with the mods here, coming from certified
       <em>
        outsiders
       </em>
       . We should be aware that there are people who want to do that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       My impression is that some group is trying to cause a user revolt here in order to increase their influence over the moderation.

       A senior mod made the decision to levy these bans, we gave him an opportunity to explain himself in the modmail and when he failed to do so we reinstated the users.
      </p>
      <p>
       As lower level mods we have to be somewhat careful, as the mod in question could remove all of us on a whim (although doing so would no doubt cause a large problem in the community and I do not believe he would do such a thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a general note about the post in question; there are two active users on our modteam who also mod large subreddits;

        /r/technology

       because
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/">
        he discovered the word filter list setup by davidreisss666 and publicly shamed that fat fuck off the mod team there
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I was added to worldnews by one of their senior mods with a mandate to keep an eye on removals from the backend.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have one inactive mod (illuminatedwax) who also mods some large subs, but he does not use reddit very much; for example, he mods
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof

       but
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       has been banned from

       Just out of curiosity could you explain how you guys recruit mods and why a controversial mod would have that much power in one sub? Like most things in life this just seems like a great way to abuse a position, what sorts of checks and balances does the mod team on this sub use?

       Except this is not an isolated incident, numerous people (myself included) have detailed incidents in which we were banned unjustly and without explanation for posts that don't violate subreddit rules at all.

        This post in particular is deeply concerning.
       </a>
       The fact that a moderator has taken it upon himself to be the sole decider of what "is" and "is not" a conspiracy, and carries out systematic censorship of things that single moderator has deemed of no concern to this subreddit is deeply concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sitting back and allowing this behavior, while at the same time adding "censored in x subreddit" flair to posts about reddit censorship is hypocritical.

       I wasn't the person who banned either user, I thought the bans were unjust, we discussed it amongst ourselves in the mod mail and I unbanned them.  It being made public was one of the only reasons I and the other mods noticed the ban happening, we aren't alerted to bans unless we go check the mod log on our own.

       That's not the rigth thing, the right this is to ban the mod who censored the users. This mod
       <a href="/u/mr_dong">

       has not even made a public apology, he even laughed at the user who rencently banned.

       Doesnt saying ANYTHING negative about the mods violate rule 10?

      <p>
       And Mr_Dong telling the user "tough shit" and laughing at him technically violates rules 4 and 10.

       Oh shit. I just made an accusation of a rule violation. That violates Rule 2.

       I'm one individual on a team of individual mods.  I can't speak for the others - all I can do is moderate to the best of my personal abilities and try to make my opinion known if and when I think one of the other mods steps over the line and hands out a ban unjustly (as I did in this case).  I can't speak to dong's intentions as he hasn't been on reddit since yesterday to defend himself.  What I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       say is that I don't think unjustified bans and censorship really occurs here to the extent that you're implying, I try to keep an eye on the mod log and the ban list to ensure that things like yesterday don't happen with any frequency.

       The Reddit Moderators serve their corporate overlords good and well and they strike with vengeance. They do not accept any criticism of :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The ruling class.
       </li>
       <li>
        The biased mass media, including Reddit.
       </li>
       <li>
        The mega corporations and their crimes, fraud and tax evasions.
       </li>
       <li>
        The T.B.T.F. financial institutions and their wast complex of fraud, theft, price manipulations and political
        <del>
         briberies
        </del>
        lobbyism.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Federal Reserve and their illegal money printing scheme.
       </li>
       <li>
        The widespread corruption in politics and the dysfunctional two party system.
       </li>
       <li>
        The military industrial complex.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Intelligence community and their blatant disregard for the US constitution and their mass surveillance illegal activities.
       </li>
       <li>
        The criticism of the militarisation of law enforcement agencies.
       </li>
       <li>
        The broken and corrupt justice system, the destruction of Due Process of Law, by the ruling class.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Inequality, poverty and austerity that plagues many US citizens, while the ruling class becomes richer and richer.
       </li>
       <li>
        The unfair and completely lag of taxations of wealth in the US, if you belong to the ruling class.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That is how you get a shaowban or your posts removed to an obscure sub-Reddit or just simply deleted. If they are in the mood, the Moderators will allow your post to be either down voted or trolled into oblivion by "PR firms" and "Government Contractors". The idea of pluralism and the exchange of ideas died a long long time ago on Reddit.

       There's critizm of the ruling class, media (including Reddit), mega corps (Monsanto comes to mind quick, Google and Microsoft..etc.), the FED (infact i dare you to find a day the fed doesn't make the top 50 here.) etc. etc.

       I'm all for a good conspiracy, but to suggest there are taboo topics in a forum that wanted to show us "the kinder side of Hitler" (lol i never ever thought i would type that.) the concept of taboo is ridiculous. As wild as it may be, it's freedom of speech at it's finest. Sure there are bumps, but the process works, and allows us our voices weither you accept that, or not. I think tptb would like nothing more than us to take a defeatest attitude and be like, "welp, they got it all on lock, can't even talk about it anymore ." Silence is the most power shield a despote can wield.

       hardly, and i would love a mod to step in on this. I am 98% sure that i am against alot of the grain around here. I drop quips, I disagree constantly, and rarely, I actually say something relievent and thought provoking (i hope). To me it's proof of mod tolerance. Just like they tolerate those pro-nazi d-bags, they tolerate my trollieness because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is about throwing out some wild ideas, talking them over with others and allowing those whom browse the forum to come to thier own conclusions. I'm sorry if you've been banned here before, and I know no mod team is perfect. They are only human after all (unless they're bots and/or lizard ppl).

       Conspiracy websites (reddit included) are the biggest targets for disinformation and censorship. The odds of mod corruption in this sub are extraordinarily high. Perhaps all of them, a few, or only one. It is hard to tell, but it's a fact of life.

       I doubt any of them personally know each other IRL. A mod could easily be a team of intelligence analysts for any firm or government. Just a thought experiment.

       It's a little group of jerks that can't stand the existence of this sub. They try this witch-hunt routine every few weeks or so with new accounts. They link to it in various sordid subreddits and IRC channels for vote gaming purposes.

       You know what really bothers me about this shit and all the related posts is that this user is a new user. If they had been a previous user I would like them to prove their identity publicly before accusing a mod who has obviously been here for a very long time of misconduct. I at first thought this to be frivolous but apparently its a direct attack to our sub. I understand my acct is new but I can point out my old user name easily and it was a 3 and 1/2 year old acct.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am getting at is I have NEVER seen this guys (catholic_fetishistic) posts before and it comes off as an attack more than anything.

       It's not a tactic its called statistic and conspiro helps me with that all the comments I replied to you have been downvoted with the same quantity your comments have been upvoted minutes later after being posted, even those oh people barely read because of the volume.

       One up/down vote per IP address... or didn't you know that? Even if I had 1,000 accounts and downvoted you with all of them it would still only show up as one downvote. Try it yourself. Using one of your other accounts, upvote one of your comments, Then log out and you'll see that your other vote didn't count. Minus 2 means at least three
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       people downvoted you. You shouldn't be surprised. It's well deserved.

       Yes, sorry to inform you but I do have friends here. And after working here as a mod with the rest of the mods, I consider them as friends too. I stick up for them because I know for a fact that they do a great job in a very difficult situation and will always come under attack by those trying to undermine this sub. Sure, they may make an occasional mistake but... who doesn't?

       For your information, that mod's "proof" that he doesn't up vote himself isn't valid. I don't know if he does, but switchysharp or TOR would take care of the IP issue easily. That is how shills can run 10 or more accounts at the same time.

       I wouldn't know about that. I tried the Firefox extension 'Hide My Ass' a couple years ago and wasn't even able to log into any website. I assumed all those similar anonymity enhancing apps were the same. I thought that was the point of them... keeping a person anonymous. It's my understanding that the simple act of logging in eliminates that anonymity.

       The admins see your IP. If you use TOR, they see an IP from China, Russia, etc. The only problem with it is you have to cycle your IP when you switch accounts. You can run 3-4 accounts from different browsers at the same time all using an IP mask though, so it's not too inefficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, open chrome and use switchysharp. Open Firefox and use TOR, etc. But this is coming from a guy with little knowledge on the subject. I'm sure many others have much more advanced techniques. I'd like to get my hands on some documents from an AstroTurfing company.

       That sounds like a lot to have to go through just to post extra up/down votes unless one has a program/application/bot/whatever to control it. In my mind, there's only a certain type of person that would go to that extreme and it's not the type that are real, regular subscribers here interested in conspiracy theories.

       <br/>
       Making up drama, cross posting all over reddit, sockpuppets calling for the removal of certain mods, then some nice level, headed smart guy comes along, and all these accounts that have been shitposting here for months call for him to be sworn in, to 'sort the place out, and save the subreddit'

       Not true. Another user proposed that AMA and fed Axolotl phony contact information for Richard Gage. Sadly, Axolotl fell for the troll. Just as many here are falling for the crap that OP catholic_fetishistic has posted. People that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

       Edit: btw, axolotl discredited the 911 truth movement by displaying a fake AMA.

       It's beyond incomprehensible why users like yourself would accuse those who wish to get rid of mods who make nefarious 'bad decisions.'

       Don't ignore that. Let's get your opinion on that, or should you ask axolotl about that before you speak for them?

       A mod of this sub promoted and held a fake AMA with the best 911 truth advocate we have.

      <p>
       Subsequently, that advocate has said (since that AMA was brought to their attention) that they won't come on reddit to do an AMA.

       Its really interesting to see how groupthink is thriving in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone calls out a mod for OBVIOUS and BLATANT censorship and the group immediately defends the actions and accuses the accuser of being a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet people dont understand why this sub is such a laughing stock.

       axolotl is the mod in question. axolotl chose to promote and hold the AMA with unverified information from a fake user. That is on the mod, not the fake user. The fake user can't hold an AMA alone.

       You passed. Not surprising.

       Scroll through comments to see I'm not making anything up. our new mod answered questions that fake Richard passed on, all while not noticing that fake Richard was making ridiculous claims.

      <p>
       axolotl hasn't even removed all the fake Richard answers, as noted on my link. And if you take a moment to scroll through that link, you'll notice orangutan answering questions for fake Richard, just like I said.

       Wrong, its called justice. Justice will always win. Call the Admins, tell them that I exposed how mods are censoring posts in this sub, I myself called the mods suggesting a ban for mr_dong. They haven't deleted this post because they know a mistake has been done.

       The jokes on you. The post was removed about an hour after it was posted. The only traffic/votes it has gotten is from those few who had already seen it and those that were linked to it in other subs so it could be brigaded. Look for yourself, it's not listed in /hot or /new or /rising or /controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only mistake that's been made here is attacking the sub and it's mods.

       I fixed some spelling mistakes, gramtical errors, and tried to make it more clear etc... I'm not sure why the image is down but I can put it back up lol. Or copy and paste it in here if it just isn't working lol.

       Whatever. We righted the wrong and you're all still not happy. Think whatever you want. I personally didn't like that either one of these guys were banned for wrongful reasons and worked to make it right. If you'd all like it better without me here (believe me you won't) then I'm leaving. I think this is bullshit. I tried doing something right and all I'm get back is snarky hatemail for it.

       Chill out guys. Check out img42.com yourself. The default lifetime on an image posted there is 10 minutes. It was the first time I used it and didn't know that. I'm using Tor or I would have just used imgur myself.

       Thats not the solution, when you ban an account you also remove the reputation associaded to the name.

       Well if you are getting banned, it might not be the best reputation. And it's only a 3 month old account. I would understand if it were older, but come on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure if you apologized nicely they would unban you. But don't go attacking the mods, that's going to get you nowhere.

       So how did you get their personal images of their conversations with mods anyways? Did they ask you to post this? I'm a little confused by you caring so much about other accounts getting the ban hammer.

       Did these people message the other moderators and ask to be unbanned? Hell I have been banned from all sorts of subs, was recently shadowbanned.

       But if you talk to the mods reasonably they usually will unban with a warning.

       Whatever. We righted the wrong and you're all still not happy. Think whatever you want. I personally didn't like that either one of these guys were banned for wrongful reasons and worked to make it right. If you'd all like it better without me here (believe me you won't) then I'm leaving. I think this is bullshit. I tried doing something right and all I'm get back is snarky hatemail for it.

       Edit: Also, learn to count. I've gone after those who's fingerprints are all over the fake Richard Gage AMA. That's two people, not three. Don't be so dramatic when defending those two mods who helped ruin the 911 truth movement on reddit. You're a mod of

       I'm one individual on a team of individual mods.  I can't speak for the others - all I can do is moderate to the best of my personal abilities and try to make my opinion known if and when I think one of the other mods steps over the line and hands out a ban unjustly (as I did in this case).  I can't speak to dong's intentions as he hasn't been on reddit since yesterday to defend himself.  What I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       say is that I don't think unjustified bans and censorship really occurs here to the extent that you're implying, I try to keep an eye on the mod log and the ban list to ensure that things like yesterday don't happen with any frequency.

        If a cat is frightened, put your hand over its eyes and forehead, or let him bury his head in your armpit to help calm him.
