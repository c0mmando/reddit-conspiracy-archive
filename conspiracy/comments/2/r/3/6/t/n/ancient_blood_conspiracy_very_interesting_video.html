<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1NyrLucWM">here</a> is the link. I strongly advise watching it and and would love if you would tell me what you think.  Warning: Its like 2 hours long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To attempt to condense 2 hours of tightly packed and fascinating info into one comment.... (seriously just watch it, lots of amazing pictures/artifacts/bones here):</p>

<p>That there is evidence that up to 4 different alien races have been visiting visiting the earth, they SHOW the evidence and its really neat and sure seems to be a lot of good evidence that civilization is a lot older than we are told and we have been lied to about our history. Some of it could be debunked, but there is a LOT of stuff most I&#39;d not seen before; so much so really seems impossible to fake <strong>all</strong> of... or would at <em>least</em> doing so would also be an unbelievably elaborate conspiracy just as interesting. </p>

<p>That the highest ruling class got there because of ties and perhaps even used genetic experimentation to make a hybrid with a Neanderthal.</p>

<p>That we are approaching a tipping point where something very evil or else very enlightening is happening soon, either a culling or else a grand awakening. </p>

<p>That we are all one and have far more power to change the world than seems possible because we ARE the world, and quantom phisics is starting to prove that occultism could indeed be real. </p>

<p>And yeah, this is more of a summarized summery of a summery and does not to it justice, seriously prob just watch it when you have 2 hours to kill because it is amazing. But this is the best TLDR I have time for on mobile right now, which is horrible because the 2-hour version already seems as boiled down as it could possibly be and the dude moves and speaks quickly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard to say what the &quot;ancient blood conspiracy&quot; is if you&#39;ve watched the video -- I haven&#39;t watched it, which is why I asked.</p>

<p>From what you&#39;ve written, I gather that the conspiracy of the video is the idea that the ruling class is genetically related to aliens, who have been visiting the Earth for a long time. That&#39;s the &quot;ancient blood&quot;, right? The bloodline of ancient aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of them probably are carved in modern times to look old, but who and why and are they really <strong>all?</strong> fake?  So many ancient-looking depictions of our solar system and the micro scale in this video, and dozens of non-human skeletons I had never seen before. What a massive and outlandish conspiracy it would be to fabricate all that false evidence! That would be just as interesting to me; this is an interesting video. </p>

<p>re·li·gion noun \ri-ˈli-jən\
: the belief in a god or in a group of gods</p>

<p>: an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods</p>

<p>: an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group</p>

<p>This fits none of the definitions of a religion FYI, this is just a boatload of what appears to be evidence that perhaps civilization is older than we learned in school and perhaps some aspects of civilization were brought to us from outside of this planet. Analyzing all available evidence with an open mind is actually the opposite religion. Very interesting and very important are pretty different things. </p>

<p>Ive been very careful to not say that I even believe there/were aliens on this planet, because I don&#39;t although I do now believe there sure appears to be <em>some</em> evidence that it may be a legit hypotheses, something I too had never honestly considered before this video.  </p>

<p>I cannot &quot;mute&quot; new incoming information simply because it contradicts what I previously thought to be true even if I wanted to, my mind does not work that way. I thirst for truth far too much to allow the potential shattering of everything I once thought to be ignored.  Often with long and dense videos I get bored and just listen as I do other things, this shit had my eyes glued to the screen as my mind spun wildly thinking things like &quot;How could they even fake <em>that</em>? Who would and why? What is that really made out of if not what it looks like?&quot; for each of like 200 different things. </p>

<p>When presented all together at once like this, it becomes really hard to just write off as a &quot;distraction&quot;, because even if it were, that in itself would be almost as impressive and mysterious. Usually these types of things are just a string of bold assertions, which are very easy to ignore. But there is seriously tons and tons of clear photographic evidence in this to the point that aliens visiting us a long time ago seems just as plausible as such a wide-spread conspiracy as to fabricate this much false evidence all over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you don&#39;t want to discuss facts.  Keep believing in those aliens.  It&#39;s been a wet dream of the Zionist liars in roles of authority for over 50 years.  As I stated. While aliens may exist, they are not secretly intervening or fucking with humans.  </p>

<p>The last great false flag that will he pulled on humanity is a staged alien invasion/war.  It will be used to dissolve nations, remove human rights, and ultimately enslave you and your loved ones.  Keep your eyes wide open.  You&#39;re buying into exactly what they want you to buy into.</p>

<p>This is 0% anything &quot;extra dimensional&quot;, you&#39;re thinking it is something it isn&#39;t even slightly. I do find it ironic though you will believe in non-corporal aliens in other dimensions but wont even consider this planet may have been visited by spacecraft. </p>

<p>Obsessive interest in a never ending trivia about &quot;alien agenda&quot; material, that can keep you in your religion for life, always new fantasies to discover and fantasize about. Spreads viraly to certain groups of people through the internet that starts parroting their messiahs and spread propaganda to get new believers.

    <div class="md"><p>A belief system is not at all the same thing as a religion. Read the definition of religion again. </p>

<p>re·li·gion noun \ri-ˈli-jən\ : the belief in a god or in a group of gods
: an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules <strong>used to worship a god or a group of gods</strong>
: an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group</p>

<p>If any belief system was a religion, the scientific method would be religion and an epistemology textbook would be a religious text. </p>

<p>And for real, you can entertain an idea without accepting it. You can evaluate evidence without committing to belief. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of questions being raised about consciousness and quantum effects by extremely highly regarded physicists. And a lot that&#39;s sounding like some of the concepts that have existed in much older sources of knowledge such as Hermetecism.</p>

<p>Forget the bad info and quackery. Look a little deeper. There&#39;s a very interesting convergence happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a statement from the Kyballion talks of reality being a mental model. That&#39;s very interesting considering the content of the first link I posted.</p>

<p>Symbolism and allegory directly address the subconscious in this mental model. So what might be seen as hippyish and woo can be looked on as a way of addressing the subconscious in a non-linguistic manner. And the outreach of the sub/consciousness is not yet well defined but is raised in the second link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too would love to have a good discussion with a quantum physicist about this! Ideally someone far more grounded than someone like Fred Allan Wolf to hear the objections to his findings. </p>

<p>I really doubt I would get smacked for acknowledging the unity of all things and it would be a great discussion. To me, it really seems there is something &quot;spooky&quot; about the way our minds seem to influence the external world so I keep an open mind about it, and work with it because it sure seems to serve me quite well. I think science will explain it someday, and until then I should just focus on making it work instead of why or how it works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched all of it last night and found the information absolutely exhilarating. 
Some of the info I already knew but most of it was totally new to me, which was refreshing. 
I have read bloodlines of the Holy grail but at the time I had read it I didn&#39;t fully understand it. Now however I will have to read it once again. </p>

<p>My favorite part was when he briefly covered Hermeticism. It&#39;s true that literally all we know comes from it. Science and spirituality. He covered how the emerald tablets totally transcend scientific understanding. 
It&#39;s true when he says the great work can be accomplished by human transmutation, not by external means such as what transhumanist will lead you to believe. 
I also do think the time the &quot;world teacher&quot;  is nigh. 
I&#39;m not sure if this figure will help us or further lead us astray. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also glad that watching this helped you off of the left hand path. From my understanding  and experience hermeticism is what you should keep your eye on. Alchemical transmutation is no joke. </p>

<p>Do you know whose work the documentary belongs to? I&#39;d really like to know because if he could create this, he has to more stellar information. </p>
