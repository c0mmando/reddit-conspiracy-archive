       Magic
       <strong>
        k
       </strong>
       is just using your will to effect change in the universe. It is not the disney bullshit that you are thinking of.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all just energy. The entire universe is just energy. That energy can be manipulated in ways that most do not understand. Our universe is created by our consciousness. It is not something outside of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like more information, I recommend studying Thelema.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are spirits because I know that I am not the flesh and bones of my body. This is not my first body and it will not be my last.
       <strong>
        <em>
         I
        </em>
       </strong>
       am the energy that is my consciousness. My thoughts. My emotions. That energy, connected to my pineal gland (if you believe a material world actually exists) is my spirit/soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before my soul attached to my body, not long after my conception, I was a soul connected to a different body, on the planet Erra orbiting the star(s) Taygeta, in the Pleiades, a star cluster found in the constellation of Taurus.

       What makes you believe that your brain exists? Your brain exists only in your own mind. You believe that it is your brain that is interpreting electrical signals from your sensory organs. And you assume that the signal is not intercepted, interrupted, or manipulated in any way. But can you prove it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if you had no sensory organs? What if you had no brain? There is no proof that you do. You take it on faith. That is your religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no such blind faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof that any of these electrical impulses come from outside myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am the god of my universe. I create all things. All thoughts originated with me. I am the source. I am the original thought. Everything I perceive is some subdivision of myself. Electrical impulses created by my own (sub)consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       All religions are a piece of the puzzle. They all originated with the same truth. The only truth. We are all one.

        I am Ra. The Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, as you call vibratory sound complexes, may be approximated by stating that all things are one, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator.

       Yes, you think therefore you are. But that stops at the part that thinks. Your consciousness. Not your brain or anything physical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, you can't prove there is a physical world. You only choose to believe it. That is what faith is. Blind faith. There is nothing at all to support that claim. Less support than there is for "God".

       Either way, yes, there are spirits, I know because I am one. Yes, Magick exists; much of it is just science that we have not learned yet. (ie telepathy and telekenesis). Yes, spirits exist on other planets, we call them aliens.

       No one said anything about proving where the spirit came from, dipshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just that there is definitely a fucking spirit. A soul. A consciousness. We can prove this because we think. Therefore there must be something that thinks. Pretty simple once your IQ hits the double digits.
      </p>
      <p>
       What cannot be proven is the source of these thoughts/feelings/senses. Did this electrical signal follow a nerve to my brain, alerting my consciousness, or was that electrical signal faked, from somewhere else. That is what is impossible to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all we were talking about. There is nothing "equal" about it. And no one was talking about anything beyond that. So take your idiotic logical fallacies back to junior high, and try to learn something.

       Yes something that thinks that could easily be your brain. "i am" means that you exist. Maybe we are just brains floating in jars but seeing as the healthy thing to do is to believe you exist otherwise it can cause all kinds of problems.

       Being able to think doesn't mean you have a brain, genius. It just means that there is some sort of energy that constitutes a consciousness. There is no proof of the brain. Sorry, "could easily be" isn't quite good enough.

       I'm okay with not every idea being popular, that tells me I'm still unique. There's definitely a bit of a hive mind within the conspiracy community, and voting in the last 3 months or so has been SO swayed here. I don't think regulars are "paranoid" when they point that out. There's definitely some brigade afoot, I just can't really determine who. I'm not here enough to tell if it's the 'Tards and SRD, the Stormfronters or what.

       What saddens the shit outta me online and IRL, is how deeply people reject any form of spiritual conversation. Human beings are spiritual by design, by nature. We are not just chemicals and electrical impulses. What's the difference between the mind and the brain? The soul and the heart? Between fucking and making love? So many people think you need drugs to experience something "magical". I can get high on a child's laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       How arrogant is it of me to deny a greater power than myself? To deny significance as mere coincidence? To deny the combined experience of billions of humans for thousands of years? Because I watched a YouTube video, that reinforced my small, egotistical view?!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is good and evil, light and dark, positive and negative. There's also a neutral ground. I'm trying not to be stuck in neutral.

       I think the vote manipulation has gotten to the point of automation - or at least a very coordinated effort.  But really, it seems like bots to me a lot of the time.  If only because I can't really imagine anyone being pathetic enough to literally sit in the new queue hitting the refresh button and downvoting everything, let alone 5-10 people doing this simultaneously.

       I couldn't agree with you more here.  You can see the eyes glaze over and/or people just getting ridiculously uncomfortable or angry at even the suggestion of there being "more" out there, no matter what it is or may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't adhere to any one ideology or train of thought but I have found value and truth in every single religion I've yet studied and I think a person is severely crippling themselves by ignoring the spiritual side of life.  Hell, even if you want to ignore it - at least be able to articulate
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       you want to ignore it, which most people can't or won't even attempt to do.  The best part is most "atheists" I know are in their teens or 20's and have literally no idea what the hell they're talking about, they're just parroting what they've heard others say and likely have never opened a religious or spiritual text in their lives.

       So, not to promote anything or push any dogma, but I attend Alcoholics Anonymous, which I find the basic text is a mix of psychology, medical opinion and spirituality. Bill Wilson drew from Jung, William James, Catholicism, early 1900's spiritualism, etc.

       Thanks I'll definitely check it out - and I'm happy to hear that you've found a healthier mindset in your life.  I say that as someone who comes from a family full of alcoholics and who has seen first hand how damaging that life can be.

       Just felt like adding my 2 cents to this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there is a concerted effort to bury the truth in this sub. The more attention it gets, the more truthy you know it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything involving Aliens gets a lot of attention. So does anything that might make us aware of the energy that comprises our consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other dimensions/densities. There are other beings/entities that exist there. All the proof one needs can be found after a gravity bong rip of DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take some LSD and see if you don't understand that everything is simply energy/waves, and not physical particles as we are led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take solace knowing that the awakening is happening. Change is happening. Maybe not as fast as I would like. But it's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot prevent us from knowing what we are forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who don't figure it out in this lifetime, don't fret, you have an unlimited amount of chances to get it right. Time is only a phenomena in this 3D world.

       I feel like I intuitively understand this without ever having taken LSD.  I probably should though, I've just never really had the opportunity - I think I'd be more inclined to try mushrooms before LSD though.

       Not trying to be a dick here but did I say something about good and evil?  I don't think I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still though, what I would say here is that in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       life, in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       world, in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       dimension, good and evil do exist.  Someone who sodomizes and ritually murders infants and small children is evil.  I don't think that any amount of jargon would convince me otherwise.  Tell me all you want that I'm a part of him and he's a part of me and we're all a part of everything, and you may well be correct, but how is that helping the kids being tortured?  And would you really argue that that person - those people - are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that the 3rd dimension is
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       about duality and about realizing everything and everyone is part of the whole regardless of which end of the spectrum it's on - but that doesn't mean the spectrum doesn't exist, especially from our (extremely limited) perspectives.  Duality is a learning tool, we have to acknowledge it before we can transcend it.

       Lucifer came here to help us evolve. By offering us choice. Before choice we had no free will. Therefore we could not evolve. So yes, in the 3D world, there is duality. It is indeed a learning tool. The choice was given on the most abstract level. I believe there is always an option that leads us closer to unity, and a option that leads us away from unity. But neither is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who torture and rape children? Yeah, it is a path away from unity. But I wouldn't call it evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       A part of incarnating in a 3D world is to experience all there is to experience. That is why the original thought divided itself. To experience all there is to experience, and to re-unite with itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you prefer to take a 3D perspective, the Dracos and Orions are here to divide (and conquer). But it is all a part of a grander scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that time is just a 3D illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need pain, so we can understand fear, so we can overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could there be pleasure without pain? We would have no point of reference. The more pain we experience the more capacity we have for love. Such is the nature of duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, mushrooms are cool too. They were put here to help us evolve. Just ask Terrence McKenna. Each psychedelic offers its own unique perspectives. LSD, DMT, 4-HO-DMT (Psilocin), 5-MeO-DMT, 4-AcO-DMT, Mescaline, 2C-B, etc etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend you try them all.

      <p>
       But isn't "path away from unity" just a euphemism for evil acts?  "Good" is just the way humans describe things that bring us closer to unity and "evil" is how we describe things that bring us further away.  I don't know, I agree with the gist of what you're saying but I can't get behind anything that tells me raping babies isn't right or wrong, it just
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       .  Even if you're right, I'd prefer to live in a world where something might be done about it instead of letting it go on because "it's just duality expressing itself".

       Agreed but this is kinda my point.  We need to acknowledge pain so we can understand fear and then transcend it.  It works the same for good and evil, right and wrong, truth and lies.  All of these things exist within our limited 3-dimensional perspectives, if they didn't we wouldn't be able to learn from them.

       Fair enough. I do agree that we should not torture babies. But I also understand that there will never be a 3D world where babies are not tortured. I am on this planet to do everything I can to prevent such atrocities, but I also know it is an exercise in futility.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the most abstract level, choice is just 1 or 0. Black or White. Neither path is wrong, for there are many paths but one truth. We are all one. No matter which path you choose, whether it be "Good" or "Evil", there is no escaping the truth. Eventually we will all understand that we are one, and we will all be united.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I am in this 3D world, here on Earth, I will try to get as many people to take the most direct path to unity. I am at war with those who wish to enslave; manifested in this 3D world as Draco-Orion Reptilians and Greys. But I know that on the most abstract level, they are only here because they love me. And I love them. I have my mission and they have theirs. We are all just actors on a stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here to prevent as much pain and suffering as possible, to live a service to others; but death is not something to be feared. Mine nor anyone else's.

       This is where I agree with religious moral teaching. Sins aren't about being good or doing bad, they're about distancing us from our own humanity, which was designed to mimic God's love, which is deeper than even our most graced understanding.  Loving other people isn't just rewarding for those receive the love, it FEELS GOOD TO LOVE. Moral teachings weren't to create shame or punishment, they were for guidance. Gah, I'm tired, I'm not so eloquent without my coffee.

       I think there is a spiritual dimension and there are beings there both good and evil nature. Yes, we humans are a mix of both, but I think in the energy/spirit world, there's definitely more clearly defined +/-. The middle way might work for humans to understand their own nature without judgment, but I believe in angels and demons. I don't believe we get another chance to be human again. I think you get your shot here on Earth, then return to your soul-form, from whence you came. We don't remember how we got here, but I think we struggle with loneliness in that attempt to realign with God/Higher Power/Truth. Reincarnation seems like a cop-out to me. We should strive to achieve Truth in each and every day. The end goal isn't enlightenment, it's peace with all our warts.

       Where are you coming up with this stuff? Who convinced you there were angels and demons?
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe that your soul has existed for eternity (somewhere other than Heaven or Hell?), let me repeat that
       <strong>
        eternity
       </strong>
       , and then you get 0-100 years here on Earth to do all the bullshit that Christianity claims, in order to spend another eternity in Heaven. Or else you spend Eternity in Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're good as long as you ask for forgiveness before you die? (I'm assuming here)
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet those people who forgot to ask for forgiveness are pretty bummed. Having to spend eternity (all of time, forever, with no end) burning in Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       All because some dude ate a ham sandwich last weekend and forgot to ask for forgiveness before getting killed by a drunk driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am only making assumptions, I apologize if you don't believe in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of this nonsense. It just seems like your god is asking you to do more than he is willing to do himself.

       Sounds like you need to forgive yourself, dude. God isn't the judge in the sky, he's the voice in your head, whispering Feel More, Do More, Love More.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe in angels and demons, because I've witnessed events, felt presences, experienced them. There were no flashes of light or smoke fog. It's energy. If you think that sounds ridiculous, I think aliens and reptilians are pretty outlandish ideas. But I'm not gonna bully you about them. You're free to believe, and so am I. Does that make either one of us wrong? Maybe faith is what matters, regardless of dogma, just believing in something greater than myself.

       Pluto is a planetite, I think it's called. Also the Roman version of the god of the Greek underworld, Hades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still pretty certain that astronomers were the ones behind naming it Pluto and debating whether it was a planet or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea who decided that Pluto was a good name for Hades. It happened thousands of years ago.

       Right, it was the astronomers. And it was the bankers who came up with usury.

       Well, usury had been around longer than the institution of what we would consider a bank. Still don't see what Pluto or Astronomy have to do with that.

       Usury originated with the Rothschilds, before they were Rothschilds. Just like fractional banking and fiat currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this have to do with anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Astronomers may be the puppets, but who is pulling the strings?
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, maybe nothing has any greater meaning. Everything is just a coincidence. Nothing to see here. Move along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Pluto is in the history books as a planet, may not be that important. But it's an interesting coincidence, if you are to believe that Lucifer would like to trick us into believing he doesn't exist.

       Usury originated in Antiquity, in ancient Greece. Before banking was really a thing, it was pretty much guys who could lend you money, sometimes with interest. Not a Jewish business neccessity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I am confused as to what that has to do with anything. Also the Pluto stuff.

       Lucifer and Pluto were very different characters.

       Read the original book. And stop skipping the most important parts, like Enoch.

       Stop calling him, Jesus. His name is Jmmanuel.

       There was never a J in any language and only recently came into litterary use in the 13th century. Gabriel and every other angel is an administration of Yahweh representing his nine devine attributes. "Everything that which may be know of Yahweh from the creation of the world to his power is made manifest within them so that man is without excuse" Your physical body is a pattern that is made in the likeness of a spiritual pattern.

       if im wrong i cant be right. though if im mistaken there is room for correction. If im right i cant be "more right" for im already right. I'll  clarify, in english the hebrew word translated as angel is messenger. An angel is and was reffering to a messenger of Yahweh either spiritual or physical and no one can tell you a thing about Yahweh except himself. An angel is an administration of Yahweh himself even a profit when uttering a proffecy Yahweh was the one speaking through that profit not figuratively through the message but literally as the profits voice. An angel is a host. Gabriel is Yahweh as the perfect messanger not a seperate entity created but an administration held by  Yahweh himself utilized within his purpose. An esoteric insight an Angel is an angle in which you are seeing the true light.

       "Angels" are no different from us. They are simply beings (sometimes more evolved in terms of consciousness) from other planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you interpret their words as the words of YHWH, then the same can be said for all of us. Which again, isn't necessarily wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just need to stop thinking of YHWH as a God. That's not what it is. There is no one that should be worshiped outside of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       YHWH is just the original thought. The source. Love. Unity. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is inside of us. It is what we are all composed of. The ether. The energy that comprises our consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gabriel just happened to be a very evolved entity that happened to originate from the planet Erra, which has Taygeta as its Sun(s), in the Pleiades star system, found in the constellation of Taurus.
      </p>
      <p>
       He sired the prophet, Jmmanuel. The Talmud of Jmmanuel was written in Aramaic, not Hebrew. By Judas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mother was a Lyran named Mary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The words you are saying, are mostly correct, but your understanding of the words may not be complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, this evolved creature (Gabriel) understands and can teach you about the true light. Light = Love = Unity = YHWH
      </p>
      <p>
       He came here to teach Earth about ONENESS. The fact that we are all made up of the same energy. The energy that began with the original thought. The original consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no "right" or "wrong". There's only popular opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, no one can tell you anything about YHWH except himself, because he is the original thought. He is the source. All thoughts originated from "him". He is inside us. He is what we are. So, no, we don't need an "Angel" to hear his word. His word is inside us, all we need to do is listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to be perfectly clear. I am not religious. This is just how the universe works.

       The dogmas that are taught professing to be teaching from the bible SHOULD make you laugh if you're  unawar as the evil they represent. Every Christian pastor is preaching the theology of satan every religeion is of satan point blank period. Have you done your own research into the bible ? Have you yourself compared it to diverse religions and dogmatic opinions? Have you done it with an open heart? Btw there are no contridictions in the bible.

       So, not to promote anything or push any dogma, but I attend Alcoholics Anonymous, which I find the basic text is a mix of psychology, medical opinion and spirituality. Bill Wilson drew from Jung, William James, Catholicism, early 1900's spiritualism, etc.

       is just using your will to effect change in the universe. It is not the disney bullshit that you are thinking of.

       We are all just energy. The entire universe is just energy. That energy can be manipulated in ways that most do not understand. Our universe is created by our consciousness. It is not something outside of ourselves.

       If you would like more information, I recommend studying Thelema.

       I know there are spirits because I know that I am not the flesh and bones of my body. This is not my first body and it will not be my last.
       <strong>
        <em>
         I
        </em>
       </strong>
       am the energy that is my consciousness. My thoughts. My emotions. That energy, connected to my pineal gland (if you believe a material world actually exists) is my spirit/soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before my soul attached to my body, not long after my conception, I was a soul connected to a different body, on the planet Erra orbiting the star(s) Taygeta, in the Pleiades, a star cluster found in the constellation of Taurus.

       Something that cannot, and never will be proven, therefore people like

       I think therefore I am. I have conscious thoughts. The energy that comprises those thoughts is my spirit. Not that tough to prove.

       Sounds like you need to forgive yourself, dude. God isn't the judge in the sky, he's the voice in your head, whispering Feel More, Do More, Love More.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe in angels and demons, because I've witnessed events, felt presences, experienced them. There were no flashes of light or smoke fog. It's energy. If you think that sounds ridiculous, I think aliens and reptilians are pretty outlandish ideas. But I'm not gonna bully you about them. You're free to believe, and so am I. Does that make either one of us wrong? Maybe faith is what matters, regardless of dogma, just believing in something greater than myself.

      <p>
       And God is. The I Am. Always was, always will be. Infinite.

       The dogmas that are taught professing to be teaching from the bible SHOULD make you laugh if you're  unawar as the evil they represent. Every Christian pastor is preaching the theology of satan every religeion is of satan point blank period. Have you done your own research into the bible ? Have you yourself compared it to diverse religions and dogmatic opinions? Have you done it with an open heart? Btw there are no contridictions in the bible.
