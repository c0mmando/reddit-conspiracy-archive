    <div class="md"><p>Basically we are supposed to believe that 2 muslims meticulously planned a mass murder (complete with an illegal weapons cache and a list of targets)... and yet they &quot;accidentally left their ID&#39;s in the car&quot; ??</p>

<p>Kind&#39;a reminds me of the FBI &quot;finding&quot; all the hijackers passports on the streets of New York (in near pristine condition) on 9/11.  Way too &quot;convenient&quot; for reality.</p>

<p>...further, I am sure it has <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong> to do with the fact that France recently it&#39;s support of Palestine as a State:</p>

<p>nahh... nothing to do with that ;)  ;)</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:  Watch for France to back-off it&#39;s support of Palestine.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>regardless if this attack was due to France&#39;s support of Palestinian statehood I highly doubt they will back off. Many countries are in support of both Israel and Palestine but nothing ever changes. Israel will do what it wants as long as it is America&#39;s favorite lap dog, and even if it somehow got on America&#39;s badside the Israelis would continue kicking Palestinian ass. It&#39;s a sad situation and neither side is without blame. European condemnation of Israel or support of Gaza/West Bank does nothing to change the situation one way or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now see here, I don&#39;t believe they accidentally left them in the car, it makes sense to leave your ID behind if you plan on committing a crime and not taking it with you. If they were planning on escaping they would of course need them later but wouldn&#39;t want to bring anything personal with them for the attack lest they accidentally leave it behind.</p>

<p>I think its perfectly reasonable that leaving their IDs in the car was part of their plan. If I were to go out and commit some kind of crime I would leave my ID behind and retrieve when I was done. I would also leave behind every personal item , like wallet, keys, cell phone etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What got me was the supposed execution of the police officer as others have pointed out. ..
if you watch it very close the bullet doesn&#39;t even hit him.  Rewind it and watch it 5-6 times. .The bullet hits the ground about a foot in front of his head.  </p>

<p>Also, there is no movement from the officer when he is hit. .His body just kind of rolls. For anyone who has ever seen a assult rifle impact on anything it would create massive head recoil...</p>

<p>think of the JFK assignation. .. Kennedy&#39;s head is ripped apart...and that was from 2 football fields away.</p>

<p>in this video he is shot at point blank range and nothing..no body recoil..no brains flying anywhere..nothing. .you can call me a tin foil hat fool..but go to youtube and look up assult rifle  7.62 impact at close range...and also the whole ID bullshit..this just smells like a false flag...looks like Mossad is up to its old tricks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was my suspicion that he missed the shot or at least the head, and if he was already wounded that would solve the &quot;where&#39;s the blood&quot; scenario because he has already been hit, I&#39;m assuming in the main body cavity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just by watching a couple liveleak videos of people getting shot in the head and you can know that it doesn&#39;t always play out like that. ISIS regularly posts execution videos with done with AK ammunition or 7.62x39 and those poor people shot in the head don&#39;t always recoil or explode brains everywhere.</p>

<p>As I stated elsewhere in this thread this doesn&#39;t strike me as Mossad, too sloppy and chaotic. Mossad agents would likely try to pull off a bombing attack with high casualty if they wanted to incite hatred of Muslims in Europe.</p>

<p>The drawings of Muhammed in different newspapers around the world have drawn threats from all Muslims even moderates showed considerable outrage, frankly I&#39;m surprised we haven&#39;t seen more attacks due to these drawings sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow please stop twisting the narrative to suit your false flag agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>multiple weapons that are very hard to get (even illegally)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you confirm this?
Europe is awash with second hand weapons from various conflicts, everything I&#39;ve read indicates that it&#39;s not too difficult for a determined criminal to acquire said hardware through underground connections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were using their guns with precision (according to police)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of their targets were killed at close range, unless they&#39;ve never fired the gun before they&#39;d be hard pressed to miss. Plus &#39;precision&#39; in this context can have different interpretations. A &#39;civilian&#39; being able to capably use an assault rifle could be regarded as &#39;precision&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>had two getaway cars (one a decoy) and had a well planned out escape route that allowed them to get away...but they decided to leave their ID cards behind in their decoy car?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They just killed 10 civilians and 2 police officers, plus wounding multiple others. They were at that time the most wanted people in France/Europe and undoubtedly had to act quick if they wanted any chance of escaping. In this time limited clusterfuck fuelled by surging adrenaline it&#39;s entirely probable that they left a bag, pair of pants, dropped a wallet in one of the vehicles they were using..</p>

<p>I could go on but I doubt it&#39;ll do any good convincing you otherwise, and as for this post getting deleted from other subs, umm well that&#39;s because your claims have no fucking factual basis behind them.</p>

<p>You make it sound like people who do not think this was staged are insane. Which is odd when it seems like you have your mind made up about this based on your expectations for the gunmen to execute their &quot;well planned attack&quot; flawlessly. Why is that?</p>

<p>They may have planned this for some time. Define precision? Precision for an expert or a beginner? Yes they had two getaway cars, one which was a decoy, it&#39;s not difficult to get hold of cars.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they decided to leave their ID cards behind in their decoy car?</p>

<p>Did they? Did they <strong>decide</strong> to do that? </p>

<p>No one here is saying that it is not remotely possible (everything is possible I suppose), the difference is is that it sounds like you have your mind made up about this. But then I guess we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so I shouldn&#39;t be all that surprised. </p>

<p>Read my previous comment again where I said &quot;No one here is saying that it is not remotely possible (everything is possible I suppose)&quot;.</p>

<p>And hey, maybe the attackers left incorrect ID&#39;s in the car in order to throw the police off?</p>

<p>I guess it comes to down to what is more likely. I mean the purely speculative comments you have made makes your scenario how likely would you say? That being that it was staged (which I assume is what you&#39;re getting at?).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is not confirmed. But like I said above, it&#39;s possible that they left wrong ID&#39;s in the car, hence why this apparent innocent 18 year old might have been wrongly implicated in the attack. </p>

<p>Because in order for a person to make an informed analysis of the situation, you must also accept the following:</p>

<p>1)  Covert agencies do things like this.</p>

<p>2)  There remains the possibility that these were the &quot;patsies&quot; who a covert agency attempted to frame.</p>

<p>It is the unfortunate world that we live in where our government agencies are intentionally deceptive in order to manipulate citizens.</p>

<p>So to answer... Could they have made a mistake?  Possibly... but it seems like a pretty big and pretty stupid mistake to make under the circumstances.  </p>

<p>So in return, I have to ask you the question:  Why can&#39;t you seem to accept that our own governments use these type of &quot;false flag&quot; attacks and they occur around the world?  </p>

<p>If you do accept that, then why are you so willing to discard that possibility so hastily??</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the state wouldn&#39;t consider killing its own citizens to further certain goals. But honestly, I find it difficult to come off the fence with these false flag attacks and conclude definitively that they were indeed false flag operations, mainly due to the amount of alternative narratives and lack of evidence which can prove something was a false flag beyond all doubt, perhaps that&#39;s down to my world view though, ay!</p>

<p>But as far as this case goes, it just astounds me that some people have already concluded that it was indeed a false flag event, they must have some pretty damning evidence. God I need to remind myself where I am typing more often. </p>

<p>That&#39;s good.  You shouldn&#39;t decide one way or the other until you have enough information to empirically say what happened.  So to say that it &quot;must have been this group&quot; that did something without empirical proof is just as illogical as automatically assuming something was a false flag.</p>

<p>I think, based on this, we could probably both agree that the most rational thing to say about this right now is:  &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your emotions get in the way of you thinking clearly about these types of things.  Remember to just divide evidence up into things that provide a narrative and evidence that provides actual concrete proof.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t want to keep getting scammed over and over again by government lies and situations they create.</p>

<p>This is why the police, or any investigative government body for that matter, isn&#39;t ever interested in truth. It is interested in being able to feed the public a story and get their members promotions.</p>

<p>Police and the DA are an especially good example of this. They rarely if ever get into the idea of planted evidence, it is too complicated and so they won&#39;t bother.</p>

<p>It is simpler for them to just take the information at face value and use it for a conviction. The public gets their story and the &quot;investigators&quot; get a career victory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, they were screaming Allahu Akbar and some nonsense about avenging mohammed. Also as to why they didn&#39;t &quot;take the whole ship down,&quot;  it seems that these attackers just don&#39;t share the same suicidal ideology as some jihadis. For instance, the boston marathon bombers didn&#39;t blow themselves up in the attack. Doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t a muslim extremist attack...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a bunch of well trained, coordinated, well planned attackers decided, despite going to great efforts to conceal their pre-planning and secrecy of their attack as well as wearing masks, body armor and planning multiple escape routes in multiple cars just up and decided to leave all of their photo ID&#39;s in the one vehicle they already planned to leave behind at the scene of the crime despite successfully escaping from police?</p>

<p>Please, do go into detail on the reasons why they chose to do this. It would be great to hear your &quot;non-circlejerk&quot; opinion since facts are offending you so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are two scenarios off of the top of my head where they were intentionally left AND it&#39;s still not some govt conspiracy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They never intended to get away. They went in there fully expecting to die as martyrs during their spree and left their IDs so they could be identified quickly and held up as martyrs in their pathetic circles. Once they get in there and do their damage, they either get cold feet or realize they can get out of there alive - either way they split to the safest exist and don&#39;t exactly have time to grab their IDs. </p></li>
<li><p>They stole three random IDs from men on the street and left them in their cars knowing that they would be found. The police go to investigate these men instead, giving themselves a little more time to escape the search. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not saying either of these scenarios are likely, I&#39;m just saying that there can be so many possibilities for the reason behind this. The problem with most people on this sub is that they look at each horrible thing that happens with the assumption that it was a government conspiracy and then look for evidence that supports that idea. That is simply bad science. </p>

<p>The burden of proof is on you.   Extraordinary (not for this sub of course,  but for sane people) claims require extraordinary evidence.   Give me anything tangible that would actually point to a conspiracy and I&#39;ll definitely read it.   None of this &quot;why would they&quot; or &quot;how would they &quot; bullshit.

<p>And they will investigate.  If he&#39;s innocent then he&#39;s innocent.  If anything you can argue that they (the terrorists) are trying to throw off the trail by accusing some random kid.  Of course we&#39;ll see, the truth will come out.  Where he was at the time should be fairly easy to prove, very well he could be innocent - especially if he turned himself in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>multiple weapons that are very hard to get (even illegally)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you confirm this?
Europe is awash with second hand weapons from various conflicts, everything I&#39;ve read indicates that it&#39;s not too difficult for a determined criminal to acquire said hardware through underground connections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were using their guns with precision (according to police)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of their targets were killed at close range, unless they&#39;ve never fired the gun before they&#39;d be hard pressed to miss. Plus &#39;precision&#39; in this context can have different interpretations. A &#39;civilian&#39; being able to capably use an assault rifle could be regarded as &#39;precision&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>had two getaway cars (one a decoy) and had a well planned out escape route that allowed them to get away...but they decided to leave their ID cards behind in their decoy car?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They just killed 10 civilians and 2 police officers, plus wounding multiple others. They were at that time the most wanted people in France/Europe and undoubtedly had to act quick if they wanted any chance of escaping. In this time limited clusterfuck fuelled by surging adrenaline it&#39;s entirely probable that they left a bag, pair of pants, dropped a wallet in one of the vehicles they were using..</p>

<p>I could go on but I doubt it&#39;ll do any good convincing you otherwise, and as for this post getting deleted from other subs, umm well that&#39;s because your claims have no fucking factual basis behind them.</p>
