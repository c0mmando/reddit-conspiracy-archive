        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like after every one of these &quot;scandals&quot; there&#39;s almost always a convenient distraction to divert our anger towards another less important problem. I posted earlier on this subreddit that when the Torture report was released, we had the North Korea hack pushed into the limelight(and what a coincidence, the media highlighted the country&#39;s torture and human rights record, basically saying, &quot;look at North Korea, they&#39;re so much worse than the folks we tortured). It seems to have worked again in the UK. Just two months there was the news of UK investigating the list of the VIP pedophile ring consisting of high level officials and politicians. Why aren&#39;t we talking about it and why weren&#39;t there protests? Oh right, they ended up banning &quot;extreme porn,&quot; which took up the newscycle. That ended up getting a highly publicized protest movement, though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that we should only address ONE problem, ONE at a time, when it happens, because that&#39;s just impossible. But I&#39;m noticing how easy it is for TPTB to distract the public and continue on as usual. I guess that&#39;s what&#39;s so concerning: That things are going to get much, much worse because of apathy and the people in power are using it in their favor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people already assumed these things to be true. Torture is by no means a new subject in American political discourse and well, nothing in the UK will beat Jimmy Saville. Britons are under no illusion that their superiors are a bunch of perverts. The fact that those who encouraged torture in the states will never be prosecuted and most of the people involved in the UK scandal are dead or ancient means there never will be true justice. Its more a feeling of disillusionment than anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just at a get together with a bunch of conspiracy theorists on New Years, and I was amazed how quickly I shut down conversations when I mentioned the recent pedophile sex ring accusations and revalations. People who were happy to discuss alien abduction, monetary theory, reptilians, GMOs or just about any other offbeat topic were taken aback by the fact that I raised the elite pedophile topic. Many of them were unaware of recent allegations, and those who were aware dismissed the topic because there had not been proof in a court of law.</p>

<p>I think the topic is just too horrific for most people to contemplate. They shut down and dismiss it rather than attempt to research or delve into the victims stories or all of the whistleblowers who have spoken out. And, who can really blame them? Have you ever really delved into the topic and done some reading from alleged victims? That shit is horrific. HORRIFIC.</p>

<p>I think the tendency to be repulsed by the subject matter is a major stumbling block to raising mass awareness. People don&#39;t want to know the details. I&#39;m not sure how. that can be countered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that there needs to be a public easily recognizable distinction between someone accussed (and inevitably convincted) of looking at some normall styled naked pictures of smoking hot 14-16 year olds and someone who is diddling some prepubscent girl.  They aren&#39;t even closed to the same level of badness.  It would help unmuddy the waters, ease up on some people who just strayed a bit (these girls are fertile after all and its natural to be somewhat attracted) and make it more apparent who the real sickos are.  Otherwise we&#39;re talking about the full Fed camp of letter agencies going full bore on a more hapless and naive suspect like my friend to get an easy conviction and the full fucking works of everything while evil politicians and nasty people get strangely enough some benefit of the doubt because they are all thrown into that same pile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure well bust all of them proportionally but having someone who looked at some pictures of 15 year old young women should not be confusable with someone who tortured and molested little prepubscent girls.

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion somewhere round 2002 there was a change. Before that Newspapers were trusted because they employed journalists, with degrees, who had systematic applied credibility built into their work in principle. The internet gutted or streamlined newspapers. Now with WMD and currently Nth Korea hacking as abject embarrassments re objective journalism it&#39;s obvious reality is an elastic construct as never before and rationally there is no-one apart from friends and family that should be held as trustworthy. We live in a hollow hall of media mirrors.</p>

You obviously aren&#39;t paying attention to important issues in the United States that go no where, like the NYPD and Eric Garner, and the now open assassinations and ambushes of police officers nationwide to distract you.  Interesting how we were warned this would be coming months, and even a year or 2 ago, and now it&#39;s happening...but it isn&#39;t terrorists like we were told it would be (unless you&#39;re trying to convince authority figures like the police that the terrorists are the people...).</p>
