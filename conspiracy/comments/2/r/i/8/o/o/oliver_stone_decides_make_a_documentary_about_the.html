    <div class="md"><p>For those who weren&#39;t born yet, Oliver Stone was first known as an Academy Award-winning director for <em>Platoon</em>.  He had been a screenwriter &amp; critics&#39; favorite before <em>JFK</em>.</p>

<p>He was never associated with the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Then in 1990 <em>before JFK was done filming</em>, Time Magazine did a cover story (a <em>front cover</em>) hit piece attacking the unfinished movie <em>based on its script</em>.</p>

<p>It was an exceptional moment.</p>

<p>But Stone was smart.  He made <em>JFK</em> casting a wide array of famous Hollywood stars, and it amounted to a coalition of famous people agreeing:  &quot;Yes, we don&#39;t believe the Oswald story.&quot;</p>

<p>In between the Time Magazine cover story and the movie release, there were many significant &amp; interesting Kennedy Assassination-related events.  Somebody should do a Timeline:  </p>

<p>Stone attacked then-president Poppy Bush in the press (&quot; ... Existentially speaking, Bush has no eternal soul ...&quot;), then the sudden &amp; mysterious declassifying of a 1963 document that linked a &quot;George Bush of the CIA&quot; to the assassination, which gave Bush the advantage of pre-emptively &quot;debunking&quot; his connection to Dallas, a full year before the film was released.  It was clear at the time how terrified TPTB were of the film before it came out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thie claim that the driver shot Kennedy is based upon crappy copies of the Zapruder film and perhaps it is also disinformation.</p>

<p>Robert Harris has made a fine video which he goes frame by frame. He clearly demonstrates, that the gun is no gun. It is Roy Herman Kellerman&#39;s head.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=DguBcLpWBS0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=DguBcLpWBS0</a></p>

<p>The myth, that the driver Greer was the shooter was spread by Bill Cooper. Cooper&#39;s theory is that an electrically-operated gas-powered weapon shot an exploding shellfish-poison covered bullet. Cooper claimed to have read about this in a top secret document. Perhaps he really has read such a document.</p>

<p>Video of Bill Cooper <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9EiKRhmqFU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9EiKRhmqFU</a></p>

<p>JFK was killed in an uncovered limousine. He was surrounded by dozens of witnesses. While numerous people claimed to have witnessed a slow down of the car, none has seen the alleged gun in Greers hand. Witnesses didn&#39;t rush the driver, they rushed the grassy knoll.</p>

<p>Connally who was sitting next to the driver was wounded during the assassination. He neither flinches from Greer, nor does he fear the driver. No puff of smoke can be seen.</p>

<p>I got the Harris video out of a fine abovetopsecret thread, which aslo has some good photos. <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread686940/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread686940/pg1</a></p>

Truth is all I care about, the driver shot Kennedy PERIOD! The Zapruder film clearly shows this. Watch it until you get it. It does not require any knowledge or intellect. I  saw it showed my wife she saw it showed to a friend who took 30 plays to see it. Once you see it you can&#39;t unseen it. There are detractors that state the film is fake, why would you fake a secret service execution that has largely gone unnoticed since before I was born?</p>

<p>Sure, and George W. Bush was a big-government liberal - like FDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Democrats and Republicans are both right wing. Just that the Republicans are more right wing than the Democrats, making them look left wing by comparison.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should have described Obama as &quot;right of centre&quot; then to be more accurate.</p>

<p>And given those are your only two mainstream parties in the US, it would seem there isn&#39;t any left wing to speak of. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a few independent people out there, but they probably stand no chance of ever getting heard. </p>

<p>So was FDR then. So was pretty much everyone other than Trotsky, one assumes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to love Oliver stone as a filmmaker. Platoon and JFK are amazing movies, daring in their subject matter. He explored the alternative narratives and used his talents to go against the establishment. He was a personal hero.  </p>

<p>Imagine my disappointment when I first saw &quot;World Trade Center,&quot; which felt like little more than fluffy American propaganda. I couldn&#39;t believe it, there must&#39;ve been some mistake. What happened? He didn&#39;t explore any of the conspiracy surrounding the towers, he didn&#39;t even question the official story. It felt like the opposite of the film I was expecting to see. </p>

<p>But still, I continued holding onto hope that that he would redeem himself by shedding light on the financial crisis in his following film,  &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.&quot; Okay...Have you seen that movie? It was embarrassing! It was an insult to anyone who suffered through the financial crisis. It was basically a feature length film of worshiping bankers. Clearing them of any blame.  Not only did he not blame them for what happened, but he gave them a happy ending with Michael Douglas reuniting with his daughter and labeouf starting a company making solar panels. Solar panels!!! The banker invests in clean energy and has a cookout party!!!! </p>

<p>It was terrible witnessing such a powerful voice of the counter narrative becoming just another Michael bay, coca cola  feel good commercial director. After those films, he&#39;s going to have to earn my trust all over again. Hopefully he will. Seriously...I hope. </p>
