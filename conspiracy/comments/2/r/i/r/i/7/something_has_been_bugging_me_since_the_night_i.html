        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was listening to a live police scanner and reading the News thread, that was updated by the minute. The time frame in particular is the final push to get into the boat. I&#39;m recalling this without looking back at the logs, I wanted to see if others remember it like I do, without reference. </p>

<p>Several things stood out to me: </p>

<p>1)Why would the police, SRT and others wait until after dark? To get better thermal imaging of the boat? They kept having to push back reporters, who were trying to break the perimeter to get coverage. Why delay? Based on the eyewitness saying there was blood around a sleeping man in the boat, and the released video of the flashbangs, the kid was not active.  </p>

<p>2)When they were advancing, they suddenly broke over the radio that the helicopter needed to refuel and that the downlink was being broadcast on the internet. This caused a considerable delay. Why care in the middle of a standoff that the video is online, unless you want to control the narrative?! Was that bait, of those listening online, to see who had the skills to find and access the police helicopter&#39;s downlink?  </p>

<p>3) as far as we know, there is no video of his surrender, correct? Just blurry night photos of a man that doesn&#39;t appear to be wounded, that his throat was slashed? If I have a gaping neck wound, I&#39;m not climbing out of a boat to surrender. I&#39;m falling out or laying unresponsive.</p>

<p>4)The followup news broadcasts kept using the Governor of MA, Deval Patrick and the State police, which I kept thinking, this is a national event, where is the President, the FBI, etc. Why push the state response, unless Boston Strong is a psyop, and give the governor the Giuliani treatment, like post-911? (Deval Patrick said he won&#39;t run in 2016, but I doubt Clinton or Warren would be &quot;electable&quot;. Another black man will get the presidency before a white woman, probably why the racism narrative is being pushed by the media. God, our country is a fucking soap opera....)   </p>

<p>5) No interviews or video of this kid since arrest. No news agency has been granted ANY access to him? Yes, it&#39;s before the trial, but not even a clip of his transport to court? No one has managed to sneak a pic in over a year?! </p>

<p>I&#39;m also fairly sure that he&#39;ll never get a fair trial. Americans should ask themselves why, but America died a long time ago. In it&#39;s place is a bunch of mob mentality loving psychopaths being programmed to love their own destruction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL 40 years ago.</p>

<p>You think the height of the Civil Rights Movement was better? America has been on a steep decline in personal liberties since the government has fully indoctrinated the American public to believe that we need them to rule over us, regulate our lives, ensure our safety, and protect us from harm.</p>

<p>None of that is further from the truth.</p>

<p>Also, no country exists in that status because they&#39;d become powerful enough, eventually, to undermine part of the profits our corporate rulers make and we cannot have that. Enter the CIA and one or two coups later, that &#39;paradise&#39; has been lost.</p>

<p>A picture of you attending an event, walking towards the location <em>where bonb was planted</em> wearing a heavy backpack, walking away from said location 10 seconds later <em>without the heavy backpack you were previously wearing,</em> and <em>casually walking away moments after the explosions occurred without any look of concern or shock.</em></p>

<p>What happened to their backpacks? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even counting the mountains of evidence uncovered in his dorm room, eg fireworks etc. They found even more evidence on the brother, possession of the gun, video footage of the two buying large amounts of fireworks, etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only valid point you make is that there was a picture of him leaving without a backpack.</p>

<p>A picture that, as a graphic designer, has a very strange out of focus area where a backpack would be. Seriously, if I was told to photoshop out a backpack from a number of photos, I would choose the one where the subject is framed against a brick wall, and then use the clone-stamp tool to &quot;erase&quot; the backpack.</p>

<p>And you would have a strikingly similar result to the picture in question.</p>

<p>As well as the fact that the body language in that picture makes no sense, he appears to be at an angle as if a backpack is still on his back.</p>

<p><a href="http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/mix108.com/files/2013/04/no2-630x513.jpg">Take a look.</a></p>

<p>Of course I could be wrong, but I am just explaining why the backpack photo is not hard evidence in my opinion.</p>

<p>Photos can be manipulated quite easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry man but that&#39;s really bad logic. So bad that it&#39;s obvious that whatever happened you would have came to that conclusion no matter what. If you&#39;re suspected of being the bombers you would clear your name/fight it. You don&#39;t just become a murderer. Why would they run if innocent? Eventually the government would just stop looking for them? Unless they&#39;re idiots, which I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s come out they aren&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t think that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say that them running proves their guilt as it does not, but it sure as fuck points that way. And it sure as fuck isn&#39;t proof they&#39;re innocent, which you somehow twisted it to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much about this whole thing that doesnt make sense.</p>

<p>Why would they put a bomb down, then walk over and put another bomb down just to stand between the two which seemed to be a safe zone?  How would they know that if they didnt know that much about bombs and just learned how to make them?</p>

<p>Why would they pull over and go into a convience store just blocks away from shooting that campus cop!  They didnt buy any gas just junk.  Who does that ?</p>

<p>Where were all those holes in the road or debris after that chase and them throwing supposed fire bombs, granades (sp) etc?  The press showed pictures but there wasnt any damage.</p>

<p>Why would the older brother be out of the car when the younger brother ran over him?</p>

<p>I also noticed a man being interviewed immediantly after the bomb went off that a reporter was doing a &#39;man on the streets interviews about what people noticed&quot;.  This guy was wearing a white coat like a doctor and the reporter kept asking what kind of injuries did he witness.  The guys stood there without saying anything looking a bit cornered.  He finally said he had to go and pushed away onto a crowd of people.  The reporter still was trying to interview people as they went by live.  This is moments after the explosion were everything was helter skelter.</p>

<p>Now that scene bothers me.  All the medical personel was wearing these short waisted jackets that were the color of the marathon and these jackets let everyone know they were medical staff for the race.  Why was this guy wearing a white coat?  Why didnt he want to say something and why wasnt that clip repeated later by the local news people!</p>

<p>Just a bunch of strange questions I guess.  Right at the very beginning I thought everything was fishy and something was not right.  I still have no answers.</p>

<p>The FBI recently stepped away from that story and are now saying they&#39;re not sure who shot the cop. What a surprise. Lock in the narrative early and then change details as time goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes on this account lots of things were said and then unsaid. :). </p>

<p>Your assessment on his disappearance is well grounded.  It does bring up major questions.</p>

<p>On another note, him and his brother had tickets to fly out of country.  The older brother has a family and is Muslim.   And yet he was going to leave them behind?  Muslims are really big on family and they dont desert them.  But these two young men were going to hop on a plane and leave everyone else to take the heat (if they did the bombing).  I can understand flying outside the country as a visit but leaving ones family behind if they bombed something?  Again, doesnt make sense.</p>

<p>Dry runs. There were multiple investigations of someone detonating fireworks in the woods behind the younger brother&#39;s college in the month leading up to the bombing. </p>

<p>Got out of the car and tried to use the car as cover to fire at police. Didn&#39;t work, he got shot, younger brother GTFO&#39;d. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>EXACTLY!  Great analysis on this.  I too was listening to the scanner as it happened, and was listening to the entire manhunt that day. </p>

<p>Do you remember when the &quot;general&quot; (I remember they actually turned the whole operation over to DOD at the end) was so fucking angry that a press member had breached the scene?  Why was he so angry that someone from the press was taking pictures of the boat?</p>

<p>(<a href="http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/20/0420-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-cbs-boat-3.jpg)%5BThis">http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/20/0420-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-cbs-boat-3.jpg)[This</a> is the picture I&#39;m speaking about]</p>

<p>Think about it.  What would have happened if the press DIDN&#39;T GET in and take this picture?  Would the entire narrative of been that he went out guns blazing and died that night just like his older brother did?</p>

<p>I fully believe that had the press not have breached the perimeter that night, the MSM would have said that both brothers died in a firefight.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is no record of DT in the BOP prison system, ANYWHERE!  Not in the BOP prisoner locater, not with his fake BOP number that has been given out to his supporters, who have donated THOUSANDS of dollars to him under this fake BOP number, there literally is no official record of him being alive at this point, I&#39;ve even called Devens and asked them.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s another thing, Devens is a MINIMUM security federal medical prison.  Why the FUCK is someone who has been charged with terrorism charges STILL being held at a minimum security federal medical prison, when close to 2 years since his injuries have past?  Why won&#39;t they move him to a more secure, maximum security prison at this point now that he&#39;s no longer injured?</p>

<p>Lastly if you read this article from the Huffington Post, you&#39;ll see that they went out of their way to say that TWO fresh graves were dug where Tamerlan was mysteriously buried by this Christian woman, in the cover of night time.  Who is this second freshly dug grave?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you define your nebulous term, &quot;white rights users&quot;, because all I read is &quot;people with ideas and opinions I don&#39;t like&quot;.</p>

<p>What do you care about what other subs&#39; opinions are of this one (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>)?  Before you state anything along the lines of &quot;it scares away potential truth seekers&quot; let me suggest that it is somewhat of a fair point while also being incredibly hypocritical.  It suggests that your &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are more important than, or more valid, than others&#39;.</p>

<p>I really would like to hear your definition of &quot;white rights users&quot;, what they stand for, and what their goals are.  Then, explain to me how your definition is any different from the ad hom attacks of those who would call members of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community &quot;tinfoil hats&quot; or simply respond with &quot;DA JOOOOOOOOS&quot; whenever we are brought up in conversation outside this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? I dont really want to get into this with you I just feel that users that push the agenda of keeping America white and christian are detrimental to this sub and to actual conspiracy theories and discussions. It never adds to the conversation. </p>

<p>You post to <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a> ... how can you even begin to consider yourself objective? You do know the joke is that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is full of racists? I think it would be better to get more users interested and involved in this sub without having to worry about white rights users scaring them away and giving a bad impression to real conspiracy posters. </p>

<p>Whats the conspiracy here anyway? You dont like it when people arent accepting of racism? Im sorry dude but I do not agree with your views and I didnt even argue with the original poster all I did was simply explain where an off comment came from...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A user that posts racist shit. Its pretty simple. I dont agree with many of your positions on race relationships and the inferiority of non-white non-christian peoples. I think your casual and usually inaccurate racism is going the way of the pay phone, we will only have to deal with you for maybe one or two more generations before your backwards counterproductive way of thinking has been weened from the social fabric of this country. </p>

<p>Not only do I not agree with many of your pro-whites points as I have said in my previous posts I think its actually detrimental to this sub and to people doing work on actual conspiracies and abuses this government is engaged in. </p>

<p>So why do you post to <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a>? Do you think that is a good place for racial discussions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill slow it down a bit and get more detailed. Im not sure what you arent following... Do you not know what the word racist or racism means? How slow are you? A bicyclist is a person who rides a bicycle, a pianist plays the piano, a racist engages in racism... Racism should be a middle school level word for the average person... but here since I guess you arent familiar with the term the definition is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one&#39;s own race is superior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So follow me with this one when you make posts that fit the above definition (Remember this is the definition of racism, still with me?) it is racist. It becomes racist shit when there is not logic to back it up, such as most posts found in <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a> (Still with me?). So using inflammatory rhetoric against another persons race is racist shit, still with me? So calling a person a nig or nigger then feigning Oh im just promoting white rights not being racist is disingenuous at best and something an asshole would do at worst. </p>

<p>Racist shit is making sweeping generalizations about a race of people using derogatory terms. </p>

<p>you grok?</p>

<p>Edit: The fucked up thing is there was zero reason for you to pursue this line of questioning. Why the fuck would you bother me over me simply telling another user why someone would make a comment that seemingly doesnt follow what was posted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the Boston Bombing is ridiculously fishy, but I don&#39;t really see the importance of any of your points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1)Why would the police, SRT and others wait until after dark? To get better thermal imaging of the boat? They kept having to push back reporters, who were trying to break the perimeter to get coverage. Why delay? Based on the eyewitness saying there was blood around a sleeping man in the boat, and the released video of the flashbangs, the kid was not active. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long was the FBI extraction team there before they went in after him?  I don&#39;t think there is anything inherently strange about waiting to get set up.  What I do think is strange is that an Extraction team would choose to &quot;exchange fire&quot; with an unarmed man who supposedly might be the key to a terrorist plot, rather than sending in some sort of camera and negotiation tool with the capability discerning what the situation was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2)When they were advancing, they suddenly broke over the radio that the helicopter needed to refuel and that the downlink was being broadcast on the internet. This caused a considerable delay. Why care in the middle of a standoff that the video is online, unless you want to control the narrative?! Was that bait, of those listening online, to see who had the skills to find and access the police helicopter&#39;s downlink? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think swat ever wants their operations broadcast.  I would think that they wouldn&#39;t want their tactics exposed, and they wouldn&#39;t want their mistakes analyzed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) as far as we know, there is no video of his surrender, correct? Just blurry night photos of a man that doesn&#39;t appear to be wounded, that his throat was slashed? If I have a gaping neck wound, I&#39;m not climbing out of a boat to surrender. I&#39;m falling out or laying unresponsive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know what he might have been capable of doing given the extent of the injuries- or even what the extent of the injuries were.  That said, it did look like his throat was cut with a knife.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4)The followup news broadcasts kept using the Governor of MA, Deval Patrick and the State police, which I kept thinking, this is a national event, where is the President, the FBI, etc. Why push the state response, unless Boston Strong is a psyop, and give the governor the Giuliani treatment, like post-911? (Deval Patrick said he won&#39;t run in 2016, but I doubt Clinton or Warren would be &quot;electable&quot;. Another black man will get the presidency before a white woman, probably why the racism narrative is being pushed by the media. God, our country is a fucking soap opera....) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>find an emergency or tragedy that isn&#39;t governed over by the local representatives.  I don&#39;t know why you would assume the president would take a leadership role over the mayor or governor- nor do I think this has anything to do with Patrick&#39;s potentially candidacy for president.  That said- he did a good job with his script and I&#39;m sure he will be rewarded for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) No interviews or video of this kid since arrest. No news agency has been granted ANY access to him? Yes, it&#39;s before the trial, but not even a clip of his transport to court? No one has managed to sneak a pic in over a year?! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s crazy the amount of information being withheld from his lawyers.  Why does this type of crime get dealt with so much differently than other high crimes?  There is a lie being told here, but it&#39;s difficult to know what the lie is.</p>

<p>A picture of you attending an event, walking towards the location <em>where bonb was planted</em> wearing a heavy backpack, walking away from said location 10 seconds later <em>without the heavy backpack you were previously wearing,</em> and <em>casually walking away moments after the explosions occurred without any look of concern or shock.</em></p>

<p>What happened to their backpacks? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even counting the mountains of evidence uncovered in his dorm room, eg fireworks etc. They found even more evidence on the brother, possession of the gun, video footage of the two buying large amounts of fireworks, etc etc. </p>
