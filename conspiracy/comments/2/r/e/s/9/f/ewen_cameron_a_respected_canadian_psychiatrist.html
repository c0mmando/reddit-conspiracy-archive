       <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/01/04/dr-ewen-cameron-and-psychiatric-mind-control/">
        From Jon Rappoport:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "It’s important to understand that the professionals who put the most emphasis on the brain as the source of consciousness are also the people who drug it, sedate it, coerce it, and try to control it. They’re going mad trying to reduce life to purely physical terms. They’re agents of destruction."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is what happens when you put Materialists in charge of human life. They destroy themselves and everything around them. It’s their only option, because their understanding is Zero.
       </p>
       <p>
        They’re trying to make thought and imagination and passion into material objects. Since that’s an absurdity, they do the only thing they can do: try to control those “objects.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In this way, they become the perfect voluntary dupes for men who want control of the whole planet.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a whole brand of mind control that is little more than torture.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, by inflicting duress, applying coercion, making threats, causing pain and disorientation, an “expert” can make a victim do and say many things. That’s no secret. There are obviously drugs and hypnotic techniques that will soften up a person and/or put him into tremendous confusion, where he is pliable. And microwaves create pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Example: One of the foremost lunatic practitioners of torture was world-famous Canadian psychiatrist,
        <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2012/09/mk-ultraviolence/">
         Ewen Cameron
        </a>
        , who carried out experiments on unwitting patients in the 1950s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cameron, during his career, was President of the Canadian, US, and World Psychiatric Asociations, the American Psychopathological Association, and the Society of Biological Psychiatry. There was no one in his profession more highly decorated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Partially funded by a CIA front, Cameron’s method was called psychic driving.
       </p>
       <p>
        After horrendous electric shocks, very heavy drugs were given to place patients in days of prolonged sleep. Cameron then subjected them to audio tapes he made, in which he repeated phrases thousands of times, in order to produce “new personalities” for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is murderous coercion. There is nothing sophisticated about it. And it assumes that a human being is merely a sum of physical parts, pieces of a puzzle that can be rearranged at will by “those in charge.”
       </p>
       <p>
        A 2012 lawsuit filed by veterans’ groups, against the CIA and the DOD, refers to Cameron’s methods. The suit also states that two researchers, Dr. Louis West and Dr. Jose Delgado, working together under the early CIA MKULTRA subproject 95, utilized two protocols: brain implants (“stimoceivers”) and RHIC-EDOM to program the minds of victims. RHIC-EDOM stands for Radio Hypnotic Intracerebral Control-Electronic Dissolution of Memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Translation: bury memory, and insert new data. But here again, burying memory, the first phase, is achieved through force. The force of subjecting the brain to massive electromagnetic disruption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later and more sophisticated means of mind control can utilize loops, during which a person’s own brainwaves are fed back to him, along with suggestions.
       </p>
       <p>
        But different people have different degrees of consciousness about their own thoughts and feelings.
       </p>
       <p>
        No system exists which would make every person believe a thought planted in his brain is his own thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is another gap. Just because certain naturally occurring brain waves can be read and recorded, this does not mean that feeding back those waves will result in “perfect reception” and integration by every person.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third gap can be enormous, depending on the person. Voluntary thought in its basic form isn’t a product of the brain at all. The brain REFLECTS thought that is created by the person.
       </p>
       <p>
        People who are aware of this wouldn’t fooled by brainwaves fed to them with suggestions.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I’ve written before, the entire obsession with the brain is misplaced. If this organ is viewed as the fountainhead of all thought, then there is no such thing as freedom. Why? Because the brain, like every material object, is made up of tiny particles or waves that move according to physical laws—in which case the brain is just “another object” where the particles aggregate and mix and match.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is absolutely nothing inherent in sub-atomic particles that would lead to a notion of free will.
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of freedom (choice) directly implies a non-material space. And a non-material individual who is inhabiting a physical form.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mind control is most successful when inflicted on people who ALREADY have trouble making the distinction between what they think and believe, and what other people around them think and believe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ongoing research to take real-time pictures of brain activity is likely to focus on two major targets: people who hold very strong individualistic beliefs and those who are intensely creative.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aim here is to introduce new brain activity that will cumulatively erode “the determination to believe” and the commitment to create. Why? Because those are distinct threats to a controlled status quo.
       </p>
       <p>
        This research direction parallels a social propaganda campaign to eliminate the whole concept of “will power.” That phrase has become passe. It is now viewed by many people as a negative and essentially meaningless notion. In its place? Genetic determinism. DNA rules all. A person is what a person is because of his genes, and that’s the beginning and end of the story.
       </p>
       <p>
        Never mind the fact that research along these lines has turned up precious little to explain human behavior. It’s a propagated myth of “science.” And it’s promoted for its social impact: “you can’t change what you are.”
       </p>
       <p>
        It has always been true, since the dawn of time, that one person can force another person to take certain actions. But this is no mystery.
       </p>
       <p>
        These days, with the use, say, of acoustic weapons or other forms of wave-disruption broadcasting, criminals can make people sick, make them feel pain or anger or fatigue—but this is really on the level of an electromagnetic “fist” to the head. Is it dangerous? Of course. But so is a concussion or a heavy blow to the gut or a bullet to the leg.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people at the CIA, the Pentagon, DARPA, and other agencies, who are trying to change thought and behavior, are much crazier than they appear to be. They assume that the process of thought is so directly a product of the brain that they can make Thought A turn into Thought B with the flip of a switch. They have many surprises in store for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The major problem for humanity, vis-a-vis mind control, is the large number of people who already are only dimly aware of what they’re thinking and feeling. They can be manipulated with relative ease. But that is no surprise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor is it a shock when people who are members of a cult do something horrendous to others or themselves. They’ve been subjected to social conditioning every day. They’ve bought the package. They’ve sworn allegiance to a leader. It takes relatively little to push them over the edge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The SSRI antidepressants (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, etc.) are themselves a form of mind control. They elicit, in some people, suicide and homicide. But this isn’t a precise process of switching off one thought and inserting another.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the creation of a wholesale brain storm, in which neurotransmitters go haywire and scramble the brain and the nervous system. The person is literally being tortured, and he responds with violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bottom-line issue in all these heinous methods is freedom of the individual. Freedom to think his thoughts, act on the basis of his chosen goals. Mind control advocates and researchers deny such freedom exists. For them, it’s just a matter of replacing one piece of equipment for another in what they believe humans are: biological machines.
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s the end-game of philosophic Materialism, a bankrupt and contradictory system.
       </p>
       <p>
        See that. Know that. Understand it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Human beings are not machines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Human beings are not material objects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The brain is not the source of consciousness or thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        And because this is true, it opens up an endless vista of possibility for human thought, creation, power.

       i really wanted to like it, but it just wasnt informative enough for me. i had great empathy for the lady, but i didnt rate the movie for a lot of substance. it was a little too "dramatised for TV-ish".

       it was a terrible event and i think it could be done better.

       This scumbag was the head of the Canadian, American,
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       World Psychiatric Associations.  A mind control researcher who experimented on many of his subjects against their will and subjected them to enormous amounts of physical and mental abuse was quite literally the most (or one of the most) highly decorated and respected psychiatrists in history, let alone during his own lifetime.
