<blockquote>
<p>Why, if the vaccines work, is South Korea experiencing year after year increases in chickenpox (varicella) outbreaks as their mandated vaccine uptake (97%) reaches close to universal compliance? </p>

<p>In 2005, the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine was mandated in South Korean for infants at 12 to 15 months of age. Despite near universal vaccine uptake (97% by 2011), rather than see a reduced burden of chickenpox in South Korea as would be expected, no substantial decreases have been observed there nationwide. </p>

<p>Quite to the contrary, the number of varicella patients reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) increased from 22.6 cases per 100,000 in 2006 to 71.6 cases per 100,000 in 2011.  </p>

<p>The obvious question emerges: If the chickenpox vaccine is effective, why is a population whose vaccination rates have been steadily increasing year after year seeing increasing rates of breakthrough infection?</p>

<p>This glaring failure of varicella vaccination in South Korea lead a group of Korean researchers to conduct a series of studies to better understand the impact of varicella vaccination in South Korea, the results of which were published earlier this year in the journal Clinical and Vaccine Immunology in a study titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018876/">&quot;Varicella and varicella vaccination in South Korea.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The Korean research team conducted a case-based study, a case-control study, and an immunogenicity and safety study, in order to identify the reasons for the failure of the vaccine. The results were reported as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Case-based study:</h2>

<p>&quot;One hundred and seventy-six children with varicella younger than 16 years of age were enrolled in the study. Among the study groups, 80 subjects (45.5%) were girls and 19 subjects (11.1%) were younger than 1 year of age. The largest number of the patients belonged to the 1-to-4-years age group, with the mean age of 4.6 ± 3.2 years and median age of 4 years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Among 152 varicella patients who were 1 year of age or older, 139 patients (91.4%) had been vaccinated.&quot;</p>

<h2>Case-control study:</h2>

<p>&quot;One hundred and thirty-five varicella patients younger than 16 years of age were enrolled, their mean age was 4.8 ± 3.2 years, and varicella vaccination coverage rate was 91.7% in patients older than 1 year of age. Breakthrough varicella was confirmed in 82.2% of all enrolled varicella cases, and all of the vaccinated varicella cases were breakthrough infection.&quot;</p>

<h2>Immunogenicity and safety study:</h2>

<p>&quot;A total of 126 healthy children were vaccinated with a single dose of Suduvax (Green Cross, South Korea). Four children lost for follow-up and two children with positive prevaccination FAMA titers were excluded from further analysis. </p>

<p>&quot;Of the remaining 120 children, the seroconversion rate (varicella antibodies detectable) and geometric mean titers for FAMA antibody were 76.67% and 5.31, respectively (Tables 3 and ​and4).4). Adverse reactions were analyzed for a total of 126 children. Local adverse reactions were observed in 16 children (12.7%), including 12 cases of erythema, 4 cases of swelling, 6 cases of tenderness, and 3 cases of petechiae.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Systemic adverse reactions were observed in 15 children (11.9%), including 12 cases of fever, 2 cases of chills, 3 cases of lassitude, and 3 cases of rash which didn&#39;t look like varicella. Serious adverse events occurred in three children (2, rotaviral enteritis; 1, acute pharyngitis) but were not judged to be vaccine related.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The researchers compared prelicensure data on the Suduvax vaccine to the above mentioned research results and found the vaccine in actual practice has &quot;much lower&quot; immunogenicity, concluding: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Suduvax (Green Cross, South Korea) may not be immunogenic enough to be effective in preventing varicella in South Korea.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current prospective case-based study and case-control study suggests that most cases of varicella occurring in South Korea are caused by breakthrough infection in vaccine compliant individuals. </p>

<p>A breakthrough infection is defined as a vaccine recipient contracting the very disease the vaccine is intended to prevent, either through infection from the vaccine strain or a wild-type strain.</p>

<p>Additionally, the researchers noted:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Breakthrough disease is allegedly milder than varicella in unvaccinated individuals, but our study showed that varicella vaccination did not seem to alleviate clinical symptoms, although vaccinated patients were cared for more in the outpatient clinics with less serious appraisal of the disease by their parents.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider that the ultimate justification for any medically unnecessary intervention like vaccination is whether the benefit of intervening outweigh the harms of not doing so.  </p>

<p>It is an irreducible empirical fact that you can&#39;t prove with absolute certainty that any single vaccine has ever prevented any single disease, because the projected beneficial outcome is always going to be a non-event (i.e. not being infected with the disease). </p>

<p>In other words, you can&#39;t prove cause-and-effect when the cause (vaccination) can only be linked to a non-empirical effect (not contracting the vaccine specific disease) that can just as logically be attributed to our natural innate/adaptive immunity.  </p>

<p>You can, on the other hand, link vaccination to adverse effects with infinitely more plausibility. In the case of chickenpox (varicella) vaccine, for instance, not only are immediate or near immediate acute reactions observable in 1 in 4 vaccine recipients, but at least 2 dozen adverse health effects – some including chronic and life-threatening – have been documented in the biomedical literature. <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-varicella-chicken-pox">View the GreenMedInfo.com Varicella Vaccination page</a> for direct access to the study abstracts.</p>

<p>Clearly, if the vaccines don&#39;t work to prevent the very disease they are designed to, and the likelihood of being harmed is high, what justifies their use any longer?</p>

<p>Varicella vaccine is not an exception, as far as failure goes. As we recently reported in another Asian population, the <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-china-having-measles-outbreaks-when-99-are-vaccinated-2">Chinese have one of the highest measles vaccine uptake rates</a> in the world, but are continually facing measles outbreaks. </p>

<p>Vaccine failure, in fact, <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/keyword/vaccine-failure">is so extensively documented,</a> that it is disturbing how anyone who promotes authentic vaccine awareness – that is, making the public and professional castes aware of the published research on their unintended, adverse effects and/or non-effectivenes – is reflexively characterized by the pro-vaccine camp as being &#39;anti-vaccine,&#39; &#39;anti-science.&#39; </p>

<p>Beyond the antipodes of &#39;pro-&#39; and &#39;anti-&#39; vaccine is the truth. And since vaccinology and the pro-vaccine agenda is ostensibly &#39;evidence-based,&#39; criticism should remain focused on the research itself, and not those who report on it or simply exercise their legal right and responsibility (where it is still sacrosanct) to opt-out of this intervention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good questions.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why this thread was heavily brigaded (downvoted).</p>

<p>The first is because, for the last several years, anything I&#39;ve posted gets immediately downvoted. I have weird friends on reddit, apparently.</p>

<p>The second, and more important, reason is because of the subject.</p>

<p>Certain topics (especially specific &quot;buzzwords&quot; in the title) attract downvote brigades. They&#39;re probably mostly bots, and not actual people, that cause these brigades.</p>

<p>For example, &quot;chemtrails&quot; or &quot;GMOs&quot; or (especially) &quot;vaccines&quot; will cause that reaction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost certain this post was targeted because it&#39;s vaccine related.</p>

<p>Except that that&#39;s exactly how you get shingles later. Shingles is what happens when you get chicken pox as a child, and it lies dormant for a while once you recover. Not to mention chickenpox parties are frankly much more dangerous since you&#39;re exposing the child to the live virus, not a dead one.</p>

<p>This indicates that having thee vaccine DOES NOT prevent getting shingles and in fact, you should still get a shingles vaccine BUT ONLY AFTER THE AGE OF 60. How is this in ANYWAY helpful? </p>

<p>It does go on to claim that you are allegedly more susceptible to shingles if you have had pox, but only slightly. And again, you can still get shingles even if you had the vaccine. </p>

<p>In other words, get the vaccine and lower your chances slightly of getting shingles, otherwise dont get the vaccine and have normal chances of getting shingles. </p>

<p>Do you like having things injected into your bloodstream for a small change in chances? You like gambling and playing with statistics?</p>

<p>Well first of all, you seem to be forgetting that it prevents chicken pox, which seems like a rather important thing not to leave out. Secondly, the second vaccine is to prevent any possible lingering virus from reactivating. Also are you not aware that boosters are a very common thing with vaccines?</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you&#39;ve had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles.</li>

<p>The shingles vaccine is recommended for anyone 60 years of age and older to keep the varicella-zoster virus from re-activating and causing shingles.</p>

<p>SO really, its not necessary (like the flu shot) and really only serves to attempt to lessen the severity of shingles, if you were to get it, which is in no regard to having the vaccine or not. </p>

<p>The chicken pox vaccine also protects against chicken pox, which seems like a rather important thing to mention.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well these are two different vaccines we&#39;re talking about here. One which prevents against chicken pox, and the other which prevents the virus from reactivating if there is any in the body. So it&#39;s not at all what you seem to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but thats the argument the other derp posted in retort. That since I wouldn&#39;t get the pox vaccine, that I&#39;d likely get shingles and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>hopefully you don&#39;t suffer like my granddad did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the argument was that it doesn&#39;t really matter to get pox vaccine vs. a pox party because it only minimizes the chances of having a severe case of the shingles by a very small percentage. Neither of which actually prevent the reactivation, but it &#39;helps&#39; if it does.</p>

<p>Again, the issue is that you&#39;re only looking at shingles, when there is also chicken pox to consider. If you have a pox party, it&#39;s pretty much assured your kid will get chicken pox, which is something the vaccine would prevent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohh, nice attempt at being subtle with your veiled insults.</p>

<p>Guess what? I won&#39;t get the shingles. I&#39;ve already had chicken pox and built up that immunity normally, like most the kids I know born prior to the vaccine and that attended pox parties. </p>

<p>You brainwashed idiots have got a lot of growing up to do.</p>

<p>EDIT: from a very biased wiki article, &quot;In the United States, pox parties were popular before the introduction of the varicella vaccine in 1995.&quot; </p>

<p>So I guess our age is showing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For more info on the chickenpox vaccine, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/23og48/the_skeptics_guide_to_vaccines_part_i_poxes_polio/cgyz5g5">here&#39;s some of my own research on the subject.</a></p>

<p>The chickenpox vaccine is not only completely unnecessary, but it&#39;s causing a shingles epidemic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a societal benefit when chickenpox remains endemic. When the wild-type varicella virus is permitted to circulate naturally throughout society, adults receive beneficial periodic exposures to the virus boosting their immune systems and helping to suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster.</p>

<p>However, as more and more children are vaccinated with the synthetic or manufactured chickenpox virus, the natural virus becomes less pervasive and there are fewer opportunities for adults to receive these periodic boosts. This has led to much higher rates of shingles in Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Gary Goldman, an expert on the varicella virus, was hired in 1995 by the CDC to monitor the new chickenpox vaccine. According to Goldman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to the universal varicella vaccination program whereby every healthy child is vaccinated at age 12 months, there are no longer the seasonal outbreaks of varicella that occurred in schools and communities. </p>

<p>These annuals outbreaks and exposures (called exogenous exposures) played a significant role in boosting cell-mediated immunity to help suppress the reactivation of herpes zoster among children and adults who had a previous history of natural or wild-type varicella.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicken-pox-vaccine-associated-with-shingles-epidemic-54648017.html">Goldman continues:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The universal varicella vaccination program in the US...will leave our population vulnerable to shingles epidemics...there appears to be no way to avoid a mass epidemic of shingles lasting as long as several generations among adults.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Goldman, the CDC is more than aware about the problem, and that when he approached them with his concerns, they replied that “any possible shingles epidemic associated with the chickenpox vaccine can be offset by treating adults with a shingles vaccine.”</p>

<p>By 2006, the FDA had licensed Zostavax, a vaccine designed to reduce the risk of shingles. Incredibly, Merck, the same company that makes Varivax (the chickenpox vaccine), is also manufacturing Zostavax. Such an apparent conflict of interest is accepted without question, even though the very “success” of Varivax is contributing to the need for yet another product.</p>
