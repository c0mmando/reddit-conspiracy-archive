       And when there is uproar, they leave it down for a sufficient time period so the post ages, twiddle their thumbs for a few hours and then restore the post. Yay, the mods are just! It drops down a few ranks and orders of magnitude fewer people see the post. It's still censorship.

       Exactly.  There are so many different techniques and tools at the mods' and admins' collective disposal to manipulate the content on this site, and that's without even going into the entire world of shills/astroturfers/vote rigging which is probably even more extensive and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I've noticed on the bigger subs/threads is all of the "comment has been hidden" things that pop up everywhere.  Seemingly random and arbitrary but if you actually look, a lot of the more "controversial" comments seem to be the ones that are
       <em>
        coincidentally
       </em>
       hidden..

       What's so amusing is how it was perfectly fine and dandy until it got the attention. When people genuinely question the provided narrative it's shut down. Also, to be such a liberal friendly place, it's strange to see what strange bedfellows these mods would have to lay with to support this brand of censorship.

       I remember when I was 17 or 18 and I started a forum for a group of friends I had. It blew up to a few hundred people with lots of posts, and being a mod/admin on the forum really gave me a sense of power and purpose. If someone had accused me of taking it too seriously or thinking I was awesome because of it I'd deny it for sure, but deep down I thought it was awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if a person like I was at that age had a mod position for a forum with a few million users? These people are totally caught up with themselves and probably think they are doing some real good in the world by hiding the stories they think are bad. If it's not that then they are addicted to the power/drama that comes with moderating a front page sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess all we can do is hope that they grow up and realize how much they are wasting their time.

       The "Torture Report" is sort of a fight over 9/11 by proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that in 2001 they realized how mainstream the internet would become, and how unable they would be to control the narrative of something like 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe at least a majority have "alternative" theories about 9/11, and the "truth movement" has done a really good job of getting the facts out there.

       They cannot afford to have any sort of open and honest debate, because 14 year after - the government's story just doesn't hold up to basic scrutiny.

       I wonder what is in those pages?  Perhaps this is what Snowden was alluding to when he said there was some pretty damning stuff out there that would end a lot of political careers.  This needs to happen before they anoint Jeb Bush the next president.  Isn't there some sorta nepotism clause saying a father and his two sons cannot be president?

And what they found, in the post-mortem, when they looked at all of the classified intelligence from all of the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed as an intelligence community, as a classified sector, as the national defense of the United States to detect this plot,” Snowden said. “We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out.

       So after reading that Snowden thinks that it was intelligence failure,
       <em>
        which is what anyone paying attention and subscribing to the Let It Happen On Purpose Theory)
       </em>
       already knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought you were saying Snowden had info in 9/11, which I see trotted out here a lot with no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for the links, and I apologize for the confusion.

       The "Let It Happen" theory is, by and large, the stance any and every Truther should take, and for a handful of reasons, of which I'll begin to list here.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There seems to be piles of proof leading to this conclusion. Thle Saudi funding, NORAD's response to the event, ALL THE RED FLAGS provided by international intelligence agencies, fucking Tenet (then Director of the god damn CIA) even warned the Bush Admin in Aug. 2001. Let alone Able Danger or the fact that we knew of one of the hijackers suspected cells operating quietly in NYC back in Jan of 2000.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once you start going deeper down the rabbit hole (nano-thermite, collapse into the footprint, free-fall speed of the smoking gun WTC7, pools of heat NASA satellites photographed under the wreckage and the classified "crash" video of the Pentagon), you begin an uphill fight. More and more proof is required to validate such damning claims (of which there sure is a fucking lot of). But then comes the debunkers, and at this point, it becomes a battle of semantics, which leads me to number...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It sounds to me that these "28 pages" contain evidence of Saudi involvement, which should be clear as day to most people. If we, as a people, want to make a change, or bring the war-criminals called the Bush Admin to justice, we need to work with what we have as written evidence in the joke of a commission report. Yes, I know the commission was headed by members within Bush's cabinet, which would only seem to hinder the reports credibility (let's be honest, it's fuckin shit, not a single fucking investigation into WTC7? Really?). But is that really the case? If those pages show what sounds to be tangible evidence of Saudi's involvement as well as records of our intell agencies knowing full god-damn well what would happen, then proof of Bush and his admin's compliance can be set forward, without having to jump through the physics hurdles free-fall or foot-print collapse creates.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Long story short, those 28 pages could possibly contain the cold hard facts required to bring the fucking jokers in the old Bush Admin to justice. It would be lovely to watch Chenney dangle from a rope alongside Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, most importantly, it would bring closure to the families of the lost that know that the narrative fed to us over "live" television was bullshit. 3000 families deserve an answer, even when the answer is as dark as this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the proof we need, but the proof we deserve. And who knows, maybe it would be enough to start a repeal of the Patriot Act, or abolish the DoHS and the TSA. One can only hope...

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe LIHOP is the most likely scenario, considering everything you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in the minority for once here who thinks that the bullshit of the live reporting that day was far more involved in the Event than most realize, but with all the disinfo it's tough to get everyone to agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're right about Saudi stuff in the 28 pages. Makes sense. Especially when you take into account Bandar "Bush" and his association with terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       My fear is that the media will spin this as an external threat that requires external intervention, and ISIS/ISIL/IS/DAESH will then start moving in (if you subscribe to the theory that those guys are really an Islamic Academi on our side ultimately like I do), the some bombings like in Syria, and then maybe some
       <em>
        regime change
       </em>
       in the house of Saud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you starting seeing a noticeable ramp up in anti-Saudi messaging and propaganda, we're moving in that direction. So let's stay tuned.

       and was #1 at the time of removal. It couldn't be found in "top" of the week and Reddit search couldn't locate it and now it shows up in both.

       I also checked
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator/">

       and found nothing about the post.

      <p>
       I probably would have thought it possibly not that suspicious but I read about a similar thing happening to a 
Russian Times 9/11 video.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On September 8, 2013, the popular Russia Today “Truthseeker” program, with over a million subscribers on YouTube,[1] published a 13-minute newscast entitled “The Truthseeker: 9/11 and Operation Gladio (E23).”
       </p>
       <p>
        The “Truthseeker” video immediately started to gain popularity on YouTube, reaching 131,000 views in the first three days.[5](The history of the viewing statistics may be seen by clicking on the little graphic symbol under the video frame, and to the right)
       </p>
       <p>
        Truthseeker posted its program to YouTube on Sept. 8.  Russia Today tweeted the YouTube link to its 546,000 followers and to the interviewer, Daniel Bushell, that day:
A MOXNEWS copy of the same newscast was also posted September 8 under the title “Russia Today News Declares 9/11 An Inside Job False Flag Attack!” which in turn started to escalate, with over 80,000 views in the first few days.[6]...
       </p>
       <p>
        What Happened Next?
       </p>
       <p>
        In both the RT and MOXNEWS cases, the viewer statistics on YouTube suddenly flat-lined on the morning of September 11...
       </p>
       <p>
        ...Failure of Email Transmissions Describing the Above Investigation
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the most disturbing element of this case study is that for more than two weeks after September 11, 2013, it was impossible for some people to transmit by email the link to the original YouTube Episode 23 that had started to go viral.

       You apparently can't even prove the account was "hacked", your tendency to follow me around as of late does not add to your credibility. If you'd truly lost the account, logically you'd ask one of the other mods to have this account reinstated, and have the Administration to remove the original with your "evidence" on display.

       How do you expect me to prove it to you? It was hacked and I can't log in or reset the password. I made
       <a href="/u/NYPD39">
        /u/NYPD39
       </a>
       after that happened and I lost that one too, and there isn't even an email associated with that one for me to reset the password. You can click on both accounts to see they aren't banned. Reddit admins don't assist in password resets or account recovery. They haven't done anything with the accounts, I think whoever is responsible lost control of them during my password reset attempts, or they don't care to do anything with them.

       Your story just doesn't add up and yes, the Admins do in fact remove inactive accounts with mod positions, which is what I said, not account recovery, which I imagine they could also do in the case of "hacking". Have you even tried asking them? I imagine your behavior prevents you from having the courage to do so.

       Reddit is for-profit business intimately tied to the socially liberal/fiscally conservative wing of the Democratic party. Just look who the owners are.

      <p>
       All the stuff about reddit being a "community" is hogwash. We are not the customers of reddit; we are the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       The press even covered that in the early days, the handful of people running reddit had dozens of accounts each, pretending to be different, regular people are "contributing to the community."
