        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seeing the recent post on illuminati in music with Minaj and Beyonce etc, I was thinking that it&#39;s not in their lyrics or videos that&#39;s important to the record companies but the sound that&#39;s produced. They&#39;re marketed to just be extremely popular and spread to more ears. It&#39;s not the symbolism in the videos they produce, though it is effective in saying they&#39;re there. It isn&#39;t the lyrics the artists produce as they mostly talk about banging and partying. I had a theory that it is the sound of the digital age, an underlying &#39;static&#39; that combines with the chemicals that dumb our brain and thinking to wreck our thought process. I&#39;m still trying to find the right wording to the theory and would welcome the help. </p>

<p>It kind of started when i had headphones on listening to whatever and hearing the static when it went silent. Even just planting chips to push the static or alter the static through your computer output from the motherboard or inside the speakers themselves. We know there was experimentation with MKULTRA and effects of certain soundwaves/frequencies while on certain drugs/substances. We mostly &#39;assume&#39; (don&#39;t want to make an ass out of u and me) that they didn&#39;t just close the program, so what would have stopped them from doing larger experiments in the computer age?</p>

<p>I&#39;m bored at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Static on your headphones being some sort of mind control/disruption...?</p>

<p>First of all - you do realize that human beings are a <em>lot</em> simpler to control than that, right? There are inherent parts of the human experience that make introspection very difficult, and most of us can unwittingly be persuaded to marginalize/compromise/destroy ourselves in one way or another. We&#39;re born to follow (it&#39;s a hand-me-down trait from our tribal days) and quite easy to turn against each other.</p>

<p>Also (I can&#39;t hear it so I don&#39;t know for sure, but) that static is likely just coming from <em>your</em> speakers if it&#39;s still audible between tracks. A lot of residential-zoned places have inconsistent/dirty power coming through the outlets which effects playback, as does the quality of your soundcard / DAC / the headphones themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I submit to you that the ideas presented in most modern music would be upsetting to God, so let&#39;s use that as an example. Music itself is not inherently bad, but rather acts as a vehicle to drive these ideas into your mind. By taking a catchy beat and getting the tune stuck in your head, suddenly a song about murdering innocent people being a positive thing slips through your filter on the back of a beautiful sound and poetry. Now God sees you and a million others singing this ungodly tune in joy.</p>

<p>Music can be used in this way to slip any idea past your filter quite successfully. One day you&#39;re rejecting it, the next day you&#39;re singing about it whether you realize it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think the idea that mind control being equivalent to pulling strings on a puppet is something they&#39;ve sold us through their actual methods of mind control that keeps us in the dark. We&#39;d like to think that maybe a certain frequency might change our mind, but in reality it&#39;s the thoughts that we don&#39;t examine and challenge before accepting that are controlling us.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t challenge the notion that the Earth is a ball, but none of us have seen the Earth from space. Mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up when we moved to 440hz and how it was researched and concluded that that frequency is for aggression. Throw someone in a frequency and expose them to different symbols and i wonder what mind states you instigate.
Its just like going to a RAVE when on a drug if its mdma or acid amphetamines or research chems you will experience a diff state of mind that the music instigates dependant on the reactions you have while on said drug. Even sober each genre of edm produces a different feeling. A negative example for myself is Trap (trancy hip hop) when listening to trap i get this very negative vibe personally i attribute it to the lyrics. Its like the lyrics pull you to something dark....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been racking my brain to see the negative in electronic music -- not even trap and dubstep (kind of the hiphop and heavy metal of electronic music), just regular ole mainstream house. It&#39;s clearly being pushed hard by the cabal, but why? Here&#39;s a few things I can come up with, but nothing really jumps out at me:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s all A440Hz based, rather than the natural 432Hz, but then again so is most music now. I see how this theoretically unnatural or bad, but I don&#39;t see how it makes any difference in practice. Still if Rockefeller pushed A440 as a standard, it&#39;s gotta be bad for us. Or, as some people say, A432 is good for us -- supposedly &quot;heals DNA&quot;, whatever that means.</li>
<li>It&#39;s all 4:4 timing. 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4... Teaches you to stay inside the box, avoid original rhythms.. original thoughts... </li>
<li>It pulls aspiring musicians into a world where they&#39;re not learning instruments anymore -- they&#39;re learning to DJ, which is playing other people&#39;s music. You really don&#39;t even need music theory anymore. Fewer original artists means less creativity means less original thought. (The counter to this is that we now have the power of a million dollar studio on a macbook. And we can make stuff that kids could only dream of 30 years ago.)</li>
<li>Could just be a big joke on us. There have been &quot;DJs&quot; caught just playing prerecorded sets (basically just one 2 hour MP3 without their CDJs even hooked up), but the crowd doesn&#39;t know so they&#39;re going nuts.</li>
<li>I could see electronic music segwaying into an &quot;art&quot; where it&#39;s all AI generated, totally taking the human factor out of it.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because a song has a certain time signature, doesn&#39;t mean that is will have a discreet feel.</p>

<p>Take for instance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLyeS4ViUJA&amp;amp;list=PLA5F9A14DC121CFEB&amp;amp;index=5">Battles - Leydenecker</a> It&#39;s all 4/4, but would be some of the shittiest music to march to.</p>

<p>Alternatively, take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8vmaj75xzE">Tool&#39;s - Ænima</a> which is mostly in 6/4, but with all kinds of 3/4, 7/4, and 5/4 polyrhythmic bits thrown in throughout. Despite that, it&#39;s one of my favourite songs for any kind of rhythmic workout, or long walking sessions, it&#39;s probably a little slow for marching, but if you sped it up by 10% would be perfect to get troops around i guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what i assume you <em>really</em> want to know I can&#39;t talk about because of NDA&#39;s, but just be happy to know that in almost every case i can think of, weaponization of sound has been more or less a failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychoacoustics is a real thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, very real. It&#39;s the study of how your brain perceives sound. It&#39;s not very surprising that it is real at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound weaponization is a real thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can bet your arse that if someone, somewhere has thought that something might make a weapon, they&#39;ve gotten funding to try it out. Sound weaponization has been a thing for at least 5,000 years to my knowledge. Again, no surprise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What OP is claiming is nothing but fantasy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read what OP is claiming. Read it closely. &quot;The illuminati is putting chips in my headphones to change the static to control my mind&quot; That is nonsense. Firstly, the static he is experience is likely caused by a) poor listening medium, b) low quality amplifier, headphones, cables, etc or c) faulty electronics.</p>

<p>Static would be a nightmarish thing to try and get your acoustic mind control rays from, because it is random. =RAN() kind of random, but truly chaotic. If you want to get a message across, you would need to be manipulating frequencies. The problem with manipulating random frequencies is that, well, you just don&#39;t know what they are going to be, and any filtering you do will be instantly noticeable by a large portion of the population.</p>

<p>The easiest way to &quot;mind control&quot; or &quot;mass hypnotise&quot; a population through sound wouldn&#39;t be microchips in headphones, it would be to release repetitive, droning, 60-70BPM music, that favours low frequencies, and has very few transient high frequency elements. If you&#39;ve ever been to a massage parlour, think about the music you hear there, you know the ones, from CD&#39;s entitles &quot;Buddha dreams of whalesongs while meditating in a rainforest atop an isolated mountain&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>The second most effective method, as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, is by using binaural beating. Beating is the interference pattern when two very similar frequencies are played simultaneously. The easiest way to experience it is by tuning your guitar, when one of the strings is very close to being tuned, you will start to hear the note pulsing. The further the string from being tuned the faster the pulse, the closer it is to being tuned, the slower the pulse, until you have the two strings perfectly in harmony, and the pulsing disappears.</p>

<p>That is acoustic beating. Binaural beating occurs when the two similar frequencies are played over headphones, one through the left, and one through the right. Instead of the interference pattern being caused by pressure change in the air, your brain produces a similar effect perceptively. When your brain is making this perceived beating, it trains itself to the frequencies it is creating. These can correspond to various brainwaves, which themselves correspond to emotional states. Low delta variations (0-3Hz) will make you calm and sleepy, wheras a Beta 2 wave (16-19hz) will make you nervous and anxious. It&#39;s important to know that these are not sound waves.</p>

<p>While it is possible to add this effect to static/white noise/pink noise/brown noise/etc, the effect becomes immediately noticeable as the noises stop being noises so much as tones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, that was quite informative. Beat and binaural beat are not new to me (thanks CoolEdit 2000), but thank you also in the name of those who never heard of it, it was explained very well. I wish I had a second upvote for &quot;Buddha dreams of whalesongs while meditating in a rainforest atop an isolated mountain&quot; :-)</p>

<p>Of course I respect your NDAs. Of course OPs suspicion that the &quot;static&quot; was a &quot;signal&quot; was too far-fetched even for me, I will not argue in favor of the theory that there are chips in headphones or so. Every resistor does produce some noise and noise is the opposite of signal.</p>

<p>And as far as the &quot;weaponization&quot; of music goes - there has never been a war without a battle hymn, trumpets, fanfares and drums... music by itself has the power to energize or to calm. </p>

<p>If I may, though, I would like to aim my question better. Is there an acoustic equivalent to visual subconscious/subliminal 1-frame-messages that are parsed by the brain when watching a film, is there research or resources on this, or has it been tested or thought of? Not that I&#39;m trying to give the weaponizers any ideas, of course. The way I would imagine it: I take the harmless music track and modulate a signal over it (modulation really is no magic). Though indiscernible acoustically, the signal would very much be there and, given the right tools or with the source music file to xor it against could be de-obfuscated (my background: experimental hobby musician, mainly 8-bit and 1-bit (Spectrum ZX, for example), so I understand the basics of PWM and stuff, also some circuit bending and from that I know my Casio SA-1 is trying to communicate with me).</p>

<p>I also understand that octaved messages don&#39;t arrive, if I were to record &quot;KILL YOUR CAT&quot; and go all Paulstretch over it, making it shorter or longer, with pitch shift or without - the brain does not receive it as such. The idea that playing it backwards might work has thoroughly been proven bunk as well, according to my understanding. &quot;Another one bites the dust&quot; is not &quot;It&#39;s fun to smoke marihuana&quot; backwards (but &quot;Star Wars&quot; theme is &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; theme backwards, lazy John Williams :-)</p>

<p>Now to the part I know less about: the way the brain processes acoustic signals and parses them as signals instead of ignoring them as noise. As the mp3 format shows, a lot of information can be discarded without seriously affecting the signal as such (audiophiles, relax, I know, mp3 is the devil). Does it work the other way round as well? Could the verbal message &quot;KILL YOUR CAT&quot; be modulated over the track so it is not picked up consciously, but works its way into the subconscious like the visual 1-frame message &quot;drink coca cola&quot; - or, to put it more... innocent: could this be sort of the direction of what those trying to weaponize music are/were trying to do, and is there a chance we should be worried about this in the future? </p>

<p>I&#39;m a bookworm, so if ever you shred away on that new guitar of yours... you&#39;re welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Screw battle hymns, [this](<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QuO09z-SI">www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QuO09z-SI</a>
) is weaponized sound.</p>

<p>Now, firstly, don&#39;t worry about giving weaponizers good ideas, you&#39;ll have to take my word that they have gone well into the deep end looking for ways to weaponize sound.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get subliminal messages into music. Masking and Backmasking would be the obvious ways. Basically, because of the way sound works, your brain focuses mainly on the fundamental sound, and assumes upper harmonics of that sound are part of the fundamental. That is to say, all sounds are made of of the fundamental (F) and a series of harmonics (H) at frequencies of F+Fx, so, for A440, you would have F = 440 (A), H<sup>1</sup> = 880 (A), H<sup>2</sup> = 1320 (E), H<sup>3</sup> = 1760 (A), H<sup>4</sup> = 2220 (C#), and so on.</p>

<p>Your brain saves brain power by processing the Fundamental, and its relationship with it&#39;s harmonics, as opposed to registering all the information of the Harmonics, this means that you are able to &quot;sneak&quot; in sounds at those harmonics, and the brain will not consciously register them. About a decade ago, i did tests on Masking and Back-masking by recording an instrument and a word, making sure the fundamental of the word was the first harmonic of the instrumentation, and playing them at the same time. I.e. Snare drum + &quot;Cow&quot;, Piano note + &quot;Rain&quot;, etc. In almost every case, the words were indetectable. The next part of the experiment involved seeing if the they were subconsciously detected (This was much, much harder to test), where we repeated the experiment, sometimes with the words &quot;auto-tuned&quot; to the right frequencies, sometimes left natural, or tuned out from the instrumentation. Subjects were given the choice of three cards with words and images on them, one of which contained the same word as was Masked in the test track. Almost always when the words were &quot;unmasked&quot;, test subject picked the right card. This rate was significantly reduced (although still above random guessing) for &quot;masked&quot; sounds.</p>

<p>Back-masking had even worse results, as far as the results we were looking for was that back-masking was an effective way to subliminally communicate words or ideas through music. So, big bummer for all us Zeplin fans i guess.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t personally done testing for your second hypothesis, but i am well familiar with bands that incorporate similar effect aesthetics. It <em>could</em> work, but i highly doubt it. It isn&#39;t similar to having a still frame play for one second, it&#39;s more similar to say, having 1000 randomly selected pixels from your screen printed out, and trying to work out what eBook you were reading.</p>

<p>To answer your final question, the weaponization of sound is less about controlling the masses through sneaking subliminal messages in music, its far easier and far more effective using explicit means. One of the projects I had contributed to, which was later used in a weaponization project (no NDA from me) was using acoustic intermodulation distortion using ultra-high frequency audio to create discreet sonic placement. In other words, we used two beams of sound that you can&#39;t here, aimed them both at a point, and where they met, they interfered with each other creating distortion, and that distortion was a specific signal. Basically, we were able to point these sound beams at roughly ear-level, and only once you walked past a specific spot were you able to hear the message. A person a foot away from you couldn&#39;t hear anything. It was interesting at first, but when we changed the sounds to say &quot;Excuse me&quot;, it became instantly hilarious.</p>

<p>I should mention that we had someone on the ground who would explain to anyone who walked through our zero point what had happened, which became even more hilarious, because some people didn&#39;t hear or react to it, and so our assistant a few times went up to people saying &quot;Hey, you know that sound you just heard that no one around you heard? Don&#39;t worry, that was real, let me explain...&quot; That&#39;s right, being a scientist can be <strong>FUN</strong>!</p>

<p>Yup, that Aztek Death Whistle sounds just like my circuit-bent Casio SA-1. </p>

<p>Weaponized <em>sounds</em> interest me not so, I was vaguely aware of the possibilities ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Acoustic_Device">LRAD</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">Frey effect</a> were still &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. Levitation with sound and that discreet sonic placement you had scientific fun with has also become public knowledge, so I know to always keep my tinfoil helmet battle-ready. </p>

<p>Weaponized <em>music</em> however is what I&#39;d really like to know something about, so this really had me on the edge of the seat: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I re-read your opening statement from the other post: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>in almost every case i can think of, weaponization of sound has been more or less a failure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and my paran-o-iameter went ballistic. So, in a few cases you can think of, weaponization of sound has been more than less a success. Say no more, I want to believe. [/fox mulder]</p>

<p>Without knowing the details of your experimental setup, I must speculate and interpolate. So the masking actually works better than random guessing. I assume you didn&#39;t give your test subjects much chance to replay. So it is not entirely unthinkable to design, let&#39;s say the snares or hihats in a 4/4 pop song that is looped a zillion times by <del>dumb</del> young and naive teenagers, with inaudible, masked words so it goes <em>kick</em> - SSSS<sup>kill</sup> - <em>kick</em> - SSSS<sup>cat</sup> - <em>kick</em> - SSSS<sup>kill</sup> - <em>kickkick</em> - SSSS<sup>cat</sup> , so the message is subconsciously picked up due to prolonged and repeated exposition and suddenly: dead felines everywhere?</p>

<p>Not trying to argue with someone more knowledgeable, more trying to clarify what I was trying to say in layman&#39;s terms. Still thinking in terms of blurriness, and speech is quite &quot;blurrable&quot;. There are phoneme generators around for 1-bit synthesizers with ridiculously low sample rates. The quality is bad, as in really bad, but I take from that that with proper modulation the actual &quot;information&quot; does not take up much &quot;energy&quot; - you could at least guess the headlines of the e-book I&#39;m reading. That was my general idea. </p>

<p>That plus the fact that the brain is also wired to find patterns in stuff - also in noise, like those &quot;Electronic Voice Phenomenon&quot; crowd. We give onomatopoetic names to things, like boom and chirp and crack. Wouldn&#39;t a madder scientist than you get ideas from that?</p>

<p>I like cats, somehow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. The tests I did were more for intelligibility of distorted signals, almost the opposite of what you are suggesting. The end was a piece of software that took unintelligible signals, added bursts of noise where unintelligible to trick the brain into re-completing the words. </p>

<p>With the test i mentioned before, with the non-masked (SSSSS-Cat) we would get about 62% hit rate when people chose the cat card as opposed to the 5 dummy cards. With the masked sounds (KKKKKK-Cow) people were picking the Cow card roughly 22% of the time. With 6 cards, random guessing should get +-16.66%, 22% is just outside of the 20% tolerance. Not far enough outside tolerance for a WOW, but definitely far enough away for a Hrmm. In other words, The masked sounds may have had an effect on some of the subjects, but in all likelyhood there were just a high amount of correct guesses.</p>

<p>Speech intelligibility is a strange beast. In some cases you don&#39;t need much information to be intelligible, in other cases you need far more. If you are talking about hiding lyrical content within the musicality of a track (not what the OP was talking about), then it&#39;s not only possible, but has been a mainstay of music production since the 70s. The question is not if it is possible, but if it has an effect. For instance, take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvvC3BfMcZI">Tool - Cesaro Summability</a>, there&#39;s clearly some vocal content there, but it is distorted and masked in such a way that it is unintelligible. I know the Tool community has been trying to work out what is being said (if you find out, head on over to r/toolband ) with no luck at all, including after extraction methods. The question remains, does this vocal content have an effect on a person even if they can&#39;t tell what is being said? Tool obviously think so (or they wouldn&#39;t add elements like this to nearly all of their songs), Zeppelin think so (although, much of that is back-masking, not masking), Radiohead, Battles, Aphex Twin, and most of my favourite bands use these kind of techniques. I too often use these techniques (my atmos and sound effects are usually all manipulated voice and body sound tracks), but to what effect? </p>

<p>The research I&#39;ve conducted has shown that there is not really that much of an effect, but the research was testing something that while being similar, was not what asking the same questions as we are now.</p>

<p>Still, heuristically, i would say there is no effect. Sound doesn&#39;t work like vision. It&#39;s apprehended and comprehended very differently, and is stored and processed quite poorly by the brain. It is quite effective at changing a persons mood and behaviour, and can be used to entrain emotions and possibly even actions, but these effects are all above the board.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are plenty madder scientists than me, i know many of them personally, I&#39;ve even worked with some of them, although i definitely don&#39;t know all of them, nor do I know of all the far out work going on. In regards to EVP and the likes, I think a lot of that tends to be the individuals expectations and the desire to hear <em>something</em>. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a real phenomenon, but the few examples I&#39;ve been asked to explore have yielded nothing, or been obvious forgeries.</p>

<p>Take a listen to Stairway to Heaven backwards, Listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BZ57-qJTPA">First, with no lyrics</a> and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbNqeDr5mlQ">Second, with the lyrics</a> the first instance should be mostly garbled (I&#39;ve listened to it so many times now i can&#39;t really tell anymore.), the second instance, with lyrics, it should be more or less clear as day. Expectations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was all great insight!</p>

<p>I have quite similar doubts about the EVP, that&#39;s why I brought it up as an example for the brain attributing a pattern (signal) to noise when there is none - as also seems to be the case with Nileppez Del&#39;s &quot;Nevaeh Ot Yawriats&quot;, IMHO (or is it known they did that on purpose?).

<p>When i said that almost every case i could think of was more or less a failure, the &quot;non-failures&quot; are things like the VLF directional cannon, which was meant to cause it&#39;s targets organs to melt, and instead caused them to lose control of their bowels. </p>

<p>was completely unfounded and borderline crazy. First of all WTF is &quot;underlying static?&quot; Perhaps OP&#39;s headphone connection is shit, or he is listening to audio at 48kbps that he ripped from a shit youtube link. Second of all....&quot;the chemicals that dumb our brain and thinking to wreck our though process?&quot; I mean come on. Yes, I understand there are studies that link fluoride and GMO soy to health and brain development issues...but to say that these compounds are somehow activated by &quot;underlying static&quot; in mainstream pop music..........COME ON.</p>

<p>I never said that it was impossible to alter the brain by the use of 
audio...I simply said that I think things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It kind of started when i had headphones on listening to whatever and hearing the static when it went silent. Even just planting chips to push the static or alter the static through your computer output from the motherboard or inside the speakers themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is fucking crazy, paranoid, and has absolutely no science behind it to be validated. I have no idea what the fuck &quot;just planting chips to push the static or alter the static through your computer output from the motherboard&quot; is even supposed to mean. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading and replying, regardless of how backhanded and impolite your response was. If you agree with OP, that&#39;s great. I was simply stating that I think OP&#39;s post was a borderline incoherent paranoid rant. </p>
