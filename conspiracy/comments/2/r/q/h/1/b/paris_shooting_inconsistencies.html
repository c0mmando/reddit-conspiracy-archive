    <div class="md"><p>Take a step back and look at the big picture. France got hit. That means, within a one year period, France, Canada and Australia have all had attacks attributed to (or linked with) Islamism. Since 2001, that makes it these 3 countries plus the USA, Spain and Britain.</p>

<p>This could be part of a trend. But if these are false flag attacks, they are working quite well. All of the major western countries are getting one single attack  by Muslims. These attacks serve as the problem. Then comes the predictable reaction.... which will be met with the offered solution. </p>

<p>More security measures. Less freedom. More support for whatever wars. It&#39;s been almost a thousand years since the last Crusade. Looks like we&#39;re due for another one. You can laugh at my use of the word Crusade if you like. But just take one more look at the countries that have been hit. Three English speaking countries, plus Spain and France. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it won&#39;t be too much longer before there&#39;s a false flag hit on Germany. </p>

<p>This could be part of a trend. But if these are false flag attacks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TLDR: Spain was hit BEFORE their big election which was between two parties: one FOR the Spanish involvement in the neocon wars, and one that was NOT.  Terrorist act was to build outrage in Spain against moslems.</p>

<p>My article on 9/11 and connected global terrorist incidents (definitely NOT done by &quot;the toilet&quot; or &quot;al kaida&quot;):</p>

<p><a href="http://americangoy.blogspot.com/2012/07/fun-and-games.html">http://americangoy.blogspot.com/2012/07/fun-and-games.html</a>  </p>

<p>My speculation, broght to you by my conspiracy brain covered by a generous tinfoil bandana:</p>

<p>The Spanish Election was crucial to the &quot;coalition&quot; of countries fighting in Iraq, the neocon flagship project at that time.</p>

<p>Spanish general election, 2004, Wikipedia.   (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_general_election,_2004">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_general_election,_2004</a>)</p>

<p>There were two main forces fighting for power in the 2004 Spanish election, the Leftists and the Centre Right (typical European system of multiple parties and alliances).</p>

<p>The Leftists were opposed to the Spanish participation in the Iraq war, and simply put wanted to withdraw Spanish troops and other assets from that conflict.</p>

<p>The old &#39;Domino Theory&#39;, where if one domino falls, others follow - in this case, withdraw from the support for the neocon war in Iraq.</p>

<p>The Centre Right party, if they won (as was expected), would keep the Spanish troops in Iraq and keep the Spanish flag in the &#39;Coalition of the Willing&#39;.</p>

<p>After the 9/11 incident, Americans bayed for revenge and were easily manipulated into taking &quot;revenge&quot; on a country which had nothing to do with the 9/11 event - Iraq.</p>

<p>The country united behind the president and party in power and unanimously supported every decision without question.</p>

<p>It was a close election, and the Centre right party and its leader needed some help, in order to win, as (2004 Madrid train bombings Wiki):</p>

<p>The bombings occurred three days before general elections in which incumbent José María Aznar&#39;s PP was defeated, despite its small but narrowing lead in opinion polls.</p>

<p>However, the powers that be miscalculated the European mindset, and</p>

<p>In a result which defied most predictions, the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers&#39; Party (PSOE), led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, won a plurality of seats in Congress of Deputies, and was able to form a government with the support of minor parties. The socialists received more votes than expected as a result of the government&#39;s handling of the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. In the early moments following the attacks, the national government maintained the theory of the ETA responsibility; when evidence pointed to the possibility that an Islamic extremist group was behind the massacre, the ETA theory lost weight. If Islamic extremists were responsible, the attack could have been perceived by the electorate to be a consequence of the Spanish government&#39;s support of the invasion of Iraq. One of the explanations for the PSOE votes was that a certain number of voters, known as the original non voters (who did not intend to vote in the elections like in prior elections), went to the polls for PSOE. Also many members of United Left (IU) switched sides and enlarged the PSOE votes and decreased those of IU.</p>

<p>The incumbent and his party had a small lead, but it was narrowing, but unfortunately for the (nameless to protect the guilty) bumbling intelligence agency assessment and prediction, the bombing galvanized the Spanish not into American style revenge mindset (&#39;Let&#39;s bomb some ay-rabs!&#39;) but into a cowardly, scared, petulant population, not willing to support a military venture with money and soldier lives that had nothing to do with Spanish nation&#39;s interests.</p>

<p>But the &#39;Domino Effect&#39; was spot on, as the &#39;Coalition of the Willing&#39; disintegrated in 2004:</p>

<p>Multi-National Force – Iraq, Wikipedia:</p>

<p>2004 withdrawals</p>

<p>Dominican Republic — 302 troops withdrawn by the end of May 2004, shortly after Spain and Honduras withdrew their contingents, citing growing domestic opposition and the fall from power of PRD candidate Hipolito Mejia and the election of center-left PLD candidate Leonel Fernandez to the presidency in 2004. The decision to withdraw came just two days after President Mejia promised to keep the troops in Iraq until the expiration of their mandate in August. Dominican troops were under constant mortar attacks but suffered no casualties. While in Iraq, the troops were under Spanish command (South East Iraq).</p>

<p>Honduras — 368 troops withdrawn by the end of May 2004 along with Spain&#39;s contingent, citing that the troops were sent there for reconstruction, not combat. While in Iraq, the troops were part of the Spanish led Plus Ultra Brigade in South East Iraq.</p>

<p>Hungary — Hungary&#39;s contingent of 300 transportation troops had begun arriving home in Budapest from Iraq on December 22, 2004, reported by the AFP. All of Hungary&#39;s troops were reported by the Defence Ministry to have left Iraq by the end of that day. While in Iraq, one Hungarian soldier was killed in an insurgent attack.</p>

<p>Iceland — Iceland had a total of three troops, including two Explosive Ordnance Disposal experts, a medical advisor, and some transport experts assigned to the Danish unit immediately after the occupation began; they have since been withdrawn.</p>

<p>New Zealand — Two rotations of 61 military engineers, known as Task Force Rake, operated in Iraq from September 26, 2003 to September 25, 2004. They were deployed to undertake humanitarian and reconstruction tasks consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1483; they were not part of the invading force. While in Iraq the unit was under British command (South East Iraq) and was based in Basra.</p>

<p>Nicaragua — 230 troops left in February 2004, no replacement, attributed to financial reasons. While in Iraq, the troops were under Spanish command.</p>

<p>Philippines — 51 medics, engineers and other troops led by Jovito Palparan were withdrawn on July 14, 2004 in response to the kidnapping of a truck driver. When the hostage takers&#39; demands were met (the withdrawal of Filipino troops from Iraq), the hostage was released. While in Iraq, the troops were under Polish command (Central South Iraq). During that time, three Filipino soldiers were wounded in an insurgent attack, although none died.</p>

<p>Spain — had 1,300 troops (mostly assigned to policing duties) in Najaf and commanded, through the Plus Ultra Brigade, the troops of Honduras, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and of Nicaragua. Newly elected Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero fulfilled one of his campaign pledges and declared the end of the mission on April 28, 2004 with the withdrawal of the last 260 troops. While in Iraq, Spain lost 11 military personnel: ten killed in insurgent attacks and one in an accident.</p>

<p>Thailand — Withdrawal of the last 100 troops from Thailand&#39;s 423-strong humanitarian contingent was completed on September 10, 2004, in accordance with Thailand&#39;s mandate in Iraq, which expired in September. Thailand lost two soldiers in Iraq in an insurgent attack.</p>

<p>Simply put, the 2004 Madrid bombings had the opposite effect of what was intended.</p>

<p>This ends the rampant, tin foil speculation of yours truly.</p>

<p>FYI, this is one of my best articles when I used to give a shit.</p>

<p>ISIS is a sunni mercenary group that is basically a consolidated al quaeda,  fighting against shiites and kurds in what likely eventually be redistrictee as greater kurdistan. Hezbollah is probably the only thing standing in their way,  but they are threatening both lebanon and iran.

<p>You might be absolutely correct and crusade is the correct way to put it. It&#39;s always Muslims that do everything and they&#39;ve made them into villains so that they can be attacked. The whole Israel and Palestine conflict is probably leading up to a crusade.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany is interesting to watch. An attack here would seem a lot less likely than in France or England. I&#39;m not sure if there are a lot of people on this subreddit from West Europe, but countries like France have had serious problems with integration of Muslims into society for decades. This is what we are told lies behind the attacks. People drift away from society, finding no connection with their values and radicalise because in these groups they feel like they belong somewhere. Now, Germany also has a huge Muslim population, but integration here has worked much better. There are loads of Turkish immigrants, and they generally adapted better to Western society. Therefore I would find an attack in Germany hard to believe. Also I think taking Australia into account is dumb because that seemed more like a crazy individual than organized terrorism.</p>

Many people wouldn&#39;t buy a car from a used car dealership because &quot;those people are probably dishonest scammers who will try and fuck me over&quot;.

<p>It&#39;s a mental disconnect. I guess people can handle the idea of a crooked salesman because it&#39;s something you can deal with. Maybe the idea of a bunch of crooked people in positions of power is just so uncomfortable to think about that it can cause many people to subconsciously choose to believe something else.</p>

Every poll taken in Canada links the attack to mental illness, regardless of the person&#39;s personal beliefs. The issue I see is that for some reason people instantly want to take out all muslims because a couple douchebags took a life. Think people, stop wanting to go to war over small (albeit tragic) things. Yes it is insane that this happened, it would be more insane to have anyone but the people directly responsible brought to justice. Killing hundreds of Islamic people will only further the cause of the few moronic Islamic extremists and bolster their numbers.

<p>You also speak of them as if they were suicide attackers, expecting to be identified posthumously, which wasn&#39;t the case.  Anyone who intentionally leaves behind ID and survives is begging for a manhunt.  Was being hunted part of their plan?</p>

<p>If they wanted to be caught, then why did they leave?</p>

<p>Maybe we will see them get Jack Ruby&#39;d?  So inconvenient if they&#39;re alive to testify.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, &quot;conveniently-dropped ID&quot; is like a hack screenwriter&#39;s trope from bad movies.  We&#39;ve seen it before with Van Der Lubbe &amp; Satam Suqami, and it&#39;s a joke for us to be expected to NOT notice that we&#39;ve seen it before.  Don&#39;t they have better script writers?</p>

<p>Which begs the question of why debunkers such as yourself suddenly appear with previously unseen participation on this subreddit to model such stunning gullibility and non-skepticism when it comes to believing that all hapless, incompetent terrorists magically have the same &quot;dropped ID&quot; technique, and that we should believe it, every time, without noticing we&#39;ve seen it before.</p>

<p>The suspects were named on the news because one of their IDs was left in the car.

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen the video of them on the street shooting the officer and then getting into the car, is that the one you mean? You can see some of the skin around their eyes, and it does look lighter on the spectrum, but not so much that I could say conclusively. Also, Algerians have fairly light brown skin compared to Arabs.</p>

<p>Is there a particular section of video which you feel shows their whiteness?</p>

<p>I feel the evidence that it was these two brothers is highly sketchy at best, but the video evidence does not, to me, indicate the shooters were &quot;white,&quot; which is a fairly nebulous term to begin with.</p>

<p>-They were killing cartoonists by name and let her live.</p>

<p>-Suspect number three was at school during the event.</p>

<p>-Reports of emergency services at the scene in waiting.</p>

<p>The police is looking for 3 people, one is said to be the driver although the video clearly shows that they are only two.</p>

<p>The third person allegedly helped prepare the attack. Or provided the means necessary to get away. Or whatever. He turned himself in when he saw that he was being sought so this suggests he doesn&#39;t know why he is being wanted. He was at school during the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The offensive cartoon was published in 2011, why attack now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, they continued publishing cartoons of Mohammed. Like <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ByxVESkIgAAkGUl.jpg:large">this one</a> from last october. They continued publishing Mohammed and islamic cartoons the last few years. They had been getting increasing threats for a while now.</p>

<p>They hijacked another car quickly. It isn&#39;t impossible. It&#39;s no inconsistency.</p>

<p>Man, we better show our faces huh. Why even try getting away then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suspects are identified thanks to an identity card found in an abandonned vehicle. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They quickly hijacked another car. Everything had to happen quick. Also apparently they found molotovcocktails and flags in that car as well. They weren&#39;t as meticulous as some of you guys like to think. </p>

<p>The suspects are known by the police for coming back from Syria.</p>

<p>Source? Also, why is this an inconsistency?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Charlie Hebdo reporter told that the attackers had to have been informed that the editorial meeting was taking place, otherwise there are not many people on the premises because the journalists from Charlie Hebdo only gather in their Paris office once per week.</p>

<p>Yes, like pretty much every other news outlet. If they had one fixed date, it&#39;s not that hard to find out, is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright let&#39;s answer this point by point: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The third person they were looking for gave himself up to the police because he was innocent and had proof of this. He was probably part of the suspects because he had been linked to them by intelligence which turned out to be wrong. </p></li>
<li><p>These men were known by the French justice system, one of them had been in jail and the other was known to have gone to Syria. Planning a terrorist attack and acquiring assault rifles without raising suspicions when you know you&#39;re being watched probably takes some time. </p></li>
<li><p>They had been under protection for a long time and the last attack had happened a long time ago. It&#39;s possible they decided to downsize because the threat had abated. It&#39;s also possible the terrorists had been watching the office for a while and noticed the car no longer being there, which might have triggered the attack, also explaining why they waited this long to attack. </p></li>
<li><p>They were in and out pretty fast (under 5 minutes). They changed their clothes. They changed cars. Unlike in movies where a flashy car chase looks better, in a case like this it&#39;s not uncommon for the perpetrators to initially get away and be caught later.</p></li>
<li><p>They don&#39;t want to be caught by the police. They were hoping they would get away with this, hence the masks. Allahu Akbar to make sure everyone knows who&#39;s responsible for the crime and what happens to people who insult the prophet. That didn&#39;t quite work out for them.</p></li>
<li><p>They were in a car accident and changed clothes. It&#39;s pretty likely he either left the ID in the clothes he changed in or it was knocked somewhere in the crash and he forgot about it in his hurry to change car. </p></li>
<li><p>They say they found a copy of the ID card on Facebook. When the police released the names they probably did a google search for images and found it. </p></li>
<li><p>One of them did. The other was put in jail before he could leave. I don&#39;t understand how that&#39;s an inconsistency. You can&#39;t arrest everyone that returns from Syria. </p></li>
<li><p>A couple of weeks of watching people entering and leaving the office would yield that information. If you&#39;re planning a major terrorist attack, spending a bit of time watching the place seems like pretty standard practice. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is false. The evidence they were fake was that <strong>none of them show any beheadings</strong> (at least the first four were blatantly edited to not show the actual beheading).</p>

<p>And SITE, a private, US-Corporation, is the only source if the videos.</p>

<p>No, the way that these fellas apparently spoke perfect French by saying they &quot;avenged Prophet Muhammad&quot; and they admitted they were &quot;al-Qaeda in Yemen,&quot; are why this event is being discussed as possibly being illegitimate.  Stop moving goalposts. Some of us are still paying attention.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Just because 2 were on video? What if there was a 3rd lookout? Regardless, 3 turned into 11 shortly after. And as in every situation like that, there&#39;s a lot of initial confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Attacks like this take a lot of time/money to prepare, and 2011 wasn&#39;t their last offensive publication on Islam. </p></li>
<li><p>After a long period of time of not receiving any threats, police tend to downsize, rather than use up all their resources. </p></li>
<li><p>Because it&#39;s France. They&#39;re not used to criminals carrying AK47&#39;s around like in America. </p></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>wear masks and don&#39;t want to be identified.
.. Well, no shit, why would they want to be identified?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>What does this have to do with anything? </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not Top Secret after they shoot 12 people and are now being hunted. </p></li>
<li><p>But what can the police do? The muslims are calling the race card more often than African Americans. </p></li>
<li><p>This information can EASILY be found out by anyone with a little <em>Social Engineering</em>.</p></li>

The biggest inconsistencies that remains are the fact that they only were identified thanks to an id card forgotten in the stolen car (very fishy). And the suicide of police commissioner Helric Fredou who shot himself dead after making a report to a police meeting on the Charlie Hebdo case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The police is looking for 3 people, one is said to be the driver although the video clearly shows that they are only two.&quot;</p>

<p>The 3rd &quot;driver&quot; actually turned out to be some 18 yr old kid who was in school at the time and a bunch of his classmates corraborated the story. How the heck this kid&#39;s name came up in the first place, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>How did the killers manage to get away without being caught by the police?</p>

<p>This is what has been bugging me actually. If you look at their getaway route on google maps it is ridiculous to think they would have actually planned it. The alley street is very narrow and the boulevard they turn into only goes one way. Do a street view on google maps and you&#39;ll see. Police could have easily blocked the alleyway. Somehow the suspects managed to elude police for the next 2 days after that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...5.  If they &quot;wanted their affiliations known&quot; then there are more direct ways than an ID, which is not an &quot;affiliation card&quot;.</p>

<p>You also speak of them as if they were suicide attackers, expecting to be identified posthumously, which wasn&#39;t the case.  Anyone who intentionally leaves behind ID and survives is begging for a manhunt.  Was being hunted part of their plan?</p>

<p>If they wanted to be caught, then why did they leave?</p>

<p>Maybe we will see them get Jack Ruby&#39;d?  So inconvenient if they&#39;re alive to testify.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, &quot;conveniently-dropped ID&quot; is like a hack screenwriter&#39;s trope from bad movies.  We&#39;ve seen it before with Van Der Lubbe &amp; Satam Suqami, and it&#39;s a joke for us to be expected to NOT notice that we&#39;ve seen it before.  Don&#39;t they have better script writers?</p>

<p>Which begs the question of why debunkers such as yourself suddenly appear with previously unseen participation on this subreddit to model such stunning gullibility and non-skepticism when it comes to believing that all hapless, incompetent terrorists magically have the same &quot;dropped ID&quot; technique, and that we should believe it, every time, without noticing we&#39;ve seen it before.</p>
