    <div class="md"><p>The Internet is fully militarized. I know it&#39;s a mega buzzword, a meme and all the rage the days these days, but people with experience in information security since long before it was the cool new thing for ever adolescent male on the Internet to pretend like he knows about. Back to the point. The Internet, the public Internet, is fully militarized. It has been now for half a decade. There were early signs of this back in the 07&#39;-08&#39; era, but it wasn&#39;t until the 09&#39;-10&#39; when it really b became apparent what was happening. IMO the early examples of the the public information warfare campaigns associated with this militarization started by targeting Wikipedia. Yes, this idea of shills and web brigades and the whole is a meme in and of itself at this point, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real/true. Useful idiots are everywhere. </p>

<p>There are two types and two classes of people in these places which can arranged in a matrix.. Honest/dishonest and informed/uninformed. There are useful idiots who genially don&#39;t know any better. And you have to put yourself in their shoes. If your entire exposure to a given subject was their exposure.. for example mostly everything you Average American knows about the world and other human beings he learned through corporate media. If all I knew about <em>x</em> was what the corporate media says, then what would be my position? These are honest uninformed people. On the opposite end you have people that know the facts about a given thing, but are boldly dishonest about it. Most of these people are shills, sock puppets, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true. The early Internet, before the web, ie no HTML web sites, was all about information sharing. Pretty much everyone who was online back in those days was 2 things, a.) an adult and b.) very technologically literate. In stark contrast to the internet of today is dominated by the web infested with technologically illiterate adolescents. The web was invented, HTML 1.0, Lynx, all that good stuff.. Some people made web sites while the rest of us cynics laughed at this whole new &quot;web&quot; thing thinking it was doomed to fail. The biggest security threat on the early Internet was basically hobbyist hackers doing their thing. Think of the Morris worm for example. Eventually the corporations moved in. Once that happened shit really started to take off. Enter eCommerce. Enter grandma and that snot nose kid next door. This is the beginning of the end. With all that money comes Internet criminals trying to steal and scam it. These hackers continue to develop their skills. They make more money and invest in more sophisticated attacks. By the late 1990&#39;s or early 2000&#39;s the Internet started to become militarized. However it wasn&#39;t until about 2007 or so that the full blown information warfare style manipulations of social media really blew up. The primary threat actors on the net today are nation state sponsored. That doesn&#39;t mean the criminals aren&#39;t still doing their thing, and it doesn&#39;t mean the hobbyist aren&#39;t still doing their thing, but they&#39;re in the background now as far as threats the Internet at large faces. Today is an age of a new Manhattan project. The same vigor nation states applied in developing nuclear weapons in the context of kinetic war is being applied to developing &#39;end-game&#39; cyber weapons. As they said in the Matrix, &quot;Welcome to the real world.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you understand what is meant by the phrase &quot;militarization&quot; as it applies here. Just because the military funded the creation of the Internet doesn&#39;t mean that the Internet was militarized. Do you understand what is meant when one refers to the Internet being militarized? The fundamental technological capacity for such militarization of the Internet wasn&#39;t even close to existing back in those days and has only become a reality in past decade or so. We&#39;re talking about fully automated mass-scale surveillance, attack tools and malware, information warfare like censorship or manipulation, etc. Military funding is also responsible for just about everything else you see in the world in so far as science and technology goes. Did you not catch any of the Snowden leaks? Read about the mass scale automated exploitation the US government has deployed against the Internet at large? That&#39;s militarization of the Internet and it barely existed 10 years ago, much less back in early 90&#39;s when the www was born and certainly not during the days before then. The early Internet was about research and information sharing, not about espionage and command/control of a nation&#39;s critical infrastructure and/or asset control systems.  Especially since that infrastructure and control systems didn&#39;t even exist yet.. </p>

<p>That should clear things up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if the full truth of terrorism was ever revealed, people would be astonished to find out who was actually in charge. I&#39;ve heard some pretty good theories about all kinds of terrorist attacks going all the way back to Europe in the 1970&#39;s.</p>

<p>You want to get rid of some pesky political opposition, have them get hit/kidnapped by some &quot;terrorists&quot; that actually work for you. You want to get public support for government surveillance or for going to war? Terrorism!</p>

<p>If you subtracted MI6, Mossad and the CIA from the world, I bet that would eliminate the majority of the world&#39;s terror groups. Al Qaeda, ISIS and most of the Syrian opposition groups would go &quot;poof&quot;. Maidan and MH17 would never have happened either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. Sometimes I entertain the idea that people are inherently good and that most of the people who aren&#39;t are too lazy or incompetent to actually back up their threats.</p>

<p>For example. Nobody killed Bush. Nobody killed Obama. In a country of over 300 million, with people foaming at the mouth about assassinating these leaders, it never happened.</p>

<p>Why, because the common people are not capable, for the most part, of doing it. Its just a theory, but it would explain why so many of the terrorist events on the world can be tied back to sketchy organizations with government/superpower ties.</p>

<p>Its like we reached a point where people are no longer that capable of performing international violence (due to a number of factors), so The Powers That Be have been forced to manufacture it.</p>

<p>I mean, think about the current state of the US. We are watching our country get destroyed by money and we are more aware of it than ever. But the common people just have too many other things going on in their lives to do anything extreme about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really good point. Why has no one actually become angry enough to take out a particularly despised &quot;representative&quot;? Why have there not been any real terrorists? I don&#39;t get it. Wouldn&#39;t a member of an oppressed race or religion, if their adopted government was murdering millions of their countrymen back home, meanwhile turning public sentiment against people of their race/religion, go totally ballistic?</p>

<p>Sure, they say peaceful protest is more effective, but where does the restraint come from? I find it difficult to believe that no one has cracked yet.</p>

<p>Then when we get these very convenient attacks, they go after a bunch of cartoonists. Wtf? Why do that? Why not go and shoot some corrupt politician or anyone else who is far more likely to be involved in your oppression.</p>

<p>What kind of world would it be if any politician who advocated/voted for war in the middle east actually wound up dead? Isn&#39;t that how spies/paramilitary orgs would actually go about getting people out of the middle east? Don&#39;t they even have access to suicide bombers? Wouldn&#39;t it be pretty easy to kill anyone if you had no fear for your own life? Especially in America where you can carry a gun.</p>

<p>So many things that don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>No, but the ideas of a representative sample of a population reveal information about the entire population as an aggregate. By and large, every time one of these shootings occurs, a relatively large number of threads appear to label it a false flag, and they are generally upvoted and heavily discussed. So on the aggregate, this sub does seem to uncritically apply the false flag label to every major incident of violence. Your making the mistake of trying to apply these (valid) aggregate conclusions onto individiuals in a population. </p>

<p>Half hour or so of designing methodology, hour or two of data collection, half-hour of analysis and hypothesis testing or so. I like looking at interesting statistics though, so I wouldn&#39;t classify it as work. There is of course no guarantee that the results would support my notion that the sub is very supportive of labeling most major tragedies a false flag. That&#39;s what makes this such a worthwhile endeavor. We&#39;d actually be learning things about the community. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve obviously never worked with statistics. I don&#39;t need names attached to find a populations weight distribution, and I certainly don&#39;t need them to gauge this subreddits distribution of opinion on a subject. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m really tempted to write a bot in python to scrape data on subreddits. That could lead to some very interesting problems in computational sentiment analysis, and who knows, maybe the end result would be you could point to the results and say that &quot;objectively, conspiracy is not in fact anti-semetic&quot; every time the accusation pops up. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they do, but believe it or not, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">mathematics</a> behind quantifying these things. It&#39;s a burgeoning field (and an incredibly interesting one, I might add), no doubt, but it can be done. You&#39;re denying that meaningful statistics can be pulled from anonymous opinions flies in the face of work a lot of very smart people have been doing. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If it happens infrequently, it would be strongly outweighed by all the genuine posts on the subreddit, so it wouldn&#39;t affect the accuracy of the results at all. Afterwards, we could even calculate how many &quot;shitposts&quot; would need to be in the analysis to throw it off, and by how much, using uncertainty quantification. So, sure, there may be error bars at the end of the analysis, but their usually are for most meaningful statistics. </p>

<p>The wikipedia article isn&#39;t the most comprehensive look at the subject. Check out the <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli">Journal of Computational Linguistics</a>. All of it&#39;s articles are free, and it has papers on detecting sarcasm and other statements that actually reflect the opposite of what may semantically be being said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So basically it comes down to a persons opinion, not an objective analysis, as corroborated here:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no objective meaning in linguistics at all, which is what the article is making reference to. The next part you highlight is incredibly important:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is usually measured by precision and recall. However, according to research human raters typically agree 79%[29] of the time (see Inter-rater reliability).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If two people claim that a statement has different sentiment, which of them is objectively right? The computer is designed to do as good as humans are because themselves can&#39;t agree. And because language only exists inasmuch humans agree it does, it can&#39;t possibly beat them at it. </p>

<p>In any case, you can do an objective analysis of the statistical distribution of set of subjective data. Movie scores are an example of that. Movies can&#39;t be objectively bad, but you can measure a population&#39;s opinion on them and determine if most people think they are bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further, the whole area of study seems shaky and narrow in scope:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was 6 years ago when the article making that claim was written, but like I said, it&#39;s a brand new field that makes leaps and bounds every year. Seriously, check out the MIT journal I linked above. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s definitely a reddit stereotype here, represented by actual users who are, in fact, mentally ill, very young, and lack logical reasoning. And yes, there&#39;s a good couple dozens of Jew-haters. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s also a crazy amount of trolls and brigades, users posing as conspiracy users, and often fooling even the mods. </p>

<p>Well, I have the relevant educational background, a Matlab personal license, and Numpy/Scipy to help me manage something like this. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know which way the analysis would go; if I did, why would I go through all the effort to do it. I have a hunch, but I wouldn&#39;t put money on it. You can even help me design the experiment so you can&#39;t scream &quot;methodological flaw&quot; afterwards.</p>

Most we see on TV or newspapers are half truth at best. 1/4 million people are good sign that others are &quot;awake or at least curious enough to want to inform their selves of other points of view.  I am still not sure what happened with 911 but 1 thing I&#39;m sure of I we are not being told the TRUTH about what really happened.  The same sword we use to cut to the BS from news is also used to cut the BS from this sub and at least consider if even part of what we see here is true it&#39;s still not good.    The facts that come out here, more so the facts in history books and FOIA fact sheets in themselves are reason alone to ask more questions and not trust the answers the mainstream media, politicians, police or organized religion feeds us.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always find it amusing to watch TV news after reading about the stories and reading actual journalist investigations. The news covers only 5% of the story. There&#39;s never any context. It&#39;s just a smear campaign or a hidden agenda to get people to only think about one aspect of the event. </p>

<p>TV News: &quot;Group A attacks group B in place C.&quot;</p>

<p>Why? <strong>What?</strong> <strong>Where?</strong> <strong>When?</strong> (Who?)</p>

<p>In grade school we were taught to elaborate and form a complete story. The news doesn&#39;t follow this model. They always leave out the most important W&#39;s.</p>

<p>Average viewer, &quot;Those dirty Muslims attacked a Western nation!&quot;</p>

<p>And the beautiful part for big media is that they can&#39;t really know who or why so they get to report in a legitimate and knee jerk fashion what they do know. And the people develop the same knee jerk reaction. This is the problem with globalism in news. Inciting hatred is illegal except if your big business and the people being hated aren&#39;t &quot;us&quot;.</p>

It&#39;s a very useful knee-jerk that the majority of the population doesn&#39;t realize they have. </p>

<p>Broken logic everywhere in anti-intellectual society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that the &quot;false flag&quot; posts are routinely at the top tells us that much of the readership agrees.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s kind of an embarrassment.</p>

<p>But, then again, I think that a large percentage of the posters here are dimwit antiSemites with the education of a glass of water and the critical thinking abilities to show for it. </p>

<p>So why do I check a couple times a week? Because the conspiracy theory world has, over the 20 years I&#39;ve been looking at it, sometimes been dead on, and weeks or months ahead of the curve. Most of the time it&#39;s just dumb and wrong. But sometimes the ignorance and cynicism of this subculture, which sees sinister doings in every news story, is actually really useful for exposing something closer to the truth. It&#39;s more than &quot;right twice a day.&quot; It&#39;s actually right a pretty sizable minority of the time. Not enough to use as your main source, but a very good jumping off point for further thought and inquiry. </p>

<p>Back in the 90s, the brother of a friend was a kind of weird recluse who lived in the woods and wrote a conspiracy &#39;zine, lie Mel Gibson in <em>Conspiracy Theory.</em> One night when he was driving home to his place, on the dark rural road there, he was waved over by some guys in suits. They beat him so badly he is permanently disabled, partially because he was afraid to go to the hospital after that and just treated his injuries himself. He never knew who he pissed off, but he knew it was someone dangerous.</p>

<p>Now, &quot;brother of a friend of some dude on the internet&quot; is pretty much the definition of an urban legend, so I definitely recommend taking my story as a grain of salt, but it&#39;s been clear to me that there are things afoot at all times that we&#39;re not supposed to know about. It&#39;s worth keeping an eye out for incongruities. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t make everything a false flag. I&#39;m pretty sure that 3 French radicalized dipshits shot up a magazine staff because they didn&#39;t like some pictures they drew. I also think that Islamists flew those planes into those towers, and that the burning jet fuel was enough to bring the buildings down as they did because of the weird construction of those buildings. </p>

<p>But I also think the US government knew all about it and let it happen. </p>

<p>And you would be wrong. As I have already stated countless times, that is an illusion.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;readership&quot;, there is a constant changing influx of different people upvoting different things on different days. Also , some things are upvoted to 500, some are upvoted to 3000+, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying but still; when I first got into this sub it was about conspiracies like UFO&#39;s, illuminati, shit like that. Fun stuff that seemed to have a grain of truth. Even the 9/11 stuff was interesting to chew on. All this crisis actor stuff and &quot;they&#39;re doing it to take our guns&quot; bullshit is just depressing, impossible to believe and in my opinion has taken all the excitement out of it. And by excitement I mean the feeling I used to get as a kid reading about bigfoot and the Bermuda triangle and things like that. The &quot;everything is a false flag&quot; has indeed muddied the waters of what this sub used to be like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. Sometimes I entertain the idea that people are inherently good and that most of the people who aren&#39;t are too lazy or incompetent to actually back up their threats.</p>

<p>For example. Nobody killed Bush. Nobody killed Obama. In a country of over 300 million, with people foaming at the mouth about assassinating these leaders, it never happened.</p>

<p>Why, because the common people are not capable, for the most part, of doing it. Its just a theory, but it would explain why so many of the terrorist events on the world can be tied back to sketchy organizations with government/superpower ties.</p>

<p>Its like we reached a point where people are no longer that capable of performing international violence (due to a number of factors), so The Powers That Be have been forced to manufacture it.</p>

<p>I mean, think about the current state of the US. We are watching our country get destroyed by money and we are more aware of it than ever. But the common people just have too many other things going on in their lives to do anything extreme about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true. The early Internet, before the web, ie no HTML web sites, was all about information sharing. Pretty much everyone who was online back in those days was 2 things, a.) an adult and b.) very technologically literate. In stark contrast to the internet of today is dominated by the web infested with technologically illiterate adolescents. The web was invented, HTML 1.0, Lynx, all that good stuff.. Some people made web sites while the rest of us cynics laughed at this whole new &quot;web&quot; thing thinking it was doomed to fail. The biggest security threat on the early Internet was basically hobbyist hackers doing their thing. Think of the Morris worm for example. Eventually the corporations moved in. Once that happened shit really started to take off. Enter eCommerce. Enter grandma and that snot nose kid next door. This is the beginning of the end. With all that money comes Internet criminals trying to steal and scam it. These hackers continue to develop their skills. They make more money and invest in more sophisticated attacks. By the late 1990&#39;s or early 2000&#39;s the Internet started to become militarized. However it wasn&#39;t until about 2007 or so that the full blown information warfare style manipulations of social media really blew up. The primary threat actors on the net today are nation state sponsored. That doesn&#39;t mean the criminals aren&#39;t still doing their thing, and it doesn&#39;t mean the hobbyist aren&#39;t still doing their thing, but they&#39;re in the background now as far as threats the Internet at large faces. Today is an age of a new Manhattan project. The same vigor nation states applied in developing nuclear weapons in the context of kinetic war is being applied to developing &#39;end-game&#39; cyber weapons. As they said in the Matrix, &quot;Welcome to the real world.&quot; </p>
