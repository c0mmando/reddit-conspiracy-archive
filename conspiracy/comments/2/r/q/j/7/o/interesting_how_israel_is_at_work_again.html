<p>I noticed this: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2rpfj4/in_light_of_recent_events_in_france/">http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2rpfj4/in_light_of_recent_events_in_france/</a></p>

<p>Note the 3500+ points for the post itself and the first comment with 800 points. The other comments only have 70, 8 or even less points than that.</p>

<p>So the theory that it is actually Israel behind the attack is quite plausible, seeing how France voted agains Israel two days ago.</p>

there were two police officers killed. But you only know about the muslim one, precisely because it is bullshit to claim that nobody wants to talk about it. His death and religion are headline news across the world.</p>

<p>infinitely better evidence than what exists for the claim that it was israel.
Also, i dont deny that suspects have been identified. We even have their names (which of course are Muslim names). Im aware that al quaeda had already stated their desire to kill the editor, and that Muslims have already firebombed their offices in the past, threatened them, and threatened and killed other cartoonists. Motive is clear, and evidence suggests made explicity clear: &quot;muhammed has been avenged.&quot;</p>

This may mean cutting your allegiance to your beliefs for a few seconds, which is hard but worth it.  The first belief you must tackle, is that the media is on your side and telling you the truth 100% of the time.  The second belief you must confront is your ability to argue and make solid points.

<p>You&#39;ll always be a servile nit-wit because you are incapable of absorbing and assimilating information on your own without somebody handing it to you. It&#39;s why you&#39;re perfectly content to believe that it <em>must</em> have been some muslims just because someone found an ID in the car and they shouted &quot;allahu akbar&quot; while they were shooting people.</p>

<p>People in this sub do not buy into that story so easily because we read about previous conspiracies / deceptions / political agendas that correlate with the darker side of political maneuvering, namely, the unethical manipulation of public opinion for certain ends.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t interested in finding this shit out on your own, don&#39;t expect us to treat you like a fucking child and hand it to you on a silver platter. You&#39;ll get nothing but down votes and ridicule.</p>

<p>Who gives a fuck what you buy into? i was just interested if there was any reason that a person who is not a fucking fool should buy into it. The answer turned out to be &#39;no&#39;.</p>

<p>because you guys are stupid? you think that is a hard thing for me to consider? You may not believe it, but obviously I do. You would have to be pretty stupid to even ask. Obviously i think you&#39;re a bunch of idiots. I have not made it a secret.</p>

<p>My observations are pretty well compatible with my declared theory that you&#39;re a pretty dim bunch.</p>

<p>You think this is good enough evidence to make claims that shooters we&#39;re Muslims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>infinitely better evidence than what exists for the claim that it was israel.
Also, i dont deny that suspects have been identified. We even have their names (which of course are Muslim names). Im aware that al quaeda had already stated their desire to kill the editor, and that Muslims have already firebombed their offices in the past, threatened them, and threatened and killed other cartoonists. Motive is clear, and evidence suggests made explicity clear: &quot;muhammed has been avenged.&quot;</p>
