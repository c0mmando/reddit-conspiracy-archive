        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was hoping someone else would make a post like this, but since it didn&#39;t happen I will.</p>

<p>A few days ago the top 2 posts within this subreddit was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2r5tie/deranged_obama_slaps_more_sanctions_on_north/">Deranged Obama slaps more sanctions on North Korea after Sony hack that wasn&#39;t done by North Korea!</a></li>
</ol>

<p>and</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2r5dvr/is_this_a_joke_obama_seems_to_be_the_only_one_who/">Is This a Joke: Obama seems to be the only one who didn&#39;t get the memo that North Korea didn&#39;t do it</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Many sources are now claiming that FBI has proof, including such basic ones that IP addressing that directly incriminates North Korea. So the FBI says so, the government says so and is acting upon it and as we know the hackers only demands was in the interest of North Korea.. No money demands.. Just &quot;Don&#39;t show it&quot;</p>

<p>I think even the most skeptical ones can at this point say its likely it was in fact North Korea sponsored cyber crimes.</p>

<p>Some conspiracies are obv real with legitimate Merits, but unfortunately some opinions or assumptions gets put within the same category. This takes away focus and credibility from the real issues, such as privacy and corporate and political corruption which is so important to reveal for all of our futures.</p>

<p>I wish r/conspiracy/ members were more fact focused and selective with what it gives the spotlight to and not upvoting loaded posts based on pure personal emotions, opinions and/or at best guesswork.</p>

<p>By not doing so, it directly harms the important issues of the day which so many are blind to and also it directly plays into the hands of the very people who are actually involved in conspiracies.</p>

<p>statements like &quot;deranged obama&quot; etc while drawing conclusions a subject with basically ZERO insight, is embarrassing for any skeptical thinker. What makes anyone here think they are in a better position than Obama to draw conclusions on this? How do anyone here know who hacked Sony? And even so, who cares about a stupid movie, why give it this much attention?</p>

<p>To no ones surprise it turns out it was North Korea after all, easily proven by novice mistakes repeatedly made. Surprisingly it turns out that our government who basically spies on everyone is able solve a cyber crime of national interest...</p>

<p>If there is any &quot;conspiracy&quot; worth attention here, its the fact that after all these sanctions and demonizing of North Korea over the years, they have all these years until now been allowed to use the US banking system to sell and buy weapons!..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has the &quot;evidence&quot; been publicized? I dont follow this particular story, to be honest. But i do know that sometimes, when a theory (such as the one you are blasting) seems to be obviously wrong, or whatever, but you still have theorists saying the official story isnt right, its not because the theorists are stupid, or arrogant. </p>

<p>Sometimes they cant convey their thoughts clearly, but a lot of the time its about the issue that (for example, this FBI dude you speak of) someone high in power says something, but doesnt <em>actually</em> show the evidence.</p>

<p>You see, conspiracy theories arise because the People dont trust their government. And when the top guys in government make a claim that results in actions that the People are less than thrilled about, and when they make that claim without providing evidence, it becomes suspicious. </p>

<p>Its literally the top guys are saying, &quot;Trust me. Im a Big Wig. I know North Korea did this because we have evidence that we wont show anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like they had &quot;evidence&quot; of WMDs not too long ago... You see where im going with this?</p>

<p>Of course, there are plenty of folks here who cant take criticism <strong>at all</strong>. But, overall, i think most of the time theres a bug in the official story that would be easily fixed if the Big Wigs would lift a finger and allow the &quot;evidence&quot; to be publicized. And like, immediately. When they dont, its not farfetched to assume they are hiding something...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good point, thanks for valuable input.</p>

<p>I would add to that tho, that in this case we have something more, the fact that their sole motive turned out to be doing damage to Sony and stop a particular movie (as proven by their actions). This removes a lot of variables and by itself is pretty deeming evidence that it was NK sponsored</p>

<p>I agree 100%. </p>

<p>But &quot;sponsored&quot; is different from actually carrying out the attacks... This is what i was trying to get at in my other comment (i hope i wasnt offending you). </p>

<p>It has been proven that those IP&#39;s has been used by North Korea previously. </p>

<p>I think its safe to assume that when the FBI provides public proof for a crime it holds up. I also don&#39;t believe you are better technically adept than the FBI&#39;s cyber crime departments, unfortunately.</p>

<p>are those IP&#39;s the only proof they have? Obv not, but its the one proof that people would understand and it would not hurt future efforts.

<p>Good point, on &quot;why trust&quot; however at this point you can logically say that its reasonable to believe that it was North Korea, based on the fact that 1. The FBI says so and B.

<p>True, all these things <em>indicate</em> that NK was the perpetrator. But, <strong><em>its not proof.</em></strong></p>

<p>Like i said before, i havent been following this story much at all, so i dont know what info is out there, for or against your claim.

<p>This certainly is an issue. Here in r/conspiracy as well as everywhere else in the world. Especially politics. And true, it would be unethical to be dropping names on people (e.g. &quot;deranged Obama,&quot; as you have pointed out), and i dont condone that behavior much when it is based on a claim that hasnt yet been proven either way. </p>

<p>Although i dont like Obama at all, i still gotta call whats fair, fair. In fact, even if all the &quot;obama theories&quot; were to be true, id think that this would make him quite a genius. An asshole, but a genius. But i guess thats a different discussion entirely...</p>

<p>That is not true, send me a link to any credible article showing that the hackers at any time wanted money and I will tip you 1Bitcoin ($285)</p>

<p>From the start their sole motivation was to halt the movie release. They even started off by threatening the Sony staff and a possible &quot;terrorist attack in movie theaters&quot;</p>

<p>Why would any hacker who is after the money start throwing terrorist threats around? sounds incredible illogical.</p>

<p>The malware is signed by them with the same name. It seems likely the two are related (at least as likely as NK involvement based on similar types of evidence).</p>

<p>How can you participate in the discussion without knowing that? All they wanted was the movie not released. No demands for money was made.. Already there the evidence leans heavily towards North Korea</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Proof?</p>

<p>If the hackers wanted money and suddenly the FBI/Gov claimed they were terrorists it would be so easy for them to publicly deny and prove that. They had a direct dialog with media (proof below)</p>

<p>Therefor that is one thing FBI/gov obv cant lie about. Because there is an &quot;unknown&quot; third part with the other half of the convo, By doing so the FBI/gov would set themselves up for failure and being ridiculed.</p>

<p>and as the matter of fact, the hackers did release a lot of info, leaks from the Sony servers, even movie scripts, personal emails along with many statements and badly worded sentences for example via twitter and the hacked Sony websites they controlled.</p>

<p>Not only that they directly communicated their desire to have the movie stopped. So we know 100% that was their desire. To even argue against that at this point is beyond retarded and shows how narrow minded and uninformed you are. Why are you even discussing matter you know nothing about?</p>

<p>Also, as we know a lot of Sonys unreleased movies was released by the hackers, which also further supports the fact that money was not the goal, as it would be the most valuable leverage. </p>

<p>As for the terrorist threat, the hacker group published the following statement to the public: </p>

<p>&quot;We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places “The Interview” be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.
Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.
The world will be full of fear.
Remember the 11th of September 2001.
We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.
(If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.)
Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
All the world will denounce the SONY.&quot;</p>

<p>It could even be argued that the language style is North Korean&#39;ish.</p>

<p>For proof, google those statements and you get 1+ million hits.</p>

<p>That message was released alongside personal Sony emails belonging to the Sony, proving it was a legit message from the hackers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, &quot;The attackers only latched onto &quot;The Interview&quot; after the media did – the film was never mentioned by GOP right at the start of their campaign. It was only after a few people started speculating in the media that this and the communication from DPRK &quot;might be linked&quot; that suddenly it became linked.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could try to find timestamps to prove this, but this is why it&#39;s so funny that you&#39;re getting so upset, I&#39;m not making any claim, yet you keep asking for proof.</p>

<p>My claim is simply that there is no proof that NK did it. Your claim is that NK did it.</p>

<p>I cannot prove a negative, so you&#39;re going to be the one here to offer up some evidence to support your claim.</p>

<p>That quote of yours is from one guy on the internet.. called Mark.</p>

<p>One of the first things the hackers did was request that the movie was stopped. They even threatened terrorist attacks. The hackers communicated this directly with the press. I think its safe to say they wanted the movie stopped... To argue against that is retarded.</p>

<p>And the argument &quot;they first wanted money&quot; like, what does that mean? is your theory they originally wanted money but the press mentioned the movie so then they shift goals from getting rich to stopping a movie? I dont get it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep asking for proofs? I did it one time after your repeatedly asked me to give you links anyone would find after a google search.</p>

<p>There is proof they did it. The malware used directly incriminates them, the cyber investigators are saying they can prove it and NK is the only one with a motive to stop the movie. Even before the hack NK said the movie was &quot;an act of war&quot;</p>

<p>That was a public statement made by NK.</p>

<p>couple weeks later Sony is hacked and the hackers demands is to stop the movie. But no, shadofshadow is on the case, a case of retard.</p>
