    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself why all the answers are in the back of the book. There is a right and wrong, a false dichotomy. Students are more likely to want to know what&#39;s going to be on the test rather than think about the information. There is no incentive to actually learn it&#39;s all in the grade. Essentially grades are just a measure of how well the student jumps through hoops. Multiple choice give me a break. This in it self is weeds out antiauthoritarian types. This is just the tip of the ice burg. School is indoctrination it teaches nationalism, loyalty and blind adherence to orders with swift punishment if they are disobeyed. School where hyperactivity is ADHD and obedience is an A. They drug kids up and they make them sit still when they should be out running in the woods and playing in the rivers. The rigid schedule of school is used to normalize hierarchy, instill groupthink, and mentally condition a nations youth. Private schools train the elite and public the proletariat. I could go on but you hit on something huge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fucked up man. They convince parents that normal behavior like &#39;rough housing&#39; is a symptom. We are animals and school is a cage. Drug the ones who resist and reward those who submit. The way schools are set up is unnatural. I&#39;m dyslexic and was put into a strange room one hour each day as a child where they would watch me write. When I would write a letter or number backwards I would be corrected. I was eventually able to overcome my handicap for the most part with no help form the institution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty of scientific evidence for climate change. </p>

<p>Well it depends on the subject, history does teach critical thinking but can easily be prescribed by the Government. </p>

<p>I would say that people are taught the most likely theory at the time of being taught. It may come out that that theory is bs but at the time it was the best theory with the evidence to hand, science is all about disproving those before you essentially </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an irrelevant point. The correctness of what is taught doesn&#39;t matter. The important thing to look at is how information is presented. In an elaborate false dichotomy. Answers are either right or wrong with no room for conjecture. The possible &quot;third&quot; answer or cause is rarely entertained. Multiple choice leave no room for critical thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes none is needed or possible. Maths the sciences, though what you are taught in science will probably turn out to be wrong the most likely theory is what is taught because you simply do not know enough about science to offer alternate theories. </p>

<p>For subjects like English, history, the essay subjects, you can put things forward as long as you support them with evidence. Sadly exams rely on technique. I remember in a lower year in history we were shown a documentary about the gunpowder plot being staged and had to make up out minds as to whether we agreed with the documentary. I agreed because the evidence was solid</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was alternative evidence available? Or was your only point of reference the traditional narrative? Hmm. Being an American I only have a survey level understanding of the fifth of November. But those stylistic demerits are designed to make you get good at jumping through hoops. Grammer and punctuation are important but when their importance overshadows context the student is encouraged to regurgitate what they have been told in uniformity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We looked at the evidence for and against and there are so many things that don&#39;t work. Like the amount of gunpowder they had would have been impossible to get (all gunpowder was controlled by the tower of london) it would be like bin laden renting storage under the White house and putting a nuke under it. </p>

<p>Sadly the way exams work is jumping through certain hoops but I find you get a good degree of freedom even just in wording, for instance I believe hitler escaped, I don&#39;t say that but I say &quot;after hitler was gone&quot; so I hint at my view but don&#39;t allow myself to be marked down for &#39;inaccuracy&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That bin Laden analogy is hilarious. And that&#39;s an interesting point. That damn City of London has a very clouded history. You are right about power of wording. My undergraduate was in history and in the beginning I would toe the line and write what I thought was the correct answer. It wasn&#39;t until my last year that I really began to write what I felt. For example extensive work on the genocide of Native Americans or the silencing of the American labor movement. OrWhich is so blatantly white washed in the narrative that we celebrate Columns Day. When I started being more rebellious I was rewarded but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s only because I always backed up my claims and was cautious not to make what would be seen as an outlandish claim.</p>

<p>Lots of stuff about gunpowder plot is odd. You have Guido Fawkes (basically a bloody foreigner who was also catholic), the guards missing the massive store of gunpowder in a first sweep. But because the story is passed as gospel most people don&#39;t even think to doubt it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically the elevation of Washington and his ilk to the level of God&#39;s. Claiming they fought for the freedom of all men when they really had personal reasons and gains for fighting. And from this stems the America dream farce. Gary Nash did a good book about the fragmented mentality of the revolution. It was kind of a perfect storm of events that redirected legitimate anger that came from the existing hard times. Possibly spreading from merchant Princes monopolies as much as England&#39;s mercantile policies. I.e. closed ports to foreign trading. It&#39;s really quite complicated. But to the American youth it is painted as a struggle against tyranny. Look up the whisky rebellion and ask yourself how much Washington cared about tyranny. So basically like all complicated events it is painted as a simple false dichotomy. Boom.</p>

<p>Perhaps you misunderstood.</p>

<p>What are they being paid to find?</p>

<p>Evidence in support of climate change agenda?</p>

<p>Or evidence debunking it?</p>
