       William (Bill) Lauderback. Bill works CURRENTLY, for a Strategic Relations Firm called Hill+Knowlton Strategies, one of whose major clients is the infamous and globally powerful companies known as DuPont Chemical. In the past, Bill Lauderback also worked for a Strategic Relations Firm called Bonner &amp; Associates as VP of Operations. Of Bonner &amp; Associates major clientele list, is none other than Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just 5 days before the West Fertilizer Co. explosion that leveled a town, Monsanto and DuPont had settled a long running lawsuit over rights and usage of their proprietary technologies, by agreeing to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough this compromise between DuPont and Monsanto may or may not have had to do with William (Bill) Lauderback's past and present connections between both Hill+Knowlten and Bonner &amp; Associates (the two Firms whom Bill Lauderback has held high positions in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's the twist - Previously, as has been verified in this article from the Wall Street Journal, West Fertilizer (formerly known as Texas Grain, Inc.) had a long standing and HUGE Class action lawsuit against Monsanto which was ran into the ground after a magistrate judge denied a request to certify the case as a class action. The lawyer said Texas Grain appealed the ruling, and that a district judge has railroaded the case by stalling to rule on the appeal, subsequently causing Monsanto to go scott-free due to a statute of limitations. Link &gt;&gt;&gt; [link to bl ogs.ws j.c om]
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, the company (Texas Grain) was represented by 30 attorneys from 12 firms and now West Fertilizer was determined to continue to proceed with the suit against Monsanto as did the previous owners of the company when it was called Texas Grain, Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here is the smoking gun!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       While Bill Lauderback has ties with Monsanto and DuPont who just agreed to work in unison, he had absolutely ZERO ties with West Fertilizer Co. So why in the HELL, did someone named Bill Lauderback just so happen to be the last person to edit a Manta Business profile on the same day as the explosion, just 5 days after his two past and present clients (Monsanto &amp; DuPont) agreed to work together? Link to Manta Profile &gt;&gt;&gt; [link to ww w.manta.c om]
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I think I have found the Answer.. Guess whom owns DuPont? The Koch Brothers.. SO, what's the big deal with the Koch Brothers???? Hmmm....Do you know who the largest owner of fertilizer business in the world is??? The FUCKING Koch brothers!! Yep!!
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Monsanto faces massive class action legal problems from West Fertilizer.
       </li>
       <li>
        West Fertilizer Co. is competition to Koch Brother owned Koch Fertilizer, LLC.
       </li>
       <li>
        Koch Brothers also own DuPont
       </li>
       <li>
        DuPont and Monsanto being working together
       </li>
       <li>
        Five days later, West Fertilizer is utterly decimated.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It's a Win-Win-Win situation and in the best interests for DuPont, Monsanto, and Koch Fertilizer, LLC. To get the fuck rid of West Fertilizer Co

       I always thought this was super dodgy at the time, and coming on the heels of the Boston Bombing it was pretty much swept under the carpet. Nice timing.

       It doesn't seem to be true that either Monsanto or DuPont are owned by the Koch brothers. Koch industries did buy a division of DuPont called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invista">
        "Invista"
       </a>
       back in 2004. But I don't understand why the ownership of either Monsanto or DuPont is important here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I understand what the alleged motive is supposed to be, There was a lawsuit that
       <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/04/18/before-the-blast-west-fertilizers-monsanto-lawsuit/">
        appeared to be dead
       </a>
       , so it doesn't seem to be much of a threat. But if the lawsuit was still alive, why would the explosion at the plant stop it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't understand the "smoking gun". A consultant edited a web page. What is that supposed to prove?

       Implications of the photo?

       I get that it's suggesting that the the two plant explosions were bombs of some sort but is there anything else to it? Genuinely interested. Thanks

       Very interesting, I had just read this here and was wondering what else went on in West:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The second unit, assisted by CIA agent Roland Carnaby, followed the theft of nuclear weapons from the sorting facility near Amarillo to a fertilizer plant outside Waco, Texas. In April 2014, as Snowden reputedly handed Able Danger documents to Russian intelligence, the plant where the nuclear weapons were stored, the West Fertilizer Plant, was destroyed in a massive explosion, killing 15."
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Covering up nuclear devices stored there could also explain the lack of OSHA checkups as well
