<p><strong>I call BS.</strong></p>

<p>Kind&#39;a reminds me of the FBI &quot;finding&quot; all the hijackers passports on the streets of New York (in near pristine condition) on 9/11.  Way too &quot;convenient&quot; for reality.</p>

<p>...further, I am sure it has <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong> to do with the fact that France recently it&#39;s support of Palestine as a State:</p>

<p>nahh... nothing to do with that ;)  ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly.</p>

<p>If you can find a source for firearms such as these, I&#39;m sure you can find a source for counterfeit ID&#39;s.</p>

<p>But then, who were the real gunmen under those masks? Were they truly French Islamic extremists? We won&#39;t know until they actually find any of the three suspects, but what I feel is that considering one of the suspects has a completely solid alibi, you have to question if either of the other two suspects are truly the gunmen.</p>

I can&#39;t beleive a person who had just shot people and who had the presence of mind to calmly pick up the shoe before getting in to the get away car would then later not check the car to see if THEIR ID&#39;S! WERE LEFT IN THE CAR!</p>

<p>9 shots with the final at point blank to kill 1 person? </p>

<p>What kind of a world are you in where that&#39;s accurate? </p>

<p>Why would a pro run to the right at 0:15, turn around and change his mind about where he wanted to go and almost bump into his partner? </p>

<p>Why did the man with the white straps frequently allow his gun to be pointed at his partner when it should&#39;ve been pointed at the ground? </p>

<p>For professionals they act like they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol u guys pick the weirdest shit to get your panties in a wedge over. That&#39;s what happens when a bullet it moving at close to 3000 fps from a rifle, it penetrates the glass cleanly as it doesn&#39;t have time to crack. A pistol round, moving at about a third of the speed of most rifle rounds, will have a different effect. It&#39;s a similar effect to when you shoot cans or bottles with a rifle and the can doesn&#39;t even move at all, often at range this makes the illusion that you missed, but really the bullet just ripped so quickly and cleanly through the can that it doesn&#39;t move. </p>

<p>Show me one real &quot;headshot&quot; video where there isnt an ounce of blood to be seen. Anyone can link you to liveleak or the like where you will see, there will be blood. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiBjT7XzJ-U">Russian AK47 headshot</a>  In the clear versions of the video of the cop on the sidewalk you can see:</p>

<ul>
<li>ZERO recoil even though his arms are outstretched during the shot. Perhaps a smaller caliber round, fine, but there still would be some recoil visible with his arms reaching in front like that even with a recoil buffer.</li>
<li>the cop is in the process of turning his head away from the barrel as he is shot at and his head movement isnt at all affected by the &quot;impact&quot; of the &quot;bullet&quot;</li>
<li>He apparently was already shot which is why he was laying there. The photo&#39;s released show a small patch of blood towards the curb, not at all where is head was but closer to his lower extremities/waist</li>
</ul>

<p>He was definitely NOT shot in the head. Why is the media <del>sensationalizing</del> stating he was?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that its probably B.S. too but I think its probably a cover because they don&#39;t want to reveal (and compromise) their real source. You don&#39;t want to say &quot;we tracked them by using information from one our informants planted in a terrorist cell in this suburb of Paris blah blah blah&quot;. I&#39;m pretty strongly against government secrecy for 99.9% of things but I can understand maintaining for that 0.1%.</p>

<p>It reminds of me of when the Brits intercepted the Zimmerman telegram but had to come up with cover story for how they got the intel since telling its true origin would reveal that a) Brits were tapping American telegraph lines and b) the Brits had broken the German codes. So instead they had to come up with some elaborate cover story about a leak on the Mexican end of things.</p>

<p>Absolutely. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure. However if one knows that the gunmen were concerned so much with not being caught that they wore masks, used multiple getaway vehicles and cared enough to not leave their shoe behind (it&#39;s difficult to ID someone from a shoe) then it stands to reason that they wouldn&#39;t bring their fucking photo IDs with them.</p>

<p>You want to talk of logic? Explain to me the rationale behind bringing your photo ID to a mass murder that you&#39;re clearly attempting to get away with. Apply occams razor to that.</p>

<p>picking up a shoe is not meticulous. that&#39;s sort of actually a normal behaviour. you drop something, you pick it up. during the course of the incident the same fellow also probably scratched his balls, adjusted his hair under his mask, maybe checked and re-checked his ammunition and then fiddled with the bolt, played with his keys...</p>

<p>Like i said, you can&#39;t invoke one said of behaviours to describe another.</p>

<p>Maybe they forgot.</p>

<p>Maybe it was force of habit.</p>

<p>Hell the other day i set out to drive for 2 hours explicitly to make a return on an item before the policy expired. Upon arriving i realized i left the receipt at home sitting on my counter.</p>

<p>If you purse the history of &quot;People Doing Things&quot; you&#39;ll find an incredible number of blunders, missteps and well... to use an awfully stupid internet analogy... fails.  Evidence for this goes back as far as written history. </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they just tell a guard to look <em>inside</em> the giant wooden horse gifted by their enemies?? </p>

<p>Because they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Look whatever insinuations you wish to make about <em>the real</em> identity of the gunmen, or that one of the people whose ID was found has a pretty solid alibi and that perhaps these IDs were stolen or otherwise not theirs... sure go ahead. At my most sceptical i&#39;d say you might have a case.</p>

<p>But invoking &quot;humans acting weird&quot; (and then attempting to decode that behaviour) as evidence for queer-goings-on is just absurd.</p>

<p>That&#39;s also assuming that we can label people who are willing to go on a killing-spree as &quot;Rational Agents&quot;.</p>

<p>I watched my dog lick his own butthole for 20 minutes straight. How long can one rational human, watch a dog lick its own butthole?  Clearly i&#39;m some sorta shill for BigKibble</p>

<p>This is wet work disguised as &quot;terror&quot; - I&#39;d be interested to know who the first person whacked was - it was totally professional operation, they only killed who they needed, and the patsy were ready at hand; youngish guys with no obvious connection to Yemen, one of whom was jailed for 18 months for fighting in Iraq - Can you say - turned by intelligence services?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to do some research about who was in the room at that time, but for anyone who wants to get an idea of what I&#39;m banging on about check out the 2008 film The Trojan Horse and the start in particular.</p>

<p>When the world figured out it was Mossad who executed the Munich terrorists all you could do was shrug and say they deserved it. There is no way the world can/would justify Israelis murdering satire cartoonists to create civil unrest. Mossad is too calculated to do something so dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW I&#39;m having my doubts as to whether this was &quot;wet work disguised as terror&quot;, as you put it.</p>

<p>It is my hunch that the paper and its personnel <em>were</em> specifically targeted, but not because those that ordered the hit had reason to take out any of the targets <em>as individuals</em>, rather, I suspect that this was a <em>politically motivated</em> action carried out by non-Muslims - the goal being to generate extreme hatred and xenophobia toward <em>all</em> Muslims.</p>

<p>Who would do such a thing and why? Well, obviously Israel comes to mind - the Palestinians have been making bids for UN recognition and to join the World Court:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-07/palestinians-can-file-anti-israel-cases-at-world-court-in-april.html">Palestinians Can File Anti-Israel Cases at World Court in April</a></strong> </p>

<p>More and more Western nations are beginning to recognize and support Palestinian Statehood, and it is no secret that Israel finds this prospect VERY disconcerting, as they have no intention of EVER letting this come to pass.</p>

<p>Despite heavy lobbying efforts by the Israelis, the Palestinian &quot;cause&quot; has made significant headway - and Israel is getting desperate. </p>

<p>Of course, if &quot;crazed fundamentalist Muslims&quot; (wink wink) were to launch a vicious murderous assault over something as simple as &quot;offensive caricatures&quot;, the world would be awestruck, and the people would tend to &quot;harden their hearts&quot; against these &quot;crude, primitive, brutish people&quot;, no?</p>

<p>The Mossad has a long history of carrying out assassinations - and they frequently try to blame others for their dirty work. Check out this article:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7254807/Mossads-licence-to-kill.html">Mossad&#39;s licence to kill</a></strong></p>

<p>And note that the author is VERY credible - having intimate ties with the Mossad, and author of the <em>only</em> Mossad-approved book on the organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire event has signature Mossad methods all over it. Like 9/11 and all of the other so called &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks, props such as ID&#39;s, identifiable pieces of clothing, documents or parts were left behind in perfect condition for evidence of the perpetrators. </p>

<p>This particular &quot;attack&quot; reminds me of 9/11 only in the way there are forces obviously and purposefully stirring up hatred for Muslims. The shills are using the &quot;official story&quot; which the media was spewing before the dust even settled and the shills are going crazy on reddit stirring up the hatred. It&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this has EVERYTHING to do with the recent pro-Palestinian vote. This is how Israel&#39;s diabolical behavior works. It&#39;s not so much about punishing France as it is making the French second guess the UN vote and turn their backs on the Palestinians....this is some evil shit going on right now. And it&#39;s heartbreaking watching all of the brainwashed sheep fill their hearts with hatred towards people who had nothing to do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep! It&#39;s either the UN or Israel punishing France. I read something- somewhere- that Bush received 9/11 as a sort of &quot;punishment&quot; for not moving fast enough on war with one of those muslim countries and that he was told by UN to enact some sort of massive national surveillance system (Patriot Act) which he didn&#39;t do when they wanted to. When a head of state doesn&#39;t go by the &quot;rules&quot;, they get punished for it. Listen- anyone remember when Hagel warned Obama over this new &quot;rogue world order&quot;? Hagel&#39;s words &quot;&quot;We don’t control it. You must question everything, every assumption, everything they” — the military and diplomats — “tell you. &quot; then Hagel quit, resigned, whatever because he knew this was gonna go NOwhere. I opine this whole conspiracy in re: UN/world order deal is why Obama ignores his phony &quot;Security Briefs&quot; he was criticized for (ignoring) - because they are packed with lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all part of the elitist agenda to curb down on freedom of speech, anyone who argues tell them to just look at what is happening on Facebook (social engineering medium). Expect more free speech restrictions very soon. Now you understand why Europe has been flooded by Muslim immigrants. The elite needed to have the so-called enemy within otherwise how could you be manipulated on the long-term? I mean if someone came from abroad for a short-term stay to commit a terrorist attack this would not be as worrying as many muslims living within the nation itself that could strike daily for a long period of time. Lets face it, you could ban and shut off muslim immigration and visas but the ones already here are here. What is a result of this fear? The native populations move more to the far-right. You watch how quickly France turns to the National Front and Marine Le-pen at the next election. People in a nation need a common following not mixtures that have all been designed to hate the others. It is all part of the grander attempts to usher in the Luciferian Doctrine.</p>

<p>Great comment. Reminded me of Goering, actually, in the Nuremberg trials:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course the people don&#39;t want war. But after all, it&#39;s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it&#39;s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it&#39;s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. <strong>Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if its true, the suspects were already well known to police, they didn&#39;t need the IDs to identify and find the suspects. Also if you look at the most recent attacks committed by extremist Muslims, both were shot and killed or died several hours after the attacks - fully intending to die and become martyrs.

<p><strong>22.50:</strong> More on the raid in Reims from our reporting team in France</p>

<p>Quote</p>

<p>Elite French forces were last night reportedly besieging the three Charlie Hebdo attackers in Reims, eastern France amid reports all three had been “identified and located” <em>after an identity card was found in their getaway car.</em></p>

<p>Security sources told several French media that a police operation with the elite RAID anti-terror squad was underway in Reims, with two of the three attackers reported to be holed up in the neighbourhood of Croix Rouge in Reims. Helicopters were flying over the site where they were thought to be hiding.</p>

<p>The operation started at 11pm.</p>

<p>Just hours after two of three masked and heavily armed gunmen walked into the satirical weekly’s offices and shot dead 12 people, their identities had been widely reported in French media, but not confirmed by French authorities. </p>

<p>But it has now emerged that the suspected terrorists have been identified after one of the brothers left his ID card in the Citroën C3 they abandoned as they escaped.</p>

<p>It was also reported that two of the machine gun-wielding murderers went to the wrong office in the minutes before the raid on the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo.</p>

<p>After being told by two maintenance workers that the correct location was two doors over, the men are reported to have killed one of the duo before launching their attack on the magazine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People makes mistakes all the time. Absolutly. I said the same thing in my inital post. Now about the IDs, it&#39;s not really werid that they dropped their IDs.

According to my souces information about even the existence of those IDs is not typically released to the public. It&#39;s very common practise in these cases to avoid disclosing how attribution was determined.</p>

<p>Just a few notes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>According to my sources, ISIS seems to have taken credit for this attack. Some well known ISIS accounts seemed to foreshadow this event on social media and have given this attack attention that some other recent incidents did not recieve from them. </p></li>

<p>yes when doing so would reveal important trade secret. Which is not the case here. </p>

<p>to your point 1., of course they did. And I&#39;m guessing 20 other groups have too as is always the case after a terrorist attack, but nothing has been confirmed yet.</p>

<p>EDIT: According to my sources it was JFK and Tupac who orchestrated the attack and planted that ID card</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but note the whole saying &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; is straight out of TV shows, almost always, when depicting a &quot;Muslim attack&quot; and then, as other&#39;s note, the convenient finding of the ID&#39;s has too much of a theatrical feel to it. Seems to be lots of leaking from unnamed sources and with seemingly immediate naming of the suspects, yet they still have not been located and apprehended.. I have to admit there is almost too much of a theatrical feel to the whole thing.</p>

<p>I admit I am just now getting into this and have some more digging to do, but this is just my initial impression fwiw.</p>

<p>BUT, that does not mean that the whole thing wasn&#39;t a planned event by Bibi himself. This could actually be a legit terrorist attack - taking into account that (IMO) Bibi is a terrorist. And...you know...that he said France would see grave consequences for recognizing Palestine.</p>

<p>Tons of people on this sub seem to think it&#39;s either one or the other: that either fake IDs were planted, or it was a state sponsored attack. It&#39;s entirely plausible it&#39;s both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on my phone so sorry in advance for formatting errors. </p>

<p>After watching the video of the shooting in the street and I found a few things a bit odd or maybe I&#39;m looking into it too much but, 
as the gunmen exits the car there is a shoe on the road (bare with me) &amp;amp; the guy who exits the left of the car shoots, from behind the van.</p>

<p>But when he shoots the camera moves just enough so that we can&#39;t see him shoot. 
Heck if I was the camera man I&#39;d jump too! 
But what gets me is the dude manages to zoom out (twice I think) perfectly onto this cop (that shows no sign of blood all video) as the guy runs up and puts one in his head (with little to no recoil on what I can assume is an Ak of sorts) there is some crazy ricochet dust shit but no blood? </p>

<p>The second guy just follows suit back to the car, but picks up this shoe that&#39;s just sitting there. Now to me they look like they both are not missing shoes.
So where the fuck did it come from? 
If he remembered to pick that shoe up, how the fuck does he forget and leave id&#39;s? </p>

<p>Maybe a long shot too but I don&#39;t think the pictures floating around the media of the two gunmen, match the White eye sockets I see of the men in the balaclavas? </p>

<p>Maybe I should just sleep. </p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>picking up a shoe is not meticulous. that&#39;s sort of actually a normal behaviour. you drop something, you pick it up. during the course of the incident the same fellow also probably scratched his balls, adjusted his hair under his mask, maybe checked and re-checked his ammunition and then fiddled with the bolt, played with his keys...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However if one knows that the gunmen were concerned so much with not being caught that they wore masks, used multiple getaway vehicles and cared enough to not leave their shoe behind (it&#39;s difficult to ID someone from a shoe) then it stands to reason that they wouldn&#39;t bring their fucking photo IDs with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like i said, you can&#39;t invoke one said of behaviours to describe another.</p>

<p>Maybe they forgot.</p>

<p>Maybe it was force of habit.</p>

<p>Hell the other day i set out to drive for 2 hours explicitly to make a return on an item before the policy expired. Upon arriving i realized i left the receipt at home sitting on my counter.</p>

<p>If you purse the history of &quot;People Doing Things&quot; you&#39;ll find an incredible number of blunders, missteps and well... to use an awfully stupid internet analogy... fails.  Evidence for this goes back as far as written history. </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they just tell a guard to look <em>inside</em> the giant wooden horse gifted by their enemies?? </p>

<p>Because they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Look whatever insinuations you wish to make about <em>the real</em> identity of the gunmen, or that one of the people whose ID was found has a pretty solid alibi and that perhaps these IDs were stolen or otherwise not theirs... sure go ahead. At my most sceptical i&#39;d say you might have a case.</p>

<p>But invoking &quot;humans acting weird&quot; (and then attempting to decode that behaviour) as evidence for queer-goings-on is just absurd.</p>

<p>That&#39;s also assuming that we can label people who are willing to go on a killing-spree as &quot;Rational Agents&quot;.</p>

<p>I watched my dog lick his own butthole for 20 minutes straight. How long can one rational human, watch a dog lick its own butthole?  Clearly i&#39;m some sorta shill for BigKibble</p>
