       Nobody seems to be connecting the dots lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've got an Australian Patriot Act to push through... Suprise! Worldwide news coverage of a few random acts of violence.  Dohnut shops are under attack!
      </p>
      <p>
       We've got a Canadian version of the patriot act up for the vote... Surprise!  The parliament is under attack just in time to sway the opinion of the fence sitters.  (Just think of the poor troops!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Suprise!  The French version of the patriot act was crammed through at the very end of a parliamentary session while nobody was watching.  When people started mobilizing to protest... Surprise again.  Islamic terrorists are everywhere, just waiting for the moment to strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of course is justifying huge surveillance and intelligence contracts to private security contractors to grab up multi billion dollar contracts
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you guys been paying attention to the long game?  When I see these short sighted "conspiracy theories" that are the same bullshit "false flag" "crisis actor" over and over again, it's embarrassing.

       Yep an awesome spot, easily the most convincing 'coincidence' relating to yesterdays attacks I have seen. Was watching the news coverage and it felt wrong. By the way who is OP? Saying welcome back to a 2 day old account tells me I am missing something.

       <a href="http://chertoffgroup.com/bios/michael-hayden.php">
        Michael Hayden

       of all people on a morning talk show commenting on the Paris attacks.  Why the fuck would you have Hayden on TV to comment on this instead of a Frenchman, a journalist, or even someone from the State Department??

       I've been posting similar comments to this one for a while now. It's the Hegelian dialectic of Problem Reaction Solution. Yes, the government has been using the fear principle to herd the sheep in the right (wing) direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I see an even bigger trend than increased government powers. Look at who's been hit since 2001. The USA. Then Britain and Spain. Then, in just the last year, Canada, Australia and France. We're also looking at rising levels of anti-Islamic sentiment in Germany and other European nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the world like it's a chess board, the major western nations are being primed for war with Islam. Think of the nations that took part in the Crusades. England, Spain, France and the smaller German speaking countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today we're seeing the Anglo-sphere nations, plus the other powerful European countries slowly being readied for a major war in the Middle East. I'd expect to see at least a couple more attacks like this in some of the other major European countries this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to guess, I'd say Germany, Italy are next. The Netherlands and maybe Norway, Denmark or Sweden might get false-flagged as well.

       Netherlands just got hit with the MH17 fiasco, although I concede your point that it is not of the particular brand of terrorism you are referring (#al akhbar).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are dead on with Germany. They've been getting a little to close to the Ruskies lately and while I completely agree with your hypothesis of how the world has been constantly molded for the past 1-2 decades (especially lately), I think they have been trying to do the same with the Russian Bear (2/3s if the new Axis, if you know what I'm saying).
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin sees the writing on the wall, and sees the Anglo American Empire cozying up to China economically, trying to tie them to us to limit the Bear's choices. At this point, it would be the BRICS and the Islamic guys, right?

       I agree, but that only proves Zionism claims. Which the OP rejects.

       "The perceived holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the Crusades, as European Christians sought to win the Holy Land back from the Muslim Suljuq Turks. They had taken it over after defeating the Muslim Arabs, who had in turn taken control from the Christian Byzantine Empire." -Wikipedia

       Zionism? I don't know for sure about that. But you don't even need to go looking to assign responsibility. Just take a look at who's living in modern day Israel. It's called a Jewish state. But essentially it's populated by the first generation descendents of immigrants from Europe. They might be mostly of Jewish ancestry, but they came from France, Germany, Poland and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, Israel is a European colony located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean. Most people in western countries don't see it this way because the story has been spun so hard. There were European colonies in the Holy Land before. They didn't last forever and there's no guarantee that the modern version will be any different.

       Do you have a link for the French Patriot act? I did a search earlier and posted about some legislation from September, but am unfamiliar with French Parliamentary procedure and am very loose when it comes to how things work across le entang.

       you seem to have ignored this part of the french article which is inconvenient for your narrative: "which had been passed back in 2013"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm confused how terrorism helps justify Bill C-13 as C-13 seems to be targeted at cyberbullying? So why would they need a false flag attack when the narrative is about protecting children? Wouldn't you instead want something that matches that?

       Sorry, I wasn't intending to mislead anybody.  The law was up for vote in late 2013 and wasn't actually enacted until 2015.  There was some action that happened on Christmas Eve 2014 which triggered it to come into effect.  I'm having a hard time tracking down how it all worked because I don't read or speak French.  I swear I didn't make this up, but if I got any details wrong, I apologize.

       Thanks! I got off on a tirade there for a bit, but thanks for reading anyway.  From my most recent attempt at understanding what's going on, I think that there's a real possibility that these corporate 
intelligence firms (basically corporate intelligence mercenaries) have the most to gain from these kind of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get to sign huge government contracts to use their staff and algorithms to scan our communications and report back to the government.  But it actually costs the government money to do that, and it makes some of the population really mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not be the governments who are orchestrating these attacks at all.  And these aren't random attacks.  They're timed out perfectly to serve the interests of people who have a lot to gain or lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there's legislation waiting with plenty of useful idiots ready to vote for it in the parliament or legislature, but none of those guys actually wrote the fucking bill...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really mad about this event, because it fits the pattern so perfectly.  I didn't mean to insinuate that false flag attacks don't happen in my post.  I only meant to say that when you call "false flag" on every single thing that ever comes up in the news you start to lose any sort of credibility to your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disinformation campaigns used by our own government should be illegal.  And the government should follow the laws... and all of those other dreams that kids have.

       Zionism? I don't know for sure about that. But you don't even need to go looking to assign responsibility. Just take a look at who's living in modern day Israel. It's called a Jewish state. But essentially it's populated by the first generation descendents of immigrants from Europe. They might be mostly of Jewish ancestry, but they came from France, Germany, Poland and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, Israel is a European colony located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean. Most people in western countries don't see it this way because the story has been spun so hard. There were European colonies in the Holy Land before. They didn't last forever and there's no guarantee that the modern version will be any different.
