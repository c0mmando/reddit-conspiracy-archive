<p>as far as answering the question...you know what? I don&#39;t actually care enough about the topic in the first place to actually answer it one way or the other. That&#39;s not even the point.</p>

<p>This shit [i.e. my point] is meta, dude - not specific. In other words, he could be asking about ANYTHING regardless of whether I or anyone else knows about it one way or the other. He could be asking anything regardless of whether I or anyone else is interested in it or regardless of whether he&#39;s actually RIGHT about thinking it&#39;s &quot;paranoia&quot; or not.</p>

<p>NONE OF THAT IS EVEN THE POINT.</p>

<p>The point is that this sub is supposed to be for and about CRITICAL THINKING on subjects that are OUTSIDE of manipulative PTB narrative. As such, you should check your presumptions about what you &quot;think&quot; is and is not &quot;paranoia&quot; and b.s. at the door.</p>

<p>Dude...Jesus Christ I WAS NOT ATTACKING THE OP.  Where the hell are you guys getting that idea from?  Ya&#39;ll are saying I&#39;m attacking him because I&#39;m saying that the words he used WERE indeed inflammatory, not objective, and <em>were</em> negatively leading?  That was not &quot;attacking&quot; him.</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S WHAT THOSE WORDS ACTUALLY <em>WERE</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mentioning his bias is one thing, but distracting from the topic isn&#39;t constructive at all.</p>

<p>Okay but where exactly did I &quot;distract from the topic&quot; aside from mentioning his bias?  What I was doing was calling him out on his bias...and a few people on here are accusing me of &quot;not being constructive&quot;?  What?  Seriously?  Come on, man.</p>

<p>I can definitely be an asshole.  I understand that.  However, I was NOT being an asshole to him.  I might not have been frickin&#39; handling the dude with kid mittens, but we&#39;re all grown boys and girls here.  We should be objective - yes - but we shouldn&#39;t have to try to only speak in &quot;flowery language&quot; or whatever for fear of hurting or offending somebody.  Come on, bro.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t cure ignorance by accusing someone of ignorance and subverting discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See...That&#39;s fucked up though, man.  That&#39;s a seriously straw man fallacy there though.  You&#39;re accusing me of something that I WASN&#39;T AND AM NOT doing.  <em>You&#39;re</em> the one that put that on what I said - not me.  I didn&#39;t &quot;subvert the discussion&quot;.  I ALIGNED it (or at least attempted to).</p>

<p>Do you see the difference there?  The OP <em>STARTED</em> the conversation and the questioning with a negative &quot;it&#39;s ignorant b.s., but...&quot; perspective and slant in the first place.  So how exactly am I &quot;subverting the discussion&quot; when what I am trying to do is ALIGN it by trying to have him rephrase his wordage or change his thinking in a manner that DOESN&#39;T start off thinking that the subject matter in question is b.s. in the first place?  How can your mind even be really receptive to learning the truth on a subject if you come into it already thinking &quot;this is b.s., but...&quot;?</p>

<p>THAT is not &quot;ignorance&quot; on my part, man.  And, for the record - even though I never accused OP of &quot;ignorance&quot; - sometimes you actually CAN cure someone&#39;s ignorance by TELLING them they&#39;re being ignorant.</p>

<p>If someone actually IS being ignorant, for example, and you let them know that, occasionally (though not often), you might get a person who is astute and developed enough and doesn&#39;t have a fragile or inflated ego enough to see whether what they are saying IS indeed ignorant or not...and if it actually <em>is</em> ignorant (i.e. lacking in correct knowledge in one way or the other), the person in question might say &quot;Oh wow.  I didn&#39;t realize that.  Thank you for pointing that out to me.  Cheers.&quot;</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, might not be too common an occurrence, but (even though I didn&#39;t out and out call OP &quot;ignorant&quot;) sometimes you CAN indeed fight ignorance by calling somebody out on it and specifically letting them know they&#39;re being such.</p>

It was because YOU guys got butthurt over the fact that I tried to tell OP not to say he/she is ignorant on a subject yet shows obvious preconceived notions against it!  If you really <em>are</em> ignorant about it, then dismissing it by saying &quot;I think it&#39;s paranoia&quot; actually implies the OPPOSITE of ignorance because it assumes that one KNOWS it&#39;s &quot;paranoia&quot; (i.e. not really worth serious inquiry).</p>

<p>No, man.  lol.  That is actually NOT what this sub is about at all.  It&#39;s about going against thinking WRONG <em>regardless</em> of whatever the popular notions are about things one way or the other.  This is actually different than what you just stated above.  What you stated above says that this sub is about &quot;going against thinking right&quot;...and, again, it&#39;s NOT about that.</p>

<p>You see what I&#39;m talking about here?  You actually made the very same mistake <em>AGAIN</em> that you started this OP with.  You made a comment that is actually <em>worded</em> and THOUGHT OUT incorrectly, and I&#39;m simply pointing that out to you.</p>

<p>Yet what do you do?  You waste your time and get upset THAT I&#39;M POINTING IT OUT or that I&#39;m using &quot;all caps&quot; or whatever rather than actually stopping and thinking about what it is I&#39;m actually saying - rather than stopping and thinking about the fact that you ARE indeed phrasing and thinking about things incorrectly.</p>

<p>What kind of attitude is that to come in with trying to get any answers to ANYTHING?  You don&#39;t really want answers if you come in like that is my point.  You want confirmation that what you THINK is right <em>is</em> indeed right...even if it&#39;s <em>not</em> right.</p>

<p>I did not say this sub is about &quot;going against thinking right&quot;.</p>

<p>But look at your phrasing.  Look at how you said what you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought that this sub is meant to challenge popular beliefs going against the notion that you can &quot;think right&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;popular beliefs going against the notion that you can &#39;think right&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>That statement, at absolute best, is very, very ambiguous.  It can mean various things.  All I&#39;m saying is that the words you used conveyed certain meanings, and that meaning seemed to indicate a touch of confusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is not a &quot;right way&quot; to think,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Well, while this in theory seems valid TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, I would say that, contextually-speaking, there <em>are</em> indeed certain ways to think that are actually better than others.  As such, even though one can, I guess, think however they want, SOME ways of thinking are more conducive toward certain outcomes than others.  This is another way of saying that (again, contextually-speaking) some ways of thinking ARE indeed &quot;more right&quot; than others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are alternate ways to think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely, and that is in large part what this sub IS about.  However, even within the context of those alternative ways of thinking, there are certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemological</a> standards that seem to apply across the board regardless of whether you&#39;re thinking &quot;alternatively&quot; or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day you are convinced that you have the &quot;right&quot; way to think and you can keep thinking that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Dude...at the end of the day, I am &quot;convinced&quot; that my way of thinking is indeed &quot;right&quot; because I&#39;m abiding by the standards of GENERAL, OVER-ARCHING EPISTEMOLOGY that exist in this dimension we live in.  You don&#39;t actually know what that means though...do you?</p>

<p>The reason I <em>do</em> indeed &quot;think I&#39;m right&quot; and will indeed keep thinking that way (until someone shows me otherwise) is because 2+2 in this world HAS indeed been thus far shown to be 4.  &quot;Up&quot; <em>has</em> shown itself to be up.  &quot;Down&quot; <em>has</em> shown itself to be down.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you say &quot;up&quot; but you really mean &quot;down&quot;, then it is in fact YOU that are speaking incorrectly, and if you continue doing that, then you likely won&#39;t be very well-understood in your life.</p>

<p>Good luck,</p>

<p>It might not be &quot;certain&quot;, but there is soooo much evidence of it that it might as well be.  It&#39;s a bit of a foregone conclusion at this point.  There&#39;s more evidence for it than there is for some other things in the world that people DO actually take as a foregone conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  You&#39;re really going to try to put some kind of blame on me for stating that coming in with presumptuous attitudes is, perhaps, NOT a good thing and not the most conducive to possibly learning something new?  If somebody comes in and says &quot;Dude, I know &#39;theory 1, 2, 3&#39; is paranoia b.s., but I&#39;ll let you try to convince me anyway.&quot; what kind of basis do you really think you&#39;re starting with?  You&#39;re really going to try to waste your time with someone who&#39;s already convinced that they think they know what&#39;s going on if they actually don&#39;t?  Maybe YOU should try to try to answer the question then.</p>

<p>And this has nothing to do with &quot;why we can&#39;t have discussions&quot; in this thread one way or the other.  We can&#39;t have discussions not because people get called out on presumptuous attitudes.  We can&#39;t have discussions because people COME IN with presumptuous attitudes in the first fucking place.</p>

<p>And as far as answering the question...you know what?  I don&#39;t actually care enough about the topic in the first place to actually answer it one way or the other.  That&#39;s not even the point.</p>

<p>This shit is meta, dude - not specific.  In other words, he could be asking about ANYTHING regardless of whether I or anyone else knows about it one way or the other.  He could be asking anything regardless of whether I or anyone else is interested in it or regardless of whether he&#39;s actually RIGHT about thinking it&#39;s &quot;paranoia&quot; or not.</p>

<p>NONE OF THAT IS EVEN THE POINT.</p>

<p>The point is that this sub is supposed to be for and about CRITICAL THINKING on subjects that are OUTSIDE of manipulative PTB narrative.  As such, you should check your presumptions about what you &quot;think&quot; is and is not &quot;paranoia&quot; and b.s. at the door.</p>

<p>and THAT&#39;S why we can&#39;t have discussions in this thread.  Not because of anyone pointing out what I&#39;m pointing out.</p>

<p>Put your critical thinking cap on, man.  You apparently dropped it somewhere.</p>

<p>I very much doubt it. Both Catholicism and all fraternal organizations (from the KoC to Freemasonry to the various animal Lodges in the US such as the Elks) have seen a dramatic decline in membership from 1980 to 2005, but Freemasonry is starting to bounce back as is the Church, and I think this century is going to have just as many highs and lows for both as the previous one.</p>

<p>I&#39;d much rather have them in the same Lodge together with blue collar workers and artists and teachers than to be off in some ivory tower, ignoring the reality of the world they live in, so no, that doesn&#39;t bother me at all!</p>

<p>In my Lodge there are rich people, influential people, even a couple of more or less famous people. But there are computer programmers (like me), tattoo artists (3 of them!), firemen, middle managers, students, ministers and so much more.

<p>They&#39;re really not that secret. The teachings esoteric and are largely about becoming a better person. It&#39;s geared around moral self improvement.</p>

<p>The is zero evidence of satanism in freemasonry. In fact satanism runs counter to everything that freemasonry stands for.</p>

<p>Lucifer is an esoteric archetype that is not the same thing as Satan at all. Lucifer is similar to prometheus, giving knowledge and wisdom to humankind. That&#39;s the correct esoteric concept.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s satanic to raise money for charitable good causes to improve the lot of those less fortunate or in need? All charities are satanic?</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely nothing to do with salvation. In fact a lot of its esoteric moral teachings are sourced from the Bible.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, believing in a supreme being is a requisite for being a freemason. Indeed some parts of it, such as the Rose Croix, require that you are a Christian.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t what I said. Satan is a deceiver who uses good intentions for the &#39;betterment&#39; of mankind, which is in his opinion separation from God. He turns the picture upside down and brings us to get in touch with ourselves instead.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. There in it to enlighten themselves and transcend spiritually. They preach good works.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all darkness. The true light is that Jesus died for us and our salvation is in the hands of Him, our God. We must believe upon Him and we are saved by grace, not by good works. It is our faith in Him that saves us and grows us spiritually.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. Becoming a better person isn&#39;t satanic and doesn&#39;t result in separation from God if you&#39;re religious.  It just means you become a better person.</p>

<p>Just...no.  This is horribly broken thinking.  Fear is a tool used for oppression and domination.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t.  It just means that you need to believe in a supreme being.  Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>How can true light derive from fear?  It can&#39;t.  Fear is used for oppression and domination.</p>

<p>You&#39;re essentially promoting fear and ignorance.  Good luck with that.</p>

<p>You see, this is where you go off the rails. You want to begin with the assumption that Freemasonry has some belief system, and so when you go pouring over random scraps of books, you find it. If I convince myself that Christianity is about abusing people (as many atheists do) and I go pouring over the Bible for evidence, I&#39;ll find it. But that just demonstrates my confirmation bias, not the reality of what I wanted to discover.</p>

<p>And said critical thinkers will ask themselves: if this organization has been around for 300+ years and has no central leadership, then what kind of bizarre view of it will I get if I try to read dozens of individual works by Masonic authors as if they all refer to the same institution or even that any one of them refers to a view that, in its entirety, any other two Masons will agree on?</p>
