        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I sure we&#39;ve all noticed the incredible amount of hate towards not just extremist muslims but all muslims. In addition it is now fine to post things muslims would find extremely offensive in the name of free speech and stare. We have also seen headlines saying that the men who committed the attack in paris were &quot;trained&quot;</p>

<p>We all know that it will be ISIS behind this attack or at the very least the men spent time in Syria. This is perfect for &#39;anyone&#39; who has an interest in invading Syria in  the name of democracy and anti terrorism. Can it also be noted that Syrias bank isn&#39;t run by the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>This drives the west into anti islamic and ISIS stance therefor making it easy for the US and EU to invade syria and iraq again taking oil and spreading democracy</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Get Germany in... And you&#39;ll have UN/NATO support to get nuts and fuck anyone who says otherwise.</p>

<p>Iran and Russia are gonna sit back and see the play they&#39;ve let develop since a Day in September 14 years ago, and it has built up a base of hate and a sentiment that is now deeply ingrained. I have a 14 year old nephew. To him, we have always been at war with Islam, just as I had my preconceived notions about Saddam when I was a kid for Gulf War 1.0</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary to think what his generation will do in a few years when they graduate high school. They&#39;ve been raised in a fantastic era of propaganda, Call Of Duty, and Modern Warfare. </p>

<p>And we&#39;ve always been at war with Eurasia.</p>

<p>So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.”</p>

<p>WTF happened here? We were all anti Chik-Fil-A one day and then BAM-  a prostrated/praying Mohammed doodle with cock and balls. Really? It&#39;s disgusting. Freedoms are important, but that doesn&#39;t mean we forego our <em>HUMANITY</em>. I do not Muslim, and I take issue with people, theology, and ethics that have resulted from that faith. The killings (whatever the truth of it all maybe) is terrible. </p>

<p>I will not dehumanize Arab people by participating in this madness. If <a href="http://www.backintimetradingpost.com/product-photos/smoking-sambo-standup-2-1294524162.gif">THIS</a> angers me, and this hate sold as &quot;satire&quot; gets a pass then I have failed as a decent human being. Are we willing to throw out the philosophies of MLK in a single generation? </p>

<p>Dehumanization is a precursor to genocide. Right? </p>
