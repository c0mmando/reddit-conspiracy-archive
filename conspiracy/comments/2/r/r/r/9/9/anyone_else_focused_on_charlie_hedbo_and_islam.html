       That is exactly what I am saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened in France was horrible, but everyone loses their shit because of 12 people, yet there were like 50000 innocents that were killed by drones in Pakistan alone. + the people (and I am not counting the rebels) that were killed by the nazi ukranian government + the people that died in gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that people start to buy into the medias bullshit and are just concerned about the problems that are also reported in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a friend who litterally said "well, you can't compare these deaths because that is collateral damage."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can, you ass. 2 terrorists killed  while 50 covillians die is not a gpod ratio. Even 50 terrorists and one civillian death isn't a good ratio.
But we are being told that collateral damage is ok and necessary.

       Well let's keep in mind the pedo rings are being used to control the media and hence the narrative of the Charlie Hedbo / Islam thing. So the two are related. We need to popularize this narrative.

       I laugh when theorists think that pedophile rings are some great reveal. It's just an excuse for more surveillance, for when people are tired of the terrorists storyline.

       There's a French politician coming out saying it was the work of a Western Intelligence agency and on top of that people are pointing out that a hostage claimed she was forced to recite verses from the Qu'ran while "staring into his blue eyes", of which none of the assailants have blue eyes.  Turkey's Prime Minister has said the same thing but with all their corruption right now, I think they are a far less credible source.  Nonetheless of the world leaders who marched in France, something like half of them are at the bottom of the list for Freedom of the Press.  They're all dictators in the least free countries in the world.

       Hopefully someone who was blackmailed, and now has no puppet strings, will take vengeance against his handlers. Hopefully in a terribly violent act of mutual destruction. It is the best we can hope for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can guarantee if someone was blackmailing me over any of the many crimes I have committed, and that info went public, the retribution would come to their family first. They would have only enough time to understand that their actions cost their genetic legacy.

       I don't think it quite works like that.  You blackmail someone, usually in these elite groups, to do more things you can record and blackmail them for, until you have a list a mile long.  There isn't any escaping these people, they get you to do one thing after another until you're so deep you're just like them, but still under their control.

       You do realise pedophile panic and Islamic panic are two sides of the same coin, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are used to justify more surveillance. When there isn't a terrorist attack, out comes the "protect the kids" storyline.

       No idea why that deserved a downvote, here's one from me. I mean really, everything is just about tightening the grip on us. Say terrorism and you can do whatever you want.

       Well when it was the elite, it didn't cause any panic, except the type of panic that, we shouldn't trust our leaders.  Although they have just turned this into a push to find evil pedophiles, but somehow refuse to address these sex slave rings among the world's elite.  People weren't panicked about pedophilia when this came out, they for the first time for many of them, began to do something most people here do regularly.  They started to question all authority.

       I don't even understand what you're trying to say, it doesn't make any sense.  I really don't think you even know what you're talking about.  What is my pet peeve?  Because I can go on about banksters and many other subjects.  You don't think that what is happening here is directly linked to such things?  I think they're intertwined.

       All of the sideshow distractions are intertwined with the banksters. This subreddit lost it's focus about 6 years ago. It now highlights the sideshow distractions and ignores the banksters by and large - much like your self-post.

       I used to love this sub but honestly it seems like its been the exact same circle jerk for the past year, either someones anti-Semitic or anti-palestinian, pro black or pro white. I no longer see a point in talking about everywhere that our country is failing. Charlie Hedbo is the top headline right now, but whether you mention the sex slave rings in the government or not, no one is going to stop it. Definitely a tragedy, but I feel like the Charlie Hedbo story deserves a lot more media attention than the wealthy. Because unless you start a separate news station, not controlled by mass media, youre only pissing in the wind.
Not trying to make waves here, im just confused.

       Charlie Hedbo had fired previous cartoonists for making cartoons they claimed were anti-Semetic, so I find it very hard to believe that anti-Muslim rhetoric is actually about Free Speech.  I think you have to read more into the story, because Charlie Hedbo has regularly attacked the Muslim religion, and argues it is Free Speech, and does the complete opposite when there is criticism of Israel.  It just shows they have an agenda that has nothing to do with Free Speech.  I'm against Israeli abuses, I'm against ISIS abuses, I'm against what is happening in the United States against the black community, I'm against corruption that jails Police Officers who try to expose these abuses.  Everyone just seems to be using Charlie Hedbo as reasoning to blame all Muslims, and for more military action in various places, which is disturbing.  15 people died from a few terrorists, so let's go bomb another 100 civilians?  We're just going to go round in circles with that mentality.

       That wasnt what I was hoping for but definitely the pretentious response that ive now come to expect from this sub. I usually never comment on reddit at all for this same reason.
I think that we are all aware of how our country is messed up, this sub has been #1 on the subject for a while, I see no point in reiterating once a week on the exact same content.
I dont think Hebdo deserves a lot more media attention, thats not the case at all, but are any of you honestly waiting for the day that the news covers all of the corruption and "sex slaves" in our government? If so, youre going to be waiting a long time.
What I think in really trying to say is im tired of seeing the same stuff here and not a single person here even considering doing anything about it, all ive seen is "arghh im angry this is happening" "me too!" And thats it. Knowing doesnt do anything when no one knows any way to fix the problems.
Not that it matters, im just becoming disappointed in this sub.
