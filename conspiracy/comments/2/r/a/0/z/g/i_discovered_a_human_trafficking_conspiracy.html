        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this belongs here but anyways</p>

<p>I am a conspiracy theorist, well sort of. No, this is not a fantasy story,  not even a NoSleep.</p>

<p>I have a friend who works for a government agency, and knows me from way back, and knows that I am always crazy about conspiracy theories and such. Around a year ago I started this &quot;cyber security and surveillance&quot; agency. I put that in quotes since it is just me and another friend, no office just a website, our tools, and our knowledge.</p>

<p>My friend at the government agency approached me, and convinced me to take freelance investigation jobs. First job was to investigate this Indian movie that was being shot in our country. As soon as they gave us the case, I knew there was something fishy. </p>

<p>Long story short, there was no movie at all. It was a cover up to bring people from India, Indonesia and Vietnam so that they could go to the USA. There were at least seven cops and 4 high ranking migration officers involved in this cover up, each one received at least USD $2,000 per person. We managed to caught them with conclusive evidence (footage, videos, recordings) and all was done by working undercover.</p>

<p>Of course, for our safety, our work didn&#39;t get to our media:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2014/08/29/pnc-investigo-trafico-ilicito-desde-la-india">http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2014/08/29/pnc-investigo-trafico-ilicito-desde-la-india</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2014/09/03/migracion-confirma-que-pelicula-sirvio-para-trafico">http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2014/09/03/migracion-confirma-que-pelicula-sirvio-para-trafico</a></p>

<p>I still work as a freelance for them, however tonight someone tried (or was successful) to enter to my facebook account. That person who tried to access my account was from India, according to facebook:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/XcAHaHa">http://imgur.com/XcAHaHa</a></p>

<p>Back in India, there were no arrests. The &quot;studios&quot; that produced the film (and 24 more persons from India that I pinpointed) were not accused of human trafficking, for some odd reason, even though that same studios have headquarters in the Caymans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m proud of my work, at the same time worried. Don&#39;t know what will happen the following weeks. It was probably my mistake to trust the reports we made to that government agency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in a casino and have heard that three of our pretty high rollers are involved in human trafficking. They are 3 oddballs that dont have regular jobs and are ALWAYS dropping tons of cash. They spend weeks there at a time. I looked up the addresses we had for them in our system and one of them is some shitty section 8 housing and the other one is a run down office area on the outskirts of downtown. Real fishy. Edit* I should also mention that I live in a city with access to a large port where this problem has been growing like wildfire. </p>
