        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Are you taking a multi-vitamin that’s killing you slowly? Did you think you were doing the right thing by jiggling that little pill out of its container and washing it down your throat every day in the name of health and wellness? Which ones are you taking; One-a-day, Centrum, Equate, or maybe you just picked up some of Sam’s club’s “Members Mark Complete?” Sounds like a real winner! Wait a second, it could be even worse. You might have gone and done the unthinkable, and you bought your children Flintstones vitamins. Tell me it’s not true.</p>

<p>Did you know Pfizer owns “Centrum?” Did you know Bayer owns “One-a-Day?” Walking into a nutritional nightmare is easy if you don’t know the “low down” on supplements. Dangerous supplements can reverse what you are trying to accomplish. Also, many multivitamins, especially the chewable ones, contain Aspartame, one of the leading causes of Fibromyalgia and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).</p>

<p>Have you really read the label, researched any of the synthetic additives, or checked out the “other ingredients,” or did you just figure that was irrelevant? If you are guilty of taking any of the aforementioned supplements, it’s time to buy some liver, kidney, and colon detoxification, and you better educate yourself about those too, because “The Man” wants you sick and dying, not avoiding toxic vitamin imposters that are NOT ABSORBABLE by the body. Dangerous, mind-blowing additives in your crappy vitamins that are listed as “other ingredients” include: talc, dyes, sodium benzoate, methylcellulose, carnauba wax, silicon and/or titanium dioxide. In all of these cases, what you don’t know WILL hurt you!</p>

<p>Most vitamins in supplements are petroleum extracts, coal tar derivatives, and chemically processed sugar (plus sometimes industrially processed fish oils), with other acids and industrial chemicals (such as formaldehyde) used to process them. Synthetic vitamins were originally developed because they cost less. Assuming the non-food product does not contain fish oils, most synthetic, petroleum-derived.</p>

<p>If your vitamins come in the form of gelatin capsules, you are more than likely consuming the skin, cartilage, connective tissues and bones of diseased animals. On top of that, if your vitamins contain the artificial sweeteners Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose or Sorbitol, you could be developing artificial sweetener disease (cancer) and mutating your cells, your DNA, and passing that mutagenic DNA along to future generations.</p>

<p>Don’t feel dumb if you did not know that synthetic B-12 comes from activated sewage sludge just don’t be a repeat offender! Your “corporate” made vitamins are made by pharmaceutical and chemical companies who also concocted chemotherapy. It’s just another angle to handle the threat of people getting healthy from nutritional information, and so you’ve been deceived.</p>

<p>Eggs---
One large egg contains about 0.45mcg of vitamin B12, or about 19 percent of the recommended daily intake, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. They are also abundant sources of vitamin A, as well as niacin, iron, pantothenic acid, sodium and selenium.
Synthetic vitamin B-12, cyanocobalamin, is made from ground up toxic cow livers and activated sewage sludge. These cow livers are overloaded with steroids and antibiotics, and the pesticides the cow assimilates from eating GMO feed, and these cows are living in CAFO’s (confined animal feeding operations), where they often collapse and die slowly, while lying in their own “sludge” or fecal matter. Synthetic vitamin B also comes from coal tar and petro-chemicals, known to depress the central nervous system and cause respiratory ailments.</p>

<p>Vitamins are not individual molecular compounds. Vitamins are natural biological complexes. Vitamins are living complexes which contribute to other higher living complexes – like cell repair, collagen manufacture, and maintenance of blood circulation.</p>

<p><strong>Most vitamins sold are not food–they are synthetically processed petroleum and/or hydrogenated sugar extracts</strong>–even if they say “natural” on the label. They are not in the same chemical form or structural form as real vitamins are in foods; thus they are not natural for the human body. True natural food vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Food vitamins are functionally superior to non-food vitamins as they tend to be preferentially absorbed and/or retained by the body. Isolated, non-food vitamins, even when not chemically different are only fractionated nutrients.</p>

<p>Even though natural health professionals agree that humans should not try to consume petroleum derivatives or hydrogenated sugars, most seem to overlook this fact when vitamin supplementation is involved.</p>

<p>Most non-food vitamins are isolated substances which are crystalline in structure. Vitamins naturally in food are not crystalline and never isolated. Vitamins found in any real food are chemically and structurally different from those commonly found in ‘natural vitamin’ formulas. Since they are different, we should consider non-food vitamins as vitamin analogues (imitations) and not actually vitamins.</p>

<p>A vitamin is--</p>

<p>“a working process consisting of the nutrient, enzymes, coenzymes, antioxidants, and trace minerals activators.”</p>

</ul>

<p>Polarized Light, A True Reflection</p>

<p>The difference between synthetic and natural vitamins becomes apparent when viewing their response to a beam of polarized light. The light when passing through a natural vitamin will always bend to the right due to it’s molecular rotation. Thus the letter “d” (representing “dextro” which means “right”) often appears on labels. However, the same light ray when passing through a synthetic vitamin will split into two parts, one part bending to the right and the other to the left. Because the synthetic vitamin is half “dextro” (right) and half “levo” (left), the letters “dl” often appear on labels at the beginning of the synthetic name.</p>

<p>A synthetic vitamin is like the image in a mirror. It looks like the real thing but doesn’t function like the real thing. Half of it will work in the body and the other half won’t work as well. Dr. Charles Schneider, Ph.D., professor of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati concluded wisely, “Get the vitamins that say natural. There is a difference. The “dl” (synthetic) will be cheaper, but if you could figure it out per energy unit or per use, the natural one will be cheaper.”</p>

<p>Which would you rather have, the food in the mirror … or the real food?</p>

<p>Toxic Ingredients</p>

<p>toxic dyes
Chemical dyes in vitamins can be carcinogenic
Check the labels on your nutritional supplements – do they list magnesium stearate or stearic acid as ingredients? “Natural“ Flavours? Sodium Benzoate or Potassium Sorbate? Stearates have been shown to suppress the immune system.  Natural flavours is often used when the product contains MSG, or monosodium-glutamate, a known brain neurotoxin.  Sodium benzoate is carcinogenic.  Stearates are used in many capsules and tablets; “Natural” flavors in lots of protein drinks, and sodium benzoate as a preservative in many liquid vitamin supplements or juice drinks.</p>

<p>It is also common to find ingredients in vitamins and nutritional supplements that have been irradiated, fumigated or contaminated with pesticide residues.  In fact, up to 70% of raw materials that are imported into the US today are irradiated.  This irradiation process creates toxic radiation by-products, that remain in the ingredients that you ingest.</p>

<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an excipient as:  an usually inert substance (such as gum arabic or starch) that forms a vehicle (as for a drug).  The International Pharmaceutical Council of the Americas states that “excipients are substances other than the pharmacologically active ingredients which are included in the manufacturing process or are contained in a finished product.  In many products, excipients make up the bulk of the total dosage form.”</p>

<p>Excipients are used in nutritional supplements and vitamins for many reasons, as fillers, lubricants, colors that liven up the product, preservatives, sweeteners, and  coatings and glazes that make it easier to swallow.  Many of the excipients, especially the lubricants, are used to make it easier and cheaper  for the company to manufacture.</p>

<p>One example is talc, a suspected carcinogen, that is used in many capsules for vitamins and other nutritional supplements today when they are manufactured with a high-speed encapsulator.  It makes the ingredients flow faster and therefore it is much cheaper to make when the talc is included.</p>

<p>Although many doctors have been taught that food and non-food vitamins have the same chemical composition, this is simply untrue for most vitamins. As the chemical forms of food and synthetic nutrients are normally different. Its important to understand that since there is no mandated definition of the term ‘natural’; just seeing that term on a label does not mean that the supplement contains only natural food substances. One of the best ways to tell whether or not a vitamin supplement contains natural vitamins as found in food is to know the chemical differences between food and non-food vitamins (sometimes called USP vitamins).</p>

It&#39;s a wall of buzzwords and you can easily spend a half hour on your search engine seeing that his specific claims (sewer sludge, aspartame causing cancer, msg being neurotoxic etc) are lies based on faulty research, research that is 30 years old and unable to be replicated, and research that has been debunked over and over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re an idiot, of course detoxification is a real thing.  I&#39;ll name you a toxin: mercury.  It&#39;s building up in basically all food-chains, and is very hard to excrete.  It is definitely possible to detoxify your body of heavy metals, have you never heard of chelation therapy?

<ol>
<li>Op said that people who take multivitamins need to stop and detox.</li>
<li>Aimforhead said Op suspiciously doesn&#39;t say what toxins need to be detoxed.</li>
<li>Caitdrum said the toxin is mercury. (also not understanding the issue, which is that op&#39;s claim is suspect not because heavy metals are a problem but because op has claimed people who take multivitamins need to detox despite not offering any toxins caused by multivitamins.</li>
<li>Subilmefly is pointing out that the toxins in question need to be caused by multivitamins in order for Caitdrums&#39; argument to make sense.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to your local hippy dippy organic market and browse the products there.  That puts you into the right category.  Just basically don&#39;t ever buy vitamins from your typical store in America unless you know from other sources that it is fine.  Just assume that its all garbage in main stream stores until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>I take my vitamins from processed vegatables.  Basically then its a vegetable extract.  Among some other issues something that the OP didn&#39;t discuss is that plant roots absorb naturally the kinds of tiny particles that the plant cells (and our cells) can process, but if its made from ore then the particles could be much too large and bound in a way that isn&#39;t helpful.  As an example of a form of calcium that is not so easily digestable is calcium carbonate (chalk).  You will get only some minimal calcium nutrition from it and there are better forms then just ground up chalk.  Ideally you would source calcium from somewhere down the line on the other end of a plant root stalk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to note, vitamins play an equilibrium game in the body, if you overshoot on one, it will have consequences on some others, and then domino effect.... and you never fix the lack in the end, you make it worse. True for all vitamin except C, you can have as much as you want of that one, but any non-alimentary vitamin supplements you take, you should actually take all the vitamins together along with the lacking one to ensure you fix your equilibrium instead of throwing it off further.

<p>The water soluble vitamins are best obtained through organic produce grown in mineral-rich soil. The best supplements in this category are the top-shelf green foods, like David Sandoval’s Best of Greens, and its equivalents.</p>

<p>The fat soluble vitamins, A, E, and D are best obtained through fish, raw organic dairy (if possible), avocado, raw nuts, raw coconut, and clean meats. High end supplements like Udo’s Choice, MOR, and Nordic Naturals can round out your EFA requirements.</p>

<p>TL/DR
-The best source of vitamins is food grown in an organic rich soil that for the most part does not exist. That means we need to supplement.
-Cheap supplements are petroleum based. Not only not does the body not absorb these like they should, but they can and often are detrimental to health.
-Take the time time to research what you are putting in your body and what effects those substances have.</p>

<p>Whole Food Vitamins, Slick Marketing &amp; Media Control
Bayer was sued after running TV and radio ads that suggested the company’s One A Day vitamin supplement can prevent prostate cancer. Bayer had to pay a fine and signed a legal agreement banning the ads. Whole food vitamins are obtained by taking a vitamin-rich plant, removing the water and the fiber in a cold vacuum process, free of chemicals, and then packaging for stability. The entire vitamin complex in this way can be captured intact, retaining its “functional and nutritional integrity.” Upon ingestion, the body is not required to draw on its own reserves in order to complete any missing elements from the vitamin complex.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Well, you may now have some insight that your vitamin needs are not being met by the majority of Vitamin &amp; Supplement manufacturers. Those in the know used to joke about expensive urine from these unmetabolized grocery store synthetic placebos.</p>

<p>Today, what everybody does know is Pepsi and Viagra and Wonder Bread and Prednisone and Double Whoppers with Cheese and Zantac and Baskin-Robbins and grocery store vitamins: synthetic vitamins. That’s America and most of the World today as the product of yesterday. Control of information worldwide today is one of the most sophisticated systems of influence ever devised. The simple ideas contained in this post are simply not available to the mass consciousness. The documentation is out there, but you really have to do a lot of research.
100 years ago if a medical doctor saw a case of cancer he would call all his colleagues to come and have a look, telling them it was unlikely they would see another case, as cancer was so rare. People rarely died of heart attacks; in fact the term heart attack itself didn’t even exist. There was no incidence at all of atherosclerosis. Diabetes was practically unheard of. What did they eat? Fruits, vegetables, meat, butter, and lard. </p>

<p>But none of it was processed with drugs and chemicals.</p>

<p>Today one in three dies of cancer. One in two dies of heart disease. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. (Vital Statistics) For anyone born after 2003, there is a one in 3 chance of Type 2 diabetes. Is that progress? If you are a food manufacturer it is, and especially if you are a drug manufacturer. In 2007 the WHO ranked the US as #39 in the world in infant mortality. Male sperm count is less than 20% of what it was in 1929. (1981 University of Florida report, Natural vs. Synthetic) Infant mortality is up; birth defects are up. The US spends $1.5 trillion per year for health care, most of which goes for administration and executive salaries. Who are the largest advertisers for TV and the printed media? Right: drug companies and food manufacturers. Do they want to keep the ball rolling? You bet. Will they kill you to do it? You bet. Do they want people to take charge of their own health by natural inexpensive foods and supplements? Negative. A cure for cancer has been “right around the corner” since Nixon. People are starting to ask questions; they’re less inclined to believe the slick ads coming every 10 minutes on TV and in Glossy Magazines. So what to choose?</p>

<p>Nutritional yeast is made from a single-celled organism, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, which is grown on molasses and then harvested, washed, and dried.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (the primary yeast used in baking and brewing) is beneficial to humans and can help combat various infections, including Candida albicans. In the text, Medical Mycology John Rippon (Ph.D., Mycology, University of Chicago) wrote, “There are over 500 known species of yeast, all distinctly different. And although the so-called bad yeasts do exist, the controversy in the natural foods industry regarding yeast related to health problems which is causing many health-conscious people to eliminate all yeast products from their diet is ridiculous.? It should also be noted, that W. Crook, M.D., perhaps the nation’s best known expert on Candida albicans, wrote, “yeasty foods don’t encourage candida growth…Eating a yeast-containing food does not make candida organisms multiply”. Some people, however, are allergic to the cell-wall of yeast and concerned supplement companies which have nutrient-containing yeast normally have had the cell-wall enzymatically processed to reduce even this unlikely occurrence.</p>

<p>Food Vitamins are Superior to Non-Food Vitamins</p>

<p>Although many mainstream health professionals believe, “The body cannot tell whether a vitamin in the bloodstream came from an organically grown cantaloupe or from a chemist’s laboratory”, this belief is quite misleading for several reasons. First it seems to assume that the process of getting the amount of the vitamin into the bloodstream is the same (which is frequently not the case. Secondly, scientists understand that particle size is an important factor in nutrient absorption even though particle size is not detected by chemical assessment. Thirdly, scientists also understand that, “The food factors that influence the absorption of nutrients relate not only to the nature of the nutrients themselves, but also their interaction with each other and with the nonabsorbable components of food”. Fourthly, “the physiochemical form of a nutrient is a major factor in bioavailability” (and food and non-food vitamins are not normally in the same form). Fifthly, most non-food vitamins are crystalline in structure.</p>

<p>The Food &amp; Drug laws seem to be suspended where synthetic imitations of good foods are concerned, and actually perverted to prosecute makers and sellers of real products…The synthetic product is always a simple chemical substance, while the natural is a complex mixture of related and similar materials…Pure natural Vitamin E was found three times as potent as pure synthetic Vitamin E. Of course the poisonous nature of the synthetic Vitamin D…is well established. These facts are almost always hidden or suppressed by the Big Pharma cartel and their complicit media, and most in the medical profession are never properly educated about these facts.</p>

<p>The difference is more than quantitative.</p>

<p>ORP---Let’s take vitamin C for an example. Even if one were to take 3.2 times as much of the so-called natural, non-food, ascorbic acid than food vitamin C, although the antioxidant effects might be similar in vitro, the ascorbic acid still will not contain DHAA, nor will it ever have negative oxidative reductive potential (ORP). A simple in vitro study with a digital ORP meter demonstrated that a citrus food vitamin C has negative ORP, but that ascorbic acid had positive ORP.</p>

<p>It takes negative ORP to clean up oxidative damage, and since ascorbic acid has positive ORP (as well as positive redox potential, it can never replace food vitamin C no matter what the quantity! Furthermore, foods which are high in vitamin C tend to have high Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC, another test which measures the ability of foods and other compounds to subdue oxygen free radicals. A US government study which compared the in vivo effects of a high vitamin C food (containing 80 mg of vitamin C) compared to about 15.6 times as much isolated ascorbic acid (1250 mg) found that the vitamin C-containing food produced the greatest increase in blood antioxidant levels (it is believed that bioflavonoids and other food factors are responsible).</p>

<p>Published scientific research has concluded, “natural vitamins are nutritionally superior to synthetic ones”.</p>

<p>Food vitamins are in the physiochemical forms which the body recognizes, generally are not crystalline in structure, contain food factors that affect bioavailability, and appear to have smaller particle sizes. This does not mean that non-food vitamins do not have any value (they clearly do), but it is important to understand that natural food complex vitamins have actually been shown to be better than isolated, non-food, vitamins.</p>

<p>Each of the other synergists in the C complex has a separate function:</p>

<p>– P factors for blood vessel strength,
– J factors for oxygen-carrying capacity of red cells,
– tyrosinase as an essential enzyme for enhancing white blood cell effectiveness.</p>

<p>Ascorbic acid is just the antioxidant outer shell – the protector of all these other synergists so that they will be able to perform their individual functions.</p>

<p>No matter how much isolated ascorbic acid one takes orally it will never saturate plasma and/or tissue vitamin C levels significantly more than can be obtained by consuming sufficient vitamin C containing foods.
-It will never have negative ORP, thus can never ‘clean-up’ oxidative damage like food vitamin C can.
-It will never have the free radical fightin))g capacity of food vitamin C.
-It will never contain DHAA (the other ‘half’ of vitamin C) or the promoting food factors.
-It will never have the same effect on health issues, such as aging and cardiovascular disease as high vitamin C foods can.
-It will not ever be utilized the way food vitamin C is.
-It will always be a synthetic.
real-food-versus-vitamin-supplements</p>

<p>Let’s take vitamin E as another example—the body has a specific liver transport for the type of vitamin E found in food—it does not have this for the synthetic vitamin E forms (nor for the ‘new’ vitamin E analogues that are frequently marketed)—thus no amount of synthetic vitamin E can truly equal food vitamin E—the human body actually tries to rid itself of synthetic vitamin E as quickly as possible. As another example, it should be understood that certain forms of vitamin analogues of B-6, D, and biotin have been shown to have almost no vitamin activity.</p>

<p>What are the best sources of Food Vitamins?</p>

<p>Carrots, yellow and green leafy vegetables, and turmeric contain natural betacarotene along with multiple carotenoids. Natural betacarotene was found to significantly decrease serum conjugated diene levels for children exposed to high levels of irradiation.</p>

<p>Most fruits contain vitamin A, but the following fruits have a significant amount: Cantaloupes, Grapefruit, Guava, Mango, Papaya, Passionfruit Tomatoes, Watermelon. Vegetables: Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Carrots, Chinese Broccoli, Chinese Cabbage, Kale
Beef, legumes, cereal grains, yeast, and fish are significant natural food sources of vitamin B.
The vegetarian foods which are highest in natural pantothenate (B-5) are nutritional yeast, brown rice, peanuts, and broccoli. Specifically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (nutritional yeast not brewers yeast) is one of the best natural sources of food pantothenate
The highest concentrations of folate (B- 9) exist in yeast and brocolli.
PABA (B co-factor) is found in foods such as kidney, liver, molasses, fungal foods, spinach, and whole grains.
Vitamin B7 is generally produced in the intestine, in the presence of healthy intestinal flora. Cereals, pulses and legumes, vegetables, nuts and beef liver contain biotin. Rice bran, rice germ, barley, whole wheat and brown rice are rich sources of biotin. Vegetable sources include mushrooms and cauliflower, while walnuts, peanuts, peanut butter and almonds also contain this vitamin.
While nutritional yeast is probably the best source of inositol (B co-factor), it is also found in fruits, lecithin, legumes, meats, milk, unrefined molasses, raisins, vegetables, and whole grains.
Phosphatidyl-choline is the major delivery form of choline (B co-factor), and is naturally found in many foods such as beef liver, egg yolks, and soya. Specially grown nutritional yeast appears to be the best food form for supplements.</p>

<p>Vitamin C naturally occurs in fruits, (especially citrus fruits like oranges and limes) in two ascorbate forms with bioflavonoids. Whole food vitamin C is also found in potatoes, onions. Also, Black Currants, Breadfruit, Grapefruit, Guava, Kiwi, Lychee, Mango, Mulberries, Papaya, Passionfruit, Pineapple, Strawberries, Amaranth Leaves, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Green Pepper, Kale, Cod, Perch, Goat Milk.</p>

<p>Vitamin D is known as the “sunshine vitamin” since it is manufactured by the body after being exposed to sunshine. Ten to fifteen minutes of good sunshine three times weekly is adequate to produce the body’s requirement of vitamin D. This means that we don’t need to obtain vitamin D from our diet unless we get very little sunlight. Mushrooms are a good source of Vitamin D.</p>

<p>Natural vitamin E “as found in foods is [d]-alpha tocopherol. Vitamin E content is highest in vegetable oils, also relatively high in avocados.
Dark leafy vegetables, as well as cabbage, appear to be the primary food source of vitamin K.
Fruits and vegetables shoppingThe bioavailability of food vitamins is better than that of most isolated USP vitamins, that they may have better effects on maintaining aspects of human health beyond traditional vitamin deficiency syndromes, and at least some seem to be preferentially retained by the human body. It is not always clear if these advantages are due to the physiochemical form of the vitamin, with the other food constituents that are naturally found with them, or some combination. Regardless, it seems logical to conclude that for purposes of maintaining normal health, natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones. Unlike some synthetic vitamins, no natural vitamin has been found to not perform all of its natural functions. The truth is that only foods, or supplements composed of 100% foods, can be counted on as not containing non-food vitamin analogues. So the best way to build health is from foods or nutrients contained in foods.</p>

<p><strong>Most vitamins cannot be made by the body</strong>. They must be taken in as food. The best sources then are obviously whole foods, rich in vitamins. Because of soil depletion, mineral depletion, pesticides, air pollution, and erosion, it is common knowledge that foods grown in many of the world’s commercially farmed soils today have only a fraction of the nutrient value of 50 years ago.</p>

<p>Vitamins and minerals are not functionally separable. They make each other work. Example: vitamin D is necessary for the body to absorb calcium. Copper is necessary for vitamin C activity. And so on. Mineral deficiencies can cause vitamin deficiencies, and vice versa. So that is the other prime difference between whole food vitamins and synthetics: whole food vitamins contain within them many essential trace minerals necessary for their synergistic operation. Synthetic vitamins contain no trace minerals, relying on, and depleting, the body’s own mineral reserves.</p>

<p>The earth’s immune system is its soil. To be vital and capable of growing vital foods, <strong>soil must be rich in both minerals and soil-based organisms</strong> – life forms. Healthy produce naturally resists insects. Insects are like bad bacteria in the body: they are attracted to diseased tissue, though they do not cause it.</p>

<p>Whether or not we need supplementation is no longer an issue, except for one who is totally out of touch. The issue is what kind and how much.</p>
