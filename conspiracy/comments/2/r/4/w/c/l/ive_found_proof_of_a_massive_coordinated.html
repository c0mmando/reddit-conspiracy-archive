        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;ve been on <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> recently you&#39;ve probably noticed that every single day at least 4 out of the top 10 articles are attack pieces against Comcast. At first I thought this was because reddit just hates Comcast, but as I analyzed the posting trends, I noticed quite a few oddities in the posts that reach the front page. </p>

<p>Check this out. </p>

<p>Yesterday an article was posted about <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2r0iy2/google_fibers_latest_fcc_filing_is_comcasts/">Google Fiber&#39;s attempts to get the FCC to grant them utility pole access.</a> This post recieved 4,933 upvotes and was the #1 story on <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> yesterday. In the thread <a href="/u/skyxsteel">/u/skyxsteel</a> made <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2r0iy2/google_fibers_latest_fcc_filing_is_comcasts/cnbbyiu">this comment</a>, which received 1,062 upvotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m tired of the whole &quot;it&#39;s free market as long as I get to do what I want&quot; argument these monopolies throw out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, <a href="/u/500500">/u/500500</a> posted <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2r3cnb/google_fiber_asks_fcc_for_utility_pole_access/">this article</a> 8 hours ago. It is literally the same exact article as the one posted yesterday, except its from a different source. It currently has 800 upvotes and is the #3 post on the front page of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> right now. In his thread, he made <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2r3cnb/google_fiber_asks_fcc_for_utility_pole_access/cnc91ns">this comment.</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m tired of the whole &quot;it&#39;s free market as long as I get to do what I want&quot; argument these monopolies throw out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar? It&#39;s the same exact comment that another user made yesterday. Looks like someone deviated from the script. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="/u/500500">/u/500500</a>&#39;s <a href="http://np.reddit.com/user/500500/submitted/?sort=top">most successful posts</a> in <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>, almost all of them are attacks against Comcast that gained thousands of upvotes and were on the front page of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. </p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more. <a href="/u/500500">/u/500500</a> also made <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2r147t/google_fibers_latest_fcc_filing_is_comcasts/">this thread</a> in <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. Familiar? It&#39;s the <em>same exact title</em> of the first post I linked to, submitted 6 hours <em>after</em> that post hit the front page. So why in the world did this post receive 1,187 upvotes? Who would see a post with the exact same title and upvote it? </p>

<p>Something fishy is going on here. Looking back at his posting history he&#39;d often post articles that were on the front page the day before (oftentimes using the same exact headline) and it&#39;d receive thousands of upvotes regardless if it was old news or not. Very fishy. </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t they one in the same?</p>

<p>But seriously, is dissing Comcast really something a corporation like Google or Verizon would pay to have done, when people already hate Comcast with a passion? That&#39;d be like KFC buying all the ad space in a town that only has a KFC.</p>

<p>They can be. What I meant is that the OP always posts a submission for a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; in a sense because nobody can truly know the OP&#39;s intentions. Whether it&#39;s simply for karma or if it&#39;s to spread an agenda are different things.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How do you know that people already hate Comcast with a passion when it could have been Google/Verizon paying to seed such a thought to begin with? Also, I don&#39;t find your analogy to be apt. </p>

<p>So to make sure I&#39;m clear, your only reasoning for you being certain that it&#39;s a karma whore is Occam&#39;s razor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit on an interesting point. Do we hate comcast, or are we told to hate comcast?</p>

<p>I hate comcast because they call me all the time to try to upsell me, which is objectively annoying. I think Google is simply speeding things up. Conspiracy or not, I&#39;ll take Google fiber over comcast even if it means Googl owns my traffic. The way iI see it, between their search engine and their mobile OS, and gmail, they already do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the awful service I&#39;ve had from Comcast, the lobbying they do to Congress (as does every major corporation, so fuck them all), and the high price for such awful service, I&#39;d say their hate is well-earned (as is any other US telecom&#39;s).</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about Occam&#39;s Razor. I&#39;m not the user in question, nor can I read minds, nor have I asked them directly. How else would I reach my opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit on an interesting point. Do we hate comcast, or are we told to hate comcast?</p>

<p>I hate comcast because they call me all the time to try to upsell me, which is objectively annoying. I think Google is simply speeding things up. Conspiracy or not, I&#39;ll take Google fiber over comcast even if it means Googl owns my traffic. The way iI see it, between their search engine and their mobile OS, and gmail, they already do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the awful service I&#39;ve had from Comcast, the lobbying they do to Congress (as does every major corporation, so fuck them all), and the high price for such awful service, I&#39;d say their hate is well-earned (as is any other US telecom&#39;s).</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about Occam&#39;s Razor. I&#39;m not the user in question, nor can I read minds, nor have I asked them directly. How else would I reach my opinion?</p>
