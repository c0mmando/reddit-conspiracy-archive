        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/12/23/whole-foods-sued-for-false-non-gmo-labeling/">From Jon Rappoport:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Regulation/Whole-Foods-sued-over-non-GMO-Project-labels-on-Almond-Breeze">The case is Michelle Richard v. Whole Foods,</a> as reported by the Food Navigator (12/5/14) and other press outlets.</p>

<p>The plaintiff’s claim? Whole Foods advertised and sold Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Almond Milk and Vanilla Almond Milk with non-GMO labels, when these products hadn’t been verified as such by <a href="http://www.nongmoproject.org/">the Non-GMO Project.</a></p>

<p>The Non-GMO Project is, by far, the largest North American group that tests and verifies food products as non-GMO, and grants the use of its “Verified” seal.</p>

<p>Concerning the lawsuit, Whole Foods declined to comment. The Non-GMO Project declined to comment. Blue Diamond declined to comment.</p>

<p>“Ongoing litigation…we weren’t involved…confidentiality of clients…”</p>

<p>Other Blue Diamond almond products bearing the non-GMO seal have been approved by the Non-GMO Project. So is this simply a case of a clerical error?</p>

<p>The plaintiff certainly doesn’t think her lawsuit is trivial. This is a class-action suit, so there are other plaintiffs.</p>

<p>The big question is, are there other products on the shelves at Whole Foods which claim to be non-GMO, but aren’t verified?</p>

<p>In 2013, Whole Foods announced a plan to label every product in its stores, so customers could tell whether or not they contain GMOs. <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/our-commitment-gmo-labeling">The deadline is 2018.</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Whole Foods states they are working with their suppliers to vastly increase the number of non-GMO food products available to customers.</p>

<p><a href="http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/43801-whole-foods-hit-gmo-labeling-class-action-lawsuit/">As reported by topclassactions.com (11/10/15)</a>, plaintiff Richard claims she “purchased the Almond Breeze products at one to two times per week between January and June [at Whole Foods].” Is she asserting that the unverified and illegitimate non-GMO label has been present on those products for six months?</p>

<p>If the case moves forward, and is not dismissed by a judge, we’ll find out more.</p>

<p>On its website, <a href="https://www.bluediamond.com/index.cfm?navId=207">Blue Diamond states</a> that it uses no GMOs in its almond products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole debate is silly. There are no GMO almonds, none have been developed. The label is useless as all almonds are non-GMO. Furthermore, a GMO label is useless as it doesn&#39;t convey any meaningful nutrition or safety information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It defines the limits of what can safely be implied. If we have two cars one that had been produced identically for 8 years one that has all new parts and had a few safety tests the new car has more unknown unknowns. If consumers wish to made their decisions on established rather than inferred risk why shouldn&#39;t they? Being a new adopter of any technology is inherently risky including food technology. It&#39;s inaccurate to say novelty is not information about safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of food at whole foods that a person could only willingly want to eat if they&#39;re ignorant.</p>

<p>Heck, virtually every single item in the store has something fatally flawed with its nutritional value, in part due to poisoning by the establishment.</p>

<p>How about eating a nice organic orange? Well.. that orange was grown with fluoridated water, so now that fluoride will just accumulate and accumulate in your body.</p>

<p>How about a nice loaf of organic whole wheat bread? Well.. wheat has been bred to contain too much sugar. The flour also contains malted barley extract (there are other bad ingredients in breads at whole foods), which is a blacklisted ingredient for anyone who knows anything about excitotoxins.</p>

<p>How about the harmless looking olives that have citric acid as a preservative? Well, citric acid comes from GMO corn GMO mold secretions, laced with mercury and excitotoxins.</p>

<p>I could take a walk in whole foods and literally everything you point at, I can invent a legit excuse why you should not be thrilled about purchasing it. Unfortunately, it&#39;s either shop there or die of starvation. Or, buy my own farm and make damn sure to get a good well system with excellent filtration for watering everything (this could be a complete nightmare now that so much pollution exists, i.e. from fracking, chemtrails, etc.).</p>

<p>As a hobby baker, I recommend getting a grain grinder and learning to make your own bread. Grinding a cup of wheat only takes five minutes and the rest can go in a bread machine. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.lehmans.com/p-45-diamant-grain-mill.aspx?show=all">Some people use the all-cast iron Diamet grinder, but it costs between $500 and $1800 depending on where you get it. And used models aren&#39;t common.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i buy black rice instead of making my own bread. but when i was experimenting with that awhile back, i would use flaxseed meal. actually i might want to go back to doing that.</p>

<p>i also don&#39;t use yeast, b/c yeast is kinda iffy for me if it&#39;s <a href="http://www.truthinlabeling.org/hiddensources.html">excitotoxin containing or not</a>. i don&#39;t eat anything fermented (anymore)- that means if it&#39;s a bacteria (or in this case- single celled fungi eukaryote organisms), i&#39;m not going to cook with it.</p>

<p>but what i used to do and might start doing again is i&#39;d throw the flaxseed meal in a corningwear stone bowl, add water/eggs, and then basically just microwave that bitch like it&#39;s cereal. i also can do oatmeal every now and then. whole foods seems to have at least 1-2 decent oatmeals i think.</p>
