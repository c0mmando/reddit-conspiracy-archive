<p>It&#39;s two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>to setup precedence to blame the upcoming financial collapse on l33t North Korea h4x0rs, and</li>
<li>to further lock down the internet with strict regulation -- much like one of these school shootings and stricter gun control laws.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with LetsHack (obviously), and am both frustrated and excited at the sheer number of these threads. Either we&#39;re being successfully meta-trolled, or there are far more out there questioning the Official Version if an Event than ever before, and I bet the regulars here remember how it was with the Ebola- and ISIS-crises.</p>

<p>This was a poor play, with numerous holes, and people are actually researching things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating because LetsHack, myself, and a bunch of others have had to jump into every thread and say our piece, but it&#39;s also exciting because we&#39;ve had to do it far more than we used to. </p>

<p>The sun is shining a little bit brighter on me at the moment, and it feels nice.</p>

<p>Agree totally on this motive. The &quot;reaction&quot; of Obama was totally transparent.</p>

<p>As to whether they would be silly enough to try to blame a financial collapse on NK? Seems unlikely - but it does provide premise for blaming it on <em>some</em> third-party nation - such as China, Russia, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to know if any of the personal info was real anyway. I ultimately do find it more likely that Sony was hacked, but just can&#39;t rely on media to fact check anything like this....and I&#39;m dubious where a major corporation seems to be profiting over it.  So, I find it reasonable to question even if I&#39;m yet to be persuaded it wasn&#39;t a real hack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>posting this here after my frustration with trying to get people to hear me out. i&#39;ve been calling this Sony thing step by step since the 17th when the initial &quot;terrorist threats&quot; were reported. i have seen the whole scheme from the beginning and people said i was crazy and being extreme. so far, things have progressed almost exactly as i outlined in a post i made on the 19th, to the point that it&#39;s actually a little creepy. i know it&#39;s kinda long but please take a look.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure what the total endgame is here so I&#39;m welcoming input...somewhat like a (social media) think tank. I believe there&#39;s a corporate and politcal agenda involved in this &quot;The Interview&quot; scandal and I&#39;ve been predicting it the past few days in my status history (in case you missed it). Sony has flip-flopped by saying they will release the movie, cancelling it with &quot;no release plans in the near future&quot; to NOW saying that they are open to releasing it through an online distributor who is willing to carry the film (which i believe was the point all along). </p>

<p>The corporate motivation is always money, so this release benefits them by allowing them to test the capabilities of the internet to function as a future wide-release platform for new products, in attempt to circumvent piracy but also net more profit bypassing the theater system. They also get to do this without any risk of &quot;failure&quot; due to the political angle of using fear to make it seem as though they &quot;have no choice.&quot; </p>

<p>The motivation of the state is usually control of the domestic enemy (the population) and as we&#39;ve seen, that threat is all too real right now with civilians in the streets, literally protesting our entire law enforcement system. The anti-piracy measures that have been put forth by the corporate sector (Hollywood/MPAA) have often gone kind of hand-in-hand with internet censorship loopholes that would be very beneficial in subduing civilian organization through the web if they were to be exploited by the state (remember SOPA?). </p>

<p>Now, in order to make a case for increased internet regulation through corporate lobbying, I would think that the first MAJOR Hollywood direct-to-consumer digital release would be a good jumping-off point. Especially if that release is MASSIVELY successful, it would create a precedent and draw attention to the shifting focus of the market, which (of course) calls for more regulation and protection of that market. With all of the &quot;international scandal&quot; that has been created by this film and the hype that always surrounds controversial material in pop culture, Sony has all the makings of such a statement. Think about it, people who would never have thought about seeing this film in theaters, people who probably didn&#39;t even know who Seth Rogen WAS a week ago, are now aware of this film and they have attached their misguided patriotism, fear and other conditioned emotional responses to it&#39;s release. That&#39;s literally the best marketing scheme EVER contrived by Hollywood standards...they&#39;ve finally brought the movies to life and removed the barrier between fantasy (show business) and &quot;reality&quot; (world politics).</p>

<p>Further, this market shift and the &quot;hackerists&quot; (that&#39;s hacker-terrorists) will not only give the government more manufactured justification for internet policing and censorship, it will just be one more distraction source pumping &quot;entertainment&quot; and commercialism in your face 24/7. People will isolate themselves further and their worlds will become smaller. Why gather with fellow humans in a movie theater to share your interest in a film that brought you all together, especially when you can stay in your home, remain docile and consume whatever we tell you is allowed to be shown on the screen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont know if i would say that was directly related to this incident but it&#39;s definitely part of what initially raised my alarms to the Sony hack being a scam and by time they started finger pointing North Korea i had pretty much figured out where this was going. there&#39;s been a huge push in Hollywood to remedy the piracy issue lately so i&#39;m sure the pirate bay thing, if unrelated, was an incentive for them to push the agenda harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I knew something was fishy about the whole thing but haven&#39;t been able to put my finger on the government&#39;s exact motivation to be involved in a marketing scheme. It all makes sense now. I feel sick to my stomach. Thank you for adding that last needed piece to the puzzle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doing it for publicity, maybe, but not for the purpose of turning a profit.</p>

<p>Sony executives are paid well, right? And the company makes money, so no danger of that changing if the movie flops.</p>

<p>Maybe they saw The Dark Knight (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJ3Yv_vgUc">particularly this scene</a>) and took it a little too seriously.</p>
