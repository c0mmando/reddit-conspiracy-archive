       What would have been an average or below-average movie is now one of the world's hottest entertainment properties....  One wonders if some Sony executive or producer went rogue and decided to increase the 'buzz' surrounding the movie by like 1000%.

       I agree with LetsHack (obviously), and am both frustrated and excited at the sheer number of these threads. Either we're being successfully meta-trolled, or there are far more out there questioning the Official Version if an Event than ever before, and I bet the regulars here remember how it was with the Ebola- and ISIS-crises.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a poor play, with numerous holes, and people are actually researching things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's frustrating because LetsHack, myself, and a bunch of others have had to jump into every thread and say our piece, but it's also exciting because we've had to do it far more than we used to.

       The sun is shining a little bit brighter on me at the moment, and it feels nice.

       Agree totally on this motive. The "reaction" of Obama was totally transparent.

       As to whether they would be silly enough to try to blame a financial collapse on NK? Seems unlikely - but it does provide premise for blaming it on

       Hard to know if any of the personal info was real anyway. I ultimately do find it more likely that Sony was hacked, but just can't rely on media to fact check anything like this....and I'm dubious where a major corporation seems to be profiting over it.  So, I find it reasonable to question even if I'm yet to be persuaded it wasn't a real hack.

       The movie would have opened in nearly 3000 theaters across the US originally. As a result of this alleged PR stunt, if that is really what it was, the film opened in 300 theaters and made $1,000,000 at the box office.

       posting this here after my frustration with trying to get people to hear me out. i've been calling this Sony thing step by step since the 17th when the initial "terrorist threats" were reported. i have seen the whole scheme from the beginning and people said i was crazy and being extreme. so far, things have progressed almost exactly as i outlined in a post i made on the 19th, to the point that it's actually a little creepy. i know it's kinda long but please take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not exactly sure what the total endgame is here so I'm welcoming input...somewhat like a (social media) think tank. I believe there's a corporate and politcal agenda involved in this "The Interview" scandal and I've been predicting it the past few days in my status history (in case you missed it). Sony has flip-flopped by saying they will release the movie, cancelling it with "no release plans in the near future" to NOW saying that they are open to releasing it through an online distributor who is willing to carry the film (which i believe was the point all along).
      </p>
      <p>
       The corporate motivation is always money, so this release benefits them by allowing them to test the capabilities of the internet to function as a future wide-release platform for new products, in attempt to circumvent piracy but also net more profit bypassing the theater system. They also get to do this without any risk of "failure" due to the political angle of using fear to make it seem as though they "have no choice."
      </p>
      <p>
       The motivation of the state is usually control of the domestic enemy (the population) and as we've seen, that threat is all too real right now with civilians in the streets, literally protesting our entire law enforcement system. The anti-piracy measures that have been put forth by the corporate sector (Hollywood/MPAA) have often gone kind of hand-in-hand with internet censorship loopholes that would be very beneficial in subduing civilian organization through the web if they were to be exploited by the state (remember SOPA?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in order to make a case for increased internet regulation through corporate lobbying, I would think that the first MAJOR Hollywood direct-to-consumer digital release would be a good jumping-off point. Especially if that release is MASSIVELY successful, it would create a precedent and draw attention to the shifting focus of the market, which (of course) calls for more regulation and protection of that market. With all of the "international scandal" that has been created by this film and the hype that always surrounds controversial material in pop culture, Sony has all the makings of such a statement. Think about it, people who would never have thought about seeing this film in theaters, people who probably didn't even know who Seth Rogen WAS a week ago, are now aware of this film and they have attached their misguided patriotism, fear and other conditioned emotional responses to it's release. That's literally the best marketing scheme EVER contrived by Hollywood standards...they've finally brought the movies to life and removed the barrier between fantasy (show business) and "reality" (world politics).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, this market shift and the "hackerists" (that's hacker-terrorists) will not only give the government more manufactured justification for internet policing and censorship, it will just be one more distraction source pumping "entertainment" and commercialism in your face 24/7. People will isolate themselves further and their worlds will become smaller. Why gather with fellow humans in a movie theater to share your interest in a film that brought you all together, especially when you can stay in your home, remain docile and consume whatever we tell you is allowed to be shown on the screen?

       thanks man, honestly since i wrote that, my stomach has been in knots every time another piece of the puzzle comes together. i'm not sure how i came up with this theory so quickly and the fact that it's coming to fruition has been disturbing, especially since a couple weeks ago, my friends were telling me i was nuts. it starts to feel like you're screaming in a crowd and nobody can hear you. i appreciate you taking the time to read and making me feel like somebody understands.

       i dont know if i would say that was directly related to this incident but it's definitely part of what initially raised my alarms to the Sony hack being a scam and by time they started finger pointing North Korea i had pretty much figured out where this was going. there's been a huge push in Hollywood to remedy the piracy issue lately so i'm sure the pirate bay thing, if unrelated, was an incentive for them to push the agenda harder.

       Doing it for publicity, maybe, but not for the purpose of turning a profit.

       Sony executives are paid well, right? And the company makes money, so no danger of that changing if the movie flops.

       Maybe they saw The Dark Knight (

       thanks man, honestly since i wrote that, my stomach has been in knots every time another piece of the puzzle comes together. i'm not sure how i came up with this theory so quickly and the fact that it's coming to fruition has been disturbing, especially since a couple weeks ago, my friends were telling me i was nuts. it starts to feel like you're screaming in a crowd and nobody can hear you. i appreciate you taking the time to read and making me feel like somebody understands.
