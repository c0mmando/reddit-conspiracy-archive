<ol>
<li>Here is a Picture :</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yDsHVHP.png?1">http://i.imgur.com/yDsHVHP.png?1</a></p>

<ol>
<li>here is the actual video -:</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5q0JVDOxpo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5q0JVDOxpo</a></p>

<p>the story is simple:</p>

<p>I will edit this to be more clear.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a flawed monetary system that was redesigned the redesigned name that fixed the flaws was &quot;Quark&quot; </p>

<p>Quark fixed nearly all the economic flaws of Bitcoin, and is also fee free.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was a NSA project, but this was an accident the NSA just wrote a white paper that was then used as the basis of technical information that was eventually coded, it is alleged that that was built to spec by Google devs, Google and NSA employees mesh across each organization. </p>

<p>here is the NSA white paper:</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm#Introduction">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm#Introduction</a></p>

<p>then this caused a problem obviously...</p>

<p>In - q -tel the CIA front contacted Gavin Bell &quot;Gavin Andersen&quot;  and employed him to find out more about it (Bitcoin) also they took possession of a lot of the actual units - </p>

<p>the address keys are flawed they use a flawed elliptical encryption, Bitcoin first introduced these keys, then Quark used them as a basis for their address keys, some people have claimed this &quot;proves&quot; conspiracy as the elliptical encryption was not &quot;well known&quot; however it is hard to see that there is a conspiracy in this regard and this encryption can be changed...</p>

<p>however... </p>

<p>Frozenbit was the first company to announce support for Quark - </p>

<p>this would have given the option of multiple keys and let anyone have full secure convenient access to Quark.</p>

<p>After announcing support for Quark they were either paid off or otherwise &quot;taken out&quot;  </p>

<p>this is because Quark is the economic superior cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is essentially a price manipulated poor mans version of Quark.</p>

<p>Summary </p>

<p>Quark is the only true Crypto that exists - all others are pretty much fakes, of course if you don&#39;t understand this you will not understand its history. </p>

<p>---------Update for more amusing notes. --------------------</p>

<p>On  Thursday, November 6th, 2014 by Daniel Mark Harrison</p>

<p>was released a news article on his crypto news site called &quot;coinspeaker&quot;</p>

<p>here is the article:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coinspeaker.com/2014/11/06/cryptocurrency-fraud-part-1-identifying-ways-in-which-fraudsters-operate/">http://www.coinspeaker.com/2014/11/06/cryptocurrency-fraud-part-1-identifying-ways-in-which-fraudsters-operate/</a></p>

<p>this was to be a 2 part series, written by myself on how crypto fraud works and how the market cap is manipulated - part one (1) covers the fraud part 2 would have covered the solution. </p>

<p>which is also inevitable : D</p>

<p>now this was so popular - it caused &quot;coinspeaker&quot; to become 2nd largest viewed crypto news site :</p>

<p>see here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coinspeaker.com/2014/11/08/coinspeaker-becomes-2nd-largest-digital-currency-news-site-catches-up-with-coindesk/">http://www.coinspeaker.com/2014/11/08/coinspeaker-becomes-2nd-largest-digital-currency-news-site-catches-up-with-coindesk/</a></p>

<p>note date - Dan also personally thanked me on Twitter.</p>

<p>however Part 2 never came out, Dan was &quot;tapped on the shoulder&quot; , i completely understand of course however it is amusing. </p>

<p>the 2nd part would have dealt with the introduction of an index called &quot;PoW+&quot; a simple, inevitable index that would make &quot;fraud&quot;&quot; impossible, this woudl not be useful for the &quot;intel&quot; agencies that are trying to spam the market with frauds to &quot;hurt&quot; crypto &quot;confidence&quot;.</p>

<p>all that is for nothing (what they do) it is all wasted energy but, correspondingly i know they &quot;have&quot; to do it, however i will say this:</p>

<p><strong>please friends don&#39;t grind against your &quot;soul&quot;, your energy will turn negative and you will hurt yourself, do what you have to but you will feel when you are grinding against your &quot;soul&quot; seek to balance that energy where you can, when you act against a fellow man that is like acting against the omega this will &quot;hurt&quot; your soul the consequences are not favorable in my opinion, i do not speak for &quot;god&quot; or the omega i only speak for myself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>i think the message is &quot;you are only hurting yourself.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>I very much recommend watching this film clip :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about quark, but I know a thing or two about bitcoin, math, elliptic curves, and cryptography.</p>

<p>There are no known weaknesses in the elliptic curve bitcoin uses for addresses, Secp256k1 . It&#39;s not a commonly used curve, but it has stood up to analysis thus far.</p>

<p>Additionally, bitcoin addresses are versioned, so if Secp256k1 were ever found to be flawed, it would be easy to phase in a new elliptic curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi .</p>

<p>That is not the focus of the problem , i know what you just said i understand that.</p>

<p>This is not the main aspect of disappeared FrozenBit the main aspects are this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Security </li>
</ol>

<p>If the addresses are &quot;possibly&quot; flawed this multi address system makes them much secure.</p>

<ol>
<li>Access.
The most important.</li>
</ol>

<p>This would give general access to Crypto taking it away from a &quot;geek&quot; or &quot;nerd&quot; and taking it to an App  culture.</p>

<p>The rest is economics .</p>

<p>Why that will never work for Bitcoin is because Bitcoin is terminally flawed by issuance monopoly.</p>

<p>So it would make sense for a monopoly issuance system to be resistant to humans having the ability to issue their own energy tokens freely.</p>

<p>That is Quark. </p>

<p>Well one of , the leader. Anyhow.</p>

<p>Thanks for the message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You originally said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the address keys are flawed they use a flawed elliptical encryption. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>you now agree that your original statement was false. Okay. good to know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In - q -tel the CIA front contacted Gavin Bell &quot;Gavin Andersen&quot; and employed him to find out more about it (Bitcoin) also they took possession of a lot of the actual units - </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d love to see some documentation of this. Given your other clam, I&#39;m skeptical, but open to evidence.</p>

<p>Now, for the reponse:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the addresses are &quot;possibly&quot; flawed this multi address system makes them much secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how security systems work. The best secure system is one that is simple, well-studied, and well-understood. Mixing different hash functions may make initial ASIC miner production more difficult. Sha256, the main hash function used in bitcoin, has been looked at very very carefully, by cryptographers all over the world.</p>

<p>I also noticed you&#39;re confusing elliptic curves with hash functions. Both are cryptographic tools, but they are attacked via completely different methods, and the security of one does not depend in any way on the other. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why that will never work for Bitcoin is because Bitcoin is terminally flawed by issuance monopoly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last I checked Quark devs pre-mined most of their coins, and are distributing them by fiat. Whereas bitcoin is barely half-way mined, and the future allocation of mining hardware is still unknown and indeed unknowable. </p>

<p>So you&#39;ve switched from &quot;bitcoin is cryptograhically insecure&quot; to &quot;bitcoin has a monopolistic distribution scheme&quot;. I think both of these claims are false , but the first is easier to prove demonstrably false. The second may be a question of speculation about the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately you are incorrect again.</p>

<p>I never stated Bitcoin was less secure you have confused this i guess because i made a statement on the elliptical encryption.</p>

<p>As for that encryption well I&#39;d say you are currently making comments on &quot;conspiracy&quot; Reddit so in view of the current low public image of the NSA and other &quot;standards&quot; agencies I&#39;d say that i could make a fairly reasonable argument for reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>However considering you mention it , due to centralized mining yes i would say Bitcoin is inherently less secure.</p>

<p>This balances off a number of economic and code vectors.</p>

<p>This is a refreshing back and forth conversation, i have an open mind but the evidence is against your position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My position is that Quark is at best only marginally more secure than Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never stated Bitcoin was less secure you have confused this i guess because i made a statement on the elliptical encryption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you did. From your original post, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is a flawed system... [...] Quark is the only true Crypto</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may not have know you were saying it, but you said it. So let&#39;s discuss the issue of elliptic curve cryptography.</p>

<p>I trust the NIST standards as much as any cryptographer out there -- which is not at all. But that does not mean all NIST standards are compromised, only that at least some are.
I know we&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I hope I am making arguments based on a good mathematical knowledge of the limitations of the physical universe. For example, many here think the NSA will be able to break any encryption. This is demonstrably false (look up the &quot;one-time pad&quot;), but apparently not widely known. 
Now, the NSA has some serious math brains working for them. And it&#39;s indeed possible to construct malicious trojan-horse elliptic curves, if their means of construction is kept secret. 
This is one of the problems with the NIST-specified elliptic curves. Most are provided as-is, with no account of the security of the curve derivation process. Yes, Bitcoin&#39;s use of the NIST-standard sec256k1 curve is, given what we know, not great. I wish they were using one of djb&#39;s curves, but they&#39;ve only been popularized in the last few years.</p>

<p>But guess what elliptic curve Quark uses? Sec256k1. That&#39;s right, the exact same thing in Bitcoin. This wasn&#39;t listed on their site, so I went and checked the code. <a href="https://github.com/MaxGuevara/quark/blob/6ce9b5730377626d0f69311b93b96c221dedf8cf/src/key.cpp#L133">https://github.com/MaxGuevara/quark/blob/6ce9b5730377626d0f69311b93b96c221dedf8cf/src/key.cpp#L133</a></p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t trust the NIST standards. And Bitcoin&#39;s Elliptic Curve Crypto may indeed be compromised. There&#39;s no evidence of it so far, and a lot of smart people have been paying very close attention in the past few years. But Quark is in exactly the same boat here.</p>

<p>So again, there are other cryptocurrencies out there that use provably secure elliptic curve derivation methods and they happen to be better than the standards anyway. It&#39;s pretty new stuff. Here&#39;s a presentation the author of these new curves gave two days ago: <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6369_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412272145_-_ecchacks_-_djb_-_tanja_lange.html">http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6369_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412272145_-_ecchacks_-_djb_-_tanja_lange.html</a>
Also, bitcoin can switch to a different curve for new addresses, as long as this is announced a year or two in advance.</p>

<p>Is the evidence still against my position? Oh, and I&#39;m still really interested to see some evidence of a Gavin Andersen - In-q-tel connection.</p>

<p>No, you didn&#39;t say that. I read your posts carefully. You said: </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I concluded here you were talking either about elliptic curves or the hashing scheme, which are the two cryptographic components of the systems, the rest being networking protocols and data storage and other non-cryptography stuff. I addressed both of these components in separate posts, showing that Quark is not more secure than Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You missed this, if you are not already aware of my history on bitContalk.org i have mentioned this many many times. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m not aware of your bitcointalk post history. How could I be? Have you linked it at all? I&#39;m not a btctalk.org regular or anything, though I&#39;ve browsed their forums now and again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NSA white paper mentioned hardware wallets , the assessment was that these will cause crypto proliferation, so FrozenBit was &quot;Frozen&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m really interested to see this paper. got a link? 
There&#39;s, of course, a lot of history on the NSA suppressing sound crypto (PGP being legally classified as munitions and being subject to export control restrictions in the 90s comes to mind). But is there actual concrete evidence of <em>your specific claim</em>? I&#39;m all for Crypto For The People, I just like specific evidence to back specific accusations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any human configuration system that uses energy tokens issuance is key. Everything else is related or secondary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I&#39;m focusing on the secondary stuff in response to your comments. Yes, the distribution scheme is very important to the well-being of any cryptocurrency system. Frankly, I think Bitcoin&#39;s distribution scheme is much better than Quark&#39;s, although BTC&#39;s presence in the spotlight has highlighted some problems. There&#39;s all sorts of development on this front -- ones that could not be backported to bitcoin (or quark, for that matter). For example, quite a few coders now thing a proof-of-stake system would be better than proof-of-work, but the theory for such a system is not yet ready for primetime, let alone the implementation in code. </p>

<p>Also, I think it&#39;s very important to do away with pooled mining, and as soon as possible. There&#39;s work being done on this, but the math is still pretty new and still being tested. This change, once fully fleshed out and tested, could be introduced into the bitcoin network.</p>

<p>&quot;You may not know you are saying it but you said it&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry incorrect.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a flawed monetary system i said it is a flawed system.</p>

<p>So let me give a practical example, if the USD collapsed in confidence and this caused  much pain and misery.</p>

<p>Economic professors etc would postulate what went wrong..what flaws in the system made the whole system flawed.</p>

<p>I expect none of them will relate to the ease or difficulty of counterfeit of the actual note or even digital fraud.</p>

<p>So you can see the disconnect between a &quot;flawed system&quot; and a flawed &quot;note&quot;</p>

<p>Or a &quot;flawed Bitcoin system&quot; or a flaw in the &quot;encryption&quot;</p>

<p>So your interpretation was what you wanted to read unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the evidence is &quot;against&quot; your position if your position is that the prime subject is about encryption flaws.</p>

<p>You see you proved my evidence more correct indeed Bitcoin and Quark have the same address encryption, Quark add encryption was derived from Bitcoin so i said </p>

<p>&quot;Bitcoin elliptical encryption is known to be flawed&quot;</p>

<p>Admittedly not the best statement for science .</p>

<p>However i was putting it in reference, in context, i will finish the sentence..</p>

<p>...so anything that adds &quot;entropy&quot; or multiple points of this encryption say like, oh, you know , a multi sig company would be seen as a problem to this possible flaw...</p>

<p>( getting the picture more clearly?) </p>

<p>Also it would obviously mean more proliferation also as it enters &quot;App culture&quot;.</p>

<p>This will all happen regardless so i see this as a amusing incident of note. So i made this Reddit that relatively no one will see .  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, alright. I was commenting not on the FrozenBit business, but on what I understood to be your claims regardng bitcoin vs. quark security. I&#39;m in complete agreement about multisignature transactions -- the sooner they are popularized, the better off the cryptocoin ecosystem will be.</p>

<p>But still...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...so anything that adds &quot;entropy&quot; or multiple points of this encryption say like, oh, you know , a multi sig company would be seen as a problem to this possible flaw...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know you put it in quotes, but you&#39;re not actually talking about entropy here. Multisignature transactions are just a way to have more than 2 parties interacting in a single atomic exchange. However, if the backing crypto (secp256k1) is compromised, multisig transactions are exactly as vulnerable as regular single-signature no-third-party transactions.  So a company offering easy use of multi-signature transactions does nothing to mitigate this potential vulnerability. </p>

<p>As for &#39;app culture&#39;, I&#39;ve no disagreement with you on that either. The more people feel comfortable with cryptocurrencies, the more stable they become.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So i made this Reddit that relatively no one will see . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is now allowing us to have a lively back-and-forth about the matter, so thanks for doing it. I&#39;ve heard of Quark floating around before, but have never looked at in in detail myself. Upon doing so, I think I&#39;ll stick with bitcoin for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the reference re the newer curves this could be of use to Quark in the future .</p>

<p>I helped insure Quark had checkpointing early on but it&#39;s all out of my hands now.</p>

<p>Re Gavin, ask him , there was a popular YouTube that was memory holed of him plainly stating that he was contacted by in q tel then had a meeting with the head of the CIA then he was employed to host &quot;lectures&quot; and work with the company to help figure their new toy out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why this would be a problem or conspiracy ? Someone isn&#39;t doing their job if that didn&#39;t happen also i support CIA ownership of Bitcoin I&#39;d also support it of Quark.  (According to neutral control) I&#39;d support any official ownership Government or agency eastern or western.  but I&#39;m no one in that regard. </p>

<p>It all comes down to neutral control and future human configuration systems. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t understand what you mean. If Gavin&#39;s been compromised by In-Q-Tel money, this would be both a problem and evidence of conspiracy. I would have a major problem with the CIA or NSA stewarding and gatekeeping the bitcoin core client code. I already have a problem with the way the Bitcoin Foundation has been behaving, so I&#39;m open to the idea that they are indeed gatekeeping bitcoin code. I just need some proof. All I could find was Gavin giving one presentation to the CIA and saying in a reddit AMA that he&#39;s had no contact with In-q-tel or the CIA since then.</p>

<p>Best to err on the side of multiple encryption or at least multiple keys.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what multi sigs do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but you don&#39;t understand cryptography. You&#39;re also throwing a couple of terms around that don&#39;t mean what you think they mean. </p>

<p>Best to err on the side of multiple encryption or at least multiple keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quark does not have &quot;multiple keys&quot; it used a mix of 6 different hash functions to derive the address space. The stated purpose is twofold: 1. to mitigate attacks against any single hash function, and 2. to make GPU and ASIC mining prohibitively expensive.
It does address (1), but the history of hash functions has demonstrated that they don&#39;t fail all at once. Rather, they are gradually defeated by shaving bits of randomness off of the result. For example, the old md5 hash function took about 5-7 years from first known weakness to become completely unsafe. So if sha256 were to fail, we&#39;d know about it long before it actually fails -- we&#39;d be able to see the very first cracks in the armor, and respond accordingly.
As for (2), this has very little bearing on the production of specialized hardware. Transistors are cheap -- you can stamp one hash function onto a die, or you can stamp nine, with very little cost difference. And it&#39;s GPU-minable too -- there are already Quark GPU miners.  I think a CPU-only mining function will be a very useful thing, but neither Quark nor bitcoin offer this functionality. Some other in-development cryptocurrencied might (Ethereum perhaps), but the jury is still out on this.</p>

<p>And, lastly, &quot;Multi-sig&quot; doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means. Multi-signature transactions are ones that allow more than 2 parties to participate -- a transaction with escrow, for example. And Bitcoin supports it out of the box -- it&#39;s supported multisig transactions since version 0.7, I believe.</p>
