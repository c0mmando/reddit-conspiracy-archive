<p>highlights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>at the present rate 1 in 2 children will have some form of autism by 2025</p></li>
<li><p>there is a 99% pearson correlation between the use of Gyphosate, a pesticide used on corn, wheat and soy, and the increaseing number of children with autism</p></li>
<li><p>Glyphosate is present in unusually high quantities in the breast milk of American mothers, to the tune of 760 to 1,600 times the allowable limits in European drinking water. </p></li>
<li><p>Urine testing shows Americans have ten times the glyphosate accumulation as Europeans. </p></li>
<li><p>Children with autism have biomarkers indicative of excessive glyphosate, including zinc and iron deficiency, low serum sulfate, seizures, and mitochondrial disorder.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense.  Not one single verified, indepent long term human health study has been performed on glyophosphate (Roundup).   The European health limits are magnitudes less than the US, and as of late we find they don&#39;t even regularly test for it, because &quot;it&#39;s too expensive.&quot;  Absolutely ridiculous.  Monsanto even recommends farmers spray their harvest crops, not to be used as a pesticide, but to help &quot;desiccate&quot; crops, further poisoning consumers. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/11/roundup-dumped-crops-right-harvest.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/11/roundup-dumped-crops-right-harvest.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/glyphosate_testing_results">http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/glyphosate_testing_results</a></p>

<p>The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Just like GMO and BPA, glyophosphate has ZERO safe levels for human consumption.   It does not belong in crops. Using it as a drying agent is insanely harmful to every consumer.</p>

<p>You still have not posted a source to prove this or your claim that Roundup causes &quot;cancers, growths, downs, disease, etc.&quot; Instead you&#39;ve went on a scientifically flawed rant which says nothing because the chemical is safe. </p>

<p>Here, have some verified long-term human health studies that you claim don&#39;t exist:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, more fabrications and ad ad hominem. Please, find the bias in the articles I linked to. And while you&#39;re at it. <strong>PROVIDE SOURCES FOR YOUR CLAIMS THAT GLYPHOSATE &quot;HAS ZERO SAFE LEVELS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION,&quot; AND THAT IT CAUSES &quot;CANCERS, GROWTHS, DOWNS, DISEASE, ETC.&quot; IN A TYPICAL DOSE CONSUMED IN FOOD TREATED WITH THE CHEMICAL</strong></p>

<p>Since you seem to have trouble remembering, I bolded this for you. Also, <strong>YOU MADE THE CLAIM THAT THE CHEMICAL IS UNSAFE WITH YOUR ABOVE STATEMENTS,</strong> not me. The burden of proof is on you to prove your statements. I already proved mine with unbiased science that you have gone and dismissed based on totally fabricated claims of bias. </p>

<p>As for the article you linked to, its main premise that the levels of glyphosate are of concern is flawed because it fails to prove the chemical is bad. All the studies the article links to are intentionally misrepresented, as the conclusions the article claims they make are either false, or the studies themselves have been challenged and were not able to be reproduced, or the studies used erroneous methods or data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL but vaccines USE your natural immune system.  The vaccine doesn&#39;t kill infections, it IS infections.  Dead ones.  It trains your immune system on what chemical markers to look for with that particular infection, using dead cells of the infection, so they have time to develop the capability to fight it on the dead ones.  That way when live infection comes they know what it is.  Relying on your &quot;natural&quot; immune system just leaves you to hope you can fight off a real infection instead of being prepared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your body has no natural defenses to mercury.  It binds to places other elements and molecules are supposed to go.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you inject it or not.  And there is NO mercury in vaccines.  There used to be a molecule added that had a mercury atom as PART of the molecule, but it does not work like just mercury would.  Hell, there&#39;s arsenic in organically grown lettuce, because it&#39;s in all soil, and it&#39;s fine.  The poison is in the dose for everything.  </p>

<p>But all this is irellevent because they don&#39;t even use that in vaccines anymore except in a very few types of adult vaccines.  Reason it was removed was over the incorrect fear by the anti-vax movement that it was dangerous.  Since it wasn&#39;t a big deal to replace it, they did it to shut people up over worrying about it.  It&#39;s only left in some adult vaccines because even if it were dangerous, it would be much less so to adults, and also because most of the anti-vax movement was concerned with child vaccinations.  It was easier to just get rid of it than to convince all the uneducated people who believe what movie stars tell them about science more than the experts.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the FDA site on mercury in vaccines.  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228</a></p>

<p>By the way, I did misunderstand you about the vaccine thing above.  I thought you meant your immune system worked better without a vaccine than after you have gotten one, which of course is not true.  Sorry about that.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Hmm actually after going back and reading your comment, I&#39;m still confused because you used the word immune when referring to mercury instead of a more applicable word like, defense or something.  Immune refers to pathogens, not elements.  &lt;shrugs&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your source &quot; Over the past several years, because of an increasing awareness of the theoretical potential for neurotoxicity of even low levels of organomercurials and because of the increased number of thimerosal containing vaccines that had been added to the infant immunization schedule, concerns about the use of thimerosal in vaccines and other products have been raised. Indeed, because of these concerns, the Food and Drug Administration has worked with, and continues to work with, vaccine manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not saying there is a high risk but if the FDA admits something is potentially harmful I would rather avoid it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think vaccines are necessary and actually just got one, but I wouldn&#39;t get one for the flu or anything that I don&#39;t see as high risk.  There will always be drugs and vaccines that are approved that shouldn&#39;t be.. At this point i am taking the minimum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But again the poison is in the dose anyway.  You would only be getting one shot with thimerosal in it, which is within the range approved by the FDA.  I wish I had bookmarked some of the sites I read last year on this.  But anyway, you absorb way more mercury in a fish dinner than one shot, even if it was just mercury in the shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Some people say that you get much less mercury when you eat it than when you inject it.  Looking at the most common form of ingested mercury (methylmercury), which is found in varying amounts in nearly all seafood, we will see that there is actually greater exposure from eating 6 oz. of white tuna, for example, than receiving one flu shot, the only recommended vaccine that has greater than trace amounts, though thimerosal-free versions are available.  According to the DHHS Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, roughly 95% of ingested methylmercury is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines), from whence it can then spread to other body organs.  White albacore tuna contains about .407 ppm (mcg/g) methylmercury.  A 6 oz. (170 g) can of white tuna would then contain on average about 69.19 mcg of mercury (170 g * .407 mcg/g = 69.19 mcg).  Eating the full 6 oz. can, then, would mean that you are absorbing 65.73 mcg of methylmercury.  That’s over two and a half times the amount of mecury from a thimerosal-containing flu vaccine (which tops out at 25 mcg/dose).  And remember, the methylmercury from the tuna sticks around much longer than the ethylmercury from the vaccine.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if that correlates with glyphosate too. Another more scary theory I have is that autism is caused by vaccines they use as a form of eugenics in order to produce genius children at the cost of causing a lot of autism.</p>
